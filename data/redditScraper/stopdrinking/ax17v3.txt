and I did not drink! Fully open bar and my wife drove.  I was nervous about  a possible relapse. Didn't know how people were going to react because I'm the drinker in the crew. Thing is no one gave a shit lol.  And I still had a blast. So to those who have the same concerns chances are that drinkers will be thinking about drinking not you. IWNDWYT!!!!!!

I do often find that the expectation of people's reactions brings me a lot of stress too so glad you made it through!!!
This is great to hear...good job man!  These were friends yes?  That's awesome that they didn't give a rats tail....  True friends. 
I had the same experience tonight.  Went to my sisters for family get together and dinner.  Alcohol is always a part of these.  I had anxiety going.  My wife had her bottle of wine.  I got there and everyone started drinking wine and beer.  I had a lacriox.  No one really noticed and I was ok.  Then I had to drag my wife out who wanted to stay and keep drinking.  That was both of us in the past.  Anways I will not drink with you today.
