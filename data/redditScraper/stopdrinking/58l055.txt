I don't know that it's 74. That is my closest guess. Regardless it won't matter if it doesn't stick this time. But if it does I'm grateful to get out for good on 74. Folks I know been trying to get out for years decades. Maybe they do for a little while. I can manage a couple weeks sometimes before I rationalize that first beer. And the relapses that moment when your will finally rolls back. ..I'll just drink and forget about it. Maybe I get up the next morning and feel hangry & hungover so I get a bunch of awful food and a case of beer and lay in bed until the food beers and me are gone. Fake my way through work the next day. Repeatedly affirm dicta indicating alcohol abstinence & regular workouts/nutrition control etc. I proceed successfully for a bit and then fall back down the hole. Grateful I haven't fallen in today. Best of luck

That was my football number it's a sign! 
Keep going man. You're the shit. Fuck booze
Fuck the zero. The zero scares me. The day after the zero scares me. Fuck the zero. I will not drink today. I will not give into the zero..Fuck the zero.
It sounds like you could use more support if you really want to get well. I needed lots of help to build a happy sober life. Therapy and AA gave me what I needed.
