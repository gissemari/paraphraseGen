For all those struggling with getting started setbacks & starting over know this:..There _IS_ a tipping point where you wake up one day and realize your motivation has changed from trying to not drink to wanting to be more & more of what you are becoming as you heal! Call it cresting a hill call it critical mass call it an inflection point (if you're a math geek like me) but know it's out there! I'm not going to say it gets "easy" after that but I will tell you human brains are a lot better at wanting things (obviously or none of us would be here) than resisting things.  Personally I've recently entered the elbow of the curve so this is fresh in my mind but know that point is out there you'll get to it & it is _SO_ worth it!

Exactly! This is why I will always say don't ever quit trying!
Yes!  Big difference for me in not wanting to drink vs wanting a more balanced sober lifestyle.
