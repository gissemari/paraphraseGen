Made a decision to take a break for a while.  Have been drinking as a relief from boredom and an escape.  Day 1 went well but I am worried that I will struggle today.  Thank you all for the support system.

Also how do I reset my flair?
Welcome back...Is the break something you regret?  How did you feel about your drinking?  If you don't feel comfortable answering then by all means tell me to screw off.  I made it 3100 days before I decided to drink again a decision I regret so I'm just curious how your experience went.
Hello. You can this. You've done it before. And you'll do it again. I am not escaping with you today.
