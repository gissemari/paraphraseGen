I'm sick of this. I don't want to be this way anymore. I can't control myself I'm spiraling so far out of anything even resembling control. I posted on reddit months ago during my first time detoxing and got some recommendations to come here. Instead I relapsed. ..I'm so sick of the depression the constant dehydration the not eating. Waking up and not knowing what happened the night before. Feeling like I've done something horrible that I don't remember or some asshole did something to me. ..I'm finished but I'll need help. I'm not sure how to do this. Last time I needed to go to the hospital for withdrawals and I'd rather not do that again if it's avoidable. Can anyone give me some advice on how to get started the right way?

how about a month in a rehab friend after withdrawing in a hospital. I know you said you don't want to but its our life we got to take hold of and jump back on the sober horse of freedom to do whatever it takes to live a great life away from the alcohol. 
Just quit. It isn't the quitting that is hard it is the thee days of restless insomnia sweating. Then 11 months of anger. Then another 3 of grey fog. Then things start to be normal...It's not the quitting it's the rollercoaster of emotions and bullshit you have to endure is where the test is. Most people won't make it the first time. I'm at 1544 today and I ain't looking back.. Good luck.
