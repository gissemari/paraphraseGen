It's been 7 days of sobriety. Last weekend the day after Christmas I drove home from a nightclub after accidentally drinking more than I should have and was extremely lucky to get home without a DUI or worse. I can't fully remember what happened even... but I KNOW I was lucky from what I can. This wasn't the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th or even 5th wake up call I've had but it is the last. I'm only 26 and I've pushed my luck more times than I'd like to admit when it comes to drinking... whether that was while driving while at work (and almost losing my job because of it) while with friends while with family while at home by myself... My husband finally told our therapist he thought I should maybe start to think about going to AA. We talked about it and despite the things I don't really like about AA I've decided to go see what it's all about...I guess I'm just looking for advice or people who can relate. NO ONE I know goes to AA. None of my other friends identify as alcoholics (yet). I know people who have gone to AA once or people who have gone to NA but I feel pretty alone right now... and I wouldn't even admit it to my husband but I'm kind of scared. :( I'm not HUGE on church and I know it's pretty religious but I also was recommended a really "chill" group by my therapist. So I'm hoping that is good news. ..Anyway been lurking on here for a while. Happy to meet anyone else who wants someone to talk to about AA or struggles in general. For me talking about it GREATLY helps.

I didn't know any admitted alcoholics when I first got sober either but I met an old drinking buddy of mine in an AA meeting within the first year. He was there because he had hit someone in a motor-pedestrian accident...I've heard it said that AA can take all the fun out of your drinking. I wouldn't really know since my drinking ceased to be fun years before I got desperate enough to ask for help.
What I discovered when I went were a bunch of really cool people that were trying to get and stay sober just like I was. 
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/) is a great comprehensive post by u/coolcrosby about what to expect at a meeting...I am not religious and have not found many religious people in AA. I found out there is a BIG difference between religion and spirituality. I do hope you check some meetings out. They helped me tremendously and even made quitting drinking sort of fun. You will be surprised at how much laughter there is in meetings...Edit: Sorry my formatting sucks I'm on my phone
Being in a room with people who understand is comforting and encouraging. Not unlike here!
[I tried an AA meeting and wrote up a review.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3obylx/first_aa_meeting_last_night/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) lots of folks have. You can try searching this sub for other AA reviews. The simple wisdom is if you get wrong vibe try another meeting. Dont forget there's also SMART and Rational Recovery. It really is a take what works for you method. 
Thing to remember is that AA is huge.  There are such a variety of groups that I strongly suspect you will find one that suits or is less objectionable...In my case I realized it was me who was being closed minded about those who have faith.  It was my "don't tell me what to do" mantra - and having all the answers that made things difficult not what they were saying...Sure some believe you need get on your knees and pray to god - it works for them - that's one you might not pick for a sponsor but beyond that - the less I argue the less they argue back...AA is an amazing institution - anarchic in that I doubt that one percent of the members could name anyone on the central board.  Its a place where people do not judge you - and certainly not on education job money.  Its a melting pot where I the son of a college administrator can be best buddies with the son of a moonshiner who has learned to read in meetings over the years. It amazingly is a place of laughter at our selves mostly...Last thing it worked for me despite my best efforts to be different and I wasn't - someting I am grateful for    
I have been actively anti-AA for many years. I hated the copious mentions of God. I hated the fact that because non-drinkers just assume it works that there are no other options commonly available...Then a few days ago I no longer had anywhere else to turn. I couldn't go on the way I was going. The only options I could see was a quick death or AA...I went to AA. I was surprised at how much of myself I heard when other people spoke. ..But the biggest thing? I don't have to be alone anymore.
