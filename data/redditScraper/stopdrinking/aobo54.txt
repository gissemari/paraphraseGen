Been sailing through this thing. Feeling awesome not even wanting to drink. .Now it's Friday I'm irritated as hell for no reason at everything especially my s/o ..He was meant to stop with me and his smoking and relapsed after day 5. .I'm pretty disappointed with him I know I shouldn't be but it seems like a piss poor attempt. .Grrrrr. .Iwndwyt
