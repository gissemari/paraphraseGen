I've done terrible things drunk and have gone months at a time sober. I'm mostly okay. But I've realized recently that drinking is just bad for my bod and the rest of me. But I've stopped before but relapsed. If I stop again it'll have to be forever but forever is hard for me to comprehend. Help me think about it smartly.

Sobriety is a choice and lifestyle for me. It isn't something I have to do. It's something I GET to do. ..I don't think about timelines anymore. I just want to enjoy my life today to the best of my abilities. And alcohol doesn't help me achieve that.
Thank you friend. I guess I just have to make sense of it as something I want rather than something which is better for me like broccoli or exercise. ..I mean I know it is. But I keep messing up or putting it off. And I'm so tired of perpetually failing. .
In my view it is not possible to quit anything forever because a future version of me gets to make his own decisions. Still every day for four years plus I have chosen not to drink. I have done that chiefly because every day I have remembered that I can no longer drink successfully. Life has improved dramatically. Not drinking does not seem like a sacrifice at all now.

When I tried to stop drinking my pickled brain was not my friend.  I had to act (not think) my way to stop drinking.
