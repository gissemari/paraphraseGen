I posted this response in another thread but it's one of about 20 comments and I wanted some feedback from the dinosaurs in here. Thanks in advance.....>  I think in the next three months I'm going to read the Alan Carr book again; I think my life is revolving around alcohol too much in AA more days than not and on SD every day... When I quit smoking I was happy that I stopped and moved on with my life. Why can't it be like that with booze? Not planning on going anywhere anytime soon but I'm hoping that in the coming months/years not drinking can be part of who I am not my sole focus in life...My response is below - ..AMEN. I'm struggling with the concept that I'm focused on my addiction most of the day whether I'm looking on this board whether I'm texting or talking with my sponsor reading the big book or the 12 and 12 talking to my wife about itjust plain thinking about it whatever it is I am CONSTANTLY focused on my sobriety. I too wish I could move on from the constant barrage of this way of thinking and living. It seems I spend way more time thinking about alcohol now than I did when I was drinking. Is it healthy to be so focused on not drinking?.

I know that just thinking about sobriety and drinking is much healthier than destroying my mind spirit and body through actual drinking and drugging. I am in a dour mood today and my alcoholic brain has been trying to beg me to just cave in and drink. I do not want to do that and I will not do that. Fuck you alcoholic brain.
Welcome to the pink cloud friend...you're three weeks in; you're going to be thinking a LOT about recovery and I don't think that's a bad thing so early on. I found that I thought a lot about it until just recently... my pink cloud dissipated a few months ago. ..So no don't worry about that at all at 24 days in. I kind of side-eye people who are still obsessive about recovery and not drinking at like 15 years in (because there seems to be a transference of addiction to being addicted to/obsessed with recovery which is what I assume you're worried about) but the way you're feeling is NORMAL. Alcohol was a huge part of life so now that it's gone NOT having it is going to be a huge part of life for a while. It goes away on its own as life normalizes.
I know exactly what you are saying and was similar for me (although I was not in AA but thoughts about drinking and not drinking dominated my thoughts)...Drinking was something that I did for so long and so often and was thinking about all the time that my mind needed time to adjust.  Now I still think about alcohol from time to time but mostly just as part of this community which I enjoy participating in.  I never have desires/urges/cravings and days can go by when I do not even think about drinking at all but I think about SD and checking in here.  Took many months for the thoughts to subside so if I were you I would keep going and let it take its course.
I'm not a dino but your post definitely rings familiar with me. The first time I came around to trying to quit I had luckily found this sub as well. I was on here *all.the.time.* I was thinking sobriety breathing it talking it walking it... for about 2 months. And then I let my guard down and didn't try again until another 8 months went by...I really *really* didn't want to have to become fanatical in order to succeed. I've had some fanatical moments in my past on other issues that I am not proud of and I want to keep my life as drama-free and open minded as possible. Surely I could do this without being obsessed right? Made it 30'ish days before I had another 3 month relapse. ..I don't want to be fanatical about *anything.*  But I'm really starting to believe that for **me** on **this** I may have to be. I'm working on wrapping my brain around that fact that not only is it okay on this issue it's probably necessary. I don't think I will succeed without throwing myself in completely. ..So what's more unhealthy for me? Continuing to be "reasonable" with myself yet going back to the same wreck or allowing myself to be obsessed with the cure and possibly be able to see it actually work. I would like for some day to come along where I can "meh" at alcohol. Even if I don't want it right now even it's presence screams when I'm around it. It separates me from everything normal. For myself it's going to take some heavy guns to even hope to stave it off.
I too am obsessed with sobriety. I love this forum! You asked the exact question I was wondering about today. Rock on! 
Ha! I was thinking about this earlier today...I wondered if the time I was spending thinking about it all was stressing me more than it was worth. Ive gone longer than this without drinking many a time...But it was always there as a crutch. Now its not. I have done a lot of introspection and Ive learned a LOT about the way my sober brain works. Ive learned a lot about the actual reasons why I drank so much that I wasnt honest with myself about before... or in some cases was genuinely unaware. Ive thought a lot about who I want to be as a person and my future looks so much better without the booze. Ive gone to therapy and I am picking apart my anxiety and fears and learning ways to cope that will be so much better for me than what I was doing for myself...Its early days for me. I have a long road and it may be stressful to be confronted with the full spectrum of feelings but so long as I take it day by day I can manage. Im learning I *CAN* actually deal with stress without "something else". Its strange terrifying uplifting all at once...So I let myself think I learn from my thoughts I learn how to get through what would normally be a trigger. I can't really say it hasnt been beneficial to dwell on it as much as I have. 
I just think about all the time I wasted drinking before... the amount of time I'm thinking about sobriety though it FEELS like a lot is actually so much less than that. So even though it may feel like the thoughts are consuming my life it's nothing compared to the amount of time I spent practically brain dead when I was drinking.
