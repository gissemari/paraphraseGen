I'm feeling strong and even though i felt like i was dying on thursday by the grace of God i am feeling so much better today. I had 3 months continuous and I still have those 3 months except for the 6 days i relapsed. I am not defeated just moving on sober and defiant against alcohol. Utmost sympathy for those still struggling. Thanks for reading this.

 Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again this time more intelligently.  Henry Ford..I saw this quote today and thought I'd share..
