My husband is the best man at his friend's wedding. ..I literally know almost no one here. I always thought I needed alcohol to be social. I have mostly stayed in since sobering up because of that. This is such a stressful situation for me! ..Weddings are like a glorification of drinking and I'm struggling really hard...Plus we are out of town and no one here besides my husband knows I'm in recovery. ...wish me luck sobies!

Why not leave and go to an AA meeting?  That's the sort of thing I did to stay on track and remain accountable to myself.
If you are an AA person I find meetings at a time like this perfect. I went to a wedding out of state a few weeks back hit a meeting beforehand and felt great. No temptation no weirdness smooth sailing. Meetings always help me but in times like you are experiencing they REALLY help me.
