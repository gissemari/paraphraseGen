I feel lost guys. So much is happening and all I want to do is go to the store and buy a handle of vodka and forget. My good friend has passed on monday very young (25). My father is dying my uncle has stage 4 cancer and my niece has cancer as well. Not sure of the stage of my niece. I've been struggling with inflammatory psoriatic arthritis which has been extremely crippling especially because I had to take a year off uni due to a severe head injury. ..Honestly is there any reason for my not to just drink as much as I can?

Drinking is not going to change anything it might numb you briefly but then you will feel bad about that on top of everything else.  ...I'm sorry you are going through so much . Is there someone you can call for a chat or some support ?  ...I'm sending you a hug (( )) and IWNDWY
Yeah there is. If you drink it will increase the likelihood that you will be placing those that care about you in the same position you are in now...worrying about your health and premature death.  Sorry that's so blunt but it's  my opinion. Take it or leave it...that's up to you....I am sorry to hear that you are having such a hard time...life does suck sometimes but drinking won't change that...IWNDWYT 
Sorry to hear i wish you the strength and courage to get through this dark time sober.  Comeback here as much as you need for support!  iwndwyt
There's no problem or pain alcohol can't make worse. ..Keep at it and seek out support groups. In person can offer different benefits. ..Good luck.
