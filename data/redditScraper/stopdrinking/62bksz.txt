Went to the doctors yesterday to safely get sober. I'm really going to try this time and am going to visit this page everyday. I've frequented this page a few times and have posted before. ..I'm 19 and have struggled with alcohol for over a year and it has really exacerbated from the start of this year. ..I was wondering if you guys had any advice for the first few days and weeks of trying to stay sober? ..Thanks SD

Take it day by day... min by min. Heck second by second. There's also that other quote if you want a different result do something different! So I started taking an outta way drive home so I wasn't do the same thing that's obviously wasn't working I reached out for help from my family and the last time I went 9 months using just this site. This place is unique stick around here. You can do this! I'm really telling myself I can do it it's gonna be scary but it CAN be done! Just stick around.
I'm so happy to hear that you went to your doctor to safely get sober! ..What really helped me (in addition to detox/counseling/nutrition/healthy lifestyle) is sober people/sober places AA (in the beginning) and coming here to SD every single day. I check in daily read/post/comment and visit the chat (link in sidebar). ..There's a ton of valuable information in the FAQ's including this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/bored which gave me ideas on how to stay active and busy...I hope to see you around here a lot more!
