Yesterday was the first day where I *really* struggled with not having a drink. I was tempted to other days but essentially said  nah I'm ok . ..The office was something of a shitstorm yesterday. ..My wife had a really stressful day with her small business dealing with an issue that *should* have had a very simple solution but the other party (someone she was trying to pay!) was being problematic: they only wanted a check to an address this entity provided. The post office returned her letter twice as undeliverable. The entity said  oh that's happening to a bunch of other people too. Just re-mail it to the same address. No we can't accept a credit card cash or payment in person.  They didn't seem to grasp the address they provided was bad. ..So we both really wanted a drink for cathartic reasons.  Didn't even want to get drunk just to have a drink. ..Managed not to. It was a hell of a struggle though. Still have some good single malt that I just can't bring myself to dump down a drain and I forgot to bring it to my friends last weekend. Even with that within easy reach didn't have any. Neither did my wife and she's just trying to cut back to weekends only as support. ..But dang. That was tough for the both of us. .
