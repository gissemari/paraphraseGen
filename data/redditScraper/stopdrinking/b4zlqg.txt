I will go to AA soon but for now I find it very helpful to be posting here everyday even if I do not have too much to share...I've noticed in the past when I've relapsed I haven't actively worked on sobriety everyday haven't checked this sub and just went with the flow thinking  I won't drink ...and then eventually I did...Yesterday I went to a lunch where people were drinking I stuck with water and weirdly did not miss alcohol and I think the man next to me drinking 3 huge beers and getting loud also made me not want to drink because I remembered my weird drunk times. I also ate in a controlled way unlike when I drank. I feel I conducted myself much better. ..My friend who's visiting got some alcohol and kept it in the fridge for everyone. I did not feel like drinking because I did not want to go where alcohol takes me. ..Today I had a tiny craving. It's day 3. But I know for sure in my heart and mind I do not want to drink it gives me NOTHING but problems. I cannot think of even one benefit but the list is problems I've gotten from alcohol is long. ..I kept myself busy the whole day today...it's night where I am and I am done. Will wake up happy and proud on day 4 :) ...

Thank you for your post. Your thoughts help me make it through today. 
Good for you! Today is day 7 for me. It is so weird to be sober around people drinking. You notice so many things you wouldn't notice while drinking with them. ..I'm stepping out of my comfort zone - I'm more of a lurker on forums. I feel like this will help me keep up the fight. I am feeling wonderful!
