I was sober for 90 days at the beginning of October of 2013. I relapsed by thinking I could just have one social drink then it turned into a couple mickeys a week until I finally quit again the day after my birthday February 28th 2014. I have been sober ever since...A brief history. I am 26 years old and female. Grew up in a pretty messy situation. My parents were young my Father was an alcoholic and an abuser he also committed suicide. He was part Native and had a lot of issues regarding the reservation he grew up on and the alcoholism that went on in his family. My Mom's side was a nice "normal" as you can get family. Hard working with good morals and values but she was always a rebel. I went to live with my Grandparents after my Mom had a few nervous break downs. I excelled well all through school at academics and in sports and did well with social skills and "fitting in." ..Highschool came around and I guess I felt I needed to fit in somewhere seeing as I didn't know the other half of me was because I was raised away from my other side of my family due to the alcholism. I ran into my older cousins in highschool and would sneak off from school and go to their houses and we would end up drinking and doing drugs. Not much I could never handle much I never really got addicted to anything either. Mainly pot mushrooms a little bit of ecstasy and maybe some cocaine here or there the odd weekend. This was all when I was 16. I partied pretty hard for a few more years and dropped out of school at 17 and worked full time...As I was working full time from 17-19 I did not touch a drink. I smoked maybe $5 worth of marijuana a day that was it. But never drank. I was living with my Mother at this time and we were fighting lots so I took up an offer and decided to move to the city (being a small town girl I thought this was a great idea boy was I wrong)..I lived in the city maybe for 6 months and thats where it really picked up I was going out almost 3 nights a week the hangovers were pretty deadly. I partied pretty hard half the time I can't even remember what I did or said but I do remember getting beat up a few times by other girls losing my job and almost being kidnapped by foreigner fishing for girls at clubs. ..I moved home and ended up finding out I was pregnant. I got an abortion because the guy I was with was a complete asshole and I didn't want to bring a child into this world into that sort of turmoil. ..I started drinking heavily for like 3 years until I gained a bunch of weight and felt like my body couldnt take it anymore. I ended up having problems and getting random ailments when I was always really healthy and fit. I started to slow down but drank at least a mickey once or twice a week and that would get me drunk and I would be hungover the next morning. Enough that it would make me smell. It would be like in my nasal passage and I would sweat it out of my pores. It was disgusting. ..I am lucky I never got seizures my bestfriend is dealing with that on a regular basis and may have to go for brain surgery for it I don't get the shakes and I don't get really bad cravings. I just can't have one drink. I have to drink it all. I can do days and days without it. It's just that one drink and then for 2 weeks I'll be on a binge or something. ..So right now I am about 32 days in. I am starting to feel better about it and I know I can do it. I just have to keep myself busy especially my hands! ..Thank you all for reading!
