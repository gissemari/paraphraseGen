I did it again. I achieved a good amount of sober time and relapsed. I relapsed HARD and out of nowhere. In the past year and a half of this pattern; significant sober time to random drunk oblivion (3-4 day bender consuming massive quantities) and I morphe into a monster. ME the REAL me is no longer present and something else is inhabiting my body driving it to lash out in an extreme way at people I really truly love with all my sober soul...This last episode I attacked my significant other (not the first time) and I verbally threatened my sister who was living with me. I kicked her out and threatened her life. The cops came (I was passed out they left no follow-up). Mind you I am doing this in front of my 2 and 4 year old babies. I lost the rent money (most of it was stolen drank the rest)..It is needless to express how much I hate myself. My family is facing eviction if I don't make the $900+ in the next few days. I can do it...I just would rather crawl in a hole and die than return to the strip club that this all began. ..I am analyzing my behavior and it is finally clear to me I have a lot of unchecked anger. I am addicted to working at the club to make the fast money. I usually get stuck back there to right all these wrongs and stay sober for a good time make all this progress just to screw it up again and again...I have been fundamentally against AA in my sobriety. I didn't agree with the "God stuff" and the idea of being powerless. I am rethinking all of that. My drinking is very brutal scary and demonic. It has been this way a very long time. I finally understand the idea of "rock bottom" and I believe I must surrender to something greater than myself to truly make a lasting change. ..My name is Akyra I am a raging tyrant alcoholic and I am searching for my higher power. I will be heading to a meeting today. I will not drink with you today.

Maybe this isnt so bad kind of reinforces the idea of long term sobriety. You had a couple months under your belt you tried to drink again and it was a complete failure and now you're back. before this stretch of sobriety i currently have i was going around 30 days between binging. Even when im bummed out or pissed off I dont even really entertain the idea of drinking because I know it just fucks me up and causes more pain. Plus by not drinking for almost six months i dont really remember the buzz or effect so i can look at drinking with a realistic detachment and see that it is just a negative potentially life threatening activity with no positives. (especially in my case Im a destructive binge drinking psychopath lol)
You may find this book from Russell Brand useful it uses the AA method but in a completely new way best wishes...https://www.amazon.com/Recovery-Freedom-Addictions-Russell-Brand/dp/1250141923
