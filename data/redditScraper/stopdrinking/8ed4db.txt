Decided that I need to cut ties with alcohol for now. I've struggled with binge drinking for years and it's not as big of a problem as it used to be because I got busy working on improving my life. (finishing college next month etc.) I am posting to keep myself accountable to stick with 30 days of sobriety (at a minimum). The hope is that I can go for much longer this time. Hope everyone has a good Monday!
