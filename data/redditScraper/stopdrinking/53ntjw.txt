So I just got back from vacation and figured I'd check my badge. It's been 194 days. Longest I've gone in over 10 years.  First time I've actually made a real decision to stop though.  I'm a bartender in a huge drinking city.  I used to indulge in the hospitality industry 'lifestyle' pretty liberally.  I was just sick of it.     .In June I went to New Orleans with 18 people for a bachelor party and didn't drink a drop.  That's when I realized I didn't need it.  I just got back from a month and a half riding a motorcycle across Southeast Asia. No booze. And you know what?  I don't miss it.  I really don't.  I don't know how because there's NO way I ever thought I'd get to this point.  I hope I continue to feel the same.    .I read This Naked Mind the week I stopped drinking.  The book did exactly what it said it would.  It's worth a shot if you're struggling.    .Of course there are people that can't believe I DON'T DRINK?!!  And those who pry at you for a reason.  But guess what?  I'm doing it for ME because that's who I have to live with.  Drink all you want I'll even serve it to you with no judgment.  Feels good.

Nice work.  I agree with your last sentence.  In fact it's very important for me to keep a non-hostile view towards booze.  Alcohol didn't ruin my life it was my own inability to control alcohol that ruined my life.  The distinction has become quite important for me.
&gt;Drink all you want I'll even serve it to you with no judgment. ..This is just how I feel. I am finally learning how to tend to my little acre and to let other people tend to theirs. Congrats on 6 months! Very impressive.
Congratulations!
