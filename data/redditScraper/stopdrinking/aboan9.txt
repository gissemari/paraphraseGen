got sober in november 2017 made it almost a full year and then relapsed with about a month and a half to to reach the year...i've thought about writing so many times here.  to talk about some of the insane things (unrelated to drinking) that happened.  ..and now i'm just.  lonely/sad.  hopeful too.  i can't have the mentality that i was one sober for a super long time.  i'm a newbie again.  but i'm a newbie who wants to be kind to myself.  not feel the shame i've been feeling the past few months.  ..so hi i'm hinuk (heenook).  i'm here again because living without alcohol is how i want to live.  living with kindness towards myself is how i want to live.  this year had so much sadness in it for me going back to drinking only exasperated that.  ..hello other jan 1st quitters.  ..and yes i have a fully loaded plan if anyone dares ask me that question...just looking for kindness.  29 and finally went no contact with my very abusive mom  not too long before i relapsed.  ..but anyway i have so many things to feel grateful for.  just writing to say i'm lonely tonight.  but i used to come here often and hoping i can do so again because this community had always been extremely supportive and loving.  could use that again.

Sending you warm New year's wishes. The community is here for you and with you. 
Welcome back!! I'm so glad you're here. Let's walk into a new year together. &lt;3
I'm here and I'm happy you are too. IWNDWYT
I went to rehab October 2017 and made it nearly 9 months sober before ending a long term relationship and relapsing for the entire summer. Now I'm in the same boat a newbie once again with a little over a month under my belt! This is my third serious try at sobriety but I'm feeling really confident this time around. I'm glad you made it back and I will not drink with you today!  
Love to you!
