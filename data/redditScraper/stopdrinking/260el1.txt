https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-DPADR2W-ZCSlU8-ce3--lMMc0tADZPYEr284fZydI/pubhtml..Perhaps this spreadsheet will be a handy visual aid for those struggling to get through the day without drinking. ..There have been many instances where I've been told "one day at a time even one hour or one minute at a time". I never actually practiced having milestones less than a day. But the next time I'm obsessing over drinking I'll start marking off the hours as they go by...Thanks to /u/offtherocks for mentioning one of these that he made when he got sober. Here's how he used his: http://i.imgur.com/9WumIUV.jpg

So check off every hour of every day that you don't drink?  This would actually really help me I think (tag isn't accurate).  I like this and am going to use this in some form.  Thanks!!
Cool!  ..If you look closely at my chart you can see where I screwed up numbering.  Way to go offtherocks.
I am so glad you did this service work /u/MySpiritForge -- maybe /u/offtherocks will consider pinning this to the sidebar afterall it is his conception and your superb execution! 
Good idea a common thread is weekend issues  my days were always easy with work being my guiding force but an un scheduled weekend is a really tough time for many here.
