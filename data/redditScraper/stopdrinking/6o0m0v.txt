My last relaps was born out of the thinking: what will other people think if I will not drink. These thoughts about others always led me to unhealthy relationships. Today I have read the book Naked Mind and it strucked me: I will not loose anything by not drinking (all the bad things in my life actually come from drinking) I can find myself I can organize my life and work I can be much better person on my own. And that's something I have never thought about before. Thank you SD. I hope this is lifechanging mindset.
