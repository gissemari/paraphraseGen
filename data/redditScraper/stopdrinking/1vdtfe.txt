I screwed up a few times. I didn't want to admit it to myself or anyone -- I even actively lied to myself saying things out loud when I was drinking...And then yesterday I got caught by my girlfriend. She might very well be leaving me taking our daughter. But you know what? I'm glad I got found out -- I've just now *finally* given myself over to my third step and now I don't have to lie. I don't have to drink or want to kill myself...I'm fucking *free*. For the first time in a long long time I actually feel *peace.*..I have a disease that wants to kill me and actively tries to. It encourages me to deceive myself and others but I don't have to do that any more. It's out of my hands and in my God's now whatever that God is. I don't know still but he's got it and that's good enough...I'm sure most of us have relapsed and the feelings of shame guilt misery after those help us to remember why we need to stay sober. Today's entry in the Daily Reflections said something along the lines of "I didn't want to hit rock bottom again more than I wanted to drink" and that's precisely how I feel...I don't have to do that any more. Not many people get a chance at a fresh start but here I am blessed to have one. And I am *so grateful for it.*..Thanks for reading and thank you all for your support. We're gonna make it.
