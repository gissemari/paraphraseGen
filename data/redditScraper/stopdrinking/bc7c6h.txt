I've been pretty high up on the relapse ladder lately and I'm finally starting to come back down to earth. I was planning my relapse for this weekend bc I don't have my kids and I'm off work... a rare chance at freedom. .I would instead like to plan some fun healthy activities. .Other than hiking/ meditating... any fun ideas?

Springtime here - perfect for a camping / backpacking trip!  Take up a woodworking project or learn how to knit.  Go to an animal shelter and volunteer to walk the dogs.  Visit family you haven't seen in awhile.  Go fishing (my go to).  Iwndwyt
Will it be warm enough to do yard work? Get some mulch and plants and go to town. Or paint a room or do a movie day.
Hot yoga. You'll be so wore out you won't worry about drinking.
I enjoy running playing poker and swimming. Do you like watching sports at all? Golf hockey and basketball are on this weekend.
Gardening very satisfying in my experience
Taking a hot bubble bath and watching a movie with popcorn and snacks
