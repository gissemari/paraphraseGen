**Before anyone tells me to go to /r/stopsmoking I implore you to please hear me out!**..I feel this is a peculiar problem for ex-drinkers as I have frequented enough AA meetings to know that a lot of alcoholics are also in the clutches of nicotine. I have always found this community to be helpful and supportive so I hope this is a place where I can discuss this..<enter>.I have been sober now for 6 months: will write the post later about that! And I seriously thought that even though I started smoking before problem-drinking that as soon as I stopped drinking cigarettes would lose their appeal. And in a way they have. I do have more days where I'm like dear god (inhale) why am I (exhale) doing this? Than when I was drinking. I am definitely less delusional about how enjoyable smoking is. But the thing is I can't get myself to stop smoking. And this is not to say quitting drinking was easy: I needed [A LOT OF SUPPORT](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5m31f2/how_i_feel_at_70_days/) and AA/stopdrinking has been a great support system for me. .<enter>.But now that I'm trying to quit It's harder for me not to feel like a POS for having quit something so life-crushing but struggling to quite smoking. ..I just want to hear from other sobernaughts who are fighting the nicotine issue: how long were you sober and what tools from sobriety did you apply to your quest to quit smoking?

I have used an electric cigarette in and off for a few years but though drinking i always went back to some cigarettes at the weekend. A treat! Stupid treat. Anyway when I stopped drinking a month ago I stopped all cigarettes and have been on my electric full time. It's helped so much with the not  drinking. I couldn't do both at once and I'm not beating myself up about the electric cigarette. I will not drink with you today 
I quit smoking before I decided I needed to quit drinking. I quit smoking 50 days ago and stopped drinking 19 days ago...Since stopping drinking the urges to smoke have been significantly less to point where I don't miss smoking at all...I keep the two quits distinctly separate in my mind to prevent a double relapse if one should happen. Good luck! 
I switched to vaping at the same time I quit drinking.  I have cheated and smoked a few cigs in the past 8 months though never drank.  The vape helps me a ton.  I have slowly reduced the nicotine in it from 24 mg down to 4 mg.  I hate being addicted to nicotine.  I feel like I'm not really sober with this stupid addiction nagging on me.  ..My goal is to reduce nicotine level down 1 mg per month until I'm at zero.  Then I imagine I'll only vape for a month or so before my body realizes I'm not craving so much anymore.  Fingers crossed.
I went on a weird amphetamine bender once smoked an entire pack in one sitting and can't stand more than one or two at a time since. I couldn't get addicted to tobacco again if I tried. Not that I haven't started smoking again at points but it was always a "anxiety time to have a cigarette; ewww time to put the cigarette out" thing...Don't quit the way I did though that was fucking stupid and unintentional - was supposed to be studying. Although trying to choke down a pack in one sitting might actually work without the other stuff I'm not sure.
Spoiler alert - 12 Step experience upcoming.  I quit smoking around three months sober when I was completing Step 3 because I could find no way to rationalize how my smoking cigarettes was consistent with God's will for me.  I stopped with the help of nicotine gum which took another couple of *years* to kick.  Nicotine and caffeine were wicked addictions for me with bad withdrawals.
I quit smoking five years before quitting drinking. You can do this.
