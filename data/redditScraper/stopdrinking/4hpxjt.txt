Hi everyone!..In about a month I will be traveling to Japan for the first time - going on my honeymoon and need help finding a few English speaking meetings while I'm there.  I'll be visiting Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka.  Any good meeting recommendations would be greatly appreciated!  I found this website and am guessing the meetings are probably in English but I'm not 100% sure: aatokyo.org..I recently had a relapse after 14 months of sobriety so I'm a bit shaken.  I'm trying my best to move forward and to plan ahead and prevent more relapses while traveling so that I can fully enjoy my first time in Japan with my new husband sober.  Thank you in advance!

So I don't have any advice on AA meetings in Japan but I wanted to say congratulations on coming back &amp; keeping your sobriety a priority!
Nice bro...Personally I have no relevant advice for you whatsoever. But a guy I live with is in AA and recently vacationed in Tokyo. I'll ask him if he went to any meetings there...He doesn't speak Japanese. AA meetings in Japan might be an awesome opportunity and it might be interesting to go to a meeting where you didn't speak the language they were speaking just to pay attention to the vibes and such. But I get what you're asking let me ask.
