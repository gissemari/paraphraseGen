So here I am again on the night of day one.  Feeling worthless sad damaged ... I know I'm capable of so much more but this scares me and I'm struggling.  I'm so tired.  ..I'm so worn out.  I can't even trust myself. ..But I am broken tonight..  crying alone...  r/sd I don't know what to say anymore.  No one can understand unless they have walked a day in our shoes.   My SO doesn't understand and I hope to God she never will.... So  here I am.....I am an alcoholic.  I have to stop.    .I have to. ..I will not drink with you today.  .....

We are all here with you. Great decision. Hang in there!
You are not worthless you have just been tricked by a false friend. Alcohol will take and take and take from you but never give. 
What's important is that you're not giving up! It's a hard road and it sucks when those closest to you fail to really get it. At least here everyone gets it and supports you and each other. Get some rest and try to be kind to yourself. You are not worthless.
