Just relapsed after 143 days. Can some of you guys share your success stories of after your relapse?  I'm not having any strong cravings but they're lurking in my brain somewhere. Any help is greatly appreciated!

I don't beat myself about it.  I keep my eye on the prize and that is racking up as many sober days as possible.  I used to freak out and hate myself if I lapsed but now I just look at how well I've done this day this month this year which is pretty good.  Count your victories and keep them coming.  You've got this! IWNDWYT.
I had so many relapses! Soo many. I just kept trying kept talking to my therapist kept plugging the wholes in my recovery plan kept reading about addiction kept meditating to cslm my mind down. I really feel each relapse taught me something new to avoid or process and now I finally feel the door to drinking is permanently closed. The trick now is just remembering what's on the other side.
For me it's all about the post mortem:  what happened? where did I go wrong? what should I do differently next time?  But most of all it's about not being too hard on myself acknowledging my mistake and moving forward to try again rather than dwell in regret.
