Never fails when I relapse I lose all interest in the few hobbies I have and like.  Learning languages and knitting are those few hobbies.  ..My desire to knit has returned!  My 6th grade teacher taught us how and then I forgot.  Two years ago I took a beginner's class at a tiny local yarn shop in my neighborhood in Seattle and started making hats and hand warmers and scarves.  I moved and a year later with a few fits and starts due to relapse I've finally picked them back up again.  All I want to do is knit now. For those looking for a new hobby...give it a try.  There is something to putting so much heart and time into creating something beautiful &amp; tangible...just out of yarn and loops. It's so cool! And it's saving me.....Gratitude.

I'm walking around knitting a dishcloth right now!  I missed it too! 
Nice! I started knitting again too. I tried to knit a few times drunk cables &amp; it did NOT go well. I cringe when I think of it because my husband must've totally known why it kept screwing up
