Going to eat some toast to see if feeling full will help me sleep. ..Anyone else struggling on Day 2?..IWNDWYT or Tomorrow either

Not day 2 but struggling with sleep too. I think it's my thyroid meds. I found my sleep improved a lot after the first few days. Toast is good..
Sleep will come and all the other benefits. Don't force it and find distractions it'll right itself eventually.
