I've been trying for a couple of weeks to change my badge after relapsing but it isn't working for me. Anyone else having trouble or is it just me?

I think the badges are reset manually so you might just need to wait a bit for a mod to get around to it.
I wasn't able to do it on mobile- had to do it on the computer. 
Are you mobile or desktop?
