I moved house a few months ago and moved in with two very nice girls....who drink a lot! I have been struggling with my problem for nearly a year now doing well then falling down but I always get back up. The only good thing is when I get back up I am always more together and less of a problem drinker each time. This time though I want to stop I want it to be over. The new housemates however have invited me out to a work night of theirs tonight where people passing out is almost seen as normal. I have turned them down a couple of times before and I know they are starting to think I am some sort of recluse (I don't go out much at all these days). I don't think I am strong enough yet to not drink in a social situation where I know hardly anyone and yet I can't help feeling like my offers of "socialisation" from them will stop after this if I don't!

Im finding people I know well enough I can be reasonably honest with but anyone else its been easier to just say I cant drink for health reasons. I have bad acid reflux anyway so I just say it makes me feel really sick so its just not worth it and 'yeah it fuckin' sucks tell me about it'. ..Most people seem to be able to relate to how shitty it is being out at a bar or with drunk people when you have to stay sober. ..Maybe you could suggest other non-drinking ways to socialise with them during the day instead if you're worried they will start thinking you're a weirdo or whatever. 
Congrats on the 8 days! Keep it up! Do your housemates know that you're trying to stop drinking? If not have you thought about telling them? ..If you don't think you're strong enough to go through this type of social situation yet it might be best to stay away. Just until you're comfortable. Don't worry--you live with these girls and will have plenty of opportunities to show them you like to go and do fun things! Maybe you could suggest some non-drinking activities for you all to do?
