I told my boyfriend a few days ago not to worry about Valentine's Day. He's never been into it and money is a little tight. But I still did my hair and makeup because I thought he'd take me to dinner or buy some flowers at least a card. Or at the VERY least not jump right on his computer game right after work. That's his other addiction. He went to the store on his lunch break because he came home from work with a case of beer. Now he's in the other room on his computer drinking his beer and hanging out with people online. I'm struggling so hard not to tear into those cans...I mean he's probably still upset with me from my last binge and resents me for being such a waste (not working not in school) but the last couple days I've been trying to change all that. I know it'll take time but his lack of empathy is really making me want to say  fuck it  right now. ..About to grab a la croix wash my face and take a bath. Thanks for letting me vent SD.

Give it time... things will change as you change. 
I hope you decided to take that bath it'll feel way better in the morning than drinking those beers. .The other posters are right give you and your boyfriend more time to comprehend your major life changes. Best wishes. IWNDWYT
"About to grab a la croix wash my face and take a bath."  Now that's what you need do something for yourself!  Keep strong - you can do this and IWNDWYT!
