Hi SD. I have been a lurker for a long time on this subreddit. For ten years I struggled a downhill battle with addiction to drugs and alcohol. I have nearly died more times than I would like to admit been in and out of hospitals for addiction combined with bipolar disorder and ruined every great relationship I had. I was homeless while going to college because of my use. It had taken everything from me and I am only 24 years old.I was terrified to stop mostly because I didn't know if I truly wanted to stop as bad as that sounds let alone if I could. In the worst of my addiction to alcohol right before I stopped drinking I drank on bad days to make them "better". I drank on meh days to make them "better". I drank on good days because a good day could always be made even better with booze even though that was never the reality of the situation. I went to AA for a while back in June but it really wasn't for me. That made me scared because it's all about AA in the addiction community it seems. Thankfully I found this subreddit. I browse this daily and get inspiration to keep going and be mindful when things are going good and to be humbled and reminded that I am just as much of an alcoholic as I was when I was at my worst. Thanks for 217 days and best of luck on your journeys! I have never been more at peace. I am a slave no longer.

High ^five!..Great going. Keep at it...I'm not drinking with you today
That's awesome! Happy for you. SD has meant a world of change for me too. I've never been to AA in my town for a couple of reasons but the fine people of SD is a ton of help :-)
