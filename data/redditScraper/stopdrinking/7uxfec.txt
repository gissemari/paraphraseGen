Granted it was for her birthday a week ago.  I have a hard time calling her.  She is the only grandparent I have left.  I lost two grandparents in the span of about half a year a couple years back.  One to alzheimers the other to cancer.  The first grandparent to cancer back in 2002. Interspersed in that time was losing my uncle again to cancer.  Every time I would hear about one of them being diagnosed it immediately felt like they died.  I did manage to talk to my grandfather before he passed a couple of years ago but it was extremely hard.  I was glad I talked to my grandma because internally I struggle with it wondering if she even remembers me or whether or not she feels alone and would welcome my call.  I guess it was a bit of amends for me and the drinking I would do to avoid struggling over whether or not I was staying in contact with my family enough...I will not drink with any of you today (and call whoever you feel like you need to! It's worth it!)

Good on you for getting past your aversion and making the call I bet receiving it meant the world to her
I'm sure she really appreciated it   .IWNDWYT
