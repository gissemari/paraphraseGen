First time poster here... been lurking for a month or so...I'm 55 months sober today. I got drunk/hammered on one substance (or more) almost every day for 30+ years and miraculously didn't die go to jail or become unemployable. I sure was a miserable SOB for the decade before I quit though...Five years ago right now I was in the middle of what I call my "soberish" chapter. Determined to quit by myself I drank 6 or 7 times over 9 months. I couldn't seem to stop starting again. It was a struggle that ended with actually asking for (and accepting) help from others. I can't do it alone...Today I am thankful for this and other communities of recovery who continue to be available to help me. I don't know how to stay sober this long. All I know is my #1 priority is not drinking today and only for today. To do that I need support. I can't do it alone. Thank you thank you thank you thank you. I can't do it alone.
