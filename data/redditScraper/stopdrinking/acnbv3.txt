Hang in there you are right in the middle of it. It gets better! I will not drink with you today! 
I know the feeling hang in there.  I will not drink with you today I promise.
Treat yourself to something nice. Your favorite meal or dessert. Watch a movie read a book take a hot shower or bath. Make a plan for tomorrow and get to bed early. You'll feel so much better than if you drink trust me. I'll be sober tonight as well!..It only gets better from here week 1 is the roughest.
I'm gonna try my best. I did dessert last night and got a blizzard from Dairy Queen yumm
Get a pizza and a bottle of Dr Pepper otherwise I am going to hunt you down. Being hungover on Saturday sucks!!!!.IWNDWYT
You got this. The craving will pass. I found it always helps to keep yourself busy. Who would have thought that I love knitting. Helps to keep my hands busy.
   
I wont drink if you wont ok.
