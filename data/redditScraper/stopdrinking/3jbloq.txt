I'm mostly on irc but for a big day I feel like I can post here. ..On average my life is better. The highs aren't quite as high but they last longer and are more satisfying. The lows aren't nearly as low and I've equipped myself with better tools to deal with them. ..Having other humans to talk to was a huge deal. I spend a lot of time irc and it still helps when things get bad. They're going to get a notification when this posts. *waves*..In the early months goal #1 was just get home sober. I knew if I did that everything else would be OK. I had a really hard time concentrating on anything for the first month. I took notes for the first few weeks and read them every day.  I played around 300 games of solitaire because after work that was about all I could focus on...Slowly things changed focus sleep and anxiety all got better. I gained confidence while that happened. They are still getting better and I have a long ways to go. I have more patience for the journey now rather than being focused on the destination...SMART meetings helped too. I like the meetings facilitated by MTMassey. They're less formal than a typical meeting but are still very useful and informative. He covers more than just stopping a bad habit. It is how to work better with yourself. I will keep attending them...I recorded a few quotes from those meetings. To make this post useful I'll share them now:."Many of us have held our emotions down like a beachball under water. They're going to come up eventually."."If you find yourself arguing with reality how is that working out for you?"."Only a fool trips on whats behind them."."You don't have to be an adult that is a choice you make on your own"..Now for some of my favorite saved posts from here in no particular order:."When someone relapses they try to find a reason.".https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3h1e80/question_for_people_who_ever_relapsed_after_2_or/cu3g38u.."Wipe your tears man fucking up You have no idea how lucky you are. No. Idea. None.".https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3d1da4/first_time_posting_legally_cant_drinkits_going_to/ct0zayg.."I am going to let you in on a little secret. This is important.".https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2hdajo/weekends/ckrqmft.."I'm not real sure how I can put this succinctly. For me the greatest benefit has been learning to trust my own judgment".https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2q547u/things_you_are_learning_whilst_not_drinking/cn32jez

Good post thanks.
Awesome cream! Really happy for you. It's been great getting to know you on IRC over the past year and you've added a lot to the channel. I definitely agree that connecting with others has made all the difference in the world - realizing that others are going through the very same things is really helpful as well as just being able to bounce thoughts off others...Sounds like everything is going well for you these days - keep up the good work!
Congratulations Cream!
Yeeeehaw! Nice job!
