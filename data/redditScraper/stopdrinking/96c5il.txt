It's wild to believe it was only a little bit over a week ago since I've "quit" drinking. Everyday has been a challenge in mindfulness (and ice cream.) I did have one relapse it was after a 10 hour day while I was in the studio recording a song and the producer asked me if I wanted a beer. It just felt natural to take it. And that led to another one. And then a glass of wine at home...The sad thing is I was proud I only had 3 drinks...  .Now it's harder than before. I made it yesterday. But today the urges are just like they'd been the first night. And I leave for a tropical vacation on Sunday where I'll be on the beach and I'll want nothing more than to relax with a beer. But that beer will lead to another and another. And man this is going to be tough. ..What did y'all do on your first vacation? Did you just stuff your face with sugar like I probably will? How in the world do you make the beach enjoyable without alcohol?

I always make a point of finding an AA meeting on vacation. Not sure where you're going or if you're an AA person but if you are it is worth a look.
Following. My vacation starts soon
On my first sober vacation I found virgin tropical drinks a lifesaver. Frozen virgin daiquiris pina coladas basically fruit smoothies ... SO refreshing delicious and best of all not dehydrating or expensive!..I would be satisfied with one instead of like 4 and it really helped get me into vacation mode. I never drink them at home so it was also festive and special to do so. It also helped to remember that day drinking in the sun always have me the headache and hangover from hell...Enjoy - this can be your best vacation yet!
