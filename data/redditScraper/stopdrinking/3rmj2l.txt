Hi all! I just wanted to share some thoughts after one week of sobriety. I feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. When I was drinking the desire to drink almost seemed compulsory. The question wasn't "am I going to drink tonight?" it was "what am I going to drink tonight?" Not having to make the decision of what flavor of poison to drink that day is huge! I can also already see the monetary effects of not drinking. I was spending more on booze than I was on food some days. I would routinely spend 10+ dollars a day on alcohol so one week sober = at least $70 not spent on alcohol. I have spent time this week outdoors hiking and bike riding and I put some effort into eating more fruits and vegetables and drinking tons of water. I have to say that I feel better than I have in years and I am only at 1 week! I can only imagine how great I will feel after 6 months! I have been struggling with my alcoholism for 21 years and I am finally ready to close that chapter of my life for good. I would like to thank all of the people who post here. Knowing that I am not alone in my struggles to remain sober is a huge motivational advantage. Thank You! I will not drink today!
