I know I have a stash hidden. With just enough to get me feeling good but not enough to make me drunk. I've been battling with myself for a couple hours. I know I will feel incredibly guilty. But I still want it so bad. It's the strangest thing. I can't bring myself to dump it yet.

Go pick it up and throw it in the trash where you can't get to it!.It's a lie. You'll be full time drinking again before you know it and who knows when you'll decide to sober up again! 
Friend that stash is never going to answer your troubles. What you hear is the voice of addiction. "it'll be ok...who will know?" This is our battle. Separate your thought from the action. Pour it out. You will feel so much better I think when you do.  Stay strong! You are made of impossibly strong stuff!..I won't be drinking with you today!
Step one: posting about it here...Step two: dumping that poison...Step three: posting about it here...You can do it.
Dump it!   
Here's the way I look at it:  It ends up down the sewer either way but if you pour it out directly your body brain and spirit don't have to pay the price.  You posted about it here you want to take action honor that part of you...We are all rooting for you here!
How long have you been sober? I am on day four and last night sadly I threw away 3 more of my hiding places. I am up to 7 "stashes" dumped. Yes it is hard but if your serious you must do it to get rid of the temptation. Yes I want it bad also to curb the shakes but I know me one ounce leads to 20+ ounces per day. I will try not to drink with you today. Man yesterday was tough.
Dump it!!!
