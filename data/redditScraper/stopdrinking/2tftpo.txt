I first went to an alcohol counsellor five years ago when I was solidly daily-drinking and feeling everything from my mind to my stomach deteriorating. I got ten sessions and it was helpful although ultimately the wrong time in life. This time round I decided today that I need some extra help as I also live with depression and anxiety and well better prepared eh. So I rang the local service as advertised online. No answer. Rang again same. Tried another advertised agency. No ring tone. Finally tried CRI yet another agency and it turns out that they've taken over all the other services here. And reduced them as far as they could. When I asked for some support I was told that as I had quit on my own they couldn't help me. If I'd rang 21 days ago I'd have received something but "as you're doing so so well Jamie we really don't need to hear from you unless you relapse". I pointed out that stopping was easy but staying stopped was the potential issue. She repeated the last sentence. "Have you considered AA?" Yes I've been going to some meetings but I have a history of low level mental health issues and I'd like..... "It really does sound like AA would be perfect for you as you're doing so so well Jamie"..If I were in a weaker state I might be tempted to go get shitfaced just so they'd take me on the books. Unbelievable. This government is anti people. If you aren't rich you can get fucked. As soon as they and the previous lot make everything 'market sensitive' and allow the spivs to undercut the NHS departments by stripping back services the games up. ..Sorry. Rant over. Three weeks tomorrow I'm going to try another AA meeting to get Saturdays nailed and I haven't drank today. And the few friends I've told about quitting have been incredibly supportive. Life is good.

I'm really lucky to live in a city with a massive alcohol problem so our services are pretty good. They're limited though as to when you can access and for how long. I used them initially when attempting to moderate and they helped me cut consumption. I'll have to ask if they do anything for newly sober people I'm working at one of their buildings Sunday I'll see what I can find out. Not that it helps you I'm just curious for me now!..Your getting fobbed off reminds me of my experiences with mental health services and the NHS generally these days though :( Before the aforementioned service above I went to the doctors depressed and in bits and was told I couldn't have NHS talking therapy because I drank :s  I now have a private therapist who does 'gifting' basically they work for what you can afford to pay them. I pay mine  20 a session once a fortnight. I gave up trying for NHS stuff. The best I got for free before was via charities but they were mainly aimed at other niches and again it's time limited. ..The way I laid that post out was terrible. I have a headache.....
That's ridiculous cleaning up the damage from alcoholism is costing them millions!.They have tightened the austerity belt in the wrong place..Glad you didn't drink!!.That is the precious thing about AA it is everywhere for everyone rich or poor. Pretty uncommon in today's world.
