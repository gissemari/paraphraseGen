I am only a few days sober and am feeling pretty great actually. ..Last week was a friends bday and so was mine. So all of us are going out tonight to have a combined birthday celebration. These people are close friends of mine but are people I drank with quite regularly. ..Obviously I don't want to drink tonight. No no no no no. I just got over my withdraw symptoms and knowing my history I relapse and slip up the most at around 4 and 5 days. But I can already see and hear it now:.."Have a drink! Wait you don't want to? Why!?"."Come on have one. We're celebrating your birthday"..And blah blah blah. I love these friends and know if I'm pushy with saying no that they'll understand but I just hope I don't slip into peer pressure and say fuck it...Wish me luck. I do not and will not drink with you today.

Do you absolutely have to go? Next birthday you'll be in a better position...
It takes more than luck to stay sober in a situation like you describe. At three days sober I avoided parties anyone who abused alcohol and did not go into bars. I was too fragile and alcohol too powerful. 
I'd be faking a cold so fast it'd make your head spin! What is your plan?  Hope  and  Luck  are zero help to me.
