I've been drinking since I was a teenager. I was the socially awkward introvert girl who did well in school so even though there were many early warning signs I wrote it off - there's no way I fit the typical mold of what an alcoholic is. ..Well I am an alcoholic. ..A year and a half ago I tried to quit drinking. It lasted for a few months but I relapsed at a company event. And so it went for the next year and a half. I'd be ok for a few weeks or months (let's be honest sometimes days) and then I'd be back on the wine again. Drinking alone until I blacked out passed out. Would feel horrible the next day but would write it off as 'oh well I was stressed about this or that that's why I did it.'.That all changed on Friday night. Somewhere into my second bottle of wine I blacked out called my boyfriend told him (I found out later from him) that I didn't want to be with him and insulted his friends. The next day he told me I needed to get help for my drinking. I completely agreed. I have only heard from him sparingly since he understandably told me he needed space. I apologized for the bs lies I said while blacked out and told him I'd go to meetings every day. So I've been going to AA meetings every day for the last 5 days. It's tough to be vulnerable in front of strangers again socially awkward introvert here so it's pretty much my definition of anxiety-inducing but I knew I needed help. I can't do this alone. I've been reading this subreddit the past few days and I've been encouraged. Staying sober is possible no matter what life throws at you. I plan on going back to this page every day and going to meetings every day for as long as it takes for me to feel like I have a handle on things again. Thanks all.

When the moment comes that you want to drink again you need to read this post again.  Re-read all of your decisions and moments that got you to the mentality that you're at now...This thing will trick you if you aren't careful.  IMHO alcoholics are the smartest people on the planet.  We even outsmart ourselves!
Wonderful and good job on 5 days - you've gotten through one of the toughest parts you can do this!.
