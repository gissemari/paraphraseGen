Just wanted to check in and say I just passed the 6 month mark. ..It has been an interesting journey and am excited to see what is in store for me...I still struggle with cravings from time to time especially with it being brewery season and all. I miss socializing with my friends seeing random people I know out in public. I know I can do that without booze but booze made it so much easier....I still have plenty to work on but at least I can do that without alcohol....
