I've been struggling with maintaining sobriety for the past 4 years. This current run has felt the strongest for me and with the help of reading SD daily the desire to maintain my badge and a few other strategies I'm feeling more resolute than ever. Yet I've never made it past 4 months sober (made it to 4 months sober a few times) I'm feeling a tad disappointed that I'm not celebrating a year long sober anniversary today (my previous attempt started a year ago today) and I'm just feeling the feels of some stress-inducing things at the moment. So I'm putting on my sobernaut outfit again today and will work through this. Have a great day SD! IWNDWYT

It might be moment by moment hour by hour but I will not drink with you today...
3-4 months was the toughest time for me. I felt like I'd given sobriety a really good try and I *still* was struggling. I was convinced it was going to be that difficult forever. But right around 4 months something clicked in me and it got so much easier. I hope that "click" happens for you. Keep going! I won't drink with you today.
