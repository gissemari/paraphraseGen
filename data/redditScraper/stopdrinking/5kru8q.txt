I have been glamorizing a drink/drug all day. I promised myself I would make it to 90 days. I know I need to go more than 90 but I've been planning my relapse all day...I have this false idea that taking some shots or some pills will make all my problems go away. That I will feel 100% relief and light as a feather. I remember the relief of the first drink the peace found from the drugs. I can't stop thinking about it...I know it's just a craving. It will pass. It's slow passing though and the thought is becoming stronger. I'm going to go to a 12-step yoga meeting tonight.

After reading this post I'm realizing I am more craving relaxation than drugs/booze. What I really want from these substances is relief. There are many ways to get relief. I really think yoga will help and ultimately working towards a meditation practice.
12-step yoga sounds good.  I realize now that I crave the illusory promise of relief that I think drinking/using will provide rather than the anxiety/loss of control/hungover feelings that inevitably do happen if I pick up.

Dang.  I know just what you mean.  My lizard brain is plotting some sort of scenario where it would be okay to drink.  I'm trying to be an impartial observer of it knowing that it's not thinking things through.  But sometimes I wish it would die or at least just shut the frack up.  Going to the gym in 15 minutes.....Edit: Back from the gym but I had to skedaddle out of there right quick.  Just my luck it's next door to my favorite watering whole and I always make it a point not to be at the gym when my bar is open.  Made it with 15 minutes to spare
12 step Yoga?  I've never heard of it but find it very interesting!  Good job interrupting that downward spiral of glamorizing. .Be strong.
