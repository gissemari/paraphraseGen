Feeling a bit disappointed I don't seem to be feeling any benefits of not drinking yet. Doesn't make me want to drink or anything I just wondered if anyone else had felt like this? .I have the deadline of my thesis on Friday and I know that's been adding to my general stress so I've been struggling to sleep and I guess that's why I've been feeling shitty..Hoping that from the weekend I can really throw myself into new sober activities!

ZERO benefits in the last ten days? Like NONE at all?
Sleep is often disturbed in early sobriety. After abusing my body for years I didn't expect it to find  equilibrium in just ten days. I do remember however the glorious freedom of waking up with no hangover. 
I have felt like this in the past especially at the beginning and even sometimes still today. Sometimes the benefits aren't always clear and they can be different for everyone. Something that helps me when I feel that way is to remember why I stopped drinking. Why did you stop? What are you expecting to gain from sobriety? How can you get there? ..Also what kind of activities are you interested in?
