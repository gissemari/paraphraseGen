So I went a total of 6 days with no beer and the last 2 I had some. Not massive amounts but enough to realise that I'll continue to have cravings if I continue every day. So I'm going to make this night the last one where I'll drink a normal amount before starting my new job tomorrow which requires me to be sober 24/7. I don't want to be sneaking alcohol around in the job and it being continually on my mind...&amp;#x200B;..I actually felt good by the end of the 6 days with each day getting progressively better. Wish me luck and thanks for the support!  .
