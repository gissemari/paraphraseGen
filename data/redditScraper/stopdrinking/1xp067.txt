We were together for 3 and a half years and broke up 6 months ago in a large part due to my drinking. This is the first time that I have seen and spent time with her since i got sober.  Long story short I still fucking love her and my biggest regret is not getting sober when I should have. I thought my lifestyle changes would help us get back together but it didn't. Too little too late I guess. 3 months ago my first reaction after seeing her would have been to get drunk as all fucking hell but this time I didn't. I thought about it I wanted to. But I didn't. It gets easier guys but every day is a goddamn struggle. ..Also current badge is not up to date due to relapse. Just hit three months sober longest streak in 7 years.

Even non alcoholics lose at love sometimes. I am constantly surprised and pleased when my reaction to life doesn't include self destructive activity. Sobriety and self examination taught me a lot. 
A milestone.  A tough one but congrat's nonetheless.  Keep it up for you!  
I know your pain brother. Woulda shoulda coulda sooner. But at least we're sober now and the lesson is not lost on us. Hang tough. Xo
Don't obsess I know I know...telling an alcoholic that is like saying don't think about the elephant in the room.  Still it is true that time heals.  Good luck.
