A beloved pet died yesterday unexpectedly. My husband is travelling for work so it was just me and my son who was just so comforting. I have a good bottle of wine here that I really wanted to open to drown my sorrows. I told my husband that I was in despair and just wanted to drink. He didn't say "don't " or "that's a bad idea". No he said nothing but comforting words. Didn't even address what I said about relapsing  which was the right response. I needed to deal with that temptation on my own in that moment. It's weird and painful to feel emotions so clearly - feelings I have always pushed back with booze. .I will not drink with you today because today...I just need to truly grieve.
