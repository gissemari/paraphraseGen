I've been mostly sober since February but I've relapsed once 2 weeks ago and I've got terrible perma-anxiety since this day. ..I can't undestand if it's the guilt or if i'm reliving my withdraw symptoms. ..It sucks..

what are you doing to help you keep from picking up (other than posting here?)..not to seem preachy but I could not have done it without AA - there are other peer groups today so you may have a choice - Its not perfect but I can say that most of my issues with it were overblown in my own head.   I suggest you read our stories linked in the sidebar and see how we did it.....good luck keep us posted.... 
When you say you relapsed once do you mean it was just one session of drinking?  If so I wouldn't suspect withdrawal symptoms...Speaking for myself the anxiety would be coming from two things.  One the guilt of relapse.  Two the associated fear that I might not be able to maintain sobriety.  If I mess up once how likely is it I'll mess up again?  Omg can I really do this?..That sort of thing.  Seeing a therapist like you mentioned in another reply can help drill down to the sources of the anxiety...In the meantime try to let yourself off the hook but stay vigilant.  Mistakes happen.  You've got this.
