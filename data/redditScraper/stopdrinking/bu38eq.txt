I don't really want to get into a lot of details at this point. I feel kind of embarrassed and just emotionally exhausted right now. I just wanted to say hi to you guys. Have a good day.

There is nothing you can do to change yesterday but you can control today. Negative emotions pass with time and there is nothing wrong with pampering yourself a little with something you like even if it's sweets or games or just crying in the dark. You will feel better tomorrow! Stay strong!
