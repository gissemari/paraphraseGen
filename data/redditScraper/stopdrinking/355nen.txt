Well I wish the numbers of days I was sober before this reached a number closer to the final points scored in a basketball game. ..Unfortunately my days sober are closer to a final score in a hockey game. ..I failed. I know why and what I allowed myself to do. Old habits aren't easy to break...That's fine. I'm gonna get up tomorrow and hopefully put to use the lesson coupled with a renewed will and effort. ..I hope you'll try hard tomorrow too. It's the only shot we got. I'm gonna focus on improvement rather then the irrevocable failures of yesterday. ..Wishing all of you nothing but the best on your journeys too!

[Well you know what Michael Caine would have to say about this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LstIgtkEe50) Best of luck today (and tomorrow)!
What are you going to do different this time?..I've seen that question asked on here since I first came to this. The last time I reset my badge and came back with my tail between my legs I knew that I might be asked that very question. Which led me to consider [what I was actually willing to do to get sober.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2vg5ie/what_im_doing_differently_this_time/) I haven't followed that program 100% but I've come close enough and I'm closing in on 90 days sober and going strong. Nothing changes if nothing changes as they say. So what's *your* plan going to be this time around?
