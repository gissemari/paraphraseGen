SOBER! No drank in the tank. No beer over here. Not a single shot in the pot. I was feeling pretty down and hopeless. Then I remembered that I have felt that way before changed my circumstances before and I can do it again. It hasn't been the easiest thing I've ever done but it hasn't been the hardest either (close though haha). I have some exciting things coming my way and I'm still in the process of relearning how to celebrate as well as lick my wounds sober. I am very thankful for this sub. There is a lot to be said about not feeling alone in a struggle like this. Thank you to everyone who has read my posts before and to those who are reading now. We are all important! We have so much strength we just have to find it and flex it. :)

Good for you! Relearning how to respond in a sober manner does not come naturally for some of us. The trick for me is to catch my thoughts in action and change my response. I'm glad you have some exciting things coming your way and you're preparing to celebrate those appropriately (what ever that means). Rephrase... celebrate without alcohol:)
Great job! Congrats on 60!
