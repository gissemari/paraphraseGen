I love the idea of online anonymous support for alcoholics and am not keen on support groups like AA due to social anxiety and self consciousness. I am newlt sober (a week) and struggling. Any suggestions for new users who need tech support as well lol? Is there an instant messaging feature?..Thank you!

It looks like you figured out how to post new threads and that is half the battle. Reddit does have a private message feature but most use it for the community aspect. Welcome and congratulations on getting off the booze.

You just did real good.
I think there's an IRC chat group too or used to be. Is that still around?
