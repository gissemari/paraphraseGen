So I never would have thought I'd I would be too busy to post my one-year sober post on this sub but it happened. It's a good thing. It's a testament to how much my life has turned around for the better. A year ago I was wandering through community college trying to figure out where I was heading and going in and out of sober stints and relapses. My final relapse resulted in a DWI and all the stuff that comes with that. I quit drinking the night I got the DWI and haven't gone back...Since then I took my last year at community college really serious and ended up graduating with honor's and made the Dean's List. I started meditating and exercising more. I learned a lot about my anxiety and depression and the ways that drinking was exacerbating the issue. I moved through an improv comedy program in my town that after 15 months I'll be graduating in two weeks. From taking those classes and becoming part of the community I was invited to come be a writer/performer on a local late night talk show production that happens live every Saturday night. I narrowed down my focus in school and now I'm in film school studying to become a filmmaker with any luck. I actually just bought a bunch of film making equipment with a portion of my student loans combined with some of my own savings that I wouldn't have had if I were still blowing all my money at the bar every weekend. I cleared my life of toxic people and the friendships that were holding me back are kept at a distance. I love all of my old drinking buddies but I just can't hang with them anymore and that's okay. I already know what they're up to and it's the thing I don't wish to be around anymore. My ambition is back. I feel like the old me who was a dreamer at heart and always went at things with 110%. I'm so excited about the future and the potential for the life I want to live. Drinking was the only thing holding me back. It wasn't lack of motivation or depression or being broke or the number of other problems I thought were too monumental to overcome. It was my drinking.  ..This post is kind of just me bragging about all the cool shit that has happened in my life since giving up booze. I've talked to people before who found it inspiring so if one person feels that way and has more motivating to stay clean and sober I would be so happy about that. We can all create the life we want to live. I feel like for myself and probably many others alcohol is the only thing standing in the way and it's so hard to see when you're still drinking. I hope everyone stays clean and becomes the best and most badass version of themselves imaginable. Have a great day everybody and thanks for all of your posts and kind words over the past year (and two months).
