Hi SD community just thought I'd share some powerful and wise words from Tara Brach a wonderful meditation master. ..She uses the phrases for heart opening/loving-kindness mediation and I personally found them very powerful and helpful this Monday morning. .. Reflect on your basic goodness your natural loving your dedication to knowing the truth and what is real. .Your desire to be helpful to grow to awaken  ..Mantra: .May I feel held in loving presence filled in loving presence.May I trust that I am enough .May I feel happy and know the joy of being alive .May I feel deep and natural peace .May my heart and mind awaken and be free... I feel it's extremely difficult accepting I'm an alcoholic a  loser label  which I for years refused to be identified with. Honestly  by affirming I was an alcoholic or suffered from.Alcohol dependency disorder (a phrase I prefer not to shatter my self-esteem completely) it was like admitting I was the biggest loser on the planet. How could I and not all my girlfriends be so horribly out of control and outright  bad  at maintaining a  life . I asked myself this all the time. I observed them participated in the conversations judged other people along with them etc etc and yet I felt such a deep shame and anger towards myself inside. And then I drank. More. I still struggle with providing love-and-kindness to myself. That's why I personally try to mediate sometimes for a couple of minutes sometimes for half an hour - maybe it can help you as well :) ..

As my actions have harmed others as well as myself My healing starts with being kind and gentle to myself.
