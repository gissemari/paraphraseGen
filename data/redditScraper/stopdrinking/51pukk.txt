Today marks 19 days since I decided to quit drinking alcohol. I've struggled with it since I was 17 years old. I never really thought I had a problem in these past ten years but as I look back I can see the insidious effect it has had on my life. It has done nothing but take and the only thing it gives is regret guilt and that wonderful hangover to wake up to the next day. Stay strong you are all beautiful people!
