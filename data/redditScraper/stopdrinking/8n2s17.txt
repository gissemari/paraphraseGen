I posted a few weeks ago about relapsing. I fully intended to quit but then of course I drank again. Cue hurting my husband because I drank again. Embarrassing myself in front of my mom who I invited to dinner and saw me drunk again after 9 months of not seeing it since I went to rehab. Cue tears fear my husband questioning our marriage........Yet here I am thinking of ways I can sneak alcohol. Wanting to say "fuck it" and spiral. Wanting to self-destruct and hide my use...But the thing is...I really don't want this. It's like these thoughts have been woken up. I truly feel like I have a different personality when alcohol is involved. I'm generally still caring but when it comes to alcohol I'm an asshole for what I want. My past 9 months have been about honesty and openness and in one fell swoop my mind is battling with itself. ..I've scheduled to get reevaluated by a psychiatrist have an appointment with my therapist next week and have plans to join a new AA group for women to hopefully find a sponsor this time around. I go to this tomorrow. ..This is awful. I will not drink with you today.

I'm glad you are here. I too have had many starts and stops. This last relapse was so bad. That's the thing they keep getting worse. I now understand when people in AA say they are so scared of relapsing. I am scared that I won't live through the next one. I'll be trying intensive outpatient this time. I will also just do whatever my sponsor wants. In the end it's got to be better than wanting to die. IWDWYT
I have not been sober long but I have been reflecting on this same pattern of behavior in myself.  I think I manufactured crisis subconsciously so I had an excuse to drink.  Well maybe I didn't maybe my addiction did.....Either way whenever things started going great in my life my drinking would increase.  I used to think it was me celebrating the successes but looking back I think it was a storm building to a tornado that would eventually lay ruin to my world...  then I could wallow in self pity and feel like I had reason to drink because my life was a wreck again; and that cycle just kept repeating...Not anymore though.  I plan to put an end to it for good so IWNDWYT!
