So nice to see Day 30. It's been awhile since I could get this far- I kept relapsing every 3 weeks. I finally decided to stop doing things *my* way and got a sponsor and started working the steps. . .Not everyday has been easy but the worst days in sobriety beat the hell out of hungover strung out and suicidal days every time. ..Here's to today! ..
