I'm sorry if this is inappropriate for the subreddit I just want to vent a bit...I have been struggling with drinking since I stopped smoking a few weeks ago my missus pointed out that I was drinking too much. I systematically stopped again (I have always blamed my drinking on my insomnia) and last week I went the whole week without drinking! Woo!..Friday morning I sent a whatsapp to a friend moaning about how I only got home at midnight after picking my father up from the airport. He replied with how 5 of our friends got into an accident at around 1am Friday morning. One of my friends died another broke his hip another ones right face got torn off and he lost his ear the other broke most of his ribs damaged his heart and is still in a medically induced coma in intensive care the last was mostly unharmed...Driving drunk is fucking horrible everyone knows that a lot of people have done it nonetheless including me I have only been in a small accident luckily (years ago I don't drive drunk since). My friends made a mistake and now 1 is dead and everyone especially the one driving is going to have his life changed forever when/if he wakes up...Drinking is stupid and I lost a friend maybe two because of it. I drank a little this weekend but mostly smoked a little weed...[Here](https://www.arrivealive.co.za/news.aspx?s=1&i=17829&page=Centurion-rollover-crash-leaves-four-people-injured) is a report of the incident he didn't die on-scene and the articles don't get updated..

Oh man... I'm sorry for your loss...Driving drunk is the worst - I usually avoided it but there were moments over the years where things could have gotten pretty grim. I've also lost a friend to driving after drinking and it *still* haunts me - not that I could have done anything to prevent it but I miss my friend (RIP RM).
Why on earth would you drink as a response to 5 of your friends being hurt in an alcohol related incident?!.
That's horrible.  I'm sorry for your loss...I think the best way you can pay tribute to your friends is by making an effort to keep alcohol out of your life.
Man I am sorry to hear all that.  But it makes me realize how lucky I've been in not killing myself or others when I would drive drunk.  What do they say?  God protects fools and idiots?  Sometimes I guess.
