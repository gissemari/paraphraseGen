Went to dinner last night with the wife and another couple. Perfect weather to be outside in Austin this time of year. They were drinking wine which I politely refused. No big deal..Towards the end of the night a random guy stopped by our table and gave us a bomber of sour beer. It was a byob restaurant and he was leaving..I broke down and split the bomber with the other guy. .It wasn't exactly a 'relapse' because it was just one beer but I do feel like I have to get this off my chest at SD. New Year's Eve night I blacked out and returned to my in-laws. I still don't know everything I did but they were PISSED. .I don't want alcohol to creep back into my life!!!

The good news is that you're here now and I can tell that you absolutely do not want to go backwards.  Forward march.  : )
Yeah. I'm super worried about the social aspect of not drinking as well. At least you didn't let that drink lead to many more! ..
Yea the social aspect is hard. ... I guess I need to do some thinking about my triggers. ... I was a homebrewer and looooooved specialty beer. No excuses but that is my blind spot
