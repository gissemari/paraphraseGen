About 3 weeks ago I relapsed after 67 days.  This is what I've learned.  All those shitty things  that made me give up drinking in the first place?  Came flooding back.  What a shock!! All those good habits I formed?  Poof in a flash.  The weight I finally started to take off?? Nothing a couple of weeks of eating crap food can't handle.  Weight came right back on.  Not remembering conversations with my children or promises that I made to them?  Yup SOP.  Working out and feeling good about myself?  Who wants to run when you're hungover?? I could go on and on.  I won't.  In a nutshell I'm back.  For me?  I am much happier with a sober life.  That being said I'm not going to do the badge thing.  I started to focus more on the number of days as opposed to my sobriety.  But that's just me.   IWNDWYT.
