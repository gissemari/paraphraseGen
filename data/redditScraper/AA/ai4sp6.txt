I drank heavily for a few days (relapse after three months) and stopped last night around 7 pm ET. Had a rough night with withdrawals  but got over it today as the day went on. I thought it was just a hangover I've been sick too. I'm not sure if the withdrawals are coming back or I'm just feverish. ..I understand this isn't a place for medical advice I'm just starting to get kind of worried. I've never had it feel like they've come back. I've read DTs don't usually start for a day or two after you stop drinking.
