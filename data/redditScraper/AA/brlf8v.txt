So I have been trying to get sober for over a year now.  When I first started I had a lot of support and did very well while working an honest program.  Since then I have relapsed and after my sponsor relapsed I lost all faith in the program and started trying to work my program.  I think we all know that working your own program does not work.  I have allowed myself to slip through the cracks for to long but have been to afraid since I have lost insurance to allow myself to detox on my own.  I tried last night and i was miserable.  I am now awaiting insurance just trying to maintain so that I can get into the program I know that will work for me.  My girlfriend who has gone through this experience with me has been supportive but has also been the one to lead me to several devastating days of helplessness.  She does attend al anon as well as several other meetings.  She did tell me today though that at the beginning when I did so well she used to snoop through my journal.  I feel like she has used my past thoughts and transgressions against me and refuses to accept responsibility for that.  The problem is that I do care for her deeply and I know through my addiction I have caused her pain but I feel as if she has used my past to create unnecessary pain in my life which is why I have had trouble getting through my relapses.  I feel it is a toxic relationship but yet she is the only one who attends meetings to try.  Is she just using meetings against me and hindering my recovery?  Is our relationship to toxic to ever overcome?  I don't know what to do besides get back to a good program and try to progress without her knowing I will think of her throughout.  I am so confused on what to do when I have that love in my life yet I know it is not what I need right now.  Please help!!!

Hang in there.  Try again.   Keep looking for a detox.  If I can do it you can too...Page 98 of our Big Book talks about  wife or no wife'....we don't get sober unless we place our reliance on God...I've found if I can put the drink down and focus on recovery then the right people show up in my life.
You have to do it for yourself.
