I hope it's okay for me to post this here and if not can someone please be kind and point me in the right direction?..My mom has relapsed as mentioned in the title of this post. My sister's and I suspected she might be drinking again around 3 months ago. We finally have proof after my sister snooped and found her stash hidden in her closet. As if her breath and strange behavior wasn't a major giveaway but we wanted to be absolutely sure. We want to confront her that we know she is drinking again. But we don't want the rest of our family to find out. Especially my grandmother because she will make things very dramatic upsetting and worse than they already are. My two sister's and I wanted to try a different approach than last time. We want to let her know we love her we are here for her we support her and want her to get help. We fully expect her to deny lie lash out and get angry with us even though we plan to do this as calmly and supportive as possible. We are unsure if this is the right way to go about this. Anyone here have some tips or advice? Is there a certain way this should be done? ..We need to do something fast because her life is in danger and so are others today my sister saw that her front license plate was hanging halfway off and realized mom must be driving drunk. I entertained the thought of turning her into the police but I'm not sure if they can do anything unless they catch her in the act and I'm not sure if that's the right way to handle things.
