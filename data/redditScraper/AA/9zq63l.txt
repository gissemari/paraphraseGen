I know for sure I'll relapse at one point or another but it's not about perfection nothing is. I knew I had to do something remarkable unforgettable the big step forward the small step in the direction of better life so I did it and now I'll carry this community with me until my flesh gets fdup. ...It might be stupid and pointless but I really want to remember the first day I saw this set of letters and felt understood empowered and inspired. You guys form one of the most welcoming loving community I've ever came across and although I wish nobody needed to be here I'm glad that I am. I'm on my way. I might not be healthy but I'm healing. And I have to thank all of you for that. ..

And you're part of the community too.
I feel like at almost three year sober I should know what this means but I am drawing a blank?? ..And congrats on starting this journey! If you need support I'm here just PM me! 
I think that is a fabulous idea. So glad you are sharing this journey. I will not drink with you today.
