Happy for you dude. Your own will power has helped you  beat addiction.  I genuinely wish you the best but.......this is a subreddit dedicated to people sharing their experience around Alcoholics Anonymous. I read these posts to gain insight and perspective on the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and your video contains no relation to the program. Sorry to be the  bad guy - you gave a great message but an AA subreddit isn't the place to post it. I don't speak for all the members here I speak solely for myself. Regardless buddy keep on truckin' a day at a time   
Great message! I can relate to a lot of it. Thank you.
A quick Reddit search of this user will show he spent the better part of today flooding all recovery related subreddits with this very same video. Canvassing? Asking everyone to subscribe? This is Reddit man. Not YouTube. I think he means well. But the basic message  Just quit using  is unrelatable and inaccessible to most. ..Again OP best of luck with your abstinence and motivational speaking career. 
Take this down man... doesn't belong here. Doesn't belong anywhere really as it's got zero point at all. Pretty ridiculous waste of time really.
