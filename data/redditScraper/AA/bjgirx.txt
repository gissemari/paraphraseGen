I've had much longer sobriety but this was the hardest to get. .Side question - does anyone have advice on resources /books (other than the big book and 12x12) that have helped you with the first step? ..My sponsor and I are using a workbook that uses the big book as a basis but I am still (somehow) struggling with the first step and acceptance.

Living sober has saved my life.
The book suggests trying some controlled drinking. I'm afraid to try that.
I think the 12X12 does a really good of summarizing First Step. Short sweet and to the point...That said I found it helpful to do what I refer to as a 'First Step Inventory'. Essentially you sit down and write out in all the ways you're powerless over alcohol and your life has become unmanageable and then share that with your sponsor. ..Unlike the Fourth Step Inventory you don't dive into any resentments fears or sexual misconduct inventories as outlined in the book. Just put pen to paper and be honest with yourself about all the ways you're life has become unmanageable (if you feel it has) and examples of being powerless over alcohol. I had a long list. Then read through and talk about it with your sponsor. Once you have to say all that shit out loud a lot of it starts to have a lot more impact and starts to sink in. H.O.W. (Honest Open Willing); that's the HOW of the program ..But that's just my two cents...Best wishes! Keep up the good work!
