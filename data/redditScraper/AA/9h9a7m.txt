I really like listening to people's stories you know it gives me some insight into the dudes but there are a ton of people in my meetings (probably close to 60+ got 30+ numbers on a sheet my first day which was awesome) but I know choosing a sponsor is important but I barely know anyone well enough to choose. ..The one guy I kind of wanted as a sponsor I guess isn't eligible turns out he had a relapse after 30 years a few weeks ago. He's the guy I've been probably enjoying talking to most at the two meetings and he is retired so I can call him in the AM which is usually when I'm most likely to drink.

I just got a bunch of peoples numbers and started talking to them. Just picked someone and worked the steps with them. I got a new sponsor after a year. You don't have to have one sponsor really. It's not like a popularity contest. It's your program. Just pick someone and work through the steps. You can always pick someone else. I have 3-4  sponsors  and like 15 other people I keep tabs on. 
Maybe ask that guy who he might recommend. I picked someone at 8 days. I just knew I had to get going or I was gonna bail.
Listen at meetings. When you hear someone that speaks a few times that you can relate with and they seem like they are working a good program have worked the steps from the book hopefully traditions too) and they themselves are sponsored go for it and ask them. ..Something to keep in mind is that you are looking for someone to take you through the steps and can help you incorporate the solution found in the big book into your daily life. You aren't looking for a therapist life coach or even a friend. If they turn into a friend all the better though. Try not to over-complicate it as many folks do.
