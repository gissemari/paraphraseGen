37M been struggling for about 17 years. I am not religious. I don't believe in it. Was trying to find some support at a local meeting but found the content was just not for me. Are there any other resources available to people who don't follow a religion or believe in god?

Yeah humility is a great resource. Higher power doesn't imply God it implies a power greater than yourself. AA can be your higher power. A door knob can be your higher power. It's about the fact that if I could solve my drinking issues on my own I wouldn't have a problem. But I have a problem therefore I can't solve it on my own. Give it another chance if you want too! If you don't want to that's cool too. You always be welcomed back. 
Some regions have AA meetings that are oriented to folks who prefer a more secular format and topics. https://aabeyondbelief.org/..There are non-AA secular recovery groups like SOS (secular organization for sobriety) Lifering SMART recovery and others. Again I don't know what's available in your area. No recovery organization for alcohol is as universally available as AA. ..Some meetings might be around you that have less of a prayer/God orientation than the one you attended but I don't know that to be true.
There are secular AA meetings. Look for them in your area. 
Of course anyone is welcome to either attend or not attend any AA meeting for whatever meeting whether it be for perceived  religious content  bad coffee no decaf coffee or tea as well as the extensive use of profanity at meetings. ..There are many secular alternatives to attending AA meetings. Rational Recovery SMART Secular Sobriety and more. There is https://aaagnostica.org/ and https://aabeyondbelief.org/ as well as others. There are atheist/agnostic meetings Freethinkers groups and other meetings/groups whose  flavor  is more secular. ..To brand all of AA as having  religious content  is like saying I don't like vanilla ice cream so therefore will no longer eat any ice cream rather than explore other available flavors. I've been to meetings with a christian outlook secular outlook Wiccan outlook feminist outlook and Native American outlook. I've been to meetings that only spoke Spanish but I looked for local English speaking meetings. ..Just because I don't buy into organized religion or religious fundamentalism doesn't mean I become so biased and intolerant that I would leave AA. I have learned from people with various beliefs and no beliefs at all. I believe totally in both freedom of religion and freedom from religion. I abhor intolerance on all levels and found any incidences of intolerance bias and bigotry have no place in my life both inside and outside the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
I struggled for almost 15 years before I realized the problem wasn't the things in the world around me that bothered me...the problem was me and my perception. I have started to find relief in just letting go. I have to look for similarities and not differences. I didn't like the whole god thing and seemingly religiousness of AA and I kept drinking again. If only the world worked how I wanted it to!
Thank you for the alternatives. It does matter enough to me to leave. 
Where is your rock-bottom?   If they said the Cookie Monster would get me sober I'd give it a go I was that desperate...Give it another go listen to the similarities and you'll find the right people. 
Would you sit in church and listen to sermons all night for free booze? 
INo one says you need to believe in anything. Keep in mind people share their experience of what worked for them. If the HP thing worked for them that's what they share. If you think you can do it another way do that. If it doesn't work out your way there's always ours. 
We do the "Lord's Prayer" at the end of most of my meetings but I haven't seen or heard of anyone giving a fuck if someone opts out of it. Other than that and the mention of God/HP in the steps I don't think I hear anything *religious*. Sometimes a person will say something about their god but almost always it's prefaced or followed with the general "you believe what you want and what works for you." I heard a friend once explain he uses the word "god" because he's lazy and it's a fairly universal/generic term like "bed." If I say I'm going home and getting in bed even though you haven't seen my bed you know what I'm getting at because you comprehend the idea of "bed" without getting bogged down with the specifics. That's helped me. If on the other hand someone was yapping about Jesus being the true whatever or Allah (blessings be upon him and all that) I'm done listening to that person. I'm not signing up for that religious garbage. I'm not condemning anyone's beliefs either...I've heard many times that "a doorknob can be your higher power" and that line is pretty lame imo. But using the IRS as your higher power or gravity or Disney whatever... any of that can work I should think...And you don't have to be a hardcore believer of an HP from jump street. Just be *willing* to believe and at some point that *might* change.
Thanks for all the replies and thoughts.... It feels good just reading the posts on here and hearing some of the success stories...  today is day 3 for me. Good luck everyone.
SMART Recovery is a high quality alternative. I hear great things about LifeRing but I've never been. These may be defunct or paid but I've heard of SOS and Rational Recovery as secular alternatives to AA. People in my area rave about Refuge Recovery which is Buddhist and thus caters to nontheistic spirituality if that interests you...I know AA is not the easiest program to adapt to atheism/secularism but it can be done. If you want to give it another shot someday here are resources for nontheists and secular folks in AA:..[https://aaagnostica.org](https://aaagnostica.org) ..[Secular meeting directory - cross reference with local schedule as it's not always up-to-date](https://secularaa.org) ..[https://aabeyondbelief.org](https://aabeyondbelief.org) ..
See the sidebar of /r/alcoholism for a list of resources. 
After my first AA meeting I went home and told my husband "I knew there would be some God but not that much God!" I kept going back for a little while but eventually couldn't take it anymore. I was already angry at everything and AA's constance religious overtones weren't helping. After I got sober with another method I went back to AA and the God stuff didn't bother me like it did before so I've been going to meetings regularly ever since to help maintain my sobriety. 
Just like people are allowed to not be religious people are also allowed to be religious. All are welcome.
They are certainly available in some States and I suggest you try any that are within reasonable driving distance. ..See if what you find there demonstrates the kinds of results you're hoping to realize for yourself. 
To be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives to face.

SMART Recovery. It's a more positivity based program overall. Very little "I was so insane but now I am saved!!!" stuff. No adults reading aloud to each other from an old self-help book no group prayers...Not as many meetings though the meetings in my area have been growing.
Yeah. AA is not about God but about finding a higher power than yourself. We're all agnostics to various degrees. There are not only tons of atheist and agnostic specific meetings but also literature about it.
