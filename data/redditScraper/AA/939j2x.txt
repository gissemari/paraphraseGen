Is the coin historically significant in the history of AA ?
I don't know of any groups who carry on the tradition but I've met several AA members around the country who carry their own. This is a photo of my coin and the pic was taken outside of Philadelphia PA. My sponsor also had a similar coin &amp; it went to other sponsees after he passed. 
Glad you posted the pic hadn't seen one of these before. Knowing me I'd put off getting the holes drilled 'till half the year was gone. The locale I've landed does trinkets but where I sobered up didn't and doesn't so the coins come home with me and get tossed in a drawer. When they start to pile up I donate them. I do enjoy the BD cheesecake that accompanies the trinkets.
why is that the definition of insanity though? 
Relapse is not necessary but it happens to the best of us.  AA Beyond Belief has an article about a treatment that when combined with the 12 steps could make relapse a thing of the past...

I remember my first meeting. They said I never had to drink again and I never have. I really have to admire the ones who relapse and keep trying over and over. I can see how bad they want sobriety and how hard they work.
I've never repeated an anniversary from 30 days on up.  Before getting a sponsor and working the steps I couldn't go a week without doing some mind altering substance.  After getting a sponsor and starting on the the steps (which I continue to do) I haven't drank or done any mind altering substances.  ..Did I count the holes right in that you have 44 years sober?  
Unfortunately a friend who drills the holes accidentally did one extra. I'm not using the coin until May 2019 just to be honest
The same anniversaries over and over? I'm curious but I'm not sure what you mean...By the way what are all those holes drilled into the coin supposed to represent?
Doesn't the Basic Text state something about how many thousands of men and women who have recovered from alcoholism?..I consider myself a recovered alcoholic as did my sponsor. Over the years I've met many long-term members (sobriety dates ranging from 1938 through 1950) who introduced themselves as recovered. I was once at Stepping Stones (Bill &amp; Lois' home) for Lois' only long-timers gathering where people who came into AA before 1950 were invited for the day. When they introduced themselves most said they were recovered &amp; there were over 150 people there...I sometimes question people who say all they have is today but tell the newcomer to stick with the winners. If all any of us have is today aren't all of us winners? .
