Had over a year sober. Relapsed... again. .This is my fifth day 1 in 20 years. ..It happened super fast. Luckily my SO sensed something was wrong and was able to snap me out of my spiral before it really started. ..Just a scary reminder to be mindful of my addiction and all that comes with that. Feeling pretty humbled and kinda sad but trying to mentally prepare for a new part of my journey.

Do you have a sponsor?  Are you working the steps?
This last Monday was my 43rd day 1 since 2014. But I'm trying one more time. Long as we dont give up we have a chance. We can do this. :D 
This is my experience and that of many members I've observed. We're willing to do just so much that allows us to get just so far then we up our involvement and level of inconvenience to get further. Adjusting further as is indicated by relapsing until we reach the level that works well for us one usually far more demanding that we'd have preferred...Maybe skip the gradations and do all the stuff this time around? Or next time your call.
