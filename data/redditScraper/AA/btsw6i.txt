Today is day 83 of sobriety for me and I've lost nearly 35 lbs in that time. I havent adjusted my eating at all (it's actually worse) but yet I'm shedding so much that I've lost a pants size and may have to punch a hole in my belt soon because im on the first one. ..I've always struggled with my weight because I was a **HEAVY** beer drinker so this is extremely satisfying for me and inspiring to keep going.

Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
Yay on 83 days!!!!!!
I lost 35 lbs.  Then I found out about ice cream. Gained 10lbs back fast.
Great work! Congratulations...
