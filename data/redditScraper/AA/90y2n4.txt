Hard relapse yesterday after a couple of weeks. Feeling sick overwhelmed and desperately anxious. Just had to get it there here. Could use any supportive thoughts. Thank you.

How were those couple of weeks before you drank again? ..Only you can decide if this relapse is just minor or the start of a new shit cycle. As long as this doesn't lead you to getting back in the habit of drinking then it doesn't have to be this awful thing it could just be a reminder that you need to put more effort into stopping. ..Also keep in mind when you haven't been drinking for a while the negative effects of alcohol seem to magnify so the anxiety and all that is heightened compared to when you were normally drinking.
