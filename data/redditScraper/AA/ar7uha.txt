I admitted my addiction 5 months ago. I found Jesus in the bottom of a bottle. here I am drinking writing my experiences and struggles. I thought I had it beat and I do in a sense I really don't desire alcohol and my Lord has kept me from really going back to where I was. ..From my first sip the allergy starts the comfort is overwhelming. Only the true addict understands this feeling the feeling that everything in life has diminished. You drift into your own reality your dimension and your God. The cunning power of the devil in the form of ethanol has consumed your soul and you drift away from our God the only God I'm not here to debate divinity it's what you believe don't let outside pressure make you believe something. It's believing in a higher power other than yourself. When I drink I am my own God and I rule. Alcohol is the devil is plain sight it's everywhere and it's legal but I bet you didn't know it's the most addictive substance on our planet. I've heard friends and others say no heroine and meth is worst and I say no because before all that is alcohol. Alcohol opens the gate to that other stuff it makes you say screw it. I guarantee unless your a very special case but I doubt you went straight to heroin before ever drinking. I firmly believe there are some who can drink responsibly but what that person doesn't know is there is an underlying addiction they haven't found whether it's meth opiates nicotine ethanol or other. Everyone on this earth has an addiction I know that because I prayed so hard one night and the good Lord came to me before I was about to shoot myself in the face with a shotgun.  Everyone struggles I put lust in every soul  that's the words I was told and it's was magical majestic and unbelievable I just heard words spoken from heaven itself. I don't care if you don't believe me because i know what i heard during my prayer was real. Our God put a struggle in all our lives and until you conquer it your living as a slave to it.

I think it is wonderful that you found a god of your understanding. ..You stated you didn't want to debate divinity. I've found that most religious fundamentalists regardless of their denomination sect or cult affiliation believe their way their god or their interpretation of that divinity is the only way leaving no room for choice or as many profess free will. ..You post keeps mentioning  Our God.  What if your interpretation understanding isn't the same as mine? Does  Our God  make my understanding invalid? ..AA's Preamble states that AA is not allied with ANY sect denomination politics organization or institution. Everyone is free to determine their own conception of a power greater than themselves. Atheists agnostics Freethinkers Secular Humanists Buddhists Christians Jews and even Wiccans have valid concepts and certainly most of those don't believe in your specific concept of  Our God  and are not part of that OUR exclusion...I too don't want to debate divinity but  religion  has no place in AA. Everyone regardless of their concept/understanding belief or non-belief has a VALID and EQUAL place in Alcoholics Anonymous and most don't belong to your  Our  group.
