Congratulations man. Hoping to be where you are soon
Congratulations! 
What are your tips? I want to be sober but keep finding easy reasons not to be 
Hiya congrat! Six months as you know is a huge milestone! ..I too had a number of attempts before I finally got to six. But once I hit six months I really started to get it. Plus I really started to like being in recovery. I had my schedule ironed out I had weekend plans that were cool and I started to have people to hang with...Congrats again! Keep up the great work.
Wonderful! Keep up the hard work.
