Hello everyone!  I am happy to say I am a newcomer and that I am two weeks sober from alcohol I am struggling to stop smoking marijuana but I am willing to stop  I was just wondering and questioning can I really even say I'm sober if I haven't stopped smoking weed  ? Or is it different can I have two dates of sobriety? One for smoking and drinking ?

I wouldn't consider myself sober if I was smoking weed. ..Sobriety dates are sobriety dates. We have one.
Yes that's the answer I was looking for  yesterday was my last day smoking marijuana I would be happy to start over again   as I said I am a newcomer like I'm very brand new to the NA/AA world  I just started going to meetings with my mother as a support for her  but during my time at the meetings I realized I want to get myself on the right track as well  and I don't want to make anyone mad by trying to have two dates and I'd rather not say I have two and I do not have a sponsor only because I want to try it out on my own  I know they say not to when you are in the early stage but it's my first time n I feel strongly that I can stop my urges n move on with my days and I haven't made a move on the steps yet  but I am accepting on everything I'm trying to do and about to do . But I also woul like advice and encouragement from those who have been in recovery for awhile  so please give me all the advice you can
Hello and kudos for two weeks of sobriety!   ..See /r/leaves for help with weed.
Stoned is not sober.
