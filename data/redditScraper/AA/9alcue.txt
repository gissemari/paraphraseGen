I know a lot of people that struggle with alcoholism claim to get great results from these but personally I remain skeptical. Just wondering if anyone has any personal experiences (pro or con) with trying either of these. ..Also curious of this is something the AA community would even be accepting of so interested in that aspect of your experiences as well...Thanks.

I remember the day my doctor told me that I was self medicating with alcohol. I had never heard of such a thing. I've worked hard in my recovery and gotten closer to my true self. I have no desire to alter my sober outlook with more self medicating. 
I took CBD oil in early sobriety to calm my anxiety. It worked. But I couldn't afford it so I don't take it anymore also my anxiety got better.  My doctor recommended cbd oil. I no longer take it though. I have 9 months sober.
