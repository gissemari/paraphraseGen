Hey I'm nit sure if this would be more appropriate in Al Anon or not but here it goes:..I'm an alcoholic. I have 12 days sober. Its my first attempt. I've been going to meetings got a sponsor and it's going pretty well. Im definitely giving it everything I've got. Ifeel better I have hope that my life is going to be better. ..Here is the rub my SO is also an alcoholic. He's actually the one who got me into meetings and without seeing him relapse I don't know if I ever would have made it to step one myself. The one thing I worry about it trust. Even as an alcoholic I may have liked to my parents friends and definitely myself but never to him. I know he'd never cheat on me or lie about anything else and he knows that if he relapses it's important to me that he tells me. I just worry that he'll start drinking again and not tell me because he doesn't want to derail my recovery. ..Any experience dealing with that worry? I'm trying to give it up to my higher power but I'm struggling with it.

I have experience with that worry. ..I have a year sober and my wife and I used to be great drinking buddies. Our honeymoon was basically getting shitty through Europe together. ..When I started getting sober I didn't think anything would have to change between us I just thought it was my thing. ..Pretty quickly her drinking started jumping out at me and I started noticing the ways she would try to draw me back in. I also started noticing how alcoholics drain the people around them. I constantly had to be involved in self inflicted emergencies. ..I had to set out some boundaries. We have a small child so I didn't just run even though I wanted to. Everyone in program said to wait. ..Fast forward and I can honestly say the truth is you cannot get more than one person sober. And it only works on yourself. Talking to her about her drinking helped me stay sober because it reminds me how badly you can lie to yourself justify blame others etc... ..We are separated now and I miss her but I cannot be with her while she is drinking And she doesn't think she is an alcoholic and I am powerless to convince her otherwise. ..
I had to realize that I'm powerless over alcohol; that means in me as well as in others.  I can't keep anyone sober and I can't get them drunk...I'd suggest staying the course getting a sponsor working the steps and focus on your sobriety.  Step 4 has a whole section on fear and teaches us how to deal with them.  I'd like to say you do Step 4 on fear once and it's gone forever.  That hasn't been the case for me but by doing that I am outgrowing my fears and by repeated actions I continue to grow.
