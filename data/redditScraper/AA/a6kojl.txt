I had 18 months sober in August and let some poor decisions lead to a relapse three days later.  This sadly went on until this week. I finally admitted to family and friends I relapsed and I went to a women's AA meeting today picked up my 24 hour chip and shared. I realized after moving divorce starting dating (that's been tough) I got complacent and stopped using the tools I learned. I stopped reaching out to friends and working with a sponsor. I am reminded now that I can't do this on my own this disease is just too powerful. ..I don't see me as starting over rather it's a new phase. I really am very appreciative of the AA community and so glad I went to a meeting as I know what I need to do moving forward.
