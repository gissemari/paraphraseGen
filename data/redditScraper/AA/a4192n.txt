Day 5. I've relapsed many times in the past 3 years but I'm not going to today. I've been living in rock bottom for a while and I'm gonna get out of this. Even if failure occurs I'm going to keep coming back. To those who fail keep coming back. Why give up. I wish everyone on here a good day. We can do it together

Whenever my sponsor hears that he says we'll see.  I understand why.  I'm an alcoholic of the type described in the big book. That means I've lost the choice in whether or not I drink. Whether or not I drink is not up to me but if I do the work I get one of the step 10 promises; the problem has been removed.  But all I get is a daily reprieve. 
Do you have a sponsor? During those times you attempted to get sober did you start working the steps attended 90 in 90? Did you get numbers from members in the room and called them when the urge to drink appeared? ? did you change people places and things? This journey in sobriety is one day at a time but it takes daily action....I am a retread I know what it feels like to bounce in and out of the rooms after 8 years of sobriety and what I've learnt is that my life is better when I am sober than when I am not....As a good alcoholic who is defiant I don't like to take direction from anyone but that led me to a life of misery and despair. Today I am more willing to take direction for I know what the results are. Happy joyous and free... keep coming back!
