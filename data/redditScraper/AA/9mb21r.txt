I'm new to this community. I've gone to a meeting before b/c my drinking has scared me &amp; the people I love. ..Tl:DR: young adult w/ some alcoholic fam looking for ways to cope when it seems like ppl my age only want to drink. ..I want to be better about it. ..There is a history of alcoholism in my family on my dads side. And that behavior flared up indefinitely when my dad was killed in 9/11. He worked on the 101st floor I was 7 years old when I lost him. ..It's that side of the family that has alcoholics and I can't blame them. ..I see those tendencies in my drinking. I don't want to drink like that. I don't want to be scared of drinking. ..I'm 25 and that hard drinking culture is everywhere I turn. It's all my friends still reaching for college glory but now they can afford it. ..It's so much to take in &amp; given my family history I'm scared to engage in that sort of culture. ..I'm so scared that I'll wind up like my uncles who drink now. Because they find that easier than coping ..That was some venting but I guess I'm asking: when everything seems like it's going to shit. How do you stay positive?...It's so hard

I got sober when I was 22. It is possible to have a social life in your twenties and stay sober! However you need to make an effort to find sober friends clubs activities etc. ..I stay positive by attending AA meetings regularly and trying my best to practice gratitude. What are 3 things you're grateful for today?
