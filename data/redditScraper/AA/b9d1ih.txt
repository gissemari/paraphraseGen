Hi all. Recently found this sub and really enjoying it. I am after some advice or feedback if possible...After many relapses and attempts at sobriety I went to my first AA meeting on the 22nd March and been 10 times since. Its been the best thing in helping me and very grateful I have found it. At present I do not have a sponsor I am taking my time to ensure I find one I can get along with and feel comfortable with that was also feedback from long standing members of the fellowship. I am also getting a feel for different meetings ones I enjoy more etc as many in my area are different...During my initial 10 days I was feeling positive productive and inspired but the last 4-5 days I have felt exhausted unmotivated and a bit meh. I have no desire to drink and look forward to my newcomer meeting tomorrow. Do you think this is just a case of the "pink cloud" disappearing? I was thinking maybe the 10 meetings in a row were a bit emotionally and mentally overwhelming hence why i havent been for a couple of days. Not sure. Thanks for reading.

Hi imnationx thanks for your post!..My two decades of experience speak to the distinct differentiation between the *program* of Alcoholics Anonymous and the *fellowship* of Alcoholics Anonymous...The program of Alcoholics Anonymous is the 12 Steps found the in the first 164 pages of the book Alcoholics Anonymous (the Big Book) and the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous is meetings and the folks you'll find there etc. The two are not always found together and do not always align...In previous attempts at sobriety through Alcoholics Anonymous I have experienced varying degrees of involvement in both the program and the fellowship. My experience shows that when I was depending mostly on meetings and other fellowship activities (sober bowling sober karaoke or BBQing etc) talking and sharing a lot my internal discomfort - the state that I just naturally eventually default to inside - would become so unbearable I would end up drinking again...My personal experiences drinking showed me that I am the  real alcoholic  on pages 21 &amp; 44 of the Big Book which then lead me to believe the solution outlined in the book would work for me. Once I felt that I had completely accepted the tenets of Step 1 - that I had an abnormal physical reaction to alcohol that made it impossible for me to guarantee how much I would drink once I started; and a mental condition that mean when I tried to stop for good on my own no matter how badly I wanted or needed to I was incapable of doing so - I felt beaten into a state of hopelessness that made me willing to complete the work outlined in the Big Book so I could recover from that state...Finding a person who had not only been in that same place but had recovered from it through the 12 Steps and could take me through that process (a sponsor) was what I needed in order to complete the process...I was a hopeless powerless alcoholic and drug addict who couldn't put together 24 hours of dry time without feeling completely miserable inside and being horrible to everyone around me. I went trough the work recovered and now live to carry that message in everything I do...The design for living the book Alcoholics Anonymous contains will absolutely take you to a place you cannot imagine internally where your external circumstances (booze drugs job spouse shitty drivers taxes whatever) will no longer hold such powerful sway over you...The freedom the Steps offer greatly exceed just being free from the obsession to drink alcohol. The promises of the Steps are about freedom from fear resentment and all other character defects that cut us off from happiness. This is not magical thinking it's just the result of going through that process with a qualified teacher.
Good for you! My advice would be to find a sponsor sooner rather than later. People often approach finding a sponsor like selecting a life mate but in reality it's just a person with more time than you who can help you work the program. Pick someone who has what you want and if it doesn't work out pick another. People often go through multiple sponsors. ..The important thing I think is to start doing step work as soon as you can because that'll keep you engaged and from feeling like you're not getting anywhere.
