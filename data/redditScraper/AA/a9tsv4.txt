Not sorry for formatting am on mobile. ..I have a parent who is in the heavy stages of addiction. I myself have a handful of years in A.A. &amp; try to be the best person I can be in the program &amp; amongst the world itself. ..However I'm furious. This parent is putting the weight of their insidious addiction on my other parent. Not to mention they run a foster house. Not to mention my child stays with them 50-60% of the time. As well too this parent is  bipolar  or whatever. I get it my first 2 1/2 years I tried various meds/doctors for my  head issues  until I realized it made things worse. I currently have found therapy &amp; diet to be most beneficial as well as a better network. Definitely open to meds though. We're supposed to seek outside help when needed. ..My point: How do I deal with this? My parents have the income where one can be away (I will help with foster kids my child) but is there a way where you can be institutionalized against your will? My parent that is struggling with this right now is clearly bonkers. Clearly not deemed sane (I'm not a judge but take my word for it) and by sane I mean they're doing the same thing over and over. Also they're F***ing thwacked out to Pluto. Below is the text I just sent them. I am not avoiding all contact with them. ..~~~You need to quit taking whatever you're taking. Things are going to get worse than last time &amp; three things are going to happen 100%. Jail. Hospitalization. Death. Keep gambling &amp; you'll see. Sorry to say...Lastly anyone from St. Louis on here? Thx. ..Long story short: parent is now the full blown addict whyyyyy.

I think it's important to remember that forcing our will often does not have the desired result. I can tell you that the forced institutionalization band aid never led to prolonged sobriety for me...The only thing that led me to sobriety was continued suffering until it was bad enough that I was willing to do anything to stop. ..I have a problem where I think I have every answer to every problem that anyone might have. I know what's it's like to find something that works and then decide that everyone needs to be ready to accept it when I jam it into their faces as a solution to their problems. Someone who isn't ready to accept the solution just isn't ready and we can't change that...You should consider checking out alanon or naranon for the family of alcoholics and addicts.
