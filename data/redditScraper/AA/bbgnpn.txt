I am 49 days sober 28 of which was spent in rehab. One person I came very close to in those 28 days started going to AA with me when I got out she was my inspiration. She worked so hard for her recovery and was almost 3 months clean from drugs and alcohol. Today 30 minutes before she was supposed to be at my house to go to an AA meeting with me her mom texted me to tell me she overdosed and died. I wanted to so badly stay home drink bury my pain. My disease was trying really hard to make me relapse. I fought it and dragged myself to the meeting. I cannot let this put me back to where I was just need to vent.

Sorry for your loss. I've experienced this myself. It sounds harsh but use it as learning lesson for your program. Where can you tighten your program up. Say some prayers for your friend as well. Stay close to the fellowship and your HP if ya have one.
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
I'm so sorry to hear this.  So hard.  Unfortunately when one goes 30 days without using then when they go back out their tolerance is low and they just don't know.  Or it's fintinal.  This is happening too much in our country.  I'm so sorry.
Sorry for your lose. I am greatly **** sorry for your lose but your inspiration and hope is not lost. Continue to find hope right and courage within.
My heart aches for you.  Please know folks who know what you're going through are out there and thinking of you!
