**Hi everyone! I can't express how excited I am to say I hit ONE YEAR OF SOBRIETY!!! I was blessed that Progress Valley (Bloomington MN) granted me a scholarship for outpatient treatment after the county denied funding after paying for my inpatient treatment. I am raising funds to donate to them to put towards a scholarship for the next woman who struggles to afford treatment. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated. My GoFundMe page is linked below. I am happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Thank you! :D**
