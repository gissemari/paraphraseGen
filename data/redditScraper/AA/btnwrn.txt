My sponsor is overseas and I'm unable to contact her for a few days so I'd like to see what you guys think about this situation. ..One of my sponsees has been a tough case from day one. She requires more attention than all 5 of my other sponsees combined. She stayed sober for 9 months but that 9 months was a long process of constant threats to relapse and not taking suggestion. My usual response to sponsees wanting to drink is to keep it easy and casual. "You can drink whenever you want. At some point you decided that you needed to quit and you had very good reasons. Before you drink do some writing on what it was like before you got into the rooms". I don't pressure or harass sponsees to stay sober and that approach generally works well for their sobriety and my sanity. ..For this gal it was clear that she wanted a more frantic response from me. We talked about it several times and I made it clear that I cannot keep her sober. I can take her through the steps and offer suggestions based on how I stay sober day to day. I am not qualified to be a therapist or doctor and I'm not her mom or bff. I do my best to answer the phone when she calls but I can't always pick up or call back right away (she has a habit of calling at 3 or 4am). She doesn't like this answer but I haven't let that get in the way of doing the work and making myself available. ..It's no surprise to me that she drank. Her attitude and willingness were lacking from the beginning (she's on a nudge from the judge). She texted me at 2am to tell me that she drank and I called her back when I woke up at 8 and I havent heard from her. ..There's also an issue with infatuation. She has told me before that she's "in love" with me and does things like follow all my friends on social media hang out outside my work and follow me to social events. This has been a constant balancing act for me. She is welcome to hang out with me and my sober friends but I have also encouraged her to make her own friends  which she has not done. ..I am tempted to fire myself as her sponsor and suggest she find someone she will listen to. In the past when she has expressed that she wants me to spend time with her every day and answer her calls at all hours I reminded her that there are women in the program who can do that for her but because I work full time and have several other sponsees I cannot offer her that level of attention. Clearly that doesnt work for her. ...I've never fired a sponsee and I feel weird about even considering it but I cant help but think that she would be better off with a different method and I could be spending my time with someone who actually wants it. ...Anyone have experience with this?

I don't have any direct experience with a situation like this however I would like to offer feedback based on your description. I think your sponsee's relapse was:..A. Inevitable regardless of you or anybody else.B. An opportunity for you..You have busted your ass with this person. I would use this relapse to tell her that this relationship isn't working for either of you. I would use her relapse as an example to find another person that MAY better fit her needs. Honestly I'm sure she will find that because she doesn't sound mature enough to be responsible for her own recovery. At the end of the day you can't make decisions for her and it is very unfair that you are feeling the emotional weight of her poor decisions. Everybody struggles but she also has to be able to walk her own path out of it with guidance. She doesn't appear to be ready to do that...I think that is amazing you have 5 sponsees that is a lot and you are really helping people find their own way through this. Take care of yourself.
