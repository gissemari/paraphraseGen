I have been struggling to get sober and I really need too. I feel like I'm slowing marching toward no turning back with my life being in shambles forever. When is enough enough. I don't  have much of an income with 3 dependents to support. I know I can change but not sure it's possible in my present circumstances. We are all safe I'm just struggling. Am I trying to blame my non sobriety on my circumstances? How do people go to meetings with dependents?

In my town the people without someone to watch their kids bring them to meetings. They do their thing on the side and the rest of us go about our business and go home. It's pretty much a non-issue from what I can tell.
The good news is when you stop it will seem like you got a 30% raise. About half the evening meetings here have kids playing in the back room. When they're around the adults try to keep their language less colorful. 
Great Advice Below  hang in their mate the Member's will Welcome you however you get there 
My kids helped motivate me to get well. They deserved a sober Mom. 
Good advice above. Just want to add that I started leaving mine at home alone more often too. My daughter is 12 and I really didn't want to at first (esp at night) but it has been fine and I'm a better Mom for it.
i used antabuse to take the decision to drink away from me. made quiting easier and all the sudden i had more money. you might want to check it out. medical doctors prescribe it. wikipedia has an entry. .
If u are looking to get sober the people in AA will do their best to help you. The first step is to self yourself and get to a meeting. U can go to AA.org and find one close to you. Best of luck
We can help you find a meeting if you're not sure where to go. That's the first step. Then when there ask for support re: your kids.
