Currently I am wishing I could get to a meeting but there are none I can walk to and the bus doesn't run today. I have no money for a bike and my efforts at hustling for any type of transport have failed...People here have not been very willing to give rides. I have heard several times "we are not a taxi service."..I have stopped asking for rides because hearing this makes me so sad and angry. It feels like many are intent on me struggling and suffering for my sobriety because they had to...I abhor this type of reasoning. I gave up every enabler in my life. And those are the only people I had. I have nothing but this phone a carryon full of my mom's clothes and a hostel for one more night...I am really disappointed in the fellowship right now but I know what I am dealing with are personalities and not principles. ..I know somewhere there is a home group a sponsor and hundreds of friends waiting to help me because they know that helping me helps them and it is their responsibility...I am going to keep praying meditating journaling and reading the literature. I will not give up. AA is my last stop and you assholes are going to take me in whether you like it or not...I may have to check into the psych ward tonight or tomorrow but I will not pick up and I will not quit. ..30 days and counting.

Call the central service office for your county and they should be able to coordinate someone to pick you up for at least your first meeting or two (maybe more).
I am sorry you are struggling to get to meetings.  I am hesitant to drive people now because I have been put in unsafe situations the two times I have done it.  Perhaps that is why people aren't as willing?  I hope it gets easier as people get to know you better.  I wish you luck!
