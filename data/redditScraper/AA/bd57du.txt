My partner is sick. He has six years more time in AA and time without a drink than me but he is still very sick. I'm finding it is effecting the household and I'm having to take myself away from him and the flat we share more and more often. When I can't I'm normally on my phone just as a distraction. I can't be the one to help him even when I offer support he knocks it down. He has a sponsor goes to meetings and is doing the steps but the sickness in the house is still strong enough to effect me..I have a strong daily programme AA friends a sponsor I work the steps and I get to meetings. By all accounts I'm firmly in the road to recovery (and even that is a cause of jealousy for him). .But this is a real hurdle and it's one I'm struggling with. Should I talk to him about it? Moving out/ breaking up is a huge and dramatic leap that I think would be too drastic to do. I suppose I'm more interested in seeing if people have gone through this situation before and could give any advice/ assistance..Thanks and God bless.

Consider checking out some AlAnon meetings. There are lots of dual AA/AlAnon members and with good reason- it is a family disease after all. Lots of us grew up with alcoholic parents and/or ended up in relationships with fellow alcoholics or have kids who end up struggling with alcoholism...My former partner and I were both in recovery when we met. He started using again and my recovery was admittedly weak at the time so I handled it really badly. I put up a lot of resistance but eventually took the advice that was given to me and went to AlAnon. It really helped me to understand how to set boundaries and focus on my own recovery...Hopefully getting some experience strength and hope from people who have been in your situation can help you decide how to broach this topic with your partner. It's hard to have a conversation like this without it devolving into an argument especially if he is not working a good program but hasn't taken a drink so "but I'm sober" is an easy excuse. Good luck.
