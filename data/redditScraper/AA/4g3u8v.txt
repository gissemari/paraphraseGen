Struggles with major depression/anxiety and drinks until he can't stand daily. Doesn't want to go to treatment. English is not good anyway so he probably wouldn't learn anything. Always blames his wife for everything and says she is the problem. I am recovering addict myself almost two years and I can't get through him.
