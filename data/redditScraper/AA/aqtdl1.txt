Yaknow it's really surreal. One thing that sticks out what was said to me and I remember is  Yo Thesedays you know what you need all you need is some willingness  I'm thinking dude wtf that's all you got for me you know my history of relapses I'm thinking I could have used some better advice. I went home to that soberhouse I was staying in and thought of that a lot more. Willingness...It's been so hard you guys  I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was 4 months clean I had the best reason to drink or use and no one would have said shit I actually was going too but I truly believe god intervened.. I won't get into that. ..My mom was in the program for years now the 1 year coin is going to be our coin.She said to me I may not get to have the grandchild I always wanted or see you on your wedding day but I got to see you happy and sober and that's all I ever wanted for you. ..Anyone new you know all you need is some willingness. I just can't believe it I was that guy who never thought the obsession could be removed I was hopeless. I was a hopeless alcoholic junkie thief. I'm not that same person today but I can turn back to the person just as quick as anyone else. Love you guys! Take this journey with me.
