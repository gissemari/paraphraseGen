I've had issues with alcohol since I was a teen my dad and my maternal grandmother are both alcoholics. ..I used to black out all the time now I don't I just drink at least three times a week...Last night I blacked out though. I drank almost two bottles of wine over the course of 4 hours that I can remember. I'm sure my s.o is upset when I left the house I woke him up to say bye and his first question was if I drank last night. ..He gave me an ultimatum previously(months ago) that I needed to stop drinking if I wanted this relationship to work(he also had problems with alcohol and doesn't drink). I resorted to hiding drinking not because I don't value the relationship but because I couldn't stop...I really do want to stop I love my significant other and want this relationship to continue and I always feel like crap after drinking(does anyone else wake up stupid early every time they drink even a little bit?). It's not good for me and I don't understand why it's so hard to stop I had no problem when I quit smoking...I want to stop I keep telling myself no more and then I go grocery shopping and end up buying wine to  cook  with. ..I just don't know where to go from here. So I'm writing this as a starting point no more buying alcohol no more drinking. ..

If a simple decision was effective there would be no recovery programs. Your problem is larger than is your ability to correct it...it will continue to defeat you eventually as has defeated alcoholics without a sufficient solution to it throughout human history...Find a recovery group with long time sober alcoholics. Do everthing the winners do.
Yes I come to and was very ill. I had no social drinking period. Alcoholic day 1 . Blackouts day 1. Felt like crap day 1...My wife was my motivating factor. ..But I had to do it for me. ..I went through 2 separations in sobriety.  Finally my wife's passing. ..Had I done it for her alone I would have had no reason not to drink in these times when she was out of my life.
