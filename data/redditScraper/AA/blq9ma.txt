Hi..My first time posting here so i hope this is the right place for it...I have a friend who's an addict -- booze and pills -- and she has been trying to get sober for a little under a year. She usually can make it about 30 days before a stressful situation arises and she turns to booze and her life falls apart again--drunk driving arrests getting fired getting into dangerous situations with dangerous people etc. Her life is not easy and I feel so terrible watching her go through it. I want to help but I'm realizing I can't really; she has to overcome this alone. I live hundreds of miles away am an adult and have my own life...For the last few years this friend of mine has established a relationship with me where she texts me constantly all day every day. From the beginning I wasnt a big fan of this level of communication. It's too much for me. If I dont reply she doesn't mind she will just keep messaging me. To clarify we are genuinely good and old friends -- it's not like she is a stalker. All right I thought she is going through a hard time. So I tried my best to be there for her. Always there to absorb her worries and stresses. To listen after a hard day. To try and coach her through an anxiety attack. To help her pick up the pieces after the latest crisis. To tell her her abusive lovers dont deserve her. Her abusive friends are shit heads. Her crazy family is crazy. That I love her...I've been put into this role of therapist or even sort of life partner. Now that she is getting sober she is realizing she cant spend time with most of her old friends because they're all users as well. She has spent her adult life getting loaded and doesn't have other hobbies or interests or communities. I'm it. And it's too much for me to handle. I love her so much but as you can probably tell Im starting to resent her after years of being constantly THERE at literally all hours of the night to assure her comfort her listen to her. I feel like I got sucked into this intense level of commitment without being asked. I'm single and I feel like what is being asked of me by this friendship is like relationship levels of communication. I am frustrated that my own mental health is taking a toll that I lie awake at night worried over someone who I see maybe once a year in real life. Someone who let's me down cause with every relapse I get more frustrated. It feels like none of this is working or helping anyway...She is vocally so grateful for me and also always says she knows what a burden she is. My wonderful amazing friend has made a mess of her life and she doesn't know how to get through the day without me holding her hand via text. But I can't keep doing this. Its not sustainable. Its definitely not a healthy friendship anymore. Its turning into a sort of weird caretaker thing I NEVER wanted and resent so much...I need to set healthy boundaries with my friend but A. I feel terrible taking a step back at such a hard time in her life and B. I dont know how...do I tell her ok you can text me twice a day and thats it?! Sounds so awful...I would appreciate any advice or input or criticism from you guys. I want her to be okay.

AA is for people who want to stop drinking.  We're not good for much else.
Seems to me you might benefit from /r/alanon.
