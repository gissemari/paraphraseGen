No drinks since NYE . I was struggling so hard to not go to the liquor store today. My weekend routine is to get black out drunk on whiskey. I managed to stay sober but i was irritated all weekend and want a drink. My Anxiety is through the roof. My husband is also an alcoholic and refuses to get sober with me. Thinking about doing online meetings..honestly at a loss right now

So sorry you are struggling. It can get better in time. I found that AA meetings helped me a lot. Is there one near you you could go to? Anxiety is tough to deal with. We are here to offer whatever support you need so just ask!
The anxiety is largely a physical reaction. Both from withdrawal and probable dehydration and/or malnourishment. It will ease itself soon enough. Remember to take care of yourself. Eat well and drink tons of water.
I don't know anyone who got sober on online meetings.  I know lots of people who are sober through face to face meetings.  
Getting to a meeting and tell the people there exactly what is going on with you will help.  For your husband r/alanon
