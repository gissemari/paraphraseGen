I started drinking heavily after my fiance of 8 yrs left. Like really really heavily. 4-5 liquor bottles a night. Last night was my 6th month of being sober. I quite stupidly reached out to her today and I almost had a relapse. F*ck I wanted a bottle or 5 so badly. Thanks yall your quiet  unknown support really helped me today

Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
Emotions do tend to come up when we are sober after drowning them so long. What step are you on? Stay strong it will get better if you have a sponsor work the steps go to meetings and help others.
Bravo for 6months /u/epicdanceman!  ..The steps helped me cope with emotions. ..Gratitude bodes well for recovery.
