Right back to it.  Learn from what led to the relapse and come up with a solid plan to use when it happens again.
I'm on the fence about AA but clearly need it I'm hesitant because I'm worried about what people will think and that they hold it at curches
A sponsee came back in with one of the worst black eyes I'd seen. After being sober a bit he decided one drinkie never hurt anyone and went cruising with his older brother. ..He didn't remember what he'd said but came out of the blackout with his brother ramming his head repeatedly into the car bumper...Whatever it was it must have been really offensive.

You are not defined by relapses but by your decision to remain in recovery despite them.
Welcome back! Knock me down 7times I get up 8 right! Get back at it. Glad you made it back!
PLAY THE TAPE THROUGH = always remember that it starts nice with fun and ends with fucking disaster. Next time play it. 
Walking back in the rooms is the best and hardest thing I did. No one treated me with anything but love and compassion. That was quite a few years ago (after several relapses) and I owe those people my life. The fellowship truly did for me what I could not do for myself. .Keep coming back!
