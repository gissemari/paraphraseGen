Today I celebrate my two years dry. I was at a low place two years ago I was using being sick from my family my girl had just left things started slipping away from me. In all honesty I was hoping the bottle would do what I was too weak to do myself I was waiting for it to make the pain stop for it to finally silence my mind. ..But in those darkest depths I found someone I knew I found the man I used to be the man who cared for all the rock for others to lean on. I knew I could be better that I could be that man again. ..I used alcohol as a crutch to help me through the tough times then to help me prepare for the bad times to come then constantly to keep the bad times away. But since I've quit I've become stronger taking my problems on headfirst and clear minded. I've learned to care more for those in my orbit knowing that everyone goes through there own secret struggles. ..One day at a time one week at a time one month at a time one year at a time. ..Today I went to the top of a mountain and poured a bottle out in remembrance for the man I used to be. He will always be a part of me reminding me where I was and how far I've come. .
