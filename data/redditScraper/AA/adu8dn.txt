And I'm thrilled to start reading. I finally found an old used ODAT that had a note in the front cover from 1988. Something about that resonates with me but makes me sad. Did they pass? Did they get a new copy? Did they stop going? Was it a gift someone didn't want? I don't know but I found a connection with it. ..I also went to another used book store and got From Survival to Recovery: Growing Up in an Alcoholic Home which I was not expecting to see. When I did I literally snatched it off the shelf. I'm excited to dive in and begin reading it. It's something I absolutely need. ..My mom has been an alcoholic since she was 16. She had me when she was 22. She's not 48 and 12 years sober. The entire ride has been a rough one. We've had many ups and downs through this time and she's had many emotional relapses that I have bore the brunt of...even recently. I'm learning to put healthy boundaries up in a kind and gentle way rather than by cutting her off for weeks at a time. I've been learning to lovingly detach inna way I never knew possible. I've only been active in alanon about a month in a half maybe a little more but I'm so grateful to this program.
