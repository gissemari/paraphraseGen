Now I'm bed ridden. I can not sit up or move I I can't move at all. I had a  previous stress fracture in my left hip at age 15 and then lower back sprain due to a car accident the year after (F22). No one knew because it was on the inside of my hip and a stress fracture/. 9 mm oblique tearwhich is only seen through contrast imaging. So I work out alot with my client (caregiver) and I'm a groomer.... Well supposed to be. ..Anyways point is Idk what sub reddit this belongs is so if you continue reading after this thankyou. Also the hospital completely neglected me and let me leave on crutches so I took pain killers for the first time and need to sleep but fuck I just need some support and to share my shitty day bc I can't even write in my journal and my bf is exhausted taking care of me and I feel like such a burden. ..So basically I did something to aggravate my hip and lower back been going on a while now. Put a referral in August of last yr to be seen by an ortho/chiropractor never heard from them. Call the Dr and they said they received it and I should contact them. .At that point I had stopped working lower legs and being more careful with lifting and just state slacking. Nothing felt right. ..I was a dancer and ran track for 3 days and then broke my hip when landing while doing power jumps. It hurt sure. After though? 6months of limping with 0 pain and no dr knew why until I got the terrible needle through my femur and lit that shit up. ..So long story short I got a new job low key ya feel and Ive worked 15 days in a row up until Friday. It was exhausting but great. During this time I found out my sister I haven't seen in almost 4yrs due to a fall out... and just well she fucked my best friend and then left in the middle of the night... And never seen her since. Anyways she has cancer which it's curable but it's a genetic mutation? Due to my parents terrible genetics that caused her to get a rare autoimmune disorder. ..Extremely rare. Goods syndrome but caught in time just has to have you know... Her sternum sawed open. We don't talk because she was my rock and she won't apologize for how she hurt me in so many ways that are even too much to add on here tbh. .Nonetheless that sent me over the edge. ..I found out on Thursday started a new job a little while ago and just been slammed and tired. New lady grooms waaaay different than I ever have. I cut a dogs pads and have been doing this for 2yrs and never done this before. 2 pads. I freaked. ..I have anxiety I have PTSD I have Major depressive disorder and Borderline personality disorder. Current diagnosis therapist is working on a new one had emergency meeting after ai cut the dogs pads. .Completely manic. Well whoopity do her we go. I have multiple medication sensitivity disorder (severe adverse reactions to pay h meds/allergic to ALL allergy meds) andddd a receptor in my brain that doesn't respond to a whole class of medicine. ..So she knows I take xanax only thing that ever helped. Well bf is recovered opiate/benzo addict clean 2yrs in a few months. When he went away I found a shit ton of xans. I figured hey great awesome for panic attacks and only kept a few and gave the rest to his sis his has severe anxiety. ..They were pressed so idk wtf I've been taking tbh.. (just admitted all this after taking that shit and trying to tell him for days but too manic to talk and busy with work) Also just found out that one of my medications shows as an opiate (for IBS) and that's why the hospital treated me like shit. Didn't let me pee for over an hour. ..I was told I'd have a room though they did say it was busy. Nonetheless Idc the problem is I told them of my previous injury and what I needed and I got nothing. Nothing but. A CT Scan which I said would show nothing... I had an xray the night before. Asked to pee 7xs when asked what was needed. .Saw more nurses etc than I can count. Told them pain was progressively getting worse. And could NOT move. ..They left me alone for an hour to hold my pee with NO button to call or crutches to get up after one of the many nurses stated hmmmm maybe u have kidney stones. Even said fuck it sedate me and stick a catherter in me. Nope. Also said I need to vomit the whole time and no bag...Dr comes after finally saying to the nurse I'm about to lose my shit and just jump up and pee bc now I'm about to black out and they need to get their shit together as at this point I'm going piss myself and vomit everywhere and rapidly losing feel in entire leg and radiating pain can only arms reach and nothing more ..Told me he didn't appreciate me saying 'fuck' bc at this point he asked what's going on and ai said this is fucking neglect yall think Im crazy but I work in this fucking system and know this is not right. .Blacked out on him he left new nurses no shot assholes brought me a bed pan??? .I can't move.Asked for a catheter... .They brought a kommode said fuck you got up and peed grabbed crutches and left. ..Nothing was on any scan. So now here I lay unable to move. Having to piss like a race horse writing this post and wondering wtf I did to derserve this. .Now I must wait until Monday to get to an ortho as it's the weekend. ..So ya that's a wrap falling asleep as I write this. I hope I'm okay... 5days sober made it a whole month without cigs (relapsed when found out my sister has cancer) unable to move. .Fuck my life lol. .Thanks if anyone made it this far ...

Early sobriety can be an emotional rollercoaster...What you're experiencing is totally normal emotionally for someone coming out of addiction...For more information on this research PAWS. This sounds like textbook post acute withdrawl...While you're bed ridden there are plenty of great resources on YouTube. If you've got time may you can start reading the big book as well. ....
Oh p. S. While you're being like every other fucking person that wants to tell me what I am how about YOU do some research on what happens when you don't sleep for a week due to stress related pain? How about you fucking damage your body how about you look up what it's like to live your whole life and be constantly discredited and then be told hey your have bipolar disorder and this is all mania etc stress related.3 ppl believe me now and it's cost. My mental health. So here I am angry at the fucking world bc somewhere somewhere else someone is dealing with same fucking thing using one substance to cope getting sober only to have their life come crashing down in the matter of days..Walk a mile in my shoes you couldn't do a fucking minute. I'm strongest person I know and the only thing that's keeping me alive and got my out of psych was the 4 ppl I've gotten to understand that I was never an addict and this is drugs.Contributes for sure but ain't the reason my man..Andddd last thing THIS is problem with the whole mental health system.THIS could have been prevented had someone believed me listened and DONE THEY'RE FUCKING JOB...End scene.Take care
