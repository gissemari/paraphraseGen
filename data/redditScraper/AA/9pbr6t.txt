Dear AA friends: ..I'm Ted an alcoholic. I also design games. I made a short card game about the daily struggles of people with alcoholism. It's not a fun game instead it tells stories real stories that I have heard in therapy and AA meetings. Names removed of course. Players go back and forth between Drinking and Recovery. When you're Drinking in the game you get Problem cards. If a player stays in Drinking too long problems accumulate until you die; the Death cards tell real stories of the things we've all heard people dying because of their drinking. But most players hit bottom and some point prior to dying and they  go into Recovery. During Recovery you have to "work off" your problems and try not to relapse. The Recovery cards have those sayings that we all know - 'Fake it til you make it' 'I only drank on big occasions like the grand opening of a pack of cigarettes' things like that. To get out from under your problems you also need the help of the other players. But they can't help you if they're drinking or if you are. However  there are special cards call "Bill W." that can really save your bacon. There are 12 Bill W. cards and each one has one of the steps on it. ..The whole game takes 10-20 minutes to play and you could have as many as 6 players. I made it for people to use in therapy sessions and especially for younger people (14+) because they may not know what kind of bad stuff lies down the road if they don't control their use. The rule book has an example of play in it so the game is not hard to learn. ..*The AA Game* is available at The Game Crafter for $16.99. I'm not looking to make money off this that price is the actual cost of the game. If I get any proceeds I will donate them to AA. ..[https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-aa-game](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/the-aa-game)..Respectfully submitted to this community which has been so important to me in my own recovery..Ted C. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
