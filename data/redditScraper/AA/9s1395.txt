I honestly can't describe how I'm feeling. I've never felt this upset in my life and not drank. I feel like I'm not even on this planet. I feel sick on top of that like feverish and flu ish which isn't from alcohol withdrawals because I was sober for like nearly six or more weeks then relapsed for one night and been sober for twenty days since. But trying to be sober on top of having gotten my heart broken feels worse than death. I'd rather be dead I think than go what I'm going through. People say to go out and do things and I have been. I just got back from a Halloween party where I just socialized and saw friends and of course everyone but me was drinking and maybe only one other of my friends wasn't. I just feel unbelievably awful and now my wrists sting. I want to go on a walk but I've been feeling flu ish and feverish all week and honestly feel too feverish to walk rn. Don't know what the fuck to do. This feels impossible. On top of that I'm PMSing hardcore.
