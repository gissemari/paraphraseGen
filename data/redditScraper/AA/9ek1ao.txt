After going through several different treatment centers I refused to ever go back. On 2 separate occasions the rehab I was at hit my family up for my insurance premium within a week of closing their doors and shutting down kicking everyone out on the street with basically a 3 days notice. The places I went to didnt care they were in it for the money. ..After relapsing shortly after the rehab I was at closed down an old friend flew 2 states over picked me up and convinced me (which took several days) to give it one last shot and admit myself to a facility he previously went to treatment at. On the word of my friend he drove me to the treatment centers office and they took me to detox. It was amazing... the house the food a fucking 80" TV and a pool and besides that the staff genuinely cared about me. The 4 therapists were actually liscensed and really listened  there were 2 nurses on staff who I could talk to 7 days a week right in the house and the people who ran the house were pretty cool too still friends with one of them. ..Tl;dr do your research before going to rehab or admitting a loved one. If I had found my last treatment center the first time I would have only ever needed one.

AA isn't rehab 
I agree they are plenty of people who are in the rehab business just for the money. There has been a new rehab that has opened in my area that is also very very plush and only takes eight patients at a time but I have yet to hear a word about it either way.
Hospitals sometimes are good for rehab because they dont except referral money and dont scam insurance companies like 99% of other rehabs do
