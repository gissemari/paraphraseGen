I relapsed two days after I got out and still am in partial hospitalization my parents can't afford to put me back into rehab so I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty lying to everyone I want to move on and start doing the twelve steps and get a sponsor closer to where I live but I can't come clean to the people at my rehab or my family because of the horrible guilt I feel and the burden of the money from the rehab. Any help would be appreciated.

The recipe for success I've seen is 90 meetings I. 90 days getting a sponsor and taking the steps.  That's what I'd do.
&gt;I don't know what to do..&gt;I want to move on and start doing the twelve steps and get a sponsor closer to where I live..It sounds like you know exactly what to do. Give yourself the best possible chance of getting back on track and staying sober by getting a sponsor and doing the steps. Find a homegroup and get yourself in the middle where you're safest- get to know people make friends in recovery and do service. Working the steps will help you to deal with the guilt you're feeling. The recovery community is full of people whose parents have paid for them to go to rehab multiple times so you're not alone in that by any means. Get serious about AA so you don't have to feel this same guilt again in a year when they're re-mortgaging their house or something to send you back to rehab because they feel so desperate to help you.
