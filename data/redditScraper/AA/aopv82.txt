So this is my first week of being sober in a long time. I simply can't remember when I actually committed to soberity.  Usually I give in by the fifth day by just drinking one beer. Which turns into one beer a-day that one beer turns into 3 a-day then leads to a six pack. A few weeks later I'm drinking tequila shots and twelve pack. If I'm going through some struggles or dwelling on my past I'm drowning in a drunken storm fueled by anger regret and sadness. I'm also not the nicest drunk to be around. It feels good to actually admit that its been interesting dealing with my emotions. I can actually feel them without letting them control me. Now I stop and think before I react. It's nice to be sober for a week. I'm happy to have hit this milestone.

It gets better.  And worse.  When we come out of that fog of booze and drugs we feel the full force of our emotions good and bad.  Today I wouldn't have it any other way....Have you taken a look at the steps yet?
Do you have someone in your life you could call for support? This is something that can't be done alone. You need people around you. A Fellowship. Because it's scary at times. And tough. Have you ever been to an AA meeting?
