But every time I relapse it seems harder and harder to pull myself up. Since I decided I needed to quit drinking in February the longest I've been able to go without is 55 days. Today I'm coming off another bender full of lies and deceiving my wife and I feel the hopelessness and worthlessness like I never have before. I don't want to go on and the thought that my wife and daughter would be better off without me is so crippling. Maybe I'm just posting because I need to write it out loud. Maybe I'm fishing for encouragement. Maybe this will reach someone who's been here. I know I'm worth it but today I can't seem to convince myself of that. I don't want to cause any alarms I'm with family and I'm not going to hurt myself. But I don't think they understand the crushing anxiety I'm going through. Maybe someone that reads this will.

It does get better. I'm coming up on 7mo in a couple of days. It's been rough but I've found that working the steps and calling a sober friend when the cravings hit has really helped. ..On my 6mo anniversary I almost broke. I walked to the liquor store and browsed for 5min before walking out. As soon as I got home I called a friend and the craving passed. ..Get some numbers at your next meeting and start calling people when you feel a craving hitting.
I know how you feel.  There's a way out.
