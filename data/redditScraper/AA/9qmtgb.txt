-The neighborhood dog wakes me up every morning because it's badly trained. It sits in their front window and barks from 6am on every morning at everything that passes. Grrrr.DOGS BARK my issue learn to live with it..-I have a new room mate there are things he does that annoy me I know I just have to get used to a new routine with another person in the house and I will but I'd like to tell you about it....DOGS BARK LET GO OF RESENTMENTS PRAY FOR TOLERANCE.-Stuck in traffic it is what it is but can I share my frustrations? .GOD'S WILL accept it.-Discovered that I'm cold at night now due to weight loss of 20+ lbs from not drinking and the heat isn't in my control. Really stinks because I love sleeping naked and that is the last thing from my past nudest lifestyle that I was able to enjoy on a daily basis since leaving behind my old life. Sad..I WILL HAVE TO DISCOVER/ACCEPT THAT EVERYTHING FROM MY PAST NEEDS TO REMAIN THERE. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD FROM MY PAST THAT I SHOULD WANT TO REMAIN. ..WHAT???? My sober future cannot involve venting having a conversation about my new roommate and how I need to adjust bad traffic I cannot be sad about not sleeping naked?????? Just because I've learned I am powerless over alcohol and I have turned my will and life over to the Good of my understanding I can no longer think ponder and openly discuss issues?..Ok 6+ months sober and I have a friend 5 years sober. I'm struggling with the fact that I cannot have a discussion or just vent about anything without it being a "character defect" or being told what page in the big book I need to read or just being told it's no longer important in my sober life or to "call my sponsor"..These are just a few examples. Are conversations to just vent and than move on no longer in my life due to AA and it's teachings/steps?.Can having someone just say to me "wow you love sleeping naked that's going to be a big change for you sorry for you" without it being a "teaching moment"???..I am 6+ months sober my friend is 5 years sober. We are both very active in our sobriety. Together and as a couple. Our priority is our individual sobriety. Our friendship is a great bonus. My struggle well you've just read what it is. Is this common? I love the no drama in this relationship. I love that we are both easy going. That we both have the same goal staying sober. I don't love that every conversation is cut short I can't think it through just label it at the start and drop it. Is this what AA is all about? ..I'll stop now I feel I'm rambling. Hopefully someone gets what I'm trying to say and can help me by sharing what they may think I'm feeling right now...Maybe now I can sleep and wake up to some insight. Thank you!

a couple of sponsors i had would lock onto anything and use it as a reason to do steps. and im like .. no getting frustrated and expressing some anger over things setting up a computer or shitty traffic or getting irritated by a girlfriend are normal things to be flustered by - as long as the anger expression is rational to the situation. ..a.a. is not a hotbed of mental health and a lot will use the steps as a fix all. it's an addiction replacement. i can't be around these people as im trying to be successful in the real world outside the rooms. they'll put themselves in a safety bubble and never work the program for real outside in the public sector where it matters. ..i use the steps to combat my alcoholism and that does mean paying attention to myself and what puts me in the alcoholic mindset. but that doesn't mean walking around being gun shy about the world at large. a.a. is great and i love a good meeting - but i walk outside and put it use. the steps help me find success in life by hindering my alcoholism. ..success to me is NOT being in the middle of a herd protected by bubble wrap. 
I vent to my sponsor. He is another alcoholic who understand me my addiction and my past and can help me reconcile these views. Most of the things you have said are work to be done on paper and it makes our life better. It has made my life better.                   ..The alcoholic is the person who walks through life shaking his fist at indignities and drinks because life is unfair to him. A lot of the problems you have described appear to be things you could change if you had the courage to. Honestly though it sounds like you are doing very very well and I'm proud of the work you are doing.
