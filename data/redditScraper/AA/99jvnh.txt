I've been caught up in a relapse for just over a year now. Went to my first AA meeting in a while. The chair was someone I've thought of numerous times as being someone I hated. I did not want to be there I went in response to a nudge from a friend. It took me the first 15 minutes so stop clenching my teeth but damn if I didn't end up feeling that old familiar comfort again. I was not really looking to share but there was silence and the chair offered myself and another person in their first 30 days a chance to speak. The other guy passed but I just went ahead and shared honestly for a few minutes about what's been going on where I'm at. I do feel pretty relieved and at the same time unsettled for the fact saying all that out loud made things feel much more real. ..Anyway half the time if you'd ask I would tell you that I hate AA. Really though I have a deep affection for the fellowship. When I walked in today 3 out of the dozen or so people personally greeted me and still remembered my name. I'm glad I went there today. I'm so grateful that I won't be hung over tomorrow. I am looking forward to the 530 meeting tomorrow. ..Thanks for being here folks!
