I haven't done it but I've seriously considered it at times. I think I would have to talk to my sponsor about that question. It's a really hard one. On one hand it doesn't involve a substance but on the other it is driven by the exact same urge to get out of myself to feel different right now and it is just as dangerous and addictive. Because the feelings are so similar for me I think I would have to count it as relapse for myself but I couldn't make that decision for anyone else...Are you okay? Is there anything you need right now? 
I'm a bot *bleep* *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:..- [/r/stopdrinking] [People who self-harmed after they stopped drinking: Did you count it as a relapse?

No we don't drink in Alcoholics Anonymous. I'm sorry that you're going through this but perhaps there is a self harm group that could help you better. I wish i could help but I can not..... God bless
It would be nice if all my OCD behaviors were removed at once but that hasn't been my experience.  I haven't had a drink or drug for a long time but I still wrestle with other shortcomings.  I still maintain my sobriety date so long as I don't pick up a drink or drug.
Absolutely not.  This is a program about substances ingested.  Alcohol or drugs.  Self harm is a symptom of additional mental health issues that can be addressed with outside help.  We have no opinion on that.  ..And def keep coming back. Read the book. Go to lots of meetings and talk to lots of people.  We don't get well in a vacuum. 
people use aa for drug use. why not open the doors entirely? 
I see dozens of people smoking themselves to death outside AA meetings and none of them don't consider that a relapse so why would any other form of self-harm count?..I see the same number of people smoking outside NA meetings too even though nicotine is psychotropic (mind altering) drug...I think the clue is very much in the name of the fellowship. Unless you go to Self-harm Anonymous then  cutting yourself isn't going to be regarded as a relapse and even then I'm guessing Self-harm Anonymous groups will allow the odd new tattoo or piercing without considering that a relapse.
yes. any old toxic or hurtful behaviour to the self...youtube aa seven selves.
