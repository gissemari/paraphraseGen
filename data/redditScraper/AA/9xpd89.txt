I'm a newcomer struggling to stay sober and believe Step 2 is the key for me. I've been working on finding a way to believe in a  higher power .....So.......I took a quiz called the Belief-O-Matic.....And.......I'm a Quaker! Liberal Quaker specifically.....While I will probably never actually become a Quaker reading about their beliefs has helped and I'm hoping this discovery will lead to completion of step 2. ...

I tried to complicate step 2 but someone cleared it up for me.  . God either is or he isn't and if you're anything like me your fucked.    That's an paraphrase of the book. I realized step 2 is really  that simple.  .I still haven't figured out my higher power I just know it works. 
Reading a studying others spiritual practices has helped me on my spiritual journey. Most recently I found out about  the Sikhs and learning about they're concept of a high power fed my understanding  of my HP.
For me I tried to complicate Step 2.  My sponsor made it pretty simple pointing out it's a yes or no question:..&gt;We needed to ask ourselves but one short question. "Do I now believe or am I even willing to believe that there is a Power greater than myself?" As soon as a man can say that he does believe or is willing to believe we emphatically assure him that he is on his way. It has been repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple cornerstone a wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be built...&amp;#x200B;
Sounds good! Quakers are about the only religion that's not totally bat-shit crazy.
I am no religion and all religions by that I mean that i am free to take what i like from any religion under the sun and use it and I am equally as free to disregard anything I don't find useful AA gave me this freedom.
Cool.
I got Secular Humanist. No help there.
