Well i was in NA for a few years... You name it ive been addicted to it pretty much everything but PCP. Now i was always convinced that 'alcohol wasnt a problem for me' except i was being dishonest with myself about that. For years i drank somewhat normally a beer at dinner or two sometimes. I dont know what changed or why but whenever i drank i found I couldnt stop. ..I would drink until i threw up almost every time i drank and sometimes still continued drinking even after. I would drink somewhat rarely i didnt crave it really not as frequently or strongly as i ever craved drugs but by making it out to be the lesser of two evils the idea of "oh a beer would sound nice right now" eventually morphed into when facing the extreme anxiety and the stress of the world into "i NEED a fuckin drink". And it was never just *A* drink. Yet still i refused to believe drinking was any issue for me. ..It was not until one night that i hung out with a lady friend of mine that i found myself anxious and almost agitated or angry that she was taking her sweet time on wanting to go out to get a large bottle of tequila. I offered to purchase an uber or lyft becoming rather hasty and insistent. Mind you i had not had a drink in weeks. I was never a very frequent drinker and truly rarely craved it. Although honestly it had started to gather steam as a problem solver in my life. She got a 1.75L bottle of 1800 and without any true liquor tolerance on my end between the two of us we killed the entire bottle. I naturally threw up all over her floor and was quite content to curl up on her bathroom floor and wish for death...Minutes later she walked out naked while i was laying on the bathroom floor mat and asked if i wanted to smoke DMT with her. We did and i then cheated on my pregnant girlfriend with her. I woke up full of guilt shame and remorse resolved to never drink again. I drank days later at a mexican tequila bar and found myself two days after that drunk again at a local bar where she and her friends frequented firmly resolved to try and sleep with her friend disregarding any prior conflict of conscience i'd experienced the week prior all memory of which had evaporated upon the first drink...The craziest part i live in a sober house. I kept doing all this shit entirely well aware that it could leave me homeless as an immediate consequence. Yet i could not resist the first drink and find various ways of hiding sneaking planning lies mental manipulation games. It is the same exact thing i do when i am using drugs. If only in a different frequency or usage pattern that aside the mentality is very much the same...Id been in recovery in NA for years and been in and out almost the entire time never honestly worked the steps with any sincerity. I always had an unfounded resentment against AA the big book you name it because I "wasn't an alcoholic" and upon the realization that in truth i certainly was i figured it was perhaps truly time to do something different. I called a friend of mine in the AA fellowship and asked him if he was goin to a meeting and if so if i could get a ride with him. Two days later i asked him to sponsor me...Before introduction to AA I never understood the phenomenon of craving. People used to tell me when i couldnt figure out why i had gotten high "well you got high because youre an addict and you wanted to". I always felt there had to be some greater or grander reason behind each relapse but i came to understand that it is an itch that begs to be scratched and that once scratched i couldnt stop scratching. ..Then came to understand the true insanity of it no matter how certain or confident the belief or sincere the promise no matter how resolutely however truly certain i was that things were different that i was ready to change i could not help but pick up the drink or the drug. No matter how much i truly in my heart believed that i was done for good wanted to be done for good seen obvious and dire consequences as an immediate result of my using and drinking i could not stop could not otherwise stay stopped and could not help it. I desperately wished to change and could not under my own power or will do so...This is when in this book i had adimantly shunned as not for me after years of banging my head against the wall the necessity of a higher power in recovery became relevant. I have been trying to fill a god shaped hole inside with things that usually tend to make that hole bigger. I never really struggled with the idea of god. I have sort of concieved god in a way that makes sense to me but didnt see where that concept really related to me or much less why i should place my whole trust and faith in it or the real actual need for it in relation to my life which i for all these years believed to be a total free will operation or a predetermined and unchangeable destiny. Either one or the other and never both. Regardless i finally realized that none of my postulations and intellectualizations of god or the nature of things really truly mattered. I came to understand why a higher power is integral to a successful recovery...I started truly praying at night. I had been experiencing strong cravings and prayed "please god just give me some relief please just help me stop obsessing so much give me the strength to do the right things and the clarity to know what those are" 2 days later i was heart dead set on wanting to pick up. Like i truly legitimately wanted to and had been planning it and thinking it all day. I instead called my sponsor. This was the first time in years in and out of recovery that i had ever done that. I on my own have never ever been able or willing to do that. So it has through this instance and looking back on however many miracles in my life that i am here and not dead or in prison for a really long time that i have come to believe that something bigger than me is looking out for me...I believe that there is a solution in this book. It has shown me the exact message in the exact words that strike my heart in just such a way that makes me believe in the 12 steps as a path to freedom from misery and hopelessness and blessed me with the desire to actually work them. It is incredible that a book written damn near 80 some odd years ago could have me laughing as if there is some sort of divine cosmic humor at play that i find the true nature of my ego my disease and myself inked within its pages in the very words that i struggled to find to shape what my recovery should look like...This is a god given program and it is saving my life and showing me that there is truly meaning and fulfillment to be found in it. God bless you people for keeping this fellowship alive
