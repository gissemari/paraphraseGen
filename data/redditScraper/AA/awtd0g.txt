My SO (37F) and I (28M) have been together for 8 years. We have a 3y son together. She has 4 kids with other partners and she is not able to see them like she would like to. She is struggling to hold it together. Her alcoholism is unbearable to watch. I try to keep it together for our son and in hopes of being able to get her to see her kids more. We are falling apart. She also struggles with anxiety and depression. She started using alcohol to bury her pain. She told me yesterday she does not have the energy to take care of herself and my son and still have energy for me. I would be ok with that as long as she was healthy because my son is more important than myself. She also told me yesterday she wants to go to AA meetings. I have hope things will get better. She is struggling so very much. She is not the person I once knew.
