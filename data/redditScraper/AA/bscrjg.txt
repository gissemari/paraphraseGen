I did something stupid.  I had my dream job 2 years ago had a year sober then and relapsed thus losing that job which was devastating.  But I picked myself up and this last year I've scraped up nearly 8 months now.  I feel great and I'm in a great place.  So my bright idea of the day was to look up the company I used to work for and see how they're doing.  They were a start up when I worked there with pending military contracts.  They now have 22 employees and have just opened a UK office!  One of the new concepts that I came up with is in production mode now too!!!  Everyone on my old team is doing great and making 6 figure salaries like I used to make.  I'm heartbroken.   I know I'm not meant 4 that job or I'd still have it but damn it was a crushing blow.  So now I'm depressed over it and yes I know my troubles are all of my own making.  Having a pity party tonight:(

Are you working a program? Do you have a sponsor?..It can be hard to come to terms with the long term consequences of our actions.  Sometimes we feel like being sober should be enough to return everything to how it was before.  Obviously it doesn't work like that though...Keep moving forward don't wallow in the past.  Don't give the past the time of day except in how the past can be used to help others.  ..You have the potential for an amazing life ahead of you... Don't let regrets keep you from getting to see that.
I too have remorse and regrets over the past. Recovery has helped me let go of what I can't control and accept reality. The Serenity Prayer is my mantra. I try to stay focused in the present moment. ..Thanks for posting.
