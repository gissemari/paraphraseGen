Well that's one holiday down. Two to go. Christmas will mark my 6 months sober. This is my second go of it and for some reason I'm not worried anymore. For those of you struggling remember don't feel afraid to reach out. Those closest to you DO want to see you succeed. Don't forget to always keep your head where your feet are. One day at a time.

Nicely said. Holidays are challenging but we will find our way. NYD will mar three years for me and it is a milestone I am committed to reaching one day at a time. Best wishes. 
Right what you said to others to not be afraid to reach out. Thanks for saying that. Great on you.
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME ABOUT THE Bermuda Triangle!.I heard that term last year and I thought it was great!
I love the term Bermuda Triangle. I have started a holiday tradition of going to a meeting on every holiday. This was my third thanksgiving sober and I look forward to going to a meeting as much as I do having dinner with my blood family.
