Without giving the whole life story here is a little background. At 25 years old I entered inpatient treatment came out worked the program and stayed sober for 6 years until relapsing ~2 years ago. I just left treatment for the 2nd time last Friday and have 24 days as of writing this. What I've realized now looking back is that I never really got it before. Not to say that I completely understand everything now not even close. ..Maybe I was just immature or not completely ready before. But I never really worked steps 2 and 3. Honestly I don't think I fully got step 1. I stopped going to AA and cut myself off from the fellowship after a few years and my thinking slowly shifted away from the steps and toward self will run riot. Truthfully I can now say that my self will probably never got out of the driver's seat. ..I had all these thoughts and realizations flowing through my head during and after treatment. I felt them but they completely crystallized for me at a big book study yesterday. On page 85 the following passage hit me like a ton of bricks. .."It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels. We are headed for trouble if we do for alcohol is a subtle foe. We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition."..I won't take this off in the weeds explaining my conception of spirituality and a higher power. The point of saying that I finally get it is to say that I finally realize that my will is going to destroy me. I had to come to believe and be willing to turn it over. This has kept me sober for 24 individual days and hopefully it will today.

Thank you for sharing.  I was a chronic relapser and I hadn't honestly worked 12 or 3 either. This time around (after nearly dying) I was finally willing to let it all go and let my higher power take over.  I also got a sponsor worked all the steps joined a home group did counseling and took on service work and I now sponsor other people. It's worked for 385 days and I'm feeling good (which was all I ever wanted anyway). 
*I finally realize that my will is going to destroy me*.I've had a shit day. You've just clarified for me why. Thank you. ..
I sought a better understanding this last time around and was willing to do a hell of a lot more than all the other times as I wanted this to be my last time around. So far so good.
\&gt;a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.  ..\&gt;I finally realize that my will is going to destroy me. I had to come to believe and be willing to turn it over. ..Yep.  Wow.  I feel these especially.  What I would produce for myself with no spiritual guidance would be tremendous loss and likely a quick death.  Thanks for these thoughts.
