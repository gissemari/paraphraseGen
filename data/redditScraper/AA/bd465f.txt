Just wanted to tell people that are struggling that it can happen to them too. ..I never set out to get 10 years it just happened. Some could say I bumble-fucked myself through some of that time but I never quit. ..Different relationships different jobs different houses a car accident that laid me out for several months and a cancer diagnosis but I'm still here. ..It's ok to cry it's ok to be sad it's ok to be scared. Sobriety and the steps can cover any part of your life. .It can be done just see it through to the other side. ..Get a big book work the steps with a sponsor out of the big book and give back. ..I hope to see you as we trudge.
