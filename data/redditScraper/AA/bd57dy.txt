My partner is sick. He has six years more time in AA and time without a drink than me but he is still very sick. I'm finding it is effecting the household and I'm having to take myself away from him and the flat we share more and more often. When I can't I'm normally on my phone just as a distraction. I can't be the one to help him even when I offer support he knocks it down. He has a sponsor goes to meetings and is doing the steps but the sickness in the house is still strong enough to effect me..I have a strong daily programme AA friends a sponsor I work the steps and I get to meetings. By all accounts I'm firmly in the road to recovery (and even that is a cause of jealousy for him). .But this is a real hurdle and it's one I'm struggling with. Should I talk to him about it? Moving out/ breaking up is a huge and dramatic leap that I think would be too drastic to do. I suppose I'm more interested in seeing if people have gone through this situation before and could give any advice/ assistance..Thanks and God bless.

I suggest inventory and Alanon.
This could be a resource: [Recovering Couples Anonymous](https://recovering-couples.org/)...It would at least be a group of people who know first-hand the kinds of struggles you are going through.
