yesterday I picked up 30 days :) ..I go to at least one meeting a day and I'm actually sitting in an AA meeting talking about the big book right now. ..I just got a job cooking at a restaurant and I start tomorrow. ..I'm definitely a fuck up but life's pretty good at the moment...I'm very grateful for all of these blessings in my life and probably even more greatful for all the struggle because of how much it taught me. In the words of Erick the Architect from Flatbush Zombies "Pride didn't do much for me but the pain did."

Yippee. Great job! Stick with it. Will only get better and better!!!!
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
Probably getting booked into jail.  Then there was the time I woke up in an unfamiliar building hearing people talking in the next room.  I snuck out before I got a burglary charge.  I saw a friend a couple days later and she said "Where's you go the other nigh you just disappeared!"
