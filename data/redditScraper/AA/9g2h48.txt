...and left it after two years...Then I got drunk for ten months until I discovered AA..Unfortunately I've relapsed (after 363 days sober!) but for the last two weeks I've been walking over to my sponsors house every day for a chat. I'll be back at meetings soon...Much love and respect to you all...

Keep up the work my dude you got it in the bag!
Sober and back at meetings soon? The time you put off could be just enough to kill ya. .Good luck tho hope u make it back!
Best days lay ahead Please take care .
I'm happy you're not giving up. I promise it will stick at some point. Hey I drank after 2 years but I'm well aware I am capable of living sober. ..Just taking it 24hrs at a time   
If you forget to brush your teeth one day you don't stop brushing your teeth forever. You put it behind you and brush your teeth the next day. Don't let a slip up hold you back. 
Likewise my friend I'm just starting to get through the fog again myself. Only as the fog lifts I just get a clearer image of all the wreckage I caused in a couple month relapse. The only way to get through it is to go through it  
Welcome back and take care xx
What is going to be different 'soon' that you'll be willing or able to go to meetings?  
Keep it up! Just went to my first state conference. It's been cool.
