Yes it's been an interesting 238 days on this subreddit. It's also been a wake up call and eye opener for me. My Basic Text tells me not to take too much time on people who aren't willing to go to any lengths to get well to stop drinking forever. ..A good friend of mine always tells me  it's only the Internet.  That being said it's been fun but not for me. ..I'm unsubscribing from this subreddit (I still haven't figured out what a reddit or subreddit is). I wish all who come here all their best in your searches for recovery. I also want to remind everyone that relapse is not a necessary part of the recovery process. Long-term continuous sobriety is possible and permanent recovery is real...Peace all - just another day in paradigm.

Good luck out there
There's always a seat for you if you want to come back. 
You seemed to have a pretty measured and realistic perspective on things in this sub if you come back around I'll look forward to hearing your perspective! Not everyone on here is decent and civil to each other  .
