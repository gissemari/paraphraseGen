This morning I arrived at the church for my daily meeting to find that our entrance was being repaired. Instead one of our fellows was hosting the meeting at her house. We all trundled inside 20 or 30-odd and sat on her sofa in chairs she pulled from her basement and on the floor. It was 7:45 in the morning and the sun was still struggling to come out. It felt like we were re-enacting an AA meeting from the 1930s where Bill and Dr. Bob shared their experience strength and hope in people's homes. It was an intimate atmosphere and the shares around the room were especially raw. It was one of the best meetings I've been to in months...When I woke up this morning I debated whether to go. I told myself that even though I could have used some extra sleep I didn't go to a meeting yesterday and would feel better if I did. I'm so glad I remembered "opposite action" and didn't give in to my fatigue...Grateful for AA both in person and on this forum.

Always go...you'll always be glad you did.
We once had a meeting outside in a parking lot because the electricity was out and it was a dark room without it.  It was fun to put the chairs in a circle and enjoy the weather.  No coffee though!
Better the sun struggle than me.
Thank you for sharing this. Made me smile. 
I have been to a in home meeting.  A member had knee surgery.  They were home but not supper mobile. 8 or 10 of us had a nice couple of hours together.
