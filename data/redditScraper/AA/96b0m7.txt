I've been to rehab before and the level of drinking at that point was pretty crazy. Rehab got me to a point where I was able to function and have a great life.. I ended up getting married and have a great group of friends and family. Drinking has slowly started to become a problem again on an almost completely different way I just got a great job and have been making a lot of new friends but they all want to go out and party . Currently I've been drinking on my breaks at work to make it through.. not because I'm getting shaky or anything but because my anxiety gets so bad that's the only thing that gets me through. I work with my partner and I even have to lie to them about what I do sometimes. This isn't every day but I know the pattern.. my problem is I guess with accountability. I don't want other people to know I'm having problems not drinking. I want to just do it. I don't want to every preface anything with I'm an alcoholic .. and at the same time the first time I ever relapsed I was afraid to go back to AA because I didn't want to be judged. My partner knows partly but not everything. Help.

This isn't your first rodeo. You know what you need to do. Do it! 
Other people don't have to know you have problems not drinking. Just head to a meeting ASAP you don't have to broadcast it to your friends. If they ask why you aren't going out or drinking tell them that drinking isn't good for your anxiety so you're not doing it. The more open you can be with your partner the better! ..I understand what you are going through and it is tough. But would you rather be known as the person that can't drink and goes to meetings for help? Or the person that can't keep a job license partner because they are a drunk? ..You can do this!!!!
The people in AA aren't going to judge you. They will be glad to help. We all understand.
