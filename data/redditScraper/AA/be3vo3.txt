My mom struggled with alchoholism for as long as I can remember she had times were she stayed sober for a few months but always relapsed.....Then late 2017 she took her life.....I want to help others in similar situations so my question is could I go to AA and share her story and fight with alchoholism?

Yes you can. Going to Alanon is also a very helpful thing- it's for people who have Alcoholics close to them.
r/alanon I am truly sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss.  ..AA is one alcoholic helping another to stay sober we share our own stories with alcoholism and recovery not the stories of others.  ..I suggest you find a grief recovery group alanon may have a spot for you as well.
