Just moved from Florida to Richmond and am without transport. There are 400 meetings a week here and im struggling to not walk 3 miles one way to a meeting. Anyone know of any rideshares to meetings in the area. Thanks!

When I was newly sober my sponsor reminded me I'd walk miles to get drunk so I could do it to stay sober. ..It turned out to be a nice thing during the few mile walks to meetings I'd make contact with my higher power. 
Call the Richmond Intergroup office and they can help you set up a ride I am sure there are folks who live near you that would give you a ride..Before Uber I was on business in Chicago &amp; San Fran and some of my NYC AA friends gave me numbers of people in those cities and they picked me up at the hotel and took me to a meeting.  Great meetings and post meeting fellowships were great...As you know AA is about helping each other get sober &amp; stay sober.
To what lengths are you willing to go for your sobriety?.I know plenty who after coming in and losing it all biked their asses or used public transportation to make meetings. .It's good for the ego to sweat and work a bit...
Just get to one meeting somehow and then ask the group for a numbers list. Call the numbers and ask for a ride. 100 percent you will find one almost every time.
