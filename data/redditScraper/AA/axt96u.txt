New here looking for help. I (20f) had to call an ambulance and police dept on my partner (25m) because he was so drunk that he fell on himself and potentially injured his back. This happened about an hour and a half ago and I'm so lost. He was sober from what I know for almost 2 months and he blew a .325 when the paramedics arrived. I don't know what to do nor what to ask for. He's in detox right now because it's protocol to take them against their will if they blow over .3 here where I live. This isn't his first relapse and it's probably the most mild one in the year and a half that I've known him. How do I help keep him sober? How do I help myself from losing my mind? Please help.
