21 F U.K...I've been a heavy drinker for what feels like a very long time but I realise it probably isn't compared to some of you guys which is why I'm hoping to gain some advice....Since about the age of 16 I was a heavy drinker and a heavy drug user more drugs until I was 18 and legally allowed into pubs. It was three years of drinking every day I'd be drunk in work when I woke up at night.. this wasn't just  Oh she's young and is partying  it was seriously detrimental to my health and I was only weighing in at 6 stone with serious mental implications and other physical ones on top. ..Fast forward to last night I've quit my job and in the process of finding a new one so I decided it would be nice to go out for  one cocktail  that turned into two shots a cocktail and three double vodkas.. which in all honestly I am proud because I went home when I realised what I was doing and I feel like that's a really big step for me because before I couldn't say enough was enough or realise how far I'd gone. ..This morning/afternoon I do not feel good I have been spewing disoriented sweating shaking shitting(normally at the same time as I'm spewing can be quite awful) these are not unfamiliar feelings so it's honestly more of an inconvenience than anything else however it is a lot worse than the times it's happened before (other relapses) and my mum believes I may be building and intolerance to alcohol completely.. i don't know how true or if this is even possible? I always put it down to my body just not being as used to alcohol as it previously was.. ..I know you guys aren't doctors but I guess I just want to know how to make these feelings ease up and how I can maybe stop spewing? If yous have any advice on how to just say no completely? Could I build up an intolerance? What helped you guys? I'm struggling a lot right now I'm sorry if this doesn't fit with the group or I've broken any rules.

The only thing that worked for me was going to AA and working the twelve steps.  I tried all sorts of other things first.
