A friend struggled but finally was really succeeding at sobriety.  Life had turned around.  Previously unimaginable opportunities were being offered to him.  He had a medical emergency yesterday and will probably come off life support today.  He will die sober...I'm grateful to be here remembering him his success and his example...I hope I too can die sober when my time comes.
