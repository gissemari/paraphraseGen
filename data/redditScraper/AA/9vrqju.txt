Had a rough night with drinking dreams and was so absolutely disgusted with myself and upset when I woke up...I guess I should be grateful that I got to find out how I'd feel if I took a drink (horrible) but I didn't actually have to relapse. It's kind of good because I've REALLY wanted to drink this week.

I made this comment last week...&gt;when i first started trying to stay dry i think i had a relapse dream just about every night but recently about a month ago i had a "sobriety dream" where i was at a bar and just ordered a coke. it really felt like a breakthrough for me. i suppose if you stick with sobriety long enough you have that to look forward to...&amp;#x200B;
When I was drinking every night but hoping to be sober soon I had regular dreams where someone offered me a drink and I said "No thanks I don't drink."..As soon as I was actually sober I had regular dreams where I was drinking even woke up panicked sometimes. Some people would say dreams are just noise maybe so. I think dreams often get oppositional and portray the opposite of what your doing now...Anyways drinking dreams in people in recovery are very common. I've been at meetings where disturbing drinking dreams were the main topic.
