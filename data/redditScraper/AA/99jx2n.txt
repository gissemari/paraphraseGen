My goal for every meeting is at least 2 new numbers. I don't always succeed but I've got hundreds of numbers and can do outreach to get out of my own head to guys I may only meet once in random meetings newbies or one and dones....Therefore everyone gets a nickname on my phone. ..One guy was eating a sandwich from a well known chain meet Subway Dave. Now we all just call him Subway. Another guy relapsed the day before his year I call him 364/365....I use towns meeting initials what they're wearing if interesting or reference a memorable thing they shared. ..All start in phone as AA - (Nickname) Name..Whatever it takes to build your contact list. ..When times get tough or too good I work the phone.

i make up nicknames for people in my head. something funny in front of their name. 
Next week's lead was announced tonight as "Nick the butcher."  I said to a friend it sounds like he is in the mob.  My friend looked at Me and miystery and said "No he works in the meat dept. At the local grocery."
