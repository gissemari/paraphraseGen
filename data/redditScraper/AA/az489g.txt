This quote has great significance for me as I go about my role...&amp;#x200B;.."Never underestimate the power of giving people hope. Kind words gestures and actions they really do go far. May the Almighty bless and increase those who uplift the struggling souls around them and show them light where they only saw darkness. May we meet them and may we be them"...&amp;#x200B;..Although not of her faith her words speak to me in the spirit of AA.

This was a great way to start my next day of sobriety. Thank you.
Amen!
Interesting article on the so-called   lord's prayer  which is chanted hundreds of thousands of times a week at the end of many AA meetings. https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/848875/jewish/Is-the-Lords-Prayer-Non-denominational.htm..The ending of Amen is universal to many religions. However if the so-called  lord's prayer  is recited by a believer of any other religion other than christianity  it isn't so innocent. 
That was my number one takeaway from my first AA meeting hope that there was a solution to my seemingly hopeless condition.
Why does a hospital need a muslim chaplain? Are the women doctors touching men?
