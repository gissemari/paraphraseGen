I've been plugging along for 3.5 years of sobriety through the program after 20+ years of struggle. For me nothing was more true than page 62 in the Big Book "...driven by a hundred forms of fear..." and I still face that intensely some days. ..This morning was a powerful example. I did my routines including meditation and prayer then read a thought for the day from Touchstones Daily Meditations for Men. The gist of the reading was that we have given up the escapes we used from the pain and fear of life. We are grateful to have given them up and pray for the strength to face life. ..Rationally speaking I have nothing to fear in my life today but that reading made me want to curl up in the fetal position or run away from everything (i.e. it filled me with intense anxiety and discomfort and not the kind that goes away but the kind that clutches on). .."Because of our escapes our growing up was delayed. We didn't learn how to deal with our pain because we escaped into an anesthetic a high and a relief."..I don't want it to take me 20+ years to walk out of these woods. I hope that writing this will help in some way. Thanks for reading.

It is true that alcohol stunts emotional and psychological growth. However with a program of recovery it is possible to "catch up". Seeing a therapist and working the steps of AA resulted for me in considerable personal growth. ..I learned how to cope with my emotions and that the only person I can control is me. I learned to let go of what I can't control. 
I've generally found that when I am fearful it's usually because I'm not trusting god. ..I'm busy worrying I might not get what  I  want next rather than trusting that my needs will be met if I follow his will.
