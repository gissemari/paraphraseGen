 ..HAPPINESS COMES QUIETLY..*"The trouble with us alcoholics was this: We demanded that the world give us happiness and peace of mind in just the particular order we wanted to get it-by the alcohol route. And we weren't successful. But when we take time to find out some of the spiritual laws and familiarize ourselves with them and put them into practice then we do get happiness and peace of mind. . . . There seem to be some rules that we have to follow but happiness and peace of mind are always here open and free to anyone."*..  DR. BOB AND THE GOOD OLDTIMERS p. 308..The simplicity of the A.A. program teaches me that happiness isn't something I can "demand." It comes upon me quietly while I serve others. In offering my hand to the newcomer or to someone who has relapsed I find that my own sobriety has been recharged with indescribable gratitude and happiness...From the book *Daily Reflections*  .Copyright   1990 by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc.

This was/is really true for me. Happiness comes most quickly when I'm not worried about me or my happiness and just trying to do the next right thing. In time I find that I am a much happier individual.
