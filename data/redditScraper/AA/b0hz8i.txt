Unsure what I can do right now. I have a sponsor who hasn't been answering her phone or text messages. .Today is a really triggery day for me and I am close to breaking my 3 month sobriety. .When I have the rare conversation with my sponsor she bitches me out for not being available when she is.. which it seems she never is because she hardly ever answers my calls. .I am a single mom with a 60 hr a week job. But I still make time for daily meetings. But no matter what time of day I cannot seem to coordinate anything with my so called sponsor...As previously mentioned I'm trying like hell to not break my 3 months.. but I'm struggling..

Finding a new sponsor is always an option though it's also possible that this relationship can be repaired with some communication. Do you have regular times to check-in? Do you meet on a particular day of the week to do step work? Since you have a busy schedule it might be worth implementing these things if you haven't already. You might both commit to a check-in via text at a particular time each day that works for both of you. Do you have other friends you can rely on in the program? It's always good to have more than one trusted person you can call when you really need to talk to someone on a hard day...Just a few things to consider... might be worth an honest conversation about your needs and expectations of each other to figure out if this is a compatibility issue or not.
