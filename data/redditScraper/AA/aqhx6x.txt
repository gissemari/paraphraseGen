Living in Australia alcohol is a huge aspect of being social. How do people combat not drinking in social situations? Like parties get togethers ect. I struggle with being socially awkward so often seek out a fake bravado with alcohol

I just drink water. My close friends know I have a drinking problem. They look out for me and help me if anyone tries to force a drink on me but surprisingly very few people actually care what I am drinking or not drinking..I also always have an escape plan. "Parties" where people just get drunk aren't very fun and people just keep saying the same jokes again and again..Good luck from a fellow Australian 
I have social anxiety. I would drink in social situations (or before going out!) just to make sure I would feel demi-okay around others...How I deal with it today is I suck it up. A feeling won't kill me but a drink might. And the only reasons I would care that much about what other people think are pride and ego... So I need to look at that...The best thing for me has been learning in the middle: learning how to do something by being thrust into situations in which I simply need to do it to get through it. I've become much more comfortable in my skin around people through exposure time and practice.
