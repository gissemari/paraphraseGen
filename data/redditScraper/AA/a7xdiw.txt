I'm new to recovery. 3 weeks two days 21 hours to be exact. I've only been to one meeting but have over the last six weeks been working with a therapist. Tonight while lying in bed my face glued to my phone and watching random YouTube videos I stumbled upon a video of the comedian Russell Brand. I wasn't looking for anything in particular but he was a comedian with whom I was somewhat familiar so I hit play. It so happened that this video was an interview of him with Kellyanne Conway promoting his new book  Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions.'  Hey  I thought  I have an audible credit maybe I'll give this a listen.  I've now been listening for a couple hours and it has already been very inspiring. After just a few chapters I know that beyond therapy I need to go to AA. I need to connect with others going through similar struggles. I will continue this book and surely be finished with it in no time. I'm wondering if anyone else out there has read it and found it helpful and/or inspiring in early recovery especially when it comes to confronting the idea of a higher power and being generally cold to the idea God. I'm hopeful for the future and I am so happy that I found this book.

The best book to read in early recovery is titled  Alcoholics Anonymous .  Read it with a sponsor.    Follow the instructions. 
Best of luck to you and congrats on turning this new page.
