These past Holidays have truly been a test for me. Including the anniversary of my fathers passing a few years ago. It still feels as if it was yesterday but I made it past Thanksgiving Christmas and New Years. I do admit there are days that I just try and convince myself that I'll be fine with one beer. But I know that's where it will all crash on me. I'm glad I come in here to see and read up on the many folks that have struggled as I have. And I'm not embarrassed or afraid to admit I AM an alcoholic. I just wanted to let this out and let people know that it's ok to wonder but please be aware of consequences if that urge takes over . There is always someone out there to listen and to help when you have that urge. Thanks for reading.
