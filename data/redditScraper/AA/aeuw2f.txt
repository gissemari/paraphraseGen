Complete failure. 11 days is the longest I've stayed sober. Nothing horrific happened. I had no reason to relapse. I did it because I'm powerless addict. I'm anxious about going to meetings full of people who haven't drink in years. I can't imagine my life without alcohol. I feel like even thought I did step 4 recently I'm only now fully understanding the first one. Nobody took my alcoholism seriously. Not even me until this point. ..I'm scared that alcohol won't kill me. It will only fuck up my life to the point of no return.

Good news is that you know where the solution is. You might consider looking at the steps you worked up to this point and asking if you were thorough and honest with them. Some of us relapse after having significant time and just like in early sobriety it's because we don't take the right actions. Give it a go. It took me a while of being  in and out  before it clicked. Doesn't have to be that way with you though if you take the right actions. 
I feel you. I relapsed in October after ten months. I am sober today for 3 days. Best  you csn do is make today your day one.
