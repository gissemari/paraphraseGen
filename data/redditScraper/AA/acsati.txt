Today was my 8th day sober which is the longest stretch I've had in a long time. I feel more clear headed and have accomplished more in this one week than I have in the past 3 months...The temptations still creep up but I've finally gotten over my severe withdrawl symptoms and continue to use that as a reminder to stay dry. My friends and family haven't been the most receptive to my sobriety but I've managed to go through a few events and even a bar visit without a drink...I made it 3 months sober straight last year and the thought of relapsing again just scares the hell out of me. Doing my best not to fall into old habits that led me back to the bottle in the first place. ..Sorry to ramble just needed to unwind a bit after this last week. Taking everything one day at a time as best I can.
