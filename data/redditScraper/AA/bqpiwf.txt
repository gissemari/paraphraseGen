My significant other has been sober for almost a year and today he drank. I'm not sure what to do/ say. I'm disappointed upset sad and worried but I don't know how to express that without making things worse. I'm worried that he has a  a few drinks aren't bad  mentality and I don't want to end up down the same path we were almost a year ago. Does any one have any advise on how to handle/ process a relapse and what things I should avoid doing? Any advice would be wonderful.

Are you an AlAnon member? If not sounds like it might be a good idea- it's a program for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholism. You can find local meetings online just like AA meetings; their subreddit is r/alanon
Hi there I was just going to suggest checking out an Al-Anon meeting. They were really helpful for me years ago when my sister was actively drinking and before I became an active alcoholic myself. I'm now in recovery but know that many have suggested to my fianc  that he check out Al-Anon for himself. We are hard to live with. And I imagine a relapse is not easy. I'm so sorry for you both. My hope is that he realizes that it's not worth risking his sobriety for a few occasional drinks and gets back on track. Good luck.
Thank you for your kind words. My dad is also an alcoholic so I'm I think going to a meeting is long over due. I left a message so hopefully someone will get back to me.
a slip isn't a relapse but yeah /r/alanon
Go to Alanon.
