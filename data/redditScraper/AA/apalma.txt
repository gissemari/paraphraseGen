Yesterday was day 19 and for the last few I have really been struggling. I met a friend for a late lunch ordered ginger beer but was still craving and struggling more now than in the beginning. We decided to go to my place to play some board games after lunch and I decided to pick up some wine. This was it I had enough days and could do it and was ready to cave...I went in got 2 bottles of my favourite one big red one small white..So much inner conflict on the way to the store while inside and on the way home;. I can still change my mind I won't have to reset my counter...  my counter was the my focus heartbroken by the thought of resetting and throwing all those hard earned days away only to re-earn them all over again? Maybe I wasn't meant to count days...perhaps that was too rigid and strict....I have also been looking forward to telling a few significant people who don't know I have been sober once I passed the 20 day mark. I know they would be surprised and proud of me..I really wasn't looking forward to how surrendering to this drink would make me feel it seemed silly and pointless.  Yay let's regress and be not my best self..  My friend was letting me make my own decisions but seeing him get sillier by the moment was not so tempting..We got home and I made a cup of tea put the wine by the front door. The night was tough knowing it was in the house but I did it. Reaching 20 days this morning was huge and felt great. I will return the wine this afternoon. Another good test :)
