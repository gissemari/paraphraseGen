As the title says I would like to thank you all for the support I got when i posted the last picture. ..***TL/DR:*** Emotions in sobriety where kicking my ass and almost made me quit. Sneaky oldtimer made me get off the sidelines and get back in the game...As a kind of personal update I  found the last few weeks a real struggle to find serenity. ..My obsession with drinking had left me and I was finding that just going to meetings was having diminishing results. My emotions were running rampant and  I was having bouts of truly vitriolic internal rage over the smallest things. (If those sweet little old ladies at checkouts having a chat with the cashier in front of me could read my thoughts I would be facing multiple life sentences.) Several times my teenage son asked me "What have I done wrong." after my over the top response to an insignificant or perceived disobedient action on his part...  I stopped sharing in the meetings I went to. I started to look for the differences and not the similarities in other peoples shares. I started to resent AA for taking away my drinking and not giving me anything else.  would look for any small excuse not to go to meetings. I would have dropped out completely if I hadn't been given a temporary service position to cover a holiday. ..This new side to my character was really troubling me and however smart I think I am I just couldn't work out where this lack of control was coming from.  I had heard the saying **"The good news about becoming sober is that your emotions will come back the bad news  about becoming sober is your emotions will come back."** But i didn't believe this would apply to me as I had always prided myself on being able to control the outward appearance of such petty things as emotions and secretly I did not hate being described as emotionally dead by past lovers. Deep down I knew that I felt everything but I was raised to believe that showing any emotion was weakness...A few examples from growing up. ..Happiness = What the fuck are you smiling at? Are you fucking special needs or something. I will give you something to fucking smile about.  (physical education teacher to 11 year old me.)..Sadness = Dry your eyes you baby. (Everyone after I reached 6 years old)..Love= You are a soppy little shit and I am going to take the piss out of you until you break. (technically nobody said this   but in my mind everyone did.).. Anger was the only acceptable emotion for a MAN to show.  So anger has become my default response to everything...&amp;#x200B;..I  cannot put my finger on exactly when my emotions started wreak havoc on my serenity. But last Tuesday they had reached terminal velocity. I found out that my older sibling and her partner had screwed up monumentally and my first response was to go straight round their house and give them a piece of my mind. (Ha.  The irony. For years they have forgiven me my screw-ups but I am going to *straighten them out*.) Then I find out my last remaining grandparent is being difficult to manage and is refusing to help himself. (he is nearly 90 and again has forgiven me countless times.) So i decide to go to a meeting to see if i can head off my volcanic explosion on my nearest and dearest. This lovely lady came in and did a main share but i honestly could not tell you what she said or even what the general message was...Finally the floor was opened. This was my chance to get back serenity.  I tried to hijack the shit out of that meeting. I usually try to get the theme of the meeting and when i share try to stay on the topic. But tonight i wanted to get my issues out and get these old timers attention.  After i finished speaking i sat back all smug and waited for these people to address my problems. You can imagine my disappointment when one by one these people shared and not one of them said anything about me.  One of these senile old fuckers even had the audacity to recite the serenity prayer during his share. We all know that prayer we say it every meeting. Who is that meant to fucking help... Thats it i am so done with this bunch. This has been a waste of two months of my fucking time...I decide to do the washing up as a goodbye. I go downstairs and start.  2 minutes later the senile old fuck that shared the serenity prayer walks in. He taps me on the shoulder "you have a phone?". "yes" i replied expecting a lecture on not hijacking meetings and calling my sponsor (which i haven't got yet.)instead. But he cheerily said "see you later" and walked out...I got home and decided that If AA wasn't going to help me fix my family problems i would have to do it myself. ..So sister first.Angrily telling her how she fucked up isn't going to solve the problem. I dont have the financial means to sort the problem. There is nothing I can do. I will have to **accept this problem I cannot change.** Thats weird...Ok grandparent next.  Angrily berating him for not helping himself and not doing what he is told. Pointless as we have been doing that for years. Trying to scare him by explaining the end result of his actions. Pointless as we have been doing that for years. Last option. **Is to have the courage to** **change** my life  so i can spend more time listening to him quote the Daily Mail and tell me how I do everything wrong.  This is spooky. ..THAT SNEAKY GIT he was helping me I was just wasn't in the right place to listen and he knew it. The next day after 2 months in the fellowship I picked up the phone and made my first phone call to another AA member. I met up with the wise man that knew the right way to help an egomaniac like me.  I asked him to be my sponsor as **I had come to realise that if I want to get better** **I need to stop treating AA like a social club for  pissheads and do some fucking work for myself.**..&amp;#x200B;..For anyone still reading.. I don't what happened this was going to be the pic and the first line of text
