I feel really proud of myself to be honest. .This is the 3rd time leaving a treatment centre. .I realise this may seem like a weird thing to be saying but I feel like I've achieved something this time. Walking out of here with more strength. I've faced up to a lot of things here. I've reported historical abuse to the police in here this time around... I've been honest and kept no secrets. There's been no bullshit. No co dependency with other peers. Just head down done what I have to do not got involved with drama. ..This is a killer disease I have no doubt about that as this relapse bought me close to death. ..I'm actually looking forward to getting back to meetings and reconnecting with old friends and getting back on to the steps again. ..It's going to be a tough journey and living life each day will bring challenges highs and low happy sad but that's life. ..I go home to my mum's where my 3 year old boy lives too and my partner lives 5 days a week at mine and 2 days at his mum's too. .I'm anxious nervous scared. This illness is insidious suttle and cunning how it can creep in to our minds. It was how it crept in to mine. I had over a year clean and sober. ..I'm grateful I'm alive. .Grateful to have had another time in treatment .Grateful for family .Grateful for friends .Grateful for fellowship. ..
