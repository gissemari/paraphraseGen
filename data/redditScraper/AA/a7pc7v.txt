Hello.Due to a mistake by my friend when booking plane tickets i'll be alone in Hanoi from the 23-25th of December. I lost my parents and other family members (death or they are bad insane people) and am not the greatest fan of the holiday season due to past events during this time of year...That's also the reason i'm not staying in my hone city but decided to take a trip. Last time i was alone in Christmas Eve + day 3 years ago  i thought i would be fine but i ended up in tears and fucked up on booze and drugs. ..Im very worried i relapsed a week ago and i'm already worried about my flight since they give you free alcohol if you like. I've been to Hanoi (before entering the program) and tbh it's a pretty boring city besides taking trips to outside Hanoi or parties.. ..Is there any fellow who lives there and knows if meetings will still be going on? Or to help me stay sober? ..Thank you

I've been to ex-pat English speaking meetings there but that was a couple of years ago. If you can't find anything online call the World Services Office in NY you can a) ask if there are English meetings running currently and b) register yourself as a lone traveler so that if anyone else calls in they can meet up with you and you can have a 2-person meeting together. There are also Skype and phone meetings that you can attend from around the world/around the clock.
http://www.aahanoi.com/..Call one of the people who has contact info on that page. I bet you'll find somewhere AWESOME to spend the holidays sober!..I've been all over the world in AA meetings. My experience is that they don't close for the holidays just like in the states.  I haven't been to Hanoi but I have been to meetings in Thailand and Japan. And everyone understands how hard the holidays can be...Good luck! Check in with us if you can. :)
