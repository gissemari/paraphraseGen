I'm struggling as it is to keep my head straight and not pick up a drink and I've just heard that one of my close mates from my younger days has been found dead :( that's 2 people in the last 2 weeks. I really don't want this to push me over the edge...Any advice please?

Remember that there is nothing   ***absolutely nothing***   that alcohol will not make worse. I'm so sorry for your loss. 
There isn't a problem in my life that alcohol won't make worse. .  .Sorry for your loss I've lost friends and family as well. Feeling feelings is difficult but healthy and you will be stronger as you get through this without alcohol 
If you drink in the morning the feelings will be the same or worse plus you'll have a hangover! Sounds like an easy decision to me. 
My condolences for your lost. You don't have to be alone with your feelings if you don't want to be. Go to a meeting call someone. You will get through this if you let yourself.
