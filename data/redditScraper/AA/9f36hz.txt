So it's day 55 for me. It's been a rough one and on days like this I get the urge to relapse. Then I came across a suggested subreddit r/drunk.  I'm glad it popped up. A couple of minutes spent over there reading how miserable most of them are I feel better with my current situation. Sometimes it's easy to forget that misery but that's just the disease trying to get the upper hand.

Something that worked for me during those tough points in early sobriety was telling myself  I can have a drink tomorrow . Pretty common practice to try but it does work. Typically by the next day the craving had passed and I was glad I didn't drink. I think that in the beginning the concept of  never drinking again  can cause a person to be overwhelmed and want to relapse. Might help! But know you are not the only one who has experienced these feelings! Keep going!
Awesome I haven't drank in many years. Helping new people is what keeps me sober I am constantly reminded of the truth about drinking not the beer commercial fantasy....
