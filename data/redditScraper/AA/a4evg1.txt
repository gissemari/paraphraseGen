The treatment program I am in consists of 3 phases. Its called intensive out patient with supportive housing. The reality of it is we live in a home like inpatient but go to our groups and approved recovery meetings outside the home. The whole program has a lot of support built into it but I am not allowed to work or even look for work until I'm in phase 3. Currently I'm in phase 2 which is the longest phase and have gotten certain privileges back like my phone and internet. But without a way to make an income the largest struggle I have is how to pay my two bills... a very small storage unit and my cell phone. ..Feel free to ask me any questions you may have...I'd love any ideas surrounding my situation.

Totally understand. The old school guys that I know would say this.... you weren't worried about the stuff in storage and your cell phone when you were out there...  I hear a lot of old timers say some pretty blunt things to people who are coming in. I am glad I heard some of them when I was new. Worry about keeping things together and everything will work out. Without recovery most of us have nothing. First things first.
