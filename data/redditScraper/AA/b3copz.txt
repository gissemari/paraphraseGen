10000 days ago I woke up stupid and afraid for the last time and started my journey of recovery in AA. The old guys used to call me a "one-chip wonder;" never had a relapse. Surely didn't do this thing perfect but AA always showed me patience tolerance and love. I try to give back however I can. Sharing my experience strength and hope; and sharing my time for service; while hopefully learning to practice that same love and tolerance one day at a time. Thanks to all of you for being a part of my sobriety.

If I in my 1791st day had to read something out to a newcomer this is what I would choose...You are an inspiration. Thank you for sharing this. Stay well my friend.  
One chip wonder I like that :-)..&amp;#x200B;
I love this. So much talk these days about  relapse being part of recovery . And maybe for some people it is but it's nice to see the stories of people coming in and sticking with it. Congrats on 10000! 
That's awesome! You prove to those of us it works if we work it! Thank you for sharing and my sobriety.
Five digits is really cool.  Way to go!
I got enough white chips to fill a five gallon bucket.
Congratulations on your 10K!   . Thank you for sharing this and reminding me about love and tolerance.
