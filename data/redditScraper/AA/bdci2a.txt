My dad has struggled with alchohol abuse his whole life. His pattern is being clean for a few months then starting off with "I can handle it this time" then he's drunk 24/7 within a week. His last time he detoxed he nearly died of dehydration. He doesn't eat either. He only eats yogurt and odwalla. He's lost 50 or so pounds in the last few months. He admits he has a problem and he is taking "meds" to get rid of it. But his "meds" are some anti anxiety meds which he believes are his miracle cure.  It's getting so bad that I think someday soon I'm going to find him dead on the floor. How can I convince him to go to the hospital to get help?

r/alanon is a program for people who are affected by someone else's alcoholics. They have been in your situation before and they can help you.
I drink a lot. Maybe 3 or 4 nights a week. Definitely not 24/7. ..But I've been told I drink too much. ..I say that to say; I think the absolute first step is making sure he WANTS to quit.
Go to Alanon.
