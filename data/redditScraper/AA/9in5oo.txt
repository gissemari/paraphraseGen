I dont have many friends and I'm too anxious for AA meetings right now. I'm a guy who stopped drinking for medical reasons. ..I want to drink every day but I keep telling myself the longer I stay away from alcohol the better I will be. So far that's held up for my physical persons but mentally I feel drained and heavy. ..I've taken to marijuana to help feel better about myself and to cut my cravings. Recently it's been real bad and half my day is spent wondering if it could cheat and drink. I dont think I'll relapse if I keep my head on straight...Can anyone share any tips if you think it'll help to stop thinking about alcohol all the time especially when the few friends I have all drink regularly?

I found it easier to keep my mind busy with other hobbies but not those hobbies you did when you was drinking. I had to stay away from my friends I use to drink with until I was comfortable to be around them with alcohol. They were real supportive with me about it and didn't offer me any as any kind p of peer pressure. The cravings suck and I too went to marijuana which has helped me. Just stick to it and keep the routine going!
I was groggy for about 2 months or a little longer. It starts to clear up the longer you go. Just hang in there and remember how far you have come and that you don't want to go backwards. Get a lot of sleep drink water eat good and cut yourself some slack.  Oh lots of candy! 
You can make new friends here on this site and at a meetings. Immerse yourself in both and things will get better. We will be your friends.
Good for you for having the courage to make change.  There are online and phone meetings. aa-intergroup.org is the official list. Best to you!
