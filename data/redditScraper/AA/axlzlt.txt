So I've been so scared for my liver. It took me a year and a half to finally get the courage to go and get a blood test...My personal best for sobriety is 76 days. Then 15. Then 45. Then 36. Now I'm on day 18. ..I finally had a blood test done and guess what... My liver is fine. I don't have AFL or worse. My kidneys are good. I'm lucky. Because I clearly battle mental illness I had convinced myself that my liver was in trouble. ..This is great news. However now I find myself struggling again. Why? Because I haven't killed my liver. If my blood test came back with the results I feared it would have given me another reason NOT to drink.  ..I'm posting because I'm feeling pretty weak today. I'm going one day at a time but ever since I learned I'm physically ok I can't stop thinking about joining my sister in a glass of wine (bottle) ..I got my results yesterday. I didn't drink. I won't drink today. but my friends... I'm feeling really weak...IWNDWYT

I hear you - it was easy for me to allow myself to keep drinking to my detriment when I learned my health was okay my job wasn't in danger my wife wasn't mad at me anymore etc. But I found that I couldn't control myself when I started not every time. Sometimes I was fine and could moderate 1 2 3 drinks at a reasonable pace and bee good. But other times I'd knock back cheap liquor as fast as possible to get to ... well wherever it was I was trying to escape to? Alcohol's tricky because I wasn't always drinking because I was sad/stressed/happy/worried/celebrating/you name it.  ...Anyway I finally started trying out this A.A. thing which is an abstinence based program since I got tired of not being able to moderate. It's been really good for me so far! Also my health (blood pressure sleep low-grade depression) have improved. It was really hard for me though to take the step into the :I'm not gonna drink at all" arena. I still wrestle with it sometimes TBH. The good news is I was able to find something that helped me stop before I DID wreck my health job or marriage.  ...If you're curious about A.A. like I was you can try out a few meetings here and there and get a feel for it - if nothing else right at first it helped me to have the moral support of other people who were fighting the same battle :).
My liver was great until it wasn't. Now after many years sober my enzymes are always off. I thought I would quit smoking cigarettes before they adversely affected my lungs. I thought I did. I was tested a year after I stopped smoking and found I have COPD/Emphysema. ..Why are you waiting until AFTER it's too late? Alcoholics suffer from terminal uniqueness. We figure the bad stuff will only happen to the other person until we find out it happened to us too.
