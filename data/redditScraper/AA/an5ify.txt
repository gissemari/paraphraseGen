  ..Last night I drank so much that I spent the later part of the night bent over the toilet regretting my choices. I have struggled with alcoholism all of my adult life. When I was 12 my dad gave me my first drink he saw me eyeballing his collection of booze and decided to get me drunk. The idea was let the kid get a hangover and fuck with him to the point he will never want a drink again...Country wisdom I guess...The problem is that I developed a taste for it. Once I hit high school (14 years old) along with the weed I was playing around with I began drinking. A friend of mine and I would steal his dad's beer while cutting class. Later after I got shipped off to Utah another friend had an uncle who would buy him anything he wanted oh and my own dad allowed me to drink at home...Father of the fucking year...My alcoholic father basically nurtured my own battle with the drink. Flash forward to today and I had to call in sick to work due to lack of sleep. I drank too much and was expelling it when I should have been sleeping but not before lying in bed for hours feeling like I had to throw up...I am an alcoholic and last night was my last drink. I poured nearly a half gallon of rum down the sink this morning. I bought the damn bottle yesterday  ouch...I am an alcoholic...I am beginning my sober journey today.

We'll see.  I poured out lots of bottles.  
For many of us it takes more than pouring out a bottle and posting on reddit.  .Why seems to be a recipe for success is 90 meetings in 90 days getting a sponsor and working the steps.
