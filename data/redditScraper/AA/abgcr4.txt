It's my first sober new year. Over all things are great and I'm so thankful for my sobriety. However I'm sad lonely and I missed a dose of my antidepressants. I'm feeling the effexor withdraws off doom and everything I'm currently struggling with has been amplified. I'll make it through sober but you know a hug would go a long way. I'm not asking for the love of my life or a profound miracle. I just feel so physical and mentally depleted. I just want human contact. Sorry for the random ramble. It seemed to intimate to post to facebook but I needed to get it out.

Happy New Year! This is my second sober new year and I've been a little weird too.  I also know what hell effexor withdrawals are. I feel for you. Remember - this too shall pass. Thank you for sharing and here's a big virtual hug!
Those ssri's fucked me up big time. My best friend is in the psych ward now after taking those things. .Please remember no matter how you feel it's temporary and it will pass..  .Prayer meditation and reading the literature will help but don't forget you can always call the local AA phone number. I use to work the phones often I was more than happy to chat that what we do... Its helps all involved?.God bless 
I can definitely relate. Hang in there. In the meantime I'm Sending you a ghost hug. You can't see it but you *know* it's there.     
You can do this .. 
First sober new year too! Well done! The downs can be hard but we're here to listen when you need to get it out :) Have a look if there's any animal shelters near by the animals love people stopping by for some affection and it does us wonders too!
