I'll be honest. It's been a fucked-up year in a lot of ways. But this program and this way of life has taught me that picking up a drink would only make things worse. ..I couldn't have made it this far without the principles promises family and support I've found in this program. ..And if you're struggling I promise you: you don't ever have to drink again if you don't want to. You can do this.
