I've been a problem drinker for the last 15 years. I started drinking seriously when I was 19 and have never had any self control. I got a DWI Iain the summer of 2017. Failed my Smart Start device enough times that in the spring of 18 I was put on an ankle monitor for 90 daysr. I managed 5 months sobriety (even though I told my group 6 months) and then I relapsed. Hard. Since last July I've managed maybe 2 weeks consecutively sober. I tried to be "smart" about my drinking but I've had enough fails on my interlock to get ANOTHER ankle monitor. Then I tried to out smart that. In the past month I got a call about "interference" because I piled napkins in between my leg and the monitor then I got a call that it registered alcohol in my system. I haven't been to a meeting since November. I want to start going again but I'm afraid I can't do it. I'm also afraid I haven't tricked the legal system as much as my disease tells me I have. I'm drunk as I write this and I'm scared. I haven't felt a connection with my HP in probably a few months.

Whew your situation sounds pretty miserable. You're going to continue to fail with your monitoring program whether or not you fool them every once in a while. The bottom is where you stop digging...Have you had enough yet? ..I got relief when I started going through the steps with the help of my sponsor. Tried that? Or do you want to keep trying your way? ..AA will always be here to help when you are ready to ask for it. 
All true alcoholics have been at that jumping off point. If you are an alcoholic the bad news is meetings don't treat alcoholism. On the other hand the very very good news is the 12 Steps do by producing a psychic change sufficient enough to remove the obsession to drink...Taking the steps out of the Big Book with a recovered alcoholic teaching you is a guaranteed path to recovery. ..Read (or re-read) the book from the title page up to page 44 then answer the questions posed to you in the first paragraph on that page. If you then decide you're suffering from the hopeless condition they're describing follow the specific instructions in the next few chapters and you will recover...Go to a meeting and find a recovered alcoholic to take you through the work rapidly as it was designed to be done and as the early AAers did it and your life will absolutely change.
