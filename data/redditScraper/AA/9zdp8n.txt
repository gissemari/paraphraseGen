I posted yesterday about struggling with step 1. The post can be found here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/9z7she/i\_am\_an\_alcoholic\_but\_still\_struggling\_with\_step\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/9z7she/i_am_an_alcoholic_but_still_struggling_with_step_1/)..I think I have worked the problem out. It's not that I am struggling with step 1 as I can fully admit that I am powerless over alcohol I keep proving this to myself. I have no doubt in my mind that I am an alcoholic..I think what the problem is by accepting Step 1 it means I enter the programme &amp; commit to it theres no turning back which means I will never drink again. ..My true self my inner self knows that this is the right &amp; only way. But my false self my  ego' does not want to let go. It  FEARS' that by letting go it will mean that there is no safety net crutch (alcohol) to protect me if the going gets tough. I have relied so much on using alcohol as a means of coping that I have this massive amount of FEAR that once alcohol is taken away I will no longer be able to avoid the pain of life which is of cause inevitable. ..I can actually feel the fear inside of me when I think about trying to cope with negative life events / struggles without alcohol. I suppose its like knowing your going to have toothache but not having any pain killers on hand to alleviate the pain. ..Does this make sense? ..How can I move forward with this mind battle?..&amp;#x200B;

For me alcohol dulled the pain for a little while but ultimately created more problems on top of the problem I was avoiding. Now that I'm sober I still have problems but I am doing a better job of facing them head on. It can be difficult but life feels more authentic. I am ok with feeling sad when I lose someone because I know that it is a necessary part of feeling true joy. Alcohol dulls all emotions not just the ones we don't like...I still have cravings I miss my old "friend." I just have to remind myself that that "friend" was trying (and often successfully) to ruin my life.  AA is about learning a new way of facing life's challenges. I'm grateful that I have discovered a strength I didn't know I have and a group of people who care about my well being who will help me when that strength isn't enough.
Good day friend. I *absolutely* relate to what you're saying! We have all been exactly where you are right now. Before I stepped onto this path of a new way of living I couldn't imagine not ever being able to have a glass of lovely merlot with a nice steak or a cold beer on a sunny day. But my reality was that there was never "a glass" or "a beer" or "a" anything! There wasn't enough alcohol in the world for me. By the time I took my last drink I was consuming over a gallon of vodka each and every day. I should say it was consuming me!..I had to get honest with myself. Or die. Like my younger brother. And my mom. And my dad. The simple truth was that I drank too much too often over too long a period of time. I hadn't lost my wife my car my house or my family. But I was going to if I didn't find a way to stop and stay stopped. Although I hadn't lost those physical things I had lost my way in life. I lost touch with what I thought it meant to be a husband father and friend...Until I found AA or I should say it found me! I went to meetings until I found a home group and some other committed meetings and go to them unless I'm sick or traveling. I asked a man to sponsor me and help me work the Steps. I shared at meetings. I found service work like making coffee and setting up chairs. I read the book Alcoholics Anonymous the "Big Book" like my life depends on it because it does. I reached my hand out to the newcomers and old-timers because they both show me how it works. And I maintain contact with a Power greater than myself because I can't do this by myself...Go where we go do what we do. And you can get what we have if you want it...This month marks 7 years of living this new spectacular life rich with friends family love and wonder...I invite you to join us we'll help you. Because we've been helped...Happy Thanksgiving! 
We learn healthy ways to cope with life in A.A.  ..In fact many of the things A.A. taught me are listed on the wiki page for stress management  under techniques. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_management..I learned how to pray and how to meditate. I learned how to remove my fears and resentments. How to deal with anger and anxiety. I learned how to have healthy relationships with people and how to trust. ..I am much more resilient after doing the 12 steps. I knew my drinking would never get better. My sobriety my sober life keeps getting better and better. I have practical strategies to help me when times get tough. I've seen people in meetings share stories of very difficult life circumstances loss death and they make it through without a drop of alcohol or drugs. ..I no longer crave alcohol. My obsession was removed. Thanks to the 12 step program I finally know peace. 
Move forward by going to a meeting.  
You are well on your way.  Get your sponsor to share his experience working through the steps.  When you hit your knees to pray Step 3 you will be launched into a program of action that will solve all of your problems.
I applaud your dilligence in examining yourself for lingering reservations as our book expicitly reccommends. My guy helped me resolve mine by bringing up scenarios where I could search myself to see if there was anything left for me in another drink. ..When I had the step inside I knew it felt it and could move on to 2.
One day at a time my friend. Just one day. That's all we have. 
You move forward by going to meetings continuing to meet with your sponsor and working the steps. The changes happen as a result of working the steps. I used to have the same fear as you but after being sober a while it has flipped 180 degrees to the point where I simply cannot imagine reaching for a drink in a difficult situation. I'm not even tempted to do so when things are stressful. ..My life is pretty great these days. I am not crippled by fear. But I did not get this way by thinking I got this way by taking actions. Thinking is a great thing but overthinking can paralyze you in a situation like this. ..
