Welcome back I'm glad you made it back.  ..Are you really licked this time?  What are you going to do differently?  
Just remember you don't have to take the elevator all the way down. You can get off whenever you want. You did the right thing today. Keep doing that.
Congrats on coming back so fast! Don't get down on yourself for relapsing. Just remember you made it back. ..What happened? How did you put yourself in a position to be vulnerable? ..Most importantly we love you because you are here and we are glad you are alive. Keep coming back.
Wait you consider pot breaking your sobriety? I've literally been using medical marijuana to help me since I quit and it's been working wonders for me.
You just posted 3 days ago about not wanting to go to extra meetings. If you are serious about sobriety then it's time to let go of your will and turn it over to a higher power of your understanding. The book has clear cut directions on how to recover. You don't recover your way you recover by following the instructions outlined in the book with the aid of a sponsor. You stay sober by enlarging your spiritual life. How often did you do things you didn't want to do to get high or drunk? How about you do a few simple things you don't want to do to stay sober? This program works if you work it. Time to get honest and get to work. Half measures don't cut it for an alcoholic drug addict like me. This is a program of action. We got your back but you have to do the work. Thank you for getting honest and coming clean. Now go to a meeting get with a sponsor and get in this program!
Doing some extra meetings might be worthwhile. No need to stretch thing out.
