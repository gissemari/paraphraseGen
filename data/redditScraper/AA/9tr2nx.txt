A friend of mine has been struggling with alcohol addiction for around 6-7 years now. She has been to detox twice recently and it hasn't worked. She lies to us constantly and thinks we don't know when she's been drinking but it's always obvious.  Myself and a couple of her other close friends have decided we need to do an intervention because she's a danger to herself and often drives drunk - including with children in the car. We have completely lost her to this disease and feel this is the only thing we can do. We know she will not respond well (I can't imagine anyone who would) and want to be prepared for anything. I am wondering if anyone here has been the subject of an intervention discussion and if so what was helpful/unhelpful?

Detach with the love..... .  .r/alanon can help you better than us
Don't do an "intervention" without professional help.
Contact a nearby treatment center tell them of your plan see if they have an interventionist who can help.  Good luck.
