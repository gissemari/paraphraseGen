For the past 15 years aka most of my life my mom has had a drinking problem. In recent years we have worked incredibly hard to support her and end her addiction. Last winter she went to rehab. For seven months afterwards she remained sober and I naively believed that we were through the thick of it. ..And then reality struck. ..My dad ended up getting abruptly sick and after 3 months of pain and suffering he passed away. It absolutely wrecked my family and 5 months later we are just as distraught. My mom has completely hit rock bottom. My sisters and I have been scrambling to figure out what to do and how to help her. Without my dad to rely on we found ourselves completely lost. She went to rehab then came home and relapsed. A couple weeks later she went again but checked herself out when her withdrawal symptoms became too much. Today I flew across the state with her after spending weeks trying to convince her to try a 30 day program. She finally agreed and I am currently on a flight home after dropping her off. As a Catholic it hurts to be spending my Easter like this. Last year my family was together. My mom cooked dinner while my Dad went out to buy us  Coco  after my sisters and I begged for it. Never in a million years did I expect I would be here now. ..But I do think the timeline of things is funny. As the Lenten season is about suffering and pain I have found this to be my most intensive one yet. Even though I failed to maintain my promises I ended up spending more than enough time taking care of my mom and constantly worrying about her. I pray that Easter Sunday remains her sobriety day for the rest of her life. That like Jesus she can rise. She can be reborn and leave her old life of constant drinking behind. ..This is still new territory for me. Although I've been dealing with my mom my whole life I had my dad to rely on. Now I'm trying to balance college with taking care of my mom and shifting responsibilities between my siblings and I. While I am just here to share my story I am also asking for advice if anyone has it. Thank you!!
