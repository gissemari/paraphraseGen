Hey  I hope it's ok for me to post here. ..My wife has been drinking and abusing prescription Adderall for about 3 years.  Just about 2.5 months ago she asked for help and went to a rehab 1300 miles away. ..She missed me and her family so she came home instead of going to IOP there...She did well the first few days but the first day alone she relapsed. A week later she had called and made plans with the rehab center to go back and is planning to stay in IOP for 6 months to a year. ..I love my wife and can't describe how much I adore her when she is sober.  I have felt so guilty over the last couple years when we would fight and she'd end up leaving to stay elsewhere for a few days.  I knew I should miss her  but the order and quiet was so lovely that I almost dreaded her coming back. ..After she was out of rehab she was the wife I haven't seen in years  and man. .I know this sounds weird but I love missing her.  I love that I miss the woman I love again.  ....Sorry off topic. I'm so very proud of her for the first and even more proud of the second trip to rehab as she recognized she needed help and she took the steps to get it  which is huge....I guess maybe I'm just terrified of some of the stories from people in al anon about relapse and now that I have her back I don't want to lose my wife to a bottle again. .. I know I can't instill these virtues in my wife but just curious what are some common traits of people who do well with their recovery?

They go to meetings daily and have a sponsor. I don't know the exact statistic but going to a meeting the day you get out of rehab increases the chance you won't drink/use that day by like x%
Frequent meetings sponsorship and working the steps to the best of your ability is a recipe for successful recovery. If she is willing to do that and keep doing that her chances are good. 
Making sobriety the number 1 priority in her life. But I encourage you to stay with Alanon because you will find more peace if you learn to be okay no matter what happens. Take care of yourself and the rest will work itself out.
See my post here about what it's like for someone on the other side of people trying to help addicts like me. ..https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/940eck/seems_like_a_bunch_of_al_anons_in_here_lately/?st=JKE1TS05&amp;sh=1a34d637
