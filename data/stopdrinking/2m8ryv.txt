Hey there guys.So today is the first day I've not had a drink since I last relapsed around 5-6 months ago. .I'm depressed and wake up every morning full of regret just hating my life. I was able to quit from April to June mainly because the doctor put me on antidepressants however I started drinking again and stopped taking the antidepressants as they were starting to make me more depressed..Hopefully if I can stop drinking and stay sober I will go back to the doctor get back on the antidepressants and sort my life out and get it back on track.

I used to go off my medication once in awhile. My doctor heard that I did this and told me some pretty scary shit about what happens when people abruptly stop taking antidepressants. ..What's your plan to do things differently? Nothing changes if nothing changes!
Alcohol caused me to become depressed. Sobriety has reversed that depression. You can do this!
Good luck! You can do this.
'Sorting life out' has some heavy connotations doesn't it? The general advice I was given early on was to focus on the first most pressing priority; tackle other things in time. For me that first priority was figuring out a way to not drink every day. So far by putting that first the rest of life has started to sort itself out. You don't have to experience another day one if you don't want to. What are your plans and priorities?
