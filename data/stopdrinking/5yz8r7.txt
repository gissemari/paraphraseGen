New to the sub not sure if I should be posting yet since I am only on day 10. Being a combat veteran with a Purple Heart and ptsd I've had a lot of struggles with alcohol. Lost many jobs going through a divorce inability to keep friends. I've been a drunk well over ten years. I just want to get my shit together pretty much.
