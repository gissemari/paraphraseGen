Alright so this might not be /r/stopdrinking material but I have struggled really hard with meeting single people who are sober or only drink on occasion. ..I've pretty much given up going to AA with the amount of crazy in there. Granted it's great to stop drinking or when I feel like I am in a crisis but I'm at the point where I need some kind of interaction where I don't come off as odd or creepy for being straight laced. I tried okcupid and it didn't really work I've tried meetup.com but every meetup other than my tennis meetups involve happy hour wine tasting or brunch with 5 cent mimosas. I'm kind of "out" of the whole needing reasons to not drink with how much I've been to AA now I just want to live my life sans alcohol. ..It's really frustrating. I'm going back to church (United Methodist) after like 12 years out of the pews in hopes of finding a good group of people but I think I give off this creep vibe while I'm in the Bible study. Like I'm really out of place or that they would frown upon me if they found out I am an alcoholic. Has anyone had this problem? How do you meet people sober?

I have never in my life thought someone odd or creepy for not drinking.   What makes  you think people are thinking that way about you?

I think you probably are just awkward. Maybe you are still coming into your sobriety.  Usually creepy people either do not know that they are giving off a creep vibe or they don't admit that.  So probably what you are describing is that you are awkward...Me too. This is why I am never dating or meeting any friends again ever.  I've accepted this.  It's why I use reddit.
