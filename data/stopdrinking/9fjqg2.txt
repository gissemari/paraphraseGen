As I'm getting closer and closer to my two year mark - yeah I know time flies - I'm finding that all the things I used to cover up and ignore are still here. I have issues deeper than addiction I am working on them and I have had a lot of growing up to do - still do in fact. They say that the way I used causes you to stop maturing when you start using - this may not be true for everyone but it certainly rings true for me. I still go to meetings I still help out where I can. But I find I still struggle with my ego struggle with my impulsiveness struggle with just about everything. Depression sucks A LOT. However I find that although it isn't easy at all I can actually face things figure them out not flee in fear of obstacles. I still have a terrible time asking for help or talking about my inner struggle but hey I'm not drowning them any longer. That seems like a great triumph in my eyes. Thank you all who suport me. If you are struggling I will listen - I may not have any valuable input but I will listen. IWNDWYT

I just realized today has been two years since I quit drinking.  I don't miss hangovers blackouts and the wondering about who I offended while drunk..IWNDWYT 
Arrested development is very real. It's taken me a long time to realign myself with reality and just went through the worst bout of depression since I quit. At least I'm not drinking though. IWNDWYT 
*They say that the way I used causes you to stop maturing when you start using - this may not be true for everyone but it certainly rings true for me.*..So true.  Now that I've stopped drinking I'm in catch up mode on maturing and personal growth.
