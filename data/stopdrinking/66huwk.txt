I went to an AA meeting at lunchtime and it was really inspiring!..Lots of stories of hope.  Many sober for long periods of time. One guy relapsed this  week after four years for no real reason at all.  It scared me but inspired me. There were a few laughs as well.  I needed that today.  I am going to a big party tonight 1.000 people !! Lots of people are scared to go but it is worth a go!  Not all are good but try it.!

AA was the beginning of my new life. Glad you enjoyed it. Hit a bunch of different meetings. Return to the meetings that inspire you. It works if you do the work.
