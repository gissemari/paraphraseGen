I thought when I stopped drinking I'd magically become fit and strong..After over 6 months it was definitely more struggle than magic. I've spent a lot of time on the couch and taking baths and haven't lost any of the weight I expected would fall off. .However!!! Today i went for a 3 kilometre run. It's short I know but I've been building up to this for weeks and weeks by running tiny distances twice a week. .This is a milestone and it is going to get better from here and I owe some of my tiny baby step fitness success to stopping drinking

3k isn't short if it's the furthest you've ever ran. Keep at it and eventually it will be a short run. But for now enjoy the high! It only gets more fun the more you do it. 
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!  3 kilometers isn't bad at all.  I need to start taking some weight loss baby steps myself.  IWNDWYT.
Congratulations!!! 
Congrats! I certainly can run that far! 
Have you tried the C25k app? It's a great way to work up to 5k and then I reused it to go from 5 to 10k. (I don't like the c210k program).
That's awesome! good for you. In fitness we sometimes lose sight of the journey worrying about the destination! Making progress is what matters. Hope you feel great.
That is really cool! Congratulations on the personal record. Running is my ally in sobriety.  Happy running to you!
Congrats!  I recently returned to daily running myself!..3k is no short distance !..I'm actually going for a run tomorrow with a friend that has been struggling with running. I love it because Im free from my phone (I track my runs like every few months for pacing) my email my insta etc. It's just me the birds and some car smog!
that's awesome!  very inspirational i think i'll drag my ass out for a run or workout tomorrow morning. :)
