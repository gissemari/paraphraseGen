What's done is done. I understand that but now where do I go from here?..As a teenager I used to be part of the  no regrets  band wagon. Even as I entered my 20's and started to make some bigger mistakes I still held onto this belief that regrets are a waste of time...Well I can tell you now at the age of 27 that I certainly have regrets...I've done some fucked up shit. Not just to myself with my drinking and self-sabotage but to other people as well. ..So here I am. 51 days sober. Trying to right the ship before it disappears into the abyss. I'm healthy and happy now for the most part. But I still have a lot of emotions to deal with now that I haven't been suppressing them with alcohol. ..One of those emotions is this fear of what I used to be and what I was/am capable of. I never want to be that person again but I feel like an imposter as this pleasant sober individual...I would love to start dating again. I'm lonely and have sexual desires. However I don't feel like I can pursue anything more than being acquaintances/platonic friends with these nice/innocent females because I'm afraid of hurting them. ..I don't even really want anyone to get to know me better because then I would have to tell them about the terrible person that I used to be. ..Let's not forget just because I'm sober now doesn't mean I'm not capable of relapsing and becoming that fucked up individual again...How can I get closure on that part of my life that I regret? How do I accept the past for what it was and look towards the future? ..Any kind words would be appreciated SD......

What's helped me is to separate past regrets into three categories: things I can make amends for now things I can make amends for down the road and things I cannot make amends for...Things I can make amends for now those I try to get to without too much procrastination. If I make the amend I can generally put that part of my past behind me. It's closed. Don't reopen the door...Things I can only make long-term amends for... one example is maintaining my sobriety so I can give my family peace of mind after all the hell I put them through. I found I can't just say "I'm sorry" and call it a day; I make 'living amends' by living sober...There's some stuff that we can't ever make up for. The circumstances might just be past. Broken relationships. Lost jobs. That sort of thing. For that I just switch from regret to thinking about what the future can hold. I'm still going to do stupid things but sobriety is at least some damage control. I'll be living the best I can from now on...And finding closure takes practice. It's not always a once-and-done thing but something we have to keep coming back to. So patience helps too...I like the way A.A. phrases it "we will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it." That's what recovery promises me. :).
One thing I like to remember is that I am worth more than the sum total of my mistakes. ..Forgiving ones self is probably one of the hardest things to do...Honestly the thought of "no regrets" is a nice one but completely unrealistic. Its human nature to feel bad about wrongs we've done or hurt we've caused. ..Thankfully there is forgiveness. Others can forgive us and we can forgive ourselves...I think what matters the most are our intentions and what we do to right our wrongs and the steps we take to minimize the harm we may cause. ..However despite our best intentions perfection is impossible. We will mess up and do something wrong and we will hurt people...For me despite forgiveness there is always a lingering feeling of pain that remains. I cant change it I can't excise it- its there and I dont think there is a way to truely get rid of it. We can wish it away we can wish we never took the action that caused the pain but we cant change it. I try to look at these as lessons. The pain I feel directs my behavior in the future. As long as we are learning and growing from our past mistakes we are doing exactly what we should be doing..
