I'm seriously struggling and recently went on a major bender.  I have been to rehab and did well for 9 months. I suffer from depression things have been getting worse with my wife. AA just isn't for me and I'm looking for advice on what y'all do to stay sober. I don't wanna fucking die but I've been real close to giving up.

Start with today. We're all with you. I will not drink with you today!
I think you need to change the way you think about alcohol deep in your mind. Ask your doctor about CBT ( cognitive behaviour therapy ) or look for SMART recovery groups ( which is CBT based recovery groups ). The reason people find it so hard to stop drinking is because of the way thoughts about  alcohol are programmed into the unconscious mind.  All of this is explained in This Naked Mind which is a book that you can read for free through this group. I think you find it on the side bar in group resources. 
Alcohol is a piece of shit.
