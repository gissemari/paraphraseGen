First post here. I've been lurking here for a long time. For the past 3-4 years I have been drinking heavy but I hide it well. For a long time I refused to believe I had a problem until I tried to cut back. ..Wow..It's hard. I found I craved it more than I realized. Apart from that it has affected me physically: Red face nose and eyes gained weight and just looked *tired* a lot.  Emotionally I was checked out a lot too...My biggest struggle with keeping off of alcohol is when I travel and I definitely do that a lot. Airlines lounges airport bars actual flying and of course going out wherever my destination is. To help myself I clipped my wings for a month (I'm not a pilot or anything haha)...Anyways this last week was my third recent attempt at cutting it out and today it was an absolute downpour outside; it wrecked my plans for a hike. So the next best  thing in my mind was to go was Monday Night Football at a bar right? So I went. I told myself not to order a beer but I did anyways. I drank a fourth of it and I was so disappointed in myself I closed my tab and went home. I preceded to pop in T25 workout video and did that instead. I'm just proud of me. I didn't go completely without but I feel it was a step in the right direction...

That's a victory if you ask me.
To leave the glass unempty is a big deal. I would have had trouble with that for sure. Stay the course sounds like you are on the right track!
