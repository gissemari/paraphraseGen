Title is all I want to ask really. Random rambles below:..I have been trying to get sober with varying degrees of success and non success for several years now. Majorly struggling right now but enough is enough. I am willing to try something new. I spoke to my doctor who was willing to prescribe me acamprosate and see how it goes for a week to start...I have no intention of attempting to moderate my intake on purpose I am aiming for full abstinence but recently I keep failing. I've been drinking (as well as engaging in all kinds of poor impulsive behaviors) nearly every day. Until two days ago. And since then I've been feeling awful. Today I received the prescription but no nearby pharmacy had it in stock so I'll be receiving it by post in a few days. Hopefully I'll be able to stay sober by then. Honestly I feel something just clicked a couple days ago and I really hope it lasts. Going to AA today. I want dialectical behavioral therapy but there's none available here. Reading a self help book on it now. I feel utterly defeated. I can't do anything but keep trying.

Campral helped with my physical cravings but I kept relapsing because I didn't work on the mental component of my addiction enough. Unfortunately I learned that an anti-craving pill is not going to help me when I'm choosing to make poor decisions on the basis of disordered thoughts and emotions. Sounds like you have the right idea by reading the self-help book and attending AA on top of the medicinal route.
To quit tobacco I needed to learn how to live in a different lifestyle and anti-craving drugs like Wellibutrin and Chantix allowed me that freedom. And I did quit. Been over 4-1/2 years now. ..I wish the government had anti-alcohol cessation programs with free quit coaches like tobacco. No tobacco anti-craving drug nay sayers that I have heard of...So hell yes - I say give life a go without alcohol and see if it works for you. Each of us have are own personal quit program.
