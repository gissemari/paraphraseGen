If you have read my posts you know path and struggles. I'm working on the goal of making it through the weekend sober. .Then a 7 day stretch the rest of the month  and so on. Anyway I have not been out to dinner without drinking in many.Years. I'm single and have never minded going places (even other countries) by myself. I love to go out to eat usually .Very nice places.  Always always always drinking. So tonight after work I went to dinner sat down put the wine list .Away and ordered soda with cranberry juice!  And stuck with it. And made it home without stopping to buy wine..I wasn't sure I could do it but am so happy it went well. Success today and high hopes for tomorrow. Wishing you all .The very best!
