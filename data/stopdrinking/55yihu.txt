I'm still mostly relieved. Sobriety feels like getting back to my normal life those nearly three months were just a short relapse. I'm so relieved I don't have to drink anymore I don't even have to debate about it with myself because of Antabuse...I really need to keep working on this and not just rely on the medication. I will start seeing a therapist next week but I also try to write my journal everyday...But I am wondering how much support I'll need with this. Last week I wrote a long e-mail to my parents and sisters explaining my problem with drinking and that I am on Antabuse. Everyone just replied with a sentence or two like "good to hear you're getting help" or something like that. I don't know what I expected though. And they have helped me so much and have always been there for me with my mental illnesses. Maybe they just really are happy that I'm getting help and that's it.

Hi here. Well done on one week. That's great news. :-)
First congratulations on 1 week!..Now about your message to your family and the replies: in my experience I thought my family would never come around. I lied and hid things for so long when I was drinking that the only way to have them truly believe that I was sober and dedicated to my sobriety was to not only say it but to demonstrate by my actions. Today I'm happy to say that they are now convinced...so much so that they want me to babysit my nephew all the time now lol (I was never able to spend time with him when I was drunk obviously). I wouldn't trade this great feeling for anything and I know you'll be very happy with the results too. Keep doing what you're doing :).
