Therapy and medication has helped so much 6 months ago the thought of being sober for a week would have made my skin crawl I'm still struggling (7 8 7 days) but this is one thing that I'm not going to give up on I still struggle with anger though my last boss former friends ...it affects me more than I like ..I will not drink with you today!..Edit: thanks for listening

get better!
I'm right there with ya friend.  I tend to make it a weekish at a time and then start over again.  I have a lot of anger too but therapy def helps to sort through it.  What I find is the more emotional junk I sort out the less I want to drink so let's keep on keeping on until we get there.
Somebody linked to an older post recently where people who kept quitting for 4-7 days (I don't remember the OP's numbers) are doing all of the hard withdraw days over and over again but are stopping just short of when the positive benefits of not drinking start to really kick in. ..It you're going to put yourself though the worst of the pain of denying the strongest urges at least hang on long enough to reap the benefits. The specter might always be there but it fades away with time.
