Suffering from alcohol addiction for past 15 years I have been 60 days sober...My biggest trigger and anxiety is thinking of the past. Money I pissed away people I pissed off nights I don't remember and keep filling in from lapsed memories. I am afraid that this type of thinking will lead me to relapse. Have been doing a lot of yoga organization exercise but it is the social anxiety that leads me to drinking and other destructive behaviors...&amp;#x200B;..In your experience what has helped you the most not to dwell on the past mistakes and behaviors?

As soon as I start to think about it I recognize that I'm doing it and tell myself that I am not that person and to stop thinking about it.  It's a conscious decision for me.  I will feel horrible if I start reliving the past 20 years.  Try to look forward.
Working the steps clears all that out for me!
I like listening to audiobooks from people who have also had to deal with their own inner demons or even just stories of achievement and purpose. I just finished Sarah Hepola's memoir "Black Out" which is about her experiences getting black out drunk ruining friendships making poor choices becoming sober relapsing getting sober again... She goes into full detail about the horrible things she would rather forget and hearing it helped me process some of my own regrets.
