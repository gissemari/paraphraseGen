Holy cow Snapchat just showed me a picture from two years ago of me and my daughter.  On top of that I had posted on Facebook 12 years ago how I was 8 days sober.....This has been a long struggle for me but I feel I'm finally in control thank you social media for a friendly reminder of how far I fell and how much I've climbed!..[The difference between two years is staggering. ](http://imgur.com/gallery/LAj7yhO)
