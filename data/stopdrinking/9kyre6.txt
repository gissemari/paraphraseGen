I was going strong for a few months there coming out of Detox...And I don't know why I started again but I did.  And now I'm immediately back into the vomiting blood the shakes are coming back and I'm needing a shot just to function...I don't want to go back to detox I really really don't.  I need advice.  I have the upcoming two days off work to attempt to detox myself...Please give me advice on how I can do this without checking myself back in to the hell known as detox.

Hmm I would be careful.  I don't know how much you were drinking and even then everyone reacts differently.  I do however know that if you detox once the next time is supposed to be more severe.  I had a seizure during my withdrawal I've been told that I'm basically guaranteed to have another one if I booze for a while again and have to withdrawal again.  Why do you not want to go to detox again?  I would definitely feel safer under some supervision.
get support. sobriety requires more than physical detox for most as far as I know 
The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. The internet is not a good source of medical information and withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly. We have removed your post and hope you'll seek medical support.
