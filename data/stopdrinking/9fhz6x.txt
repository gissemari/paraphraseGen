I felt really supported by my wife when I reached this benchmark yesterday! I have had a few cravings mostly in social settings but it has been going pretty well. Still struggle when others are drinking around me bc I wish I could be drinking too and I live in WI so pretry mich everyone is drinking. Trying to take it one day at a time. Any advice for replacement for the cravings? Soda?

I drank a lot of water because it's good to finally be hydrated hey?  I found myself drinking stuff like Coke and Fanta and Sprite- I rarely drank that stuff in the past but I liked it sometimes when I was first quitting.  I like herbal tea so I drank lots of that- I found myself drinking more coffee too much coffee beware of caffeine after noon because it messes up sleep.  Fresh squeezed juice is a nice luxury too.  I take lots of vitamins and that feels amazing.  Congratulations on your month!     
Congratulations on one month!   I'm also in the Midwest and I feel you - it can seem like everyone is drinking. What's working for me is not trying to live the same life that I had when I was drinking and smoking weed. I'm not hanging out with people when they drink. I'm trying out some new hobbies. And I'm going to support group meetings. I want a different life for myself and that means doing some different things. Good luck with your journey! And Go Bears.
