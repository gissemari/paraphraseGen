I've been sober one day now. I've never posted before so I'm not sure how this goes...I've struggled with my drinking since 21 (I'm 25 now). There's been short bursts of sobriety but nothing long lasting. I've been feeling hopeless lately with the direction of my life family and career. I knew I needed to make a change but was convincing myself I was too tired and too far in hole. I found this subreddit and have been reading about everyone's amazing resiliency and commitment. ..I am ready to change ready to make the change long lasting and finally ready to feel better. I know this will be a struggle and there will be failure and success. But for once I am finally ready and willing.

Welcome /u/Iwantedtobeaviking to /r/stopdrinking--so at this [link you will find the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out how I stopped drinking and got sober.  Maybe this will help you find your next steps.  Good luck.
There does not have to be failure.  There will be good and bad days but failure does not have to be a part of recovery...I just wanted you to know that.
Good for you! I was stuck in a similar hopeless pit with no job no money which lead to depression and misery. Once I began to face and resolve all my issues I was finally able to put down the bottle. Life today is better than ever. Stay strong and best of luck!
Thank you so much for sharing. Welcome! We are all here for you :)
Welcome! I felt the same way when I was 25 and did nothing about it and now at 29 I really wish I had been as brave as you're being now. :)
