Almost 2 weeks here face is looking clearer and more rested.  My eyes which had been bloodshot are starting to become white again. If they are red now I know I just need to hydrate more.  I'm starting to procrastinate less which is turn is allowing me to exponentially increase my productivity.  ..My anxiety is decreasing some days I will have some but I can process what's going on better and handle the issue rather than cover it up.  My spouse is being more affectionate which is because I'm not drunk on wine at night and unapproachable...This has been such a good thing so far  I'm extremely afraid of relapse.  I am very thankful for the SD community and the great insight that is here. ..IWNDWYT

Good Job!  IWNDWYT!
Great job and thank you for sharing to show others it's possible! ..Being scared of relapse is still a big deal in my brain. I check in here and post to help others to combat that. 
That fear of relapse is on my mind as well but I'm trying very hard to only let myself think in the space of the day.  I cannot control anything in the future I quite seriously can only control what I do each moment. IWNDWYT
Please don't relapse. You are doing it! 
Awesome! It just kept getting better for me. Keep on truckin'!
You're doing so well!  Be proud of yourself and keep taking it one day at a time..I will not drink with you today 
I'm almost at my one week mark. I already feel better and I look better. My wife and I had been fighting because she wasn't being affectionate. After just a week of sobriety it feels like we are a couple of high school kids. I will not drink with you today.
