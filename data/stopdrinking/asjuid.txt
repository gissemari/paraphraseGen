It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I have been acting as the full-time caretaker of my elderly mother. Sometimes it's hard to be kind to her when I remember how she was often extremely unkind to me when I was a child...**Triumph:** I am asking myself the important question of how I can maintain a life of my own while caretaking someone else. This is progress in the past I would have immediately and without question given up all of my own wants and needs in favor of the other person...**General:** I went to public school so I enjoyed this joke:..A public school girl and a prep school girl who are going to be college roommates meet in their dorm room...**Public school girl:** Where you from?..**Prep school girl:** From a place where people don't end their sentences with a preposition...**Public school girl:** Where you from bitch?.
----------immediate responses--------

Love that joke! 
Morning all! I am just finishing a 3 week guided tour of South India ( I am the guide) and for some or other reason I have been having lots of thoughts about drinking!. I have 470 odd days and I have no idea why?. I know I am an addict!. I know I can`t moderate!. I know my life is much better without drinking!.I have NO idea why this has suddenly cropped up??..I guess I just need to tell someone. I am determined not to cave in but FFS I thought the days of cravings were over.. I guess this is my struggle and my triumph will be that IWNDWYT.
u/sfgirlmary your writing resonates with me but with a twist...Struggle: I wake up with thoughts / dreams of hating my elderly parents. Out of nowhere out of the blue. IRL they were born and raised in poverty and I am at this blessed place in life in large part because of their HARD work encouragement and sacrifice. My brain is a scrambled mess because I can't get to the root of this issue to fix it.....Triumph: this year is all about forgiveness. I'm reading books to try and understand what forgiveness means where I can start whether I need to forgive or ask forgiveness and HOW I can forgive. If this were a simple physical action I'd do it with all my heart so I could move past this block and do better things with my life and time. But with my alcoholism and sobriety every new achievement is to be treasured and built upon. ..General: happy to be here at SD. I feel like I belong the anonymity allows me to write uninhibited. Also after a long time I feel attracted to someone someone I haven't had the guts to ask out. Baby steps baby steps. .Stay awesome you wonderful people. You're all rock stars! IWNDWYT 
It's Wednesday morning here in the Middle East and woke up in the hospital after having a failed attempt to stop some internal bleeding. Looks like I may be headed for more invasive surgery in the short term. But the sun is out my lovely wife is on the way to pick me up and take me home all three of our grown kids back in the states are healthy and happy and I remain sober and get to realise how lucky of a guy I am. Thank you all for your support. I will not drink with you today. 
I've been struggling with deciding how to get back into the dating world. I haven't gotten laid or gone on a date in my entire sobriety which is been about eight hundred days. I know I'm getting more attractive and I know I feel that I'm attracting healthier women but I'm just not there yet and it's really frustrating. I'm trying not to make any mistakes or do anything dumb or take home a girl that I would regret and I'm going to try to stay on the right path...Triumph: I have a really good friend and I continue to bond with him and enjoy our time together. Even though he lives in Wisconsin and I live in New York we talk almost everyday and have a lot in common and manage to help each other out. It's hard to sleep tonight because I'm overwhelmed with excitement about how much he helped me figure out in terms of my addiction and sobriety today. I'm looking forward to waking up refreshed and letting that knowledge settle into me
I have the same struggles living with my dad who is in some ways taking care of me but also needs a lot from me in terms of emotional adjustment. I struggle to constantly be gentle and patient and forgiving with him when he was such a total asshole to us when we were growing up (and sometimes still is). But it's about me not him...**Struggle:** I'm on antibiotics because an ear piercing got infected. Gah! It was really pretty too the piercing and I was feeling pretty vain about it. But I went to see a doc and he recommended I just remove it. Sigh. I haven't been on antibiotics in more than 10 years I think so adjusting to the side-effects is making me grumpy...**Triumph:** I've been writing and hopefully landing new jobs...**General:** My laptop is working again! What joy. I don't know how long it'll last but for the moment it's beautiful. I've also been listening to Albin Lee Meldau and felt the stirrings of  a serious crush (it's been so long since I've had one!) but it evaporated once I saw him perform live. Hah. 
Yesterday was hard today will be better... realizing I might need more support and tools to make this stick. But I will not drink with you today!
Struggle: Had a bad night of sleep then a bad day at work then a fight with my husband. I think the common denominator here is me and my grumpiness. .Triumph: Not drinking and not going to. .General: I am going to try sitting in this funk for a minute I will try being a reasonable and productive person tomorrow. I wont be hungover at least!
Happy Hump Day sober friends &amp; Thanks mary..Struggle: I also care for my mom and struggle because I went so long ignoring her problems. Always made sure she had what she needed just did not try to learn how to help her with her disease. (Dementia)..Triumph: As I progress along my sober adventure I am learning to help her too. I can now sit and talk with her even when she doesn't really understand and won't remember. This is progress--in the past I would have selfishly ran &amp; hid in my bottle of rum...General: Funny stuff...when I started 7th grade the Catholic school kids joined the public school system. (Catholic school only went thru 6th) The Catholic school kids were the real hell raisers...Spring is coming...won't be long and I will be starting seeds for veggie garden. ..Peace 
*struggle* with classes at uni starting really soon I am having a wee bit of panic over how on earth I will juggle everything in without going nuts. I have managed to cut my working hours and clients down ahead of starting classes but I have been enjoying the feeling of NOT being harried and overloaded so much I find myself second-guessing why I thought university was such a red hot idea... that maybe what I actually wanted was a motivation to cut back on work hours and client load and have time to fill with things like painting and such... time will tell I suppose...*triumph* I got to yoga class again today. I almost didn't because Kiddo was in a bad mood and I had work that seemed like it should be done and there was dinner needing to be cooked etc etc etc but it was my snarky Kiddo pointed out that doing yoga is a really special wellbeing thing I now do for myself and that I should go. And so I did - and by the time the 90 minute class was done I could feel how much good it did me. Still managed to get the dog walked afterwards and a quick white bean and tomato soup for dinner cooked! {pro tip - cooking beans in bulk and then freezing them in recipe-sized portions can be a lifesaver for fast tasty and healthy dinners!]..*general* An assignment for my biology subject requires me to catch kill and display a creature collection of up to 20 or more different orders of arthropod invertebrates [bugs beetles molluscs crustacea etc] as someone who has cultivated actual insect refuges here at home... this will be interesting to navigate. I do think I will get *some* satisfaction from a cockroach a housefly a redback spider a flea a pantry moth and a European wasp because they are all not fun insects. But I simply could not harm most types [ants bees butterflies beetles....crabs...] so I think I will be looking for dead bugs in good condition mostly. Yep that will be me the odd middle-aged lady wandering around town with urine sample jars in my handbag so I can scoop up a diversity of deceased invertebrates! he he he..
Struggle: I can't even begin to explain my current situation. Sorry this is long. ..In a nutshell we were friends with a couple last year...Me and the guy in the couple became really close and sort of ended up getting mild crushes on each other. It's not great but t happens. ..We talked about it because we were like - hey we need to chill this out and not hurt anyone. Nothing happened at all. I told my bf he was angry for a bit but accepted that I was honest - I never lied about it and that we talked because we didn't want to cause problems...He forgive me and this guy and we all tried to be friends. I know this sounds weird but it's a small town and felt it was easier to stay friends. ..The guys gf on the other hand couldn't deal at all. We ended up lying to her because she was freaking out so much. She wanted me to take all the blame. She wouldn't allow her bf to take any responsibility...I stupidly was like - yeah sure I'll take all that blame because I was miserable and had low self esteem and just wanted everyone to be ok. ..But this made everything worse. She kept piling more blame on me. Eventually after months of this weird friendship she flipped sent me a long nasty message. Compared me to someone they knew who had physically assaulted someone. ..It was crazy. Just because her bf had a minor crush months ago which she was in complete denial about. ..And I totally tried to take responsibility but she wanted too much from me. She wanted me to admit I was a terrible person that I deserved to be constantly ashamed...The bf tried to stay friends with my bf which is also a bit nuts. But that obviously hasn't worked out...Me and my bf have been left feeling really sad and lonely in this city. She's basically attempted to ostracise us from our friends. ..But they love to keep up appearances so they haven't even told people we fell out. I ended up lying to mutual friends pretending we're still friends and it just broke me. ..So yeah I'm going to stop lying. Stop protecting them. Because it's killing me and making me want to just disappear. ..And I feel like I'm in high school! These guys are nearly in their 40s. I feel totally mental. ..Triumph: I taught myself how to build a pretty decent website on Wordpress for work...General: ..
Mary Good Morning and thanks for the :). ..**Struggle** My struggle today so far is just being tired. I'm going to have to push through though. Right back to work!..**Triumph** Feel very triumphant today after staying sober in New Orleans. I'm fired up about work which is kind of the point of the thing and plan to ride this high until reality beats me back into submission which I predict will happen around 1:14 today LOL...**General** I was so tired driving home from the airport last night (about a 3 hour drive when Twin Cities rush hour is factored in) that I managed to lose my debit card at a gas station in MiddleONowhere MN. I was about 90% sure I'd accidentally thrown it in the trash while throwing away garbage that was piling up in my car (as one does when fueling up during a road trip). About 45 minutes later at 9 pm someone from my bank called and let me know it had been found called in and the person had cut it up. How Minnesota nice is that?
**Struggle:** My body is falling apart! 40 years too soon. Most of it is fixable but the things that are not are somewhat difficult to accept. I have some work to do there...**Triumph:** One more day that I woke up and didn t think about drinking. Sweet...**General:** The mailman keeps giving us a copy of whatever newspaper or magazine he has extra. Today s gift was a gardening magazine. I guess spring is coming early this year!
I feel ya u/sfgirlmary...being a caretaker is a whole other job in itself...and *certainly not an easy one*. Sending hugs xo...**Struggle:**     Had a crazy busy day at work yesterday. Got a phone call from BIL saying Mom fell backwards at dialysis. Raced home from work and nursed her the whole day/night. I wake up this morning and she's not speaking to me. Unfuckingbelievable...**Triumph:**     In sobriety I've been blessed with the courage to accept the things I can. And I can't change her. Unfortunately she'll be living in her own nasty misery alone...not my circus - not my monkeys...**General:**     Sobriety is a process. I would have never believed and actually *worked* the Serenity Prayer when I was just getting sober. As I've said I learn something new in this program *every. single. day*. I'm grateful :).
IWNDWYT   
**S:**  Behavioral problems with my daughter...  Not doing her homework lying talking back to me trying to kick me in my knees...**T:**  I put her in after school care because I didn't feel like putting up with her crap.  ..**G:**  Thanks for the joke.  :)
Struggle: I just got home from my first ever sober vacation which was challenging simply because I tended to drink especially heavily while traveling and this was all completely new. I'm three months in now so I didn't have to depend on white knuckling and I wasn't obsessing. It was just a strange feeling like there was something amiss almost like every thought in my head had an asterisk next to it. Actually it wasn't an asterisk but more like that weird empty box that pops up in sentences when you change computer formats and the font or symbol can't be recognized and there's that little square with nothing in it? It felt like that for the first few days. I tried filling it with coffee tea sparkling water nonalcoholic cider etc. They helped but only to a point. I'd see fancy cocktails on menus and couldn't stop myself from finding the one I would have ordered. The romantic italian dinner next to a roaring fire was off without the bottle of red wine. I tried to check my privilege for being on vacation as often as possible and it did get easier by the last day. Sober firsts are just hard plain and simple...Triumph: I made it through with no slips. When I ordered hot cider at a brewery the server warned me "That's nonalcoholic just so you know." I told her "I sure hope so! I'm newly sober and that's exactly what I want." She smiled and we had a lovely conversation about my "journey" (her word!) She complimented my skin and asked about my sleep and was just a wonderful ally to have in a server. I could have hugged the woman I swear! It was a nice reminder that some people totally get it and are on our side even in the middle of a brewery. ..General: Saw a cute movie on the plane home "Juliet Naked" and one of the main characters was a sober alcoholic. There was a minor scene where his sobriety is challenged by a drunken English mayor which was pretty funny and completely relatable...Thanks for being here and IWNDWYT.  .
Struggle: I've been a bit down lately. Not 100% sure why. Maybe in a slump. Feels like I'm punching the clock in and out of work and when I get home it's chores and taking turns with the wife to watch the baby/kids. She and I can't really spend any time together because the kids are always in the way. So it feels like we've been drifting apart for quite a while. That feeling seems to spill into the rest of the day sometimes...Triumph: Obviously \~50 days sober is a great accomplishment for me. A big part is that I actually admitted my struggle to my wife and she's supportive and holds me accountable. Also we have made a major change to our finances as we racked up a ton of credit card debt and so far we are doing a really good job of cutting back spending to pay it down...General: I live in Minnesota and we've gotten I think two feet of snow this month? Another 6-8" today and supposed to be another foot later this week. Can't wait for summer...
Struggle:  I struggle with learning how to deal with life without alcohol...Triumph:  I'm learning...General:  Your joke made me crack up laughing.  I need to do more of that!
**Struggle:**  Just trying to get to the next stage of sobriety that one that so many seem to reach where they have unbounded energy to make a major change in their career and end up with a job that they absolutely love. /s  Anyhoo...I know if it is to be it's up to me.  I *will* get there dammit!..**Triumph:**  Another great cousins reunion during this long weekend.  I love that these girls want to bond as adults and are committed to creating family as we all get older and none of us have kids.  I flew out to CA and got to see that gorgeous ocean and had a fantastic hike in a national park - yay!!..**General:**  OMG I luuuved that joke Mary!  Hoping to have more time in CA next time to visit you sobernauts residing there.  
Struggle: Boyfriend broke up with me had to move back in with my parents and into my childhood room which is absolutely disgusting. I feel very alone. ..Triumph: I didn't drink during this debacle so that's nice. ..General: I'm starting The Office over for the fourth time. I have a lot of cats. 
I will not drink today!
**Struggle:** On vacation staying with the in-laws. That causes all sorts of struggle. It's hard to accommodate everyone competing desires and share space. We're also in Shithole Nevada. Gambling drinking and smoking don't have any appeal for me but it's inescapable here...**Triumph:** We're getting out and doing things every day (an issue with the inlaws). It's not as much as I'd like but it is out. Hiking in the Mojave desert even in unusually cold winter is still special.
I've been on a really shitty spiral lately and I've made a strong commitment to 30 days sobriety. I have been struggling with everything and I wanna go back to last year when I was off the booze focused and happy. Instead of thinking of all the things I'll be missing out on I'm focusing on all the amazing things I can do like getting super organised for work and home and being fit and healthy. IWNDWYT
**Struggle -** I mostly feel good but I tend to feel down at night. At work I keep getting invited to social bar things and I'm afraid I'll say 'yes' since I have a hard time saying 'no' on the spot. I kept justifying my drinking thinking I'd go to one of these things once to make friends and then quit drinking but when the time came for the event I'd stay home to drink. Last invite I was luckily working at the time of the event. And my mom keeps calling and that's a trigger for me too so I'm avoiding listening to her voicemails for now...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph -** Made it 6 days (this day is in the bag). Although I feel down sometimes last night I watched something funny and listened to some great music instead of wallowing in it. I thought I'd feel dreadful during this but I mostly feel okay and funny things help. I'm getting back into healthy routines.
I'm struggling learning how to do things I enjoy without a drink in my hand. I cooked yesterday without drinking and today I'm watching basketball without drinking. No AA meeting for me until Friday night but no worries I've got it!..IWNDWYT 
What is the prep school way of saying Where you from?
Struggle: being sober is hard when my family is trying to convert me back and making all kinds of wild and unfair judgments on me as a cohesive group merely because I don't share their faith...Triumph: Stared them down metaphorically instead of drinking. Normally Christianity is a trigger that makes me want a drink really bad but this time I'm just allowing it to pass...General: my relationship is going well and I'm grateful to have a loving partnership with the person of my dreams. 
Testing to see if I lost my flair...
