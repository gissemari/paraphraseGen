been struggling with this for a while finally realized i have a problem..  I can do just fine when out with friends to contain myself but lately I've been grabbing a 750 and drinking most or all of it in one evening has caused me a lot of problems lately so I've tried to stop can go a week or two without issues then convince myself I can have just a drink or two in one evening so I go buy a bottle and then well... you know what happens...Anyways good long time friend of mine just bought me a bottle as a thank you for helping him out didn't have the guts to tell him thanks but no thanks.  I'm sitting here just trying to fight the urge and found this subreddit while searching the web for help..  thought I'd post a message maybe get some solid advice/obvious reasons not to go down that road again...  ..just typing this out helps me but any tips would be nice....Thanks

4 days brother... I'd give it to a hobo or throw it down a well 
Hello. Welcome! Kudos for 4 days. I'd set it out on the curb or pour it down the sink. ..It helped me to remember what happens when I drink. I don't what that. How about you?
Pour it away. It's your gift. You can do what you want with it. We will not drink today!
Alright good so far thanks for help.  Been  out in the shop trying to stay busy..
