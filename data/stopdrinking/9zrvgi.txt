Just one one one - one  .To keep the Devil away  .One one one - one  .To be that admirable son  .But - one one one - where's the fun  .I'll count up just a few more  .One two three four  .Won't go back out that door  .One two three four  .Anything more and it's myself I'll abhor  .But then again my subtle friend  .It ought to be more  .Five six and seven and eight  .It's not me -   .It's the world I should hate  .I won't walk back through this door  .I'm gone for more and more and more  .Nine and ten and what comes after that again?  .Thought I'd be somewhere nice by now  .But it's all just getting black now  .Wait and wait and wait  .Asleep its pouring out of me  .With black eyes I'll wake swearing better days  .But just to make it there I'll need a little something  .Just one one one - one  .To keep the Devil away  .
