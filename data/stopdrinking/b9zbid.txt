I know however that one glass is more like 3 for me and any more than 2 glasses and I feel hungover and like crap. ..My sister just poured herself a large glass and I'm tempted to just  have a taste'...I am hoping for some words of encouragement......I will not drink with you tonight! ..

Fewer wine calories means more food calories. ..Eat allll the tasty Mexi food! IWNDWYT!
Seltzer with lime!  Much tastier and you won't regret it tomorrow.
I've been told  Malbec  means  bad taste  in French...I've tried a single sip of Malbec and that's all I need for my entire lifetime. See also: a single can of Bud Light (which as it turns out was my second drink ever.)
Mexican food doesn't really pair with wine anyway
