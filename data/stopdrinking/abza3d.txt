This time last year I was convinced that I would drink myself to death. I couldn't stay sober for more than 2 days. ..Thinking about being sober for even a week was impossible to imagine. The last few months I've been just pushing myself to make it to a year but my struggle isn't gonna end there. I find myself craving alcohol when I'm having a bad day and I think  just make it to a year . But today's the day. It's been 12 months and I don't know what will continue to motivate me. ..I'm determined to stay sober for as long as I can so I can finish my degree and ENJOY IT. ..My post here is a little pointless but I'm proud of myself and I'm wondering what else I can do to stay on track. Reading your stories here have been so helpful for me and i'm grateful to be a part of this community. IWNDWYT

Congratulations that's a huge achievement! If you're proud of yourself you could consider posting in our new sub r/PersonalPride!
Congrats!!! Have you ever read This Naked Mind? It helped me remove the desire to drink. Made this whole journey a little more bearable. Good luck in year 2!
Oh look at that pretty shiny star.
Not a pointless post at all: an incredibly inspiring encouraging post for those of us walking in your footsteps! IWNDWYT 
Sounds like you need some renewed motivation. Maybe one related to health a hobby or your career? I see you and you are doing great.
