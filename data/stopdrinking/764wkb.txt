I know it says 149 but I don't care. haha!!!  I'm going to celebrate today anyways!!!!..Another reason to celebrate is that today marks 800 days of not smoking...So for a person 47 year old male with the bad habits of smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and drinking 12 plus beers a day and I've lost 30 pounds......I'd say today is a good day to celebrate victories!!!!..You can do it.  You can make things different in your lives.  Fight for it.  YOU are worth it!!!! .I struggled yes I've had my emotional bouts that make me want to light up or take a drink.  Some were down moments and some were good moments and sometimes I'm tempted.  ..All I did was just to hold on for a little while longer.  Stop and think.  Sleep on it.  Take a walk.  There are things that we can do to keep us clean.  Make the decision and don't ever look back.  Your life depends on it!!!!
