I started drinking again a couple of weeks ago. My badge is not currently valid. On an IV for dehydration. Mind is fucked. It does not get better with drinking. I'm so sorry

Don't be sorry. Glad you're back and under medical care.
Glad you're here now.
So glad you are back. Please stay a while.

I for one need these reminders...I am glad you stopped before you fell all the way to the bottom though this seems like it might be close enough...
I'm sorry I feel selfish. Guilt is insane. I felt more guilt for making a selfish post for support. This sub has been helpful I will come back when I'm better and hopefully begin to help others with my experience 
I relapsed as well and you're absolutely right. It doesn't get better. And now I no longer have a clean background legally not to mention the fees jail time loss of driving privileges loss of trust of family and friends and all the other stuff that (deservedly) goes along with a DUI.
I hope you are feeling better soon and welcome back. 
I'm on day one right there with you. Two nights ago I was throwing up tallboys into a hedge in public. You are safe now and you can do this. WE can.
Sorry?? Are you kidding?? SD is my favorite place for so many reasons but more than anything it's because I know this community will accept me in good times and in bad; they will not make me feel guilty or unwelcome no matter what. So that being said please take this time in the hospital to get hydrated and get some rest. Take care of YOU. We're here for you - we've got your back. Hang in there friend it will get easier :)
I can understand your pain. I'm in a similar place just not in hospital thankfully. I'm glad you came here...I wont drink with you today.
