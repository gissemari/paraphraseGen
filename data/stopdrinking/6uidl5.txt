Turned 38 today.  First sober birthday in 20 years.  A lot of things have happened to get me to this point with a lot of breaks and relapses and I have a long way to go but I have never felt better.....I received a very indirect gift this morning.  Before my last move I purchased a pair of $200 Doc Martins in my size on a flash sale.  I just grabbed them without trying them on because flash sale.  They didn't fit.  They were too tight and painful.  Since a few days after I quit drinking I noticed I could see the veins and stuff in my feet more pronounced.  I pulled out the Docs and tried them on and they fit perfectly with some room to spare.  I wore them to work today for the first time.  The drinking had my feet and ankles so bloated and painful the didn't fit but they fit sober me perfectly.....For my next birthday I know what I want more than anything.  371 days sober.  I will not drink with you today.
