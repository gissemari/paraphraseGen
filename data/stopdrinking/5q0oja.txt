Today at work a guy I never talk to patted me on the back and said a few things to me.  I had never talked to this guy before.  As soon as I left I went "Wow....that guy def has struggled/is struggling with booze."  It happened again later in the same day a different guy who never really talks to me patted me on the back and said something.  I don't remember what it was but again I felt he knew...Maybe it's a vibe I give off maybe it's I am just starting to show my pain and people are reaching out and maybe I am crazy.  Whatever the case it felt weird.

One of the reasons I always knew I had a drinking problem is that I could spot another person with a drinking problem from a mile away.  :)   
you'll be agreat example of the solution and hope to them then..and yes I hadn't thought about this but yes I can tell and its depressing as shit. One reason Im so open about my recovery is basically to wave a banner that says "YOU DONT HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS"
