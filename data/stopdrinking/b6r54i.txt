I've attempted so many times over the last year to quite. My longest without was 12 days.  And I was really trying that whole time effort educated myself. Then I read an article that was entitled  How two weeks without alcohol changed my life . The article itself had nothing new to offer but the title made me realize I had never gotten through the beginning phase.  I decided to give it another go and do everything I can to just make it to two weeks.  I did it. I can't believe it but I say without hesitation week 3 was not perfect but WAY easier for me that week one and two.  The funny thing is I've read practically the same comment that I am writing before I guess we just have to experience it ourself to really believe.  for anyone who is struggling in the beginning my experience is just make it to two weeks. It's still a battle but a much less intense one.  Thanks everyone for your help.
