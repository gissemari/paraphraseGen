Hi all. I'm struggling and need some help. I'm doing much better than in the past but know it's a slippery slope. My question is: do any of you fine people know of an (android) app that allows you to record when you're having a craving...I've recognized that when I'm stressed I make the decision to drink subconsciously well before I make the explicit act of doing so. What I'd like to do is start to recognize sooner when I'm getting to that point so that I can supplant the desire to drink with a positive response...Would appreciate any suggestions!

Good observation. ..This is a very useful app for Android based on CBT (which I used to help myself quit via SMART handbook); [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stopp.submarine.gg&amp;hl=en\_GB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stopp.submarine.gg&amp;hl=en_GB)
To add on: Most of the apps I've found provide trackers and other useful features but none seem to have the option of taking note of when you're triggered and having a craving. That's what I'd like to have.
