It wasn't the last time I did drink one more day in May. But one year ago I dropped my now ex-wife off at the airport in the morning promptly drove to the liquor store went home and got drunk. All day. I drank scotch and vodka. Got drunk slept drank again slept drank again then slept. ..On Feb 2 I told myself that I was done drinking. March 15 my wife told me she was moving out and that was the first day I went to an AA meeting.  I knew I could not do it alone and I'm grateful for the help of my fellow alcoholics.  While I did relapse once in the last year I now no longer want to drink.  I have seen what my life was becoming and do not want to return to that dark path. And anytime I hear that voice in my head saying just one drink would be ok I know that I can call someone that helps.  I can't do it alone and thankfully I don't have to.
