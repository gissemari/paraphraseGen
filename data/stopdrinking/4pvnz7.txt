It absolutely is worth it. This subreddit is an amazing place to check into and hang out. Thank you to all of the people who post here! I did not drink with you all today and I'll be right back here not drinking with you tomorrow too. 
I second this statement. Sobriety is wonderful and so worth it. 
Co-sign...I hope y'all are having an incredible weekend!
I disagree it isn't magical unless you are on the pink cloud...Its better to build your sobriety on realistic expectations then hope...Although I used hope at the beginning... I guess its all about different stages that you go through..
Definitely worth it. My view of sobriety is that it gives you freedom to try to achieve the things you want to rather than being kept a prisoner by alcohol. The hardest thing I ever did as it took me ten years to stop but also the most important thing I've ever done.
