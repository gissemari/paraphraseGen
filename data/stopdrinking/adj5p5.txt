I drank over the weekend. Hosted a dinner party with some wonderful people who were drinking pretty heavily and failed the test. I think I have to admit to myself I'm not ready to be a host right now. I'm not the usual me the unsustainable me who does everything in a cloud of alcohol to make it feel sustainable but it's obviously a total lie. Alcohol zaps my energy the next day. Ruins my sleep. Causes irregular heartbeat and intense anxiety. Shreds my stomach to tatters and gives me pains on my right side that I know are my liver saying please stop. I'm learning that if I don't put my personal mental and physical health first I have nothing. Focusing on sobriety has to be number one or I have nothing. Then physical exercise conscientious eating then everything else. I have been known to take on way too much. I think I have to protect myself now or I will keep sliding backwards. If I can stay sober until my birthday that will be 14 days and will be my record despite what the badge says. It would be a nice present to give myself. I have had some really amazing sober days and nights. I know how to do this. Please higher power I hate the word god please help me. Even goddess is better. Been toying around with that as a name for the force bigger than myself that will help free me from my addiction. Or cosmos maybe. Or black hole. Dear black hole are you there it's me a chronic relapsing alcoholic who is desperate to get on the other side of this.

I had a good several relapses last year my first year actively working on sobriety. In October I was having to pull myself out of a horrific month long bender. My mindset was give yourself the gift of sobriety just do that at least. My birthday is this Wednesday and I will be celebrating 3 months. ..You can do this I believe in you. 
That is so wonderful! Good for you! Inspiring. I want that so bad.
