TL;DR there's pics at the end. ..I'm only a month in but it feels like forever (in a good way).  When I first started I was struggling to get over the hump and I felt like I needed some sort of pavlovian training the help be sober on more days.  ..So I figured I spend at least $15 a day on booze.  For every day I'm sober I'll put $10 into a fund for a gtx 1080 that I've wanted (this is a $700 dollar video card).  Every day I drink $10 comes out.  ..BUT THAT IS BORING!  A savings account?  Did I just make my reward a savings account?  No.  I should get a bunch of $1 coins and put them in a jar!  That'll be cool.  I'll get that casino slot machine pay off sound!  Now that's some operant conditioning.  ..BUT WAIT!  Why just some mason jar full of coins?  I should get a *trophy*! Something god damned ridiculous and glorious.  Something that will stare at me from across the room mocking me every time I drank.  Saying "you are no champion!  You do not deserve me!  Also I'm taking this ten bucks bitch.  Deal."..So what does my dumb ass do?  I buy a fucking Waterford Crystal vase which will be my sobriety treasure cup!..[Behold](https://imgur.com/a/I2wqT)

Hiya. It's a beautiful vase. I love Waterford Crystal. I have Waterford whiskey glasses and photo frames. They are gorgeous. Excellent choice of trophy u/BadgerFort.;-)
Clicked for obligatory scaling with banana. Leaves satisfied.
It's a beautiful thing long may it overflow with golden shiny coins!! May I commend you on you excellent choice of fruit for scaling purposes I have often favoured the butternut squash for jobs that require fine detail but no the banana is by far the best choice in these circumstances. Exemplary work   
This is very funny and absolutely awesome. ..Thanks for the banana cleared up many questions. ..Well done on the 28 days and I love your sobriety cup!
I love your idea!!!!   You deserve every gold coin!!
Shiny! I like it. Congrats on your month!
What a great idea!
One dollar at a time.

Love the idea!! 
And when you get your video card you can polish off the most elegant La Croix ever consumed from your vase.
This is awesome! What a great and unique way to be on the road of sobriety. Good for you!
You rock! I love this idea... I'm doing this!
Such a simple but effective idea.
