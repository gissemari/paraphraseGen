He got a DUI a month ago and told me about it after I told him about my decision to quit drinking. He's been struggling on his own for a while and kept it under wraps. He's asked me to lend him $7000 to help him pay for a lawyer which I initially agreed to but then recanted after he told me he still plans to keep drinking on the table. I advised him to get into therapy and take it easy and he threw a mini tantrum and basically said "This is why I don't want to tell anyone else in the family". ..&amp;#x200B;..Anyways I'm at a loss here. I hate what alcohol has done to my family but at the end of the day we are the masters of our own domain. IWNDWYT.

Sorry that you're going through this. It's your money and if you don't feel comfortable lending it to your brother because you don't agree with his decision to keep drinking that's totally your call to make. It's also up to him to make the decision to give up drinking. From personal experience lending money to family it's often messy and can ruin a relationship as well. So in the long term it might be for the best. What ever you choose to do I wish you all the best. IWNDWYT!
$7000 is a lot of money - and I bet he can get a personal loan if he hasn't lost his job from the DUI. 
You have really good boundaries. Iwndwy
