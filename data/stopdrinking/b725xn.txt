At this time over 3 months ago I was struggling to make it through the day without a drink. I was nauseated heart racing shaking sweating anxious and depressed with a million other horrible feelings and ailments from drinking so much. I wondered if I could make it through 1 day maybe even 2 weeks without a drink. I wondered if I could get through Christmas and all the related parties. Then my birthday several other parties St. Patty's Day... all the requisite drinking occasions I've been accustomed to imbibing for along with my daily inebriation...I couldn't believe today as I looked at my calendar that I was at 100 days. I've reached a point where I'm not counting each hour wishing the days away hoping that I didn't falter. I'm still staying vigilant but there are so many more effortless days where I might think about a drink but I'm not tempted. This bright clear eyed full energy life is the best life. I hope you all get to experience this and continue on with hundreds of more days along with me.
