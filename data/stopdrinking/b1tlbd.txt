- Alcohol steals time. I now have 2-3 extra and focused hours in the day because I am not "winding down" in the evening or "waiting to feel awake" in the morning. ..- Alcohol steals money. Not just cost of alcohol but it cost me consulting hours that were billable. I am obsessively honest about my hours and I could have taken on more clients. Opportunity lost but now regained...- Alcohol steals health. I ate junk food when I drank and I didn't go to the gym in the mornings when I was feeling wiped out from wine the night before. Now I'm working out and eating healthy food again. I've lost nearly 10 pounds and gained a bunch of lean muscle - something I never thought I could do in my 50s!..- Alcohol steals joy. After six months of no poison I've stopped taking a prescription for anxiety and used a bit of CBD oil if I feel any slight twinges but my mood is so much better these days overall!..- Alcohol steals mobility. I used to be housebound from 6pm onward if I was drinking wine because I have very strict self-imposed rules about drinking &amp; driving but that meant I went NOWHERE. Now I'm out to see shows go to fundraisers or anything else that happens in the evenings. ..It was hard at first &amp; took about 6 weeks for my body and brain to be convinced that there would be no wine at night but after every part got on board (thank you "This Naked Mind" &amp; "Alcohol Explained"!) the struggle was diminished significantly. ..I'm staying vigilant however. Last night someone handed me a "thank you" gift bag and in the bag was a bottle of wine. On the way home I had that odd thought of "It would be nice to have this with..." and I stopped myself and laughed but I put it out of sight &amp; will deal with it later. Then I received an email from my past self (thank you futureme dot org) saying how proud I am to hit the 6 month mark and it made me happy. I sent a note to myself in the future for my 1 year celebration. Knowing I'll get that note motivates me to stay on track...SD has been the wind beneath my wings and I thank each and every one of you for your courageous posts and your amazing replies. I tried stopping before but this group pushed me up to the REAL starting line. Here's to the next 6 months of sobriety and IWNDWYT!

Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself. Love the idea of sending yourself a note to be read at a later date! Have a great day Cat9tail!
Great update really well done. You are so right about it stealing time. 
Thank you! Your message gives hope   
I agree  I would spend my last bit of money on a bottle of cheap wine even tho I needed food to eat. I hate alcohol.
