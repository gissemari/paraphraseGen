.Today started so great. I had my first good sober sleep in a long time. I went for a nice drive. Then I started looking at my old hangouts and I got so depressed. It just hit me hard. Just the memories came flooding back from 12 years ago and I remembered how I felt and it was too much. I've held on to people who want nothing to do with me and I have no chance of reconciling with them. I can't get myself to accept that though. I need to move on but I can't. I won't drink over it. I put myself in a situation where I don't have access to booze. Soon I can call it a night and start a new day. .
