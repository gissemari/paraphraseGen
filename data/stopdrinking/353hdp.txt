Recently I've fallen off the wagon with my sobriety. Earlier this year I made it 73 days. Believe it or not I had a half a drink several weeks ago thinking it'd be fine. I didn't drink anymore that day but the idea festered in my head and I've one on several benders since then. ..I've referred to this latest episode as an "expiremental relapse." I'm not proud that I gave in to the urges but I'm thankful to have gone through the experience to have a firm reminder that I truly can't even have one drink. It really sucks to know that I have this major issue and will be an alcoholic for the rest of my life. However I've finally concluded that I can never drink again and I've accepted that...I know the road ahead of my is a long one but something I've learned is that I need help and encouragement from other alcoholics to stay strong and stick to my commitment to not drink. I'll start by not having a drink today!

Welcome and congrats on recommitting.  .Once I made the decision that I would never drink again it made things so much easier.  No more debates or negotiations because I don't drink.
Welcome! You seem to have the right attitude ;) Grab a badge and I'll join you on not drinking today. 
It's great you've reached a new realisation and acceptance...I've made my peace with having this lifelong condition I did it to myself through prolonged practice I can't undo it. Alcohol did me way more harm than good I'm happy to be free of it. I value the benefits of sobriety it's a fresh start at living.
Welcome back! My recovery has included a lot of relapsing and I try to learn from those relapses the best I can. It sounds like you are doing the same! You've got this!
