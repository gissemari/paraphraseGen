Good Morning..I've been following this community for some months now having read about it in the Huffington Post. The comments and stories inspire me so I have decided to join. Today is day 1 again after another relapse; I have no illusions about being a social drinker- I don't want to be one I just want to anaesthetise. I am getting professional help too I have simply decided to grab all the tools at my disposal.

Sick and tired of being sick and tired was one of my main reasons. Guess what? Not drinking made those both nearly go away! IWNDWYT

Welcome HH! Life without that alcohol monkey on your back is sooo worth the effort! You got this because you WANT this!

Glad you joined us! It is an amazing place to get support and it has been very motivating for me.
Thank you all so much for the lovely welcome. I'm afraid I drank again last night. I hate this; but I know that if I'm not honest about my behaviour I will never get there. And if I have to start again and again and again so be it. But I intend to check in every day.
