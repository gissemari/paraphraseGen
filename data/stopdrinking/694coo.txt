I quit drinking for almost a month. I always relapse around 25 days. Went to a work party and stayed sober at social hour and at dinner. I was so proud. Got back to the hotel and went down to the bar with my already drunk coworker. Stayed sober for about an hour at the bar. Decided one glass of wine wouldn't hurt. Several glasses later...total fail. Clock reset today. Disappointed again.

Try again! It's possible &amp; you can do it.
Your allowed to feel disappointed just don't let it dictate your future decisions. Just because you fucked up doesnt mean you will always fuck up. Life is one decision at a time. Just think of all the times you didn't drink in the days prior as small victories. Hold on to those not the "fuck ups". Trust me you are stronger than you think.
No shame in relapsing its the decision to get back on the horse that matters. My last relapse I stayed drunk for half a year good on you for coming back so soon. 
Thank you!
