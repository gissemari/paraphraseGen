Woke this morning thinking how the struggles in the early months have passed. It wasn't easy but one day at a time I now feel empowered...I choose not to drink...for me! What a great feeling.  .."Empowerment...the process of becoming stronger and more confident especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights."..A huge thank you to this community for keeping me focused and helping me cope with the roller coaster ride of the first few months. You helped me believe I could do this when I didn't believe in myself.
