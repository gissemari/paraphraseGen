Hello you beautiful people...&amp;#x200B;..I have been struggling with alcoholism for a little over a year now. I'm 25 years old and worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years. Any of you who have know that most everyone is a functioning alcoholic. Drinks before and after work and sometimes during. It is such a pervasive element that it has become a social norm. "Let's get drinks what a day" was a very common phrase to hear. ..&amp;#x200B;..I recently (December 20th) quit what I hope to be my last restaurant job. I did so in a way that I never have before: on the spot. But the money wasn't there and the atmosphere had really been fucking with me...&amp;#x200B;..Last year I alternated between being completely hammered to maintaining or the worst shaking violently sweating hallucinating and vomiting. I could be hung over for days at a time. I dropped out of a semester of college (community so fewer repercussions but still). I tormented my partner of 4 years with worry about my safety my whereabouts my inability to get my shit together. ..&amp;#x200B;..See we had been best friends since we were 17. We finally started dating when I was 21 and it was everything either of us had ever wanted in a relationship. So much respect and love growing together similar lifestyles and life goals. Then I let my anxiety get the best of me. I started drinking heavily occasionally. And- as most of you know the story goes- more and more frequently until I was drinking in the morning every day. I hid it well for the most part. But I was a fucking mess. It ruined my mental health. I forgot so much I constantly woke up panicked that I had lost something or had said/done something I otherwise wouldn't have. I would spend the first 30 minutes of each day trying to remember if someone was mad at me if I had ruined my job if I was in trouble... a total nightmare of stress constantly...&amp;#x200B;..We had been living together for 3 years. We broke things off over the summer and I moved out to my own place in the same city about a mile from where we lived. In August we decided to try again. Things were pretty hit or miss. They would be amazing while we were together like old times. But then I would do something stupid. He would call and I would be slurring my words. I wouldn't respond to texts because I couldn't really see or use my phone. All the usual things. He was incapable of feeling at ease. I would bounce around from being sober for a couple of weeks- acting and feeling like myself- to being practically incoherent for two or three days. No one wants to be that or be with that...&amp;#x200B;..Anyway that's the back story. I've been sober for all of this year except one day in which I got trashed and vowed never again. I can't do moderation. I know that a lot of you can't either. I meant to only have a drink or two and the next thing I know I'm so fucked up I fall down in my room and try to sleep on the floor much to my visiting best friend's dismay. ..&amp;#x200B;..Tonight he ended things for good. I expected it. We love each other deeply and respect each other even more somehow. But what we had was too damaged and things have been too inconsistent for far too long. I haven't really recovered...&amp;#x200B;..I have re-enrolled in school (biology) am looking for a job outside of the restaurant industry have completely cleaned and reorganized my entire house am really excited about the new changes that I am making that will hopefully make my life more stable and hopefully me by proxy. But... even though I expected it respect and understand it completely it still really reallyyyy hurts...&amp;#x200B;..It is the first time in 4 days I have seriously considered having a drink. I think about it everyday sure but this was the first time I was willing to break the promises I have made to myself. As soon as he left my apartment I looked at my roommate's liquor wistfully before snapping the fuck out of it. But still it looms. ..&amp;#x200B;..I am sad guys. A quiet kind of sadness. I know things with us would not ever really be the same or at least not in a time frame he was comfortable with. I want him to be happy. I don't say that because I am supposed to but because I love him as a person even more than I am in love with him. I mean it. But not having the person I have talked to everyday for almost 5 years in my life anymore will be extremely hard...&amp;#x200B;..Just... send some love maybe. Help me through the night. Tomorrow will be brighter...&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink with you today...&amp;#x200B;..TLDR: Boyfriend of almost 5 years broke up with me and I'm worried I'll relapse...&amp;#x200B;..Also- sorry if the formatting is all screwy.

I'm sorry for the loss of your relationship. And I'm sorry you're struggling right now. Remember to breathe. Remember to keep your chin up. Remember how good being sober feels compared to how awful getting drunk was. I'm sending you love and I'm here for you if you need someone to talk to I'm only a few years older than you but I relate to your story so much... and I believe that we can change. I believe in you.
{{Hugs}} Breakups suck no matter what the circumstances.  On Smart Recovery online under the Resources tab there are tons of tools for your tool box.  Play the tape forward is a good one.  In other words remember one of your more horrible experiences with the drink and just play the tape forward.  Do I want to go there?  Does this align with my goals?  They have free meetings too that are all about using the tools for sobriety. Two of the best books out are This Naked Mind (Podcast too) and Alcohol Explained.  IWNDWYT
