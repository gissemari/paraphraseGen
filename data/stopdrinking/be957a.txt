I'be been sober for more than 18 months. I didn't have a rock bottom rather I was just sick of feeling out of control and crappy so I spontaneously gave up drinking after a really rough night that left me hungover and feeling full of shame. ..I'd say about 80 percent of the time I feel really good about not drinking. I love never being hungover the increased productivity feeling present with my children and spouse not having to worry about driving no risk of damaging my health never having to wonder what I did or said in a blackout...But around 20 percent of the time I kind of beat myself up. I feel like a failure for being unable to occasionally enjoy a couple of beers (like my wife can do) and I feel like my issues with alcohol are just another thing that make me broken (like my struggles with anxiety/depression which I take meds for).  This warm weather which I associate with drinking to relax is also a major trigger...Does anyone else ever feel the same way? I guess it comes down to feeling good when it feels like a choice and feeling bad when I feel like it's something I have to do.

The time of year is triggering for me too. I feel you on the difference between it being a choice vs something you have to do. I try to keep deprivation words out of my vocabulary (I don't drink vs I can't drink). I'm also thinking of rereading the books I have about it (Alcohol Explained and This Naked Mind) b/c maybe I need a refresher. I know in the past they helped me feel more free of alcohol vs deprived of it.
I too deal with anxiety and depression and likely PTSD at this point. I have tried to find a way to see this as something that makes me strong instead of as a weakness or a flaw. It's hard and I am often really hard on myself and that was likely part of the reason why I drank. I'm working hard at being kind to myself. ..I like what u/fmranger said about avoiding deprivation words. ..My life has been out of control and stopping drinking was a way to regain a sense of control. I choose to not drink. Choice is empowering. ..I will not drink with you today. Congratulations on 18 months sobriety!!
