Good luck man. Hope it works out okay for you.
well you might be the one person in the whole world that is able to moderate. Are you feeling lucky?.
I've been trying moderation for years and today I give up. I can't moderate. I will not drink today. 
Meh I had a couple shots on super bowl sunday. I didn't get much of a buzz just raging heartburn. Haven't wanted a drink since. I still consider myself sober since 1/1/18
If you think moderation will help you are already too far into this. ..Do not bother trying. Just go immediately to "I'm retired."
It didn't work for me. And finally letting go of the fantasy of it has been an incredible relief. ..Keep coming back you are always going to be welcome here...Best of luck with whatever you choose..
Just keep checking the sub regularly. I've said this too.
