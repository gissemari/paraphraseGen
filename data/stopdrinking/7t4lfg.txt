I made it three weeks until I had a terrible day and relapsed. Felt terrible mentally and physically ever since. Never again.

Remember how you feel take a picture of how you look. Use this day or last night as a reminder that you want to quit. You didn't fail you just gained some experience.
One day at a time... you can do this!!.IWNDWYT
FAIL = First Attempt In Learning..I relapsed as well. One thing to do to keep on track is think about what you can do differently this time around. Form me it was picking up a copy of This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. ..Best of luck!
No shame on you keep working you will do it! IWNDWYT
Welcome back!
