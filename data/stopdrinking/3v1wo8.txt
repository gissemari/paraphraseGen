When I stopped drinking in August I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far without a relapse. But somehow I did it. I tried to set goals for myself: get through today get through this week get through this month get through another month. ..Some how I made it this far. It hasn't been easy at all. But when I am tempted to drink and I've definitely been tempted I remind myself of all the blackouts the two day hangovers the vomiting the lost wallets the lost phones the lost car! and then the thought of another drink grosses me out...Thanks to all of you for this forum to discuss these things. Reading about all of your struggles and strategies and optimism is a  big factor in my sobriety and I appreciate it a lot.

Congratulations!!  That's a good tip to reflect on all the awful things that happened.  I once ran into my closed bedroom door and fractured my nose in a drunken stupor.  
The baby steps that often get brought up have helped me a lot every day. I love goal setting but it was too scary for me to set anything beyond the next day - every day was going to be about not having a drink on that day and celebrating that victory by going to sleep sober and waking up feeling normal. ..This sub has been key to recovery as well. Things I felt were so abnormal wrong and made me so hard on myself were all shared feelings and thoughts of others. It's not just me it's a toxic substance. ..Anyways congrats on 100 and especially congrats on thinking clearly about the reality of alcohol vs. the mirage your brain can sometimes create. 
Hail new centurion!
Nice!  Great work.  
Good job!
