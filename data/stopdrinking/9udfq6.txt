Good morning lovelies    Today I am 50 days sober. I honestly cannot believe that I have made it this far. I began my sober journey about a year ago (with many many half assed attempts that led me to relapse) and I finally have made it past a month plus some. I never ever thought this would be possible. I couldn't make it more than 7 days. It has not been easy but for whoever is reading this - please know that IT IS possible to get sober. ..Changes have already started happening. My skin is glowing like it never has before I've lost weight I feel present and for once I feel in control. I feel like I've finally escaped the hell I was living in for a almost a decade. ..With the help of anti anxiety meds and therapy I am finally taking the steps to become who I was meant to be. I am learning to love myself. I wouldn't trade sobriety for anything. I am holding onto this feeling of hope. ..For anyone out there struggling today I believe in you you can do this. Keep fighting and stay strong. Life is so much more beautiful on the other side of alcohol. I promise. ..IWNDWYT   ..
