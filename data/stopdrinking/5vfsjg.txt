Ugh... Many of you know that r/StopDrinking has a [IRC channel](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/)... There are a bunch of us that use the IRC more often than we use the subreddit. Well there are a bunch of regulars that show up on a consistent basis. Some come and go as they relapse others stick around and the new ones enter and are greeted by the goose game and other quirks of instant chat. Through it all we have a close knit community and we love our channel dearly. I have recently had a [babby](http://i.imgur.com/21h9E2e.jpg) and have not been around as much in the past few months. But I know my friends and they know I've been busy.  .  .I just found out today one of our own **i0n** passed away earlier this month. He was mostly always friendly a semi-annual relapser but always upbeat about beating it this go around. He was one of us. He loved the chat rooms he loved to discuss anything and everything but whenever a newcomer came to the room with a cry for help; he'd be one of the first to quiet down the non-sense chatter. I am not going to doxx him in death but I will quote the paraphrased coroners report:  .  .> Alcoholics and others with liver disease can also suffer from exsanguination. Thin-walled normally low pressure dilated veins just below the lower esophageal mucosa called esophageal varices can become enlarged in conditions with portal hypertension. These may begin to bleed which with the high pressure in the portal system can be fatal. The often causative impaired liver function also reduces the availability of clotting factors (many of which are made in the liver) making any rupture in vessels more likely to cause a fatal loss of blood  .  .None of us want to believe that we will die. None of us want to believe that our drinking has consequences. Sadly this is not the truth. All of us have another drink within us but do we all have another chance at sobriety???   .  .Oh the mind will play tricks on us. My mind tells me all the time that I too can moderate like most folks out there. i0n also thought moderation was possible. "I was never that bad..." Well the reality is this: mere chance is in the way of a drunken death. Are you 100% certain that you can come back after you have already once admitted you have a problem drinking? I know I am not 100% certain let alone 50%...   .  .I will be grieving the loss of my friend. I hope his death is not in vain and it gives someone the needed courage to not drink today.  I love you all and wish all of you many sober happy days. 
----------immediate responses--------

thank u for your message and sorry for your loss.
This is chilling news the consequences of drinking can be very real. I'm very sorry for the loss of your friend and the loss to everybody in the chat community.
I have no words. For someone who's felt on the brink of relapsing several times over the past 8 months it's truly scary to think how close we all could be if we gave in when the cravings start fighting back. Thank you for sharing and sending digital positivity out to all those hurt by the loss of their friend. 
Very sad to hear of a good friend's passing. You'll be missed i0n...Not drinking with all of you today.
Dang - sad to hear this and scared too. Denial is a bitch (this is a reference to my own denial!!)..RIP.
Thanks for sharing. It's these stories that hit it home for me. 
Thank you so much. Sometimes a dose of reality is what I need to hear. I'm also someone who goes long periods without drinking to find myself once again stringing together a year or two of heavy drinking.....Note to self: I do not drink without consequences The next time may be fatal.
I'm lurk on this subreddit because I work in healthcare and see the consequences of alcohol often -- the shakes the seizures yellow eyes terrible swelling in the abdomen and scrotum. Liver failure is an ugly thing. The variceal bleeding the OP is talking about can literally result in a scene that is straight off a horror film set - blood everywhere. Many of those I encounter have either no desire or no ability to stop drinking. I'm a lurksr here not because I have an alcohol problem but to steal encouragement from all of your stories so I can maintain compassion and hope for those I see. It also reminds me that some who struggle with alcohol abuse are successful and manage to quit. It's easy to falsely think that no one succeeds....Anyway just wanted to post because this story hit close to home. I wish you all the best in your goals. 
Thank you for sharing this I will take it as a potential outcome if I continue to abuse my body with alcohol.  I am sorry for your loss and the sad death of i0n.
I'm so sorry. Thank you for sharing this. It really resonated with me.  
Wow. I am typically a lurker here. I have my own demons with alcohol. Bounced in and out of AA. Relapsed more times than I'd care to admit and this hit me especially hard. Thank you for posting it. I've always had this "it could never happen to me" mentality. I had that mentality all the years I binge drank in college that eventually turned into a full blown problem. It is that exact sort of mentality that will lead to an ugly death if I don't stop for good. It is a mentality I must change. This is something I feel I needed to see and I'm glad I did. I am sorry to hear of the passing of your friend. 
I will not drink today in his honor...Moderation is a terrible temptress.  I still have thoughts regularly about the idea of someday being able to moderate and I eventually determine that I should not can not and will not moderate.  But it's the time between the tempting thought and the eventual logic that scares me and keeps me coming back to this sub for reminders and reaffirmation.  So thanks for sharing this.  It does help me.  ..It's just so very sad.
This hits home for me. My grandma died this same exact way when I was 8 and I remembered although I guess I block it out. I'm so sorry for your loss. I recently came back from a 2 week binge so thank you for writing this. I'm glad I clicked this link because I needed to read this. We do think that we will come back. For me I know this is hereditary. With my grandmas alcoholism and an aunt and uncle that are current addicts I am playing with fire. I'm only on day 2 but I have to dump my alcohol stash. This is the push I need. ..Again I'm sorry for your loss. 
This is very humbling. I am so sorry for your loss. Today I'll not drink for i0n.
I am so sorry for the loss of iOn I didn't know him but he sounds like he was a great person.  We all have a problem that tries its best to have us and we fight it as hard as we can.  Good for iOn for keeping up that fight until the last day and thank you for sharing his story to remind us what's at stake with sobriety.  I'll be thinking about him the next time I am tempted to pick up a drink.
This indeed is sad news...I mourn iOn 's passing...Thank you for this post.  I choose to see it through the lens of a Memorial a tribute to his caring nature a reminder of the very thin line between the mortal world and the next.  Mostly I choose to see it as a way to Honor iOn.  This tragic column regarding his demise can touch and help many herein including me...My brother had developed esophageal varices and had hepatic hypertension.  He couldn't stop drinking and wouldn't accept help *even though his life would be deemed "successful" by an outside view".  He took his own life...Since his passing countless of his friends and our relatives have reached out to me to confide that they too fear they have a drinking  issue.  ..Let us not let iOn's passing my Brother's passing and the countless others who slip through this thin veil be in vain...I will forgo Today just ONE drink - The First One..Thank you for posting what I suspect was a difficult and important post.
Wow. I am speechless...almost. What a shame that the drink has taken iOn from us I hope he finds peace now. No one ever plans on being an alcoholicbut we all ended up sick with this addiction. Many of us are recovering  in a life long journey indeed. I hope this post encourages us all to stay on course and weather any storm we encounter along the way. I feel sad reading about a person I never knew yet happy that his passing will somehow help the rest of us see the light. .Today I will not drink in this person's honour. 
Thank you for posting this.  ..I have been to too many funerals to see relapse as a casual event.  **It is always potentially fatal.**..In some ways my drinking/drugs can be summed by "I drank until I couldn't get away with any longer."  fortunately for me it was in time...I've tried the IRC channel in the past but as an old fart can't seem to get the hang of it - I am glad it is there and there are those like you who frequent it - as it reaches out to those who need it.
Wow I'm sorry to hear about the passing of iOn. I didn't really know him but he could have easily been me over the years. I don't know how many hundreds of times I've relapsed in my life but I know I am lucky to be sober today. I needed to read this today as I have been almost romanticizing the drink lately. I've never been sober this long in my life and I truly have no desire to drink but there's been a tiny little voice in my head lately that says "maybe?" Fuck that voice. Maybe I should check out the chat room some time. I have been posting and reading on this sub for over 2 years now and I've never been in the chat area. Not even sure how it works.
:(
Thank you for posting this. Barely got one day under my belt last week only to immediately fall back in. This is what I needed today. I need to read this post daily...I'm not going to drink today.
Thanks for sharing this. I will not drink today.
The folks in that chat are lifesavers.  I have had a couple nights when I felt so down in the dumps that I couldn't remember why I wanted to be sober.  I popped into the chat and I was treated to a combination of compassion and humor that lifted me out of the mire of self-pity and had me laughing through my tears.  Learning of the death of one of our compatriots tonight there are only tears.  
Thank you for this post everytime. I am so addened to hear this. I0n was an awesome soul. May he rest in greatness and eternal peace...That babby gives us every reason to be sober. Whether they are our own children or the community's children they need loving responsible adults to guide them. 
"Well the reality is this: mere chance is in the way of a drunken death."  This is so true and I plan to pass it along to someone who recently decided to play Russian Roulette with his sobriety.  
I just heard of another person that died the same way even though he had given up drinking some time earlier. It's scary dangerous stuff. And like the book says "cunning baffling powerful." Despite all my problems with the stuff I still dream about being able to drink it. Gotta be careful folks. 
His death is not in vain. I cry in grief &amp; gratitude as I read this for I knew this was soon to be my fate. After 25 years of misery I was having choking esophageal spasms and I read extensively on this diagnosis in the hopes I'd be "scared straight." My Higher Power AA CR and now SD rescue me and keep me sober now one day at a time. Thank you for sharing this story.
I am sad to hear of i0n passing. I can relate to his situation. I stopped drinking the first time when I was 25 through an intervention in 1998. I remained sober and in 2000 I was on a flight to Mexico for a start-up at work and my esophageal varices broke open due to the increased pressure at take-off. I passed out on the flight and awoke covered in blood with horrified passengers around me. I didn't know what was going on so when we stopped in Dallas for a flight change I decided not to continue on to Mexico and got back on a flight to home. During the flight back there were only about 20 people on the plane and I repeatedly asked the flight attendant for water but she never brought it. I believe that if she would've brought me water I would've died on that flight. When we landed my parents picked me up and while we were driving back on the highway I opened a bottle of water and began to drink it. The water dissolved the clot that had formed and in a minute I passed out again. The last thing I remember before passing out is my mother reaching over the back of my seat to hold up my head as blood exploded out of my mouth and down the front of my shirt. I was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital and then life flighted to the Cleveland Clinic where they saved my life. I had extensive "bandings" done to my esophageal varices back in the early 2000's where they actually took rubber bands and "shot" them onto the enlarged blood vessels which stops the blood flow through that vessel and kills it leaving scar tissue. I have not had any issues since then. Ultrasounds on my liver have revealed cirrhosis. I only drank really hard for a about 3 years in my early 20's so the onset of cirrhosis seemed surprising to the doctors..I then stayed sober for 12 years until I took a trip to Europe in 2010 where I thought: "When in Rome..."  .I have remained in an annual pattern of relapse/sober/relapse/sober for the past few years..I just wanted to share. I hope you all have a great day......
Thanks for posting that. It is a good stron reminder. I quit because of liver problems and high blood pressure. My numbers have returned to normal but it's posts like these that keep my head on straight. 
My buddy from treatment just passed away from his alcoholism. He was only 36 years old. He really wanted to get better too. It was just too late.
It's such a weird feeling. Never met y'all before and I'm fairly new to this subreddit. Yet I feel like I owe it too y'all and myself too continue with my sobriety. It feels like we all lost a dear friend to this demon. Rest In Peace 
ruptured esophageal varicies is the most common cause of death in patients living with liver cirrhorisis and one of the most common common causes of death in alcoholics...it occurs through something called portal hypertension
Congratulations 
My thoughts with this guy rest in peace 
Wow for the first time ever I have understood the meaning of the expression a sobering experience in this post you have created a sobering read literally...Thank you for posting this and thankyou to all of our redditor family who have shared your health consequences related to drinking.  You made me rethink. My younger brothers alcohol issues he is sober for now but I need to support him more around the health issues he has from years of heavy drinking.  He does not look well.  Thank you for the prompt...I am sorry for your loss...On a slight tangent here now: your baby is beautiful. Congratulations...
I'm sorry for you loss. It's a sad reminder of what we're dealing with here.
There are many many ways that this condition can kill us. Cirrhosis we know about and the horrors of other conditions including this one about ruptured blood vessels.  ..But there are others. Many many others. Automobile accidents whether driving or stumbling out into traffic. Cops will tell you that an incredibly high percentage of violent incidents involve intoxicants.  ..Then there's the "head-in-the-sand" attitude that many practicing alcoholics have toward our health. We ignore signs and delay seeing a physician and when we do we lie to them. I wonder how many times a doctor has said to an alcoholic "If only you had come to see me a year ago we may have been able to do something."  ..And then there's the 800lb gorilla in the room that nobody cares to discuss: Suicide. Taking our own lives is not a rational act but when we're drinking we don't think rationally. Thousands of people kill themselves every day and I bet a majority of them are intoxicated when they do.  ..Why relapse? Why indeed?  ..Tonight I am going to a pub for a trivia night. I'll be drinking non-alcoholic beverages while I do but could I successfully moderate if I tried? Almost certainly.  ..Could I successfully moderate the next five times? Probably.  ..Could I moderate the next 25 times? Maybe.  ..Can I successfully moderate my consumption of alcohol forever and ever? No way. No way in hell. There's no way I can can do that I just can't.  ..So why relapse if I know for certain that someday I will fall right back into the hole I worked so hard to crawl out of? Why relapse if I know that the ONE beer I have tonight will place my life at serious risk? Is that beer worth it?  ..Not to me it isn't. On December 7 2012 I wanted to kill myself. So I went to my first AA meeting on Dec 8th.  ..It's February 25 2017 and I am not having a beer tonight because I don't want to die.
I am not 100% certain I can stop again.  Man that was a great post.  Thank you
His death is not in vain. My husband left for work &amp; I was sitting in bed so wanting to drink. But I came here instead. What if I was about to drink (or anyone here) unknowingly it was our last time (it only takes one relapse to spur a chain of events in your body) but read this story &amp; decided not to drink? I will not drink for i0n today.
