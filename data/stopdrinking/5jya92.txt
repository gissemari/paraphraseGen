I didn't drink!!! Yesterday was my company Christmas party and as difficult as it was... I didn't drink! I remember reaching out to SD last year regarding this issue. Many gave me advice and this year it paid off!! Thanks!

Awesome! Great job resisting the "free" drinks what they lack in price they make up for in regrets for me at least not worth it at all!
Great NDV! I'm not sure I would have been able to handle it quite as well. Kudos!
