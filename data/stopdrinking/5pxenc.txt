I'm not asking for medical advice so much as whether anyone else has had this happen.  Usually my detox period is four or five days and this time was no different. It's the last time I ever want to feel that way and I've been cycling back and forth through sobriety and heavy drinking for several years.  This last relapse was really hard to stop because I was afraid of how bad the detox would be but I made it through...Then a day or two after finally feeling better again I started getting these weird headaches that feel more like fire ants crawling in my skull than any detox or hangover headache I've ever had. I worried it might be a second detox from the meds I took but benzo withdrawal is apparently a lot more severe and Xanax doesn't do anything. My worry is that it's blood pressure and I'm going to get that checked out(I was prescribed beta blockers for anxiety and have been taking those again without much effect). I don't have tremors anxiety racing heart none of the usual withdrawal symptoms. ..I'm starting to think I've been numbing myself so long I've forgotten what it feels like to just have normal headaches.  Has anyone else gone through something like this after recovering?  I know alcohol does a lot of damage to the brain that can heal over time as well as more severe damage that won't(I have an uncle whose hands still shake because his drinking caused permanent nerve damage).  I'm probably worrying over nothing but I'm used to worrying with good reason after years of worrying I should stop drinking and stay stopped.  Maybe venting about it will help take it off my mind.

I have had bad headaches for three weeks. It sucks. I am just here to commiserate. ..On the upside my headaches have been so awful I haven't wanted to drink.
