So I've been sober for 500 days! Which seems crazy to me. So much has changed in that time. I've changed as a person (for the better). .Some days have been easy others not so much. On the run up to my 500 days I struggled I think in my head I'd gone so long it made me hyper aware of it and I became consumed with thoughts of alcohol. Luckily I pushed through and feel much better now. ..In these past 500 days life has improved so much. .I've lost 60kg.I've stopped waking up with no memory of the night before.I've grown in confidence.I've saved      .I've started running.I just took part in a triathlon!!!.I volunteer to do things.I've learned to enjoy people and events without being drunk.I've started actually experiencing life rather than numbing it..It's been life changing. ..But I still know one drink would start me back down a path where I lose everything. ..Stay strong guys

Congrats friend!

Congrats!!! :D
"I've started actually experiencing life rather than numbing it"...This statement is a very profound one for to hear. I have two small daughters and I don't want them to grow up with a numbed-out zombie-hangover dad. ..I'm inspired by your story. Thank you for sharing it with us....IWNDWYT
