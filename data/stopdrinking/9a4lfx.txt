I have 5 months and some change and life is good. However I want to drink. I want to try again. I'm holding on for today.

The urges will pass as I'm sure you already know.  Hold on for one of those moments that remind you why you are sober.  ..IWNDWYT 
Five months sober what a huge accomplishment! You've made it this far and that's amazing! Keep taking it one day at a time. For tonight enjoy your life and all the beautiful things that your sobriety has bought to that good life. For tonight choose yourself over alcohol. You're worth it.
One minute at a time. Meditation. Breathing.
You got this. At day 163 you know the cravings inevitably give way to that sense of strength and steadiness that only grows over time. It's just around the corner. 
I really REALLY struggled with not drinking today too. I'd been doing pretty well this week and it completely caught me by surprise tonight. Now I'm feeling rattled but thankful I didn't give in...Don't let your guard down friend and just get. through. today. We can do this. We have to.
