Looking for advice about drinking urges. I never had real urges to drink when I was drinking but when I stopped I felt some. It would come mostly at night when I was alone over the first week or so. Then it died down and I haven't felt any strong urges except a few special occasions. But the last 3 days I have really really wanted a glass of whiskey. It's been a frustrating few days and I think my mind is going back to an old coping mechanism since the new ones aren't working...I guess my real question is: Do you guys feel urges in waves? Like do they come sometimes fade off for a while then you find yourself having them again? I just feel so crazy because I felt so in control for the last several weeks and now I'm struggling hard again...But still haven't caved. One day at a time I'll fight these urges off!

I started having some urges after hardly any in the last 3 months since I stopped. I'm just gonna ride it out and take it one day/one hour/one minute at a time. And also keep coming back to this sub every day. IWNDWYT
For me they have decreased in frequency and somehow I feel like they may never go away completely. I keep chocolate and sparkling water on hand at all times and I regularly consume them to keep urges at bay.
Ice Cream and nonalcoholic Ginger Beer and Ginger Ale has been a life saver!  Additionally it also helps me to know that the urges are just feelings that will eventually pass.  IWNDWYT 
Just like the urges will come... they will also go.  Keep practicing hanging on through the urges one at a time and the days will pile up!
I still get urges on occasion even after 2years.  I've learned to let them pass and remember what things were like before I stopped drinking.  They may never go away  but I don't have them very often anymore.
