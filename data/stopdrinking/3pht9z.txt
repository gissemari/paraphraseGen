I lurked here for a few weeks and have been posting on comments for the last few days so thought I should introduce myself and say hello!..Firstly I'm so glad to have found this sub. The information encouragement and reaffirmation of what I've known I think and feel is immeasurably valuable to me. It's made such a difference to my life making the decision to quit indefinitely and the progress I'm making doing so...I'm fed up of doing the stressful quitting for a short time trying to moderate and descending back into self destruction merry-go-round. It's not fun and I'm getting off it! It kept sucking me back into depression making my anxiety go through the roof and generally destroying my mental as well as physical health. ..I've thankfully due to the kindness patience and faith my supervisors have in me still clung onto my graduate degree program registration and I'm just in the process of beginning to write up the thesis I wasn't sure I'd ever begin to write let alone complete. My battle with myself and alcohol almost cost me one of the things I've worked towards most of my adult life and that offers me the chance of my dream career and opportunities. I can't believe I almost let it slip away and totally sabotaged myself with drink. I had a lot of bad things happen 3/4 years ago that resulted in things slipping and my alcoholism getting much worse. I was understandably traumatised at the time and had to go through the recovery process for that but without the alcohol I would of bounced back from all of that much sooner and better. It's made the mountain to climb up back from all of that exponentially harder and more painful...Mo more wasted days regrets shame & embarrassment anxiety about how I'm increasingly screwing things up and still letting it get worse depression. No more getting better to fall back down because I think I'm fine and can drink for fun again. It doesn't work for me no matter what anyone else thinks. I've been told so many times I don't need to do this it's infuriating. I now know to trust I know what's right for me. (I'm 28 in the UK people think I've totally lost my mind to do something as extreme as to suggest quitting drinking). Fortunately I did the really difficult first week after a months of drinking heavily again a few week ago then had a slip up in between however it's made these fresh four days not so bad. I almost really messed things up with work last time I relapsed which was the final thing to really startle me into action as things haven't been functional anymore. ..I'm going to embrace sobriety and gradually regaining my ability to think clearly and I'm going to write my thesis! And likely hang out in here on my breaks : )

I'd say you have totally FOUND your mind by deciding to take the radical step of cessation of ETOH overdosing your body and brain.  Good for you.  In case it helps and in the unlikely event that you haven't already come across this--[these are the Baby Steps which are a guide to next actions](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) based on what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  Best of luck.
