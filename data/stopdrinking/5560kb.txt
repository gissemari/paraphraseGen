Good morning everyone! Happy Friday! Here's Fridays Quote fresh off the press.   ..**theme** change   ..**quote** "without a struggle there can be no progress" - Frederick Douglas     ..This reminds me of something I tell myself often whenever things in my life don't go the way I planned or don't come easily. When you're changing your entire *life* it WILL be difficult. There WILL be set backs. Did you think overcoming years of inertia would come easily now that you've decided to change direction?    ..Keep to the good fight. If it's in the way of making you happy then you owe it to yourself to overcome it. ..Stay cool everyone. I gotta get to bed. Can't seem to kick this cold.    ..Not Today

Thank you!! I needed this quote today. I have so much stress from getting grad school applications ready that I almost wonder if it's all worth doing. It would be so much easier to just keep the status quo. ..But then I said the same about getting sober right? And look how worth it it's been. 
Frederick Douglass would know!
Sometimes I have to remember that I am the only one making it difficult. Today I am going to work on getting out of my own way...Thanks for a wonderful quote! Happy Friday!
