I saw it late night on Turner Classic Movies and I'm not sure where to get  a copy.  It is one of the best animated shorts I've ever seen.  Anyone struggling with alcohol addiction will appreciate this film.  Any help?...>"This animated short outlines the problems with alcohol consumption despite its social acceptability in western society. It provides a cursory look at how easily alcohol is produced and the physiological effects of alcohol on humans especially when it enters the bloodstream. It delves further into the process of drunkenness. Although few people die from overdosing on alcohol it describes other direct and indirect dangerous effects of alcohol consumption such as drinking and driving. It also lists the many reasons why people drink for good and bad. Drinking becomes a vicious circle when one looks for reasons to drink to the exclusion of all else these people who are alcoholics. For them abstinence is the only answer."..IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2826382/..**UPDATE:** Found it on a compilation called BOOZERS & LOSERS VOL 03 - DVD-R:  http://www.somethingweird.com/product_info.php?products_id=24052..By the way [Something Weird Video](http://www.somethingweird.com/about_us.php) looks friggin awesome.
