One year ago today I woke up on the sofa at 3 am with a head-splitting hangover.  I had started drinking at 1 pm the previous day and had passed out probably sometime around dinner time.  I staggered into my bedroom and checked my iPhone to find 6 text messages from my boyfriend who was frantically trying to reach me as he'd been travelling all day and wanted to let me know that he had arrived safe at his destination.  This was a ritual we were used to as we both travelled a lot with work. This time however I knew he'd be flying all day so the alcoholic in me decided that this was a perfect opportunity to get plastered alone during the daytime and  do something creative or productive' at the same time   What I got the following morning was a filthy kitchen a migraine multiple text messages from my boyfriend voice messages from him asking if I'd been drinking and if I was okay  My boyfriend had defaulted to assuming that I was drunk and not well when I did not answer the phone.  And it was upon realizing this that I finally decided that I had had enough.  I was sick of the humiliation and tired of continually letting myself and those around me down with my drinking...For 8 years I had lived like this.  Hangover after hangover getting up for work binging on weekends white knuckling through Sundays convincing myself that I had it all under control. I had quit several times for a few weeks at a stretch but always went back when I got bored or when the bottle would tap me on the shoulder on a Friday evening.  During the last few years of this eight-year period however things got really bad. And I mean terrifying.  They say that alcoholism is a progressive disease and I can attest to this.  There was a time when I would get drunk and have a great time. Then this moved to drinking and doing something stupid then drinking alone when I knew my drinking was socially unacceptable then blacking out then writing incomprehensible emails then seeing an aspect of my personality come out that was completely unfamiliar to me and so on.  By the end of this period I was engaged in a completely neurotic dance with myself every morning as I was blacking out every night and could never remember what I did.  Each morning saw me checking sent emails text messages Facebook posts to see what insane things I had said. I was also paranoid sometimes that I had expressed things that it had turned out I had not.  I wasn't sleeping more than 4 hours a night.  Every night as the alcohol wore off I'd wake up at 1 or 2 am with terrible insomnia and I'd wait the 4 hours until I had to get up for work. In addition to this most weekend mornings would see me shaking so badly that I could barely walk through the house.  My anxiety levels were through the roof and I was afraid to go outside.  One day I stared at the wall for hours as I was convinced it was breathing.  I was also 20 pounds overweight and my eyes were permanently red and tired looking.  That was what excessive alcohol consumption did to my brain and my body.  But I still didn't stop until one year ago when I realized that I was hurting the man that I loved.  I was hurting someone who actually loved me too and who wanted to see me get better.  So I stopped.  And it was hard...The first month for me was the toughest and saw me in bed pretty much every evening as my mind and hands did not know what to do with themselves.  My system had always been to cork my first bottle of wine every night at 5 pm and tinker on the computer or actually work or study while drinking.  This was before phase 2 of the evening which involved a second bottle of wine and a black out.  Sobering up and getting used to coming home and  depriving' myself of wine was terrible at first and what worked the best for me was confining myself to bed with movies and my laptop.  I took sleeping tablets to help me sleep and after about 2 weeks I actually started to sleep through the night again. After a month of bed rest I became bored and restless so I made my way back into the living room and kitchen where the craving for a bottle was patiently waiting for me like an abusive boyfriend sitting drunk on the couch and he presented me with a total of 3 significant cravings in the months that followed.  Each one of them hit hard and I still remember how manipulative and calculating my own brain was.  You see I had a great deal of associations with alcohol that I had to break in order to  move on with my life'.  I felt I deserved to drink if: I had accomplished something; I had failed at something; I was going to create something; I was going to cook; I was depressed; I was happy; I was nervous; I was celebrating; I was mourning etc  Any time any of these types of daily emotional or intellectual shifts occurred my brain wanted alcohol.  So how did I deal with it?  I called my partner whom I treated like my priest during the first few months and I confessed every dirty little detail to him.  I told him that I wanted to go get wine and that I planned to sip it in the sun-room alone and not tell him about it when he was away.  I told him that I was negotiating with myself again thinking that if I could just measure out reasonable 5 ounce rations every 30 minutes that I could control it and keep it together.  My partner talked me down each time I had a craving and walked me through every step of how that night of drinking would play out from walking in the door of the wine store to waking up sick and hungover. By the end of our chats I felt the craving weakening and would find something else to occupy my time.  I consumed a lot of junk food and sweets in the first few months to fill the perceived void that alcohol left in my life.  I also found r/stopdrinking on Reddit during these first weeks and spent night after night poring over posts telling the same stories and asking the same questions that I was.  I was definitely not alone in this...After the first 3 months had passed I believe I was over the worst of it as far as physical and mental cravings were concerned.  I stopped having cravings after approximately 4 months and was able to go out and order sparkling water with dinner and even hang out with friends who had glasses of wine with their dinner.  I started to take pride in my sobriety and I wore it like a badge of honour.  I slowly started to tell friends and family one by one that I wasn't drinking any more and I told them why as well: because I have a problem. Some people take it better than others when I tell them that I've quit drinking and I'm okay with that.  My own mother cannot even say the  A' word as I think it hurts her more than it hurts me.  I think it's painful for her to think of me struggling with alcoholism so she refrains from talking about it and sometimes even offers me wine when she knows I've struggled with it for years!!  When this happens I just politely tell her that I am not drinking (again) and ask for a sparkling water instead.  ..After 6 months of sobriety I had received a huge raise and bonus at work and had taken on responsibilities I had never even thought I would have ever been capable of taking on. My confidence was climbing my anxiety levels were almost non-existent the daily depression was disappearing.  I was speaking to rooms full of people and also getting into healthy debate and arguments that I would have avoided altogether months earlier.  I learned how to defend myself and by God did I fight hard.  I learned that all of those stupid small-minded people in my life who made me depressed frustrated and angry before weren't worth spit and they didn't deserve a minute of thought from myself any longer.  I discovered that I was capable of so much and with every passing day of sobriety and with every clear thought I believed in myself again.  ..At 9 months I noticed that I was actually in a meaningful loving relationship that I was present for and that I was planning a future around.  I wasn't sneaking around hiding my drinking; I was answering the phone taking care of business and getting up and at it early every morning.  My partner and I bought a house and started renovating it (which would lead most people to drink  but we haven't yet!). I got pregnant which knocked me flat on my ass as I thought I'd pickled those eggs long ago.  The pregnancy didn't stick but by God when I realized that I was actually able to get pregnant my world opened up my heart exploded and everything came into an even clearer perspective.  Just the idea of taking care of someone else in my life made me want to continue to take better care of myself.  I didn't want a drop of booze or a cigarette anywhere near me at all.  During this period I also took my first holiday sober as well. And you know what?  It was way better going everywhere sober than it was getting sauced at night and sleeping too late every day!..Today after this one year of sobriety I am writing this post as a reminder to myself of what I experienced during the first year so I will not take the process for granted.  I am also writing this for all the other folks out there who are struggling as hard as I did for years trying to quit over and over again.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think that I would have been able to quit.  I was convinced that I'd be locked away dancing with a bottle until the day I died. But I have quit for one year so far and I didn't die.  It was tough at first but my body got used to living without booze.  I don't need or want it now.  But one thing does remain (and it should) and that is an incredibly strong fear of alcohol. I still have the odd nightmare that I have taken a drink and I can taste it in my mouth in my dreams and it scares me every single time.  I hope I never lose this fear as I think that it and the intense pride that I feel right now for being sober will keep me clean and alive for another year.  Some things are important to remember: At no point do I ever fool myself into thinking that I can return to drinking and manage to control my intake any more; At no point do I ever think that I can successfully maintain my current lifestyle and commitments while also drinking alcohol; At no point do I ever think that I can sustain a healthy and loving relationship while also drinking alcohol.  **I am terrified of alcohol**.  If you are addicted to it you should be terrified too.  But above the din of that intense fear there is a quiet firm voice inside of all of us drinkers and all it says is one word: STOP.  Just STOP.  ..After one year of sobriety I am awestruck by how powerful this disease is and how easily it runs through families as well.  My estranged father was an alcoholic and I believe that we are genetically predisposed to this disease just as much as we are exposed to alcoholism by simple habitual use.  It feels good to know that I am not alone and that others out there are wielding their swords against the bottle as well.  It feels good to be 20 pounds lighter as well! To those of you old-timers who have been clean for years I tip my hat to you and bow down at your feet.  To those of you just starting this fight please know that you can do it.  YOU CAN DO IT.  Just buckle in and get through the first few months.  Go to AA talk to your priest call your doctor or go to rehab.  Do whatever it is you have to do to get clean. There is a LIFE at the end of the tunnel...In closing there is a strange and unexpected sort of pride that comes with being a recovering alcoholic in that not everyone gets to walk this road take this journey or do this work.  Not everyone gets to learn this much about themselves or gain the strength that comes with recovery day after day. This doesn't mean that bad things stop happening in life by any means because they don't.  But you're just able to deal with them better when you're sober and balanced.  When I have a bad day and I sometimes lose sight of what I have gained in the last year I am reminded of something that my doctor told me when I told her that I was sobering up after the first few weeks: I told her that I was afraid of giving up my crutch my buffer between me and the big bad world that bottle that I needed to lean on.  I told her that even though I knew it was poison I felt like I was losing something that I depended on for confidence comfort calmness and peace. To which she calmly replied  You're not losing any of that at all dear. You're getting it all back.   And she was right. ...

Probably because it reflects my feelings also.._________________________________________.&gt; there is a strange and unexpected sort of pride that comes with being a recovering alcoholic in that not everyone gets to walk this road take this journey or do this work. Not everyone gets to learn this much about themselves or gain the strength that comes with recovery day after day.
Now this... this is a good one year post.  You have given us much wisdom from this story.
&gt; there is a strange and unexpected sort of pride that comes with being a recovering alcoholic in that not everyone gets to walk this road take this journey or do this work. Not everyone gets to learn this much about themselves or gain the strength that comes with recovery day after day...I totally agree and I think that pride fosters gratitude for being having the opportunity to take the journey with ourselves too...Congratulations Girl-Drink-Drunk and keep it up!  
This is an awesome post. 
Thank you for taking the time to post this.  I truly did inspire me to say focused...Big congrats on the new life :D
Thanks. As someone with just a few days in this was good to hear. 
I love this post so much thank you. I very much relate to what you said about the unexpected pride. I never thought it would feel so good to take full responsibility for myself. Before I quit I spent a lot of time dismissing my own actions because if I'd done something while I was drunk it wasn't "really" me. I couldn't see at the time how psychologically destructive that is. Now if I see something I don't like I own it and can therefore take measures to fix it. You can't do that if you don't see it as "really" you you just end up in this endless rut.  ..Anyway thanks for describing your journey so candidly. I also hope never to lose the fear of alcohol. I hope I never take my sobriety for granted.
This should be saved as a Saturday share for others to read. Inspirational.
