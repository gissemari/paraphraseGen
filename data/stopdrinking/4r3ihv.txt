So far so good. I'm really happy with myself. I'm a 30 year user and have been a semi-professional quitter the whole time. .Last week walking through the airports was probably the hardest part as those places are a trigger for me. So many folks having a beer waiting for their flights. I wasn't really tempted but I certainly noticed it. .Walking the streets of Maui with the smell of dope wafting on the breeze gave me pause as well since I had a lot of time on my hands between meetings and the idea of plopping down on the beach with a 22oz Imperial IPA and a fat spliff seemed to zing through my brain from time to time. I didn't pay too much notice however as I was sipping my coffee and getting in 10k steps to help keep me on the straight and narrow. .As a multi-platinum relapser what's different this time around? I've got you all at r/leaves and r/stopdrinking to help me along in good times and bad.  .Thanks for being here. See you next time.

Great!
This is a real achievement. Well done.

Triple congrats Yen! That's an awful lot in 2 weeks. Awesome work :)
This is a big accomplishment! Well done! I should have tackled all three at once but I did drinking first and then weed and now I'm working on cigarettes
I quit nicotine 16 years ago and alcohol 2 years ago. I just can't believe how many problems and future problems I have eliminated just quitting those two things. It is mind boggling. 
Triple thanks Lee!
2 down 1 to go. You got it. Thanks for the note. 
Multiplatinum relapser...I love that! Thanks and congrats on two weeks especially since you're on Maui.
