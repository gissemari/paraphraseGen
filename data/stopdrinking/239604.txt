So I'm 4.5 years sober right now and I'm struggling.  Current deployed to afghanistan and I'm in an area with no meetings at all or support groups.  If anyone has some time to spare to talk that would be great.

I hit a very bad patch around year five. It was worked related and I came close to losing everything. I could hardly look at my wife and son at the time because of the guilt that I'd failed them. I made it through this tough period and it turned out to be a real turning point point for me. .. I'm not an AA person so I can't really offer you advice about support groups but I'm happy to chat. 
We face all kinds of situations and when we do it sober we do it best. There's no relief in drinking for people like us. 
Try the IRC chat room ------------------&gt;..There might be someone in there.  I hope it all works out can't be easy over there.  Good luck
Feel free to PM me anytime /u/not_there_yet and we can set a time to talk.
Feel free to pm...   But I can tell you one thing for sure a  - drink will not fix Afghanistan.
Dude I've got two to Afghanistan myself and I traveled all over.  PM me if you ever want to chat.  Stay away from the 'mouthwash' it's never worth the trouble if you get busted.
I can't begin to understand what that must be like but it seems universal that helping other is the best way for an alcoholic to stay sober. Have you considered starting a group where you are? Are you around enough people to potentially find someone else there who is in a similar position?..[This](http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-50_AAandtheArmedServices.pdf) might be of some help too.
