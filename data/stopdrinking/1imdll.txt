Honestly can't believe I'm here. It feels so good. Also a massive positive to anyone on their first few days it does get easier so much easier. I rarely think about drinking now and dismiss it without much thought. It is blissful compared to the agony of warring within myself all day whether or not to drink later! I have found ways to cope healthy normal ways to cope. Treating myself to nice things eating better still exercising reading a good book (Live By Night by Dennis Lehane) hoovering/vacuuming! Doing a spot of cleaning when I feel low really seems to make me feel a lot better and it's easy to do and only takes a few minutes.  ..It can feel weird in a good way when I enjoy things. Sometimes it comes at totally unexpected moments and it's more euphoric and genuine than alcohol ever was. It is harder to achieve though it takes work and effort but sure beats that quick fix solution that has so many down sides. Life isn't easy and I'm still struggling to live but I'll be damned if I'm going to waste all the good work that I've done. ..Thanks again r/stopdrinking! I honestly couldn't have done it without you! Happy Friday everyone stay strong. :)

[^the ^^number ^^^grows]....have a great weekend Apostle [tips hat]
well done! just bought Live By Night... thanks for the recomendation
Congratulations keep doing...
That's awesome Apostle.  Keep it up...I think it's important not to get discouraged when that good feeling goes away.  At some point I went from everything feeling great to being frustrated by a lot of things.  I think I was just settling in to my "new life" and needed to adjust.  It didn't last long and for the most part everything is great for me now!..Keep on keepin' on.
Congratulations.  I liked what you said -  very true:..it's more euphoric and genuine than alcohol ever was. It is harder to achieve though it takes work and effort
I'm glad to see that another understands the Prozac-power of tidying. Congratulations and keep it up. It just keeps getting better and everything really starts making a lot more sense.
