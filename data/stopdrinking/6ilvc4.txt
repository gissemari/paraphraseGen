It's not worth it. Every single time that I relapse it's always the same. I'm 27 and have nothing going on in my life. This have to change starting again.

Once I started to truly and deeply analyze my relapses I began to learn from them.  I was able to develop effective coping mechanisms for the inevitable cravings and temptations...The most important thing is to never give up. Never quit trying...I will not drink with you today!
What are you planning to do differently? I needed lots of support to stay sober. ..&gt; If nothing changes;.&gt; .&gt; Nothing changes.
