Recovery isn't always linear :)..Congrats on recognizing ALL your milestones.
You got right back on the horse is the pattern I see.  Congratulations on a job well done!  I won't drink with you today.
Wow! Thanks for sharing! Really cool to see. We are not alone! 
My timeline is much shorter than yours but it's been following the same pattern. Can't wait to log the very last date.
