I'm becoming very concerned about my mom. She's become an alcoholic. I know this because her father (my grandfather) was an alcoholic and I watched him die at 63 of liver cancer which bore out from cirrhosis. Her cousin and a wonderful man to me also drank himself to death in his mid 50's. Both of them succumbed to alcoholism within the last 10 years. ..My mom and dad met when they were 18 moved from Eastern Europe to North America and were married for about 22 years before my dad's success in the construction industry went to his head and he found a younger woman. He sold his company and moved halfway across the world for her and now has two kids with her. He left my mom with money but that was about 10 years ago now. My mom started a business and it seemed like she really enjoyed it for a while but I can tell her heart isn't in it anymore. It's not going nearly as well as it used to. ..She recently sold the old house moving into a new but much smaller home. And I came back home for Christmas (I work and live overseas now)...She drank everyday sometimes to the point she was slurring and wobbling...like today (a Tuesday). It got to the point that my grandma asked to speak to me about it. She told me that she's concerned for her daughter...and this is coming from a woman who watched her husband drink himself to death. ..I can tell my mom's depressed because my mom and I are a lot alike. Alcohol has been the #1 struggle and problem in my life since I was a teenager. Depression is #2...but they go hand in hand...I know how to deal with mine but my question is how do I make my mom realise that she's going down the same road her father and her cousin went down?..Any advice/help is appreciated. .

I cannot change other people. Sometimes the only thing I can do is express my concern in terms of how I feel about it and LISTEN. ..I cannot force anyone to see what I see. They need to see their problem clearly from their perspective. I imagine your mother is deeply in pain...trying to break her denial isn't your job my friend. ..
That's so tough when it's your mom. I know that this isn't a religious sub but I'm praying for wisdom for you. Hugs...
