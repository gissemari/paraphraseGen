I'm realizing that although I have drank with friends over the weekend I am happier than I have been in a long while. And although depression runs deep and will be back I'm gonna enjoy being happy. This place helps a lot. Just knowing that I'm not alone I. The struggle and we are all in it in some depth. But thanks y'all. Have a great Monday!

I could have written this too.  I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life.  But in sobriety I feel happy and alive again.  There are bad days that's life.  But sobriety brought me so much good...I'm happy for you my friend!
