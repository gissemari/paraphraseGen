I was primarily a beer drinker. I find I kinda struggle with the nervous habit side of drinking in addition to the chemical dependency side.  Let's be honest drinking a carbonated beverage and having a nice burp is actually pretty satisfying.  I find strait plain carbonated water to really help with some of the cravings. It has no calories and keeps me hydrated. It's win/win. ..To lighten things up a bit I have taken to giving them funny names: Ghost Beers LaCroix Ale and Topo Cheapo (I buy the store brand at HEB)..Well cheers!  Here's to not drinking with you today!

Lol!  Thank you for the laugh!   Cheers to Ghost Beers!  IWNDWYT
Germans call it  water with gas 
I switched to regular water at HEB eventually. It doesn't create carbonic acid which can hurt your teeth (Not near as bad as soda). I eat pistachios to help with the cravings.
I call them crispy waters! Haha
I've caught myself unironically saying  Lacrizzy 
I will never not think Topo Cheapo when I'm at HEB now! Lololol love it
Clear beer. Cham-no-pain. Win and tonic. Bubbly Mary. Woo-hoo drivers. "Vodka martini shaken not stirred. Hold the vodka. Extra fizz."
Ghost beers is hilarious
We call it fizzy drink here!
Topo Cheapo lol!! Oh my goodness thanks for that laugh! I wish we had HEB here in my part of Texas!
My kids call them  spicy water 
Hahaha!  Love Ghost Beers!  ..Cheers to you with my Topo!
