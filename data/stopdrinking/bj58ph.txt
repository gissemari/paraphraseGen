Last night a very stressful thing happened. Something that would have triggered me to drink ten days ago. But I didn't go buy beer! I sat with my stress and my fears. I came here and searched for "relapse" and "withdrawals" to remind myself of the horror I put myself through. I talked to someone about my cravings. I didn't drink. It was a victory. ..I can have cravings and be triggered and I can still choose to remain sober. It's awesome to wake up this morning with a clear head and no guilt and misery from drinking. I feel like I won a small battle...I will not drink with you today

Awesome to hear it - started on my journey as well...It is one of the most difficult things to overcome when it's right in front of you but when you wake up the next day knowing what you confronted and handled best feeling in the world...Keep it up
Growth!  Awesome do you have a number of days you're really looking forward to reaching?  I like to go 1 day at a time but I also would love to see my counter hit 90 days.  My personal best is a little over 60.
Good work!
