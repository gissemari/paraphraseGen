Today I finally admitted my alcoholism to my therapist. He's only the second person I've told besides my ex girlfriend. And it was tough. I almost choked on the words as they came out because I'm still working on admitting it to myself. The past two weeks have been a new low for me. Normally I'll drink 6-7 days a week. Just a few most of the time more. These past two weeks I've been going in excess of 10 drinks easily. Nightly. It's also the first time I've felt myself craving the drink to such an extreme. I would come home and feel so restless and anxious until I ran out the door to go grab beers. I had the shakes one morning after also a new first. ..I've been slow coming to this conclusion because I would always compare myself to someone who was having a tougher time with their addiction.  Well I don't drink as much as that guy so obviously I'm not an alcoholic.  Fact is I'm a slave to the drink. I have trouble thinking of how to have fun without drinking. That's not ideal. ..I'm coming up on 30 years old and I'm nowhere near where I thought I'd be. A lot of that has to do with the fact that drinking consumes a majority of my finances and free time. Add in lost time spent recovering from a night of heavy drinking and I shouldn't be so surprised at how little I've achieved. ..My immediate goals are to exercise more and continue to invest time in learning an instrument. I plan on going for a run every night immediately after getting home from work just to avoid that  I'm home now what? Drink?  feeling. An instrument gives me something tangible to invest time in that gives me a sense of a reward (satisfaction from learning a new song). ..Speaking with my therapist we're going to shoot for six months sober. As a reset. My life has needed a change and drinking is the root of so many issues in my life. I can't help but think if not now when? I've played this game before where I vow to change and then slide right back into despair. Drinking is a contributing factor to that struggle. ..I can't help but get excited at the idea of what I could accomplish in six months. I've been functional drinking as much as I have and I can only imagine that I'll be much more productive sober. And I need to remind myself of a quote I read somewhere on here that really resonated with me  Drinking is borrowing from tomorrow's happiness.  ..My biggest concern is the upcoming football season. As a huge fan and someone who used to crack open a brew at 9am on Sundays this is the huge hurdle that I'm nervous about. Any football fans with advice regarding that? ..I also am struggling with the  never again  mindset. I know to take it daily but I'd also like to be able to go out and have one or two with friends on special occasions. For instance my brother's wedding is coming up and I'd want to be able to join in and share rounds with the family. Basically I'd like to cut way way way back but still allow myself the occasional. Am I setting myself up for failure with this mindset? I probably am considering I haven't gone as long as a week without drinking as far back as I can remember...Thanks for reading and I hope to be around for the long haul! .

Welcome /u/SloppyJoMo to /r/stopdrinking.  Here's how I deal with the upcoming football season: I don't drink TODAY only; and I have a plan to renew that commitment tomorrow.  In other words I stay in the here and now.  It's part of [the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) conventional wisdom handed down from one recovering drunk to another and now me to you.  Good luck..
Hi there..Your post resonated with me. I still feel guilty for praying that the Kings wouldn't make the playoffs last year (hockey) so that I could stay out of my bar in early sobriety. They didn't make the playoffs. I was spared. That being said season starts in October I feel more prepared to handle my bar again but not making any decisions until I get there. The whole "one day at a time" thing...I also struggled with the never again mindset. It kept me from even thinking about AA for a long time. My last dry spell was supposed to be six months like you. I made it a little shy of three weeks. My first meeting of AA the topic ended up being centered around how many years of "research" everyone did: how long you drank and tried to control your drinking. I realized I had been trying to control my drinking for 17 years and I had never been successful for any substantive period of time. Research is in evidence points to alcoholic. Why go back out there and try again? A saying I see in this sub a lot is that it's easier to keep a lion in a cage than a lion on a leash. It's not worth the risk on the off chance I could drink normally. Nothing I've seen so far points to that being true...Thanks for your post strength to you on your journey.
