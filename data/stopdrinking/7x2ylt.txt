I made it 90 day a few weeks ago and relapsed really hard. Doing drugs and drinking really heavy. I don't know what to do I feel so much shame and embarrassment. I think I am losing my job my roommates are moving out. I took the day off from work I am just lying on my couch thinking about getting some beer

What always helped me is to repeat not to give up none of these things will go away from drinking. All your issues with be there when you wake up tomorrow. Fight for what's yours!!! Your life.   hope that helps. 
Losing a job would be tough..Roommates moving out is as well. .Drinking beer will not make either of those things better. 
The relief from drinking is temporary. It always was and always will be. ..Your problems can be temporary too though. ..The only issue is how much worse those problems get when you're dealing with them drunk. They can turn from temporary challenges to permanent consequences in the blink of an eye...Drinking will not make anything better. That's why you're posting here because you know that. You just need someone to push you off the fence in the direction you want to go. Get off the fence and go for a run. Deal with the pain you have instead of tossing a quick bandage over it and hoping it goes away...I will not drink with you today.
Welcome back. Each setback is a learning experience making us stronger and more determined going forward...You can do this!!
