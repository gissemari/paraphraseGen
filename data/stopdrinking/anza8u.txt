Back to day 1 and feeling frustrated and determined. I'll not keep it short; I'm a  helping professional  who has had a hard time finding support locally. Every meeting I go either is 1) 30+ minutes a way or 2) populated by people I have as a client have had as a client or generally know from  around  the recovery culture here (co-workers former co-workers etc.). Needless to say it makes find a place I feel comfortable sharing quite difficult even though I know most people are understanding of my struggles. I've reached out to two Doc.'s I know to see if I can find any private meetings but as I am not a doctor myself have struck out on locating a gathering of other non-Doctoral  helpers.  I've struggled with alcohol off and on for years and my divorce of 10 years ago - not to mention the 300-mile distance between my kids and I (with limited visitation) - leaves me accountable to almost no one. I perform very well at my job but know that can only last for so long if I keep on this path...I've done this before; had 1 year and 27 days sober and was attending AA meetings regularly before I went back out in mid-2017. I stopped going to AA because I was tired of the negative and deficits-based story telling I found at many AA meetings and had as has a time finding a  safe space  then as I am having now. ..Quitting has been harder this time too. I've needed a  home detox  (complete with a Librium taper) and now Disulfram (Antabuse) to give me the kickstart I need. I've only recently been honest with my parents and girlfriend about the ongoing issue I have string together a week or three but then lapsing into a few days of heavy binge drinking. They're loving and supporting but...they're like me in this regard. As an Atheist being told that I needed to "pray" for help was the reason I stopped talking to 2 of my 4 parents in the first place. Que sera. ..You know what though? I want my fitness back I want the intrusive and darkly suicidal thoughts to leave me I want to feel happy again and I want to stop thinking about drinking no matter the reason or occasion. Those 382 days I had were some of the brightest of my adult life and I want to live days like them again. As a helping professional I  know  what to do. I know the science and the cycles and all of the damage I've been doing to my brain and body. My difficulty is that I literally have nobody to be accountable to. ..So I guess that's what I'm here for asking for some accountability. Not because I expect others to do any work for me but knowing people expect me not to drink helps. Not sure how this would work but thought I'd throw it out there anyway. ..IWNDWYT (if not only because I'll be a vomitous wreck)
----------immediate responses--------

"I'll be a vomitus wreck"- borrowing this next time I have to defend my not drinking to others ..You're in the right place for support your situation for IRL meetings certainly sounds tricky. Reminds me of being a grad student and not wanting to be spotted in the waiting room of the university student counseling center by anyone I was currently teaching. ..This sub has been my main source of support for my not drinking endeavor. The daily check in badges and just having the sub here whenever I want to read or reach out has been very reassuring. I'm glad you're here with us! IWNDWYT
