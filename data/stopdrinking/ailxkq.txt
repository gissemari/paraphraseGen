Tests at the [University of California](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/2015-2016/11/20151125_gratitude.html) found that people who kept a gratitude journal for two weeks felt happier and healthier. While struggling through several personal problems Gratitude happened to change things for me and I fell in love with it. I decided to built this journal app that makes it easy for us to focus on the positive and become more mindful. ..Here's a link to the app : [https://gratefulness.me/](https://gratefulness.me/)..Hope you find it useful as you continue your journey!

Thank You 
Thank you so much for sharing. I just read the highlights of the link and they appear to be reporting a strong positive causal link between gratitude and all of those amazing benefits...I am off out now to buy a bigger brighter and better gratitude journal
