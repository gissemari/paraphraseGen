As much as possible I have kept to dry place/dry people but this upcoming weekend I have been pressured into attending the company Christmas party. From what I have heard about the last one it was awash in alcohol resulting in a $10000 tab for about 300 people. I was pondering if I should have a non-alcoholic beer to blend in. I have decided against it...**After all the work and struggle it has taken to become sober even having  0.5% alcohol in my life is 0.5% too much.**..I don't need my water with 0.5% poison I wouldn't want my life to be crappy 0.5% of the time and I absolutely don't even want there to be a 0.5% chance of me relapsing. Staying 100% sober and taking 0% of unnecessary risks is the best way for me to stay sober.

It looks like you've done the math and came up with the answer! I too realized that I shouldn't even dance with the .5% devil. And honestly... I thought about it. But god forbid I feel it and then get a low percentage beer and then work my way up the shitty addiction pyramid again. You're right It's not worth it.
