I've been trying to quit drinking for months and I keep relapsing and the subsequent periods of withdrawal have caused me to lose my job damage my family/friend relationships and cause my grades in college to suffer. I desperately want to stop but I don't know how to do so. I have considered an AA program at my nearby church but I am staunchly atheist so I don't think that will truly work for me. I considered a rehab center but I am scared of the cost and the stories I have heard of them being scams designed to bring you back as much as possible. Do I have any other options? What has helped you all quit?

I started with some books and podcasts and reading here.  They are cheap or free and readily accessible.  If you look at the sidebar links or search old posts you will find plenty of recommendations for both.
