Over the last 14 days I drank on 4 of them which for me is an improvement.  But I slipped up yesterday after feeling very confident that I was finally getting a good handle on things. It seems like every 2-4 days just as I am feeling better an urge hits me and all of a sudden I go on autopilot and give in quickly.  I have a lot of experience in recovery this is not my first rodeo.  I have books seen therapists joined groups so I have tons of tools at my disposal.  But I get incredibly frustrated with these constant slips.  I know what to do intellectually quite well but I still struggle with changing my behavior.  It's been a while since I had a good straight month or two of no drinking.  I want that again.  ..Some things that have worked for me in the past is playing the tape forward and imagining how horrible I will feel the following day.  Sometimes I set a timer and just tell myself I won't drink for this hour and just focus on that.  Other times I will go out and grab a nice meal at a restaurant.  Being mindful and watching the craving without reacting to it helps as well. Yet I find the cravings so strong and in the moment it feels like I have already resigned to giving in before I allow myself the chance to combat it...I want to regain control over my sobriety.  I am not some powerless victim in the face of urges.  I know this.  Anybody else out there dealt with chronic slips and how did you finally get to a point where sobriety stuck for you?  I'm thankful for you all and I will not drink today.

I have found that This Naked Mind by Annie Grace has really helped me. It allows you to understand that the craving for alcohol is based on programming that has occurred to your subconscious mind.  Once you understand that you can begin to reprogram yourself and then you can make a conscious choice not to drink.  This is not will power - (in your words "combatting" the urge) - will power against your own unconscious is a tough battle. Anyway it has helped me maybe it will help you. I will not drink with you today because I choose not to put poison in my body - poison that is addictive - poison that we are told will help us and make us feel better. I choose not to drink with you today.
That's kind of where I'm at though the last few months I was hitting the bottle hard...Most of my twenties I had my Friday night routine of getting home from work having a shower and finally unwind. I'd have a case of beer that I'd drink over the course of the night as I played video games or listened to music. I'd sleep in on Saturday and be up around noon to start the day...I'm at 9 days now which is the longest I've gone in about two years. Day 4-7 were the ones I had to fight the voice the most even today I'm kind of fighting it a bit. I want to cave and go get beer but my voice of reasoning is fighting the urge. I made a promise to myself to get back on track because my confidence and self esteem are shot not to mention I've gained 40 lbs since Christmas because of how much I was drinking and the amount of pizza I was eating to go with it. ..I want to lose the weight and get my confidence back before I even consider drinking again. I want to relearn better coping skills when dealing with stress with a breakup before I have another drink. All I can do is be mindful of how I'm feeling write it down and go through the steps in my head on why I'm feeling this way.
