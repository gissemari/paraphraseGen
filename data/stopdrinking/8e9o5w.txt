Morning thank you for reading. I for a number of years have struggled to abstain and even moderate I didnt drink until I went to university and its probably not the best place to start and pick up habits. Its been at the back of my mind for some time however now with my second baby on the way I feel the time has come. That coupled with a stupid conversation I had whilst drunk which resulted in a complaint and almost impacting my job..That happened two Thursdays ago I drank through the weekend to try and soften the guilt. .Fast forward to last Saturday I thought I could moderate have two beers then leave it. I couldn't I had more including wine..Its finally clicked - I cant moderate and I have to give up..Again thanks for reading I just needed to write this down.
