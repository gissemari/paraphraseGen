The click for me was when it was explained that alcohol was not my problem. My problem was living life in a way that required massive amounts alcohol to make life tolerable for me. .All my relapses were the result of me stopping drinking leading to life improving from not being a complete drunk followed by an increase in the knowledge that I was acting like an asshole even without alcohol followed by me reaching for a drink to get relief from all that. Vicious cycle that I was finally able to click out of with a lot of fundamental AA work.

5 1/2 Years is incredible! So happy for you &amp; inspired!
Amazing 5 1/2 years!!!! Every time I see someone with massive amounts of time I think wow!!! ..That's 5.5 years of abundant sober living! That's 5 years of full cognitive clarity - not drunken stupor/blackouts. ..That's 5.5 years of personal growth and rediscovering your true self - not hiding behind alcohol. ..That's 5.5 years of sober driving - not taking the risk thinking you're ok to drive. ..That's 5.5 years of not poisoning your body with alcohol. So toxic so aging so damaging to all parts of your body. ..That's 5.5 years of commitment to yourself. That's no easy task. 
Great job man! 999% true. Alcohol is allways a tool to deal with problems. Solve your problems you will not need that tool any more. I am so proud for you! IWNDWYT!!!
Inspiring!
