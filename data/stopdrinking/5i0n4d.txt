Hello - I'm posting my first post and I am celebrating 4 days sober. Nothing - but something I'm proud of myself. I'm struggling but so far so good. It's great to see some really inspiring posts.

I'm recently sober and find myself thinking about booze less and less everyday. Keeping busy ALL the time helps even if it's just like changing dead light bulbs or cleaning my car. Do things that increase your quality of life. They littlest things I would put off forever that slowly built up negatively around me are no longer there. If you have trouble staying busy just find a shit book to read that will put you right to sleep. 
Those first couple weeks were really tough for me. Props on 4 days keep up the awesome work 
Good job!
