I'm tired of fighting. I keep going back and forth from sobriety to relapses. I'm depressed without my drinking and drugs. I learned something about my self. I self medicate because there is no treatment that works for my depression and PTSD. I've tried everything. I'm tired of it. I can't move today. I can't get out of my bed. I'll never be happy without drugs or alcohol. I don't know what it's like to not experience anxiety or depression. It's what makes me me. There's only suffering. I'm tired of it all. I give up. I can't be saved...I got a couple handles of jim bean red stag I just want to drink until it's over. Thanks for everybody that tried to help me Thank you Talie Thank you Wincil thank you everybody who tried their best to support me in IRC Chat hope you guys make it out there...bye.

Don't do it. For what it's worth try taking Vitamin D 2000ui daily. It's helped me and my depression. Give it a shot for a while longer like a month [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908269/) 
Oh hey kitchensmoke. Don't start drinking friend. You know there's still hope. Get yourself to an ER if you're feeling like that and pop in to the chat and say hi again. We've not seen you for weeks - you know we still have hope for you. ..Hang in there buddy. If you're sober now pop in to the chat yeah?  Either way sounds like you need some medical help right now. Remember there's helplines too. ..&lt;3 Talie
Unfortunately no one here is able to provide the support and help you need. You might try posting on r/suicidewatch or calling the suicide prevention hotline at (800) 273 8255. Be well...
We're here for you kitchensmoke. If you're sober now why not pop into chat and talk it out?
