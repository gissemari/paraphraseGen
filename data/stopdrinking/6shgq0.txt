I'm thankful for my sobriety tonight in a lot of ways. Particularly for the clarity it brings. In fact as someone who also struggles with depression tonight is one of those special nights when I'm both comfortably sober and depression-free...I'm parked in front of an old gas station right now writing this (driving with my dog is one of my favorite things to do after work). Just before I stopped I heard a favorite song of mine. And I realized that it's a song I listen to in *literally* the best of times and the worst of times...Instead of advice and 'words of wisdom' maybe this is what some of you need tonight. I know it's helped me through hellish times - hope it does the same for you: https://youtu.be/L2-3ooX_XkQ

What a great song- and exactly what I needed to hear tonight. Thank you for sharing!!!
Nice. Thanks :)
I needed this. I've been so stressed I wanted to start drinking again.  You made me tear up. Going for drives is a favorite of mine too.
That was a perfect pick-me-up and I immediately added the song to the playlist that I am making for my unborn son. Thanks!!
Thanks for the song really dig it definitely lifted me up :)
Yes- that's such a great line!
Thank you for sharing that song. Love it.
