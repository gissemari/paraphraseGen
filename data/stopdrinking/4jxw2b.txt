I haven't been in the sub in a couple days but I knew I'd hit the 2 week mark at some point. 17 days? That's way more than I'd expected. Better than round 1 where I don't think I made it a week. ..I'm finally having some physiological struggles coinciding with the general curse of women so the last 1-2 days have been super painful... but I don't want a drink! I've even been able to sit next to my roommate as he's getting hammered and do my own thing in Dark Souls on my laptop. ..It's been great. We can all do this!!!!!

We CAN do this.
I'm right there with you! Although unlike you I've been relentlessly staring at my number each day as it goes up so I was hyper-aware of having 17 days.  Here's to day 18 without drinking!
nice! I'm with you man.
Dark souls impossible to play if you drink anyway. Since dark souls is a better experience than drinking you have obviously made the correct decision.
Isn't it great? 
Nice job.  Video games are a great outlet.  My sore hands are a testament to that.  At least it's not a sore face from falling flat on it drunk! :D
You're so lucky!  Right around 2 weeks was very VERY difficult for me.  Shit- it's still tough for me to be sober.  I keep waiting for the 'it gets better part'. I'm only holding out because I know for a fact that nothing will get better if I keep drinking and at least this way I have a chance!
I love that feeling! kudos
