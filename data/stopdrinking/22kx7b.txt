After 50 days of sobriety the longest I've gone since s I started drinking 9 years ago I have relapsed. I went on a 4 day bender then spent the next 2 days in bed with the worst withdrawals I've ever had. I couldn't eat the whole time had terrible insomnia anxiety and my digestive system was completely messed up. I was honesty scared I would have to go to the hospital. I've been kicking myself and just reading all the posts for encouragement. Thought I would finally post and join in this support group in hopes of not relapsing again.

Congrats on two days!.I drank for less time than you but a lot of it in all day/night binges.  Having relapsed two times my third recovery was WAY worse than my first.  I thought it was weird I had been drinking in insane ways for over a year before (casually before that) before recovery 1 and then 4 months of every day all day drinking before recovery 2.  My latest relapse came after only about 1.5 weeks and I thought the withdrawals would be much easier.. nope nope nope.  I asked about it and someone sent me this link:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_%28sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal%29..Don't kick yourself you are at two days and you can see sunlight.  That said seeing a psychiatrist or doctor can help you to get you withdrawal medicine and you can recover safely...Last night was my first post. I've was laying here twitching sweating rolling around feeling my muscles do weird things getting somehow warm and hot at the same time this was what kept me out of the bottle.  Welcome! 
Welcome /u/rubberchicken281 to /r/stopdrinking; I'm so glad you shared your relapse story with us.  As some one who relapsed after 15 continuous years for 7 hellish years "out there"--I find sobriety and AA meetings the easier softer way.
