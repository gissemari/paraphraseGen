Since February of 2017 I have had both a seven and a six month period of sobriety. During those times I've gotten back in school been successful as a distance runner and generally progressed my life. But the relapses have been beyond brutal and my inability to stop once I start is clear. I've also proven that at times I completely lack the ability to keep myself from taking the first drink once I've reached a certain point. I've hurt so many people and broken so much trust. It's hard to look up with hope but I know this bitter morass (head full of AA belly full of booze yada yada) can recede if I take the proper steps. It's of my own doing but it's hard to look with much optimisim. Regardless I'm not going to drink with you guys tonight

One thing that might help is try to pinpoint the *exact* thought process that led to that first drink. What happened and what can you do to stop yourself the next time?
IWDWYT. I understand how your feeling . I have drank when I know how many problems it has and will cause me . I'm not giving up on being free of alcohols demons . Let's stay sober!!'
