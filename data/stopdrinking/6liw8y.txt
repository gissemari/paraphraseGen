I have been lurking on stop drinking for awhile but first post. Relapsed last night and am really struggling today. So very mad at myself. The guilt I have for throwing away my sobriety for no reason is immense. I have severely disappointed my loved ones and was unable to go to work today because I was still intoxicated when I woke up this morning. It's hard to imagine things will get better at this point.

what you have accomplished can never be thrown away. keep fighting the good fight
Keep coming back. You are right back up- stop beating yourself up immediately. Feel guilt but not shame. Learn what tripped you up and make a plan for the next time that issue pops up. You are not alone you did not fail this is an opportunity to continue your sobriety. Proud of you for coming right back. *hugs* 
Things will definitely get better. You are on your way the view is just a little foggy at first. 
I will not drink with you today. The first day is the darkest (at least for me). Big hug. Hang in there and make it right for yourself.
