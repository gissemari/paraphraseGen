I don't post here hardly ever but I make this subreddit a part of my morning and nightly ritual.  Thank you for all who post it truly is an amazing community. ..With that one of the things that I am struggling with today is my expectations of sobriety.  Growing up I always learned concepts and ideas very quickly.  School was easy for me and once I decided to learn how to play golf I became good very quickly. ..This is the first process I have gone through where the results I want aren't happening overnight.  When I look back to 178 days ago where I was then and where I am now the changes are obviously there considering 178 days ago I was lying in a hospital bed and now I am typing this before my round of golf this afternoon.  But still I am a 25 year old male not where I want to be.  ..I think the best way to put it is when people with longer terms of sobriety say that things get a lot better and they met their SO and have amazing relationships and great career my first thought is great sign me up I want that right now. ..I realize I have a tremendous amount of work to do on myself before any of that happens and although 178 days is a good start its a drop in the bucket to a lifetime of sobriety.  ..However when I start thinking about a lifetime of sobriety I have to remind myself that a lifetime is a long time and the only thing I have control over is today this hour this minute and as long as my head hits the pillow sober its a great accomplishment. ..Thanks for letting me ramble and thank you all for being here : ) ..

Sometimes I ask myself where I could have been if I quit drinking at 25 (I am 37 now). Give it time and stay strong ;)
178 days is huge!
