if i didn't relapse in February i would have one year sober today. i know it's a silly thing to focus on but i put a lot of thought and energy into this date and wanted to make a point of recognizing it. don't drink. it isn't worth it. keep your date.

I find myself feeling like at one point or another I'll have a drink and lose my date. This is the first time I've ever stopped so I would really like to keep it. I'm glad to see you came back and are doing good 221 is something to be proud of. Keep it up and thank you for sharing. 
It's not a silly thing to focus on but you shouldn't focus on it too much! You have 221 days under your belt and that is nothing to sniff at - you should be proud of yourself!..
If I hadn't had my last round of drinks I'd have another 4 months on my counter as well. I regretted the reset but honestly it's faded to insignificance. I see it as part of the process that got me to today. GRATS on 221 days of not drinking. 
I would be coming up onto 3 months in a few days. Now I'm at a week tomorrow. I'm grateful that I relapsed though..because I learned what I needed to learn and I am a stronger person for it.
I'd be over 15 years now but I went out just shy of 11 years sober.  But I can't look at it that way..What matters is we're sober today.
