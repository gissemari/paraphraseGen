So I'm trucking along pretty good right one day at a time. Doing fabulous.  It got easy to go without- barely missed it after month 3 or so. Now maybe it's the season but holy hell are my cravings back so bad! I'm dreaming of it like I did month one!!! Its brutal. I'm not going to relapse- I've rode that rodeo too many times before- but can someone tell me this is normal and it goes away again??? .I WILL NOT drink with you all today regardless of my subconscious pressure

I've had a similar experience recently and someone here recommended l-glutamine which I've been trying. It seems to have helped whether it's a placebo I don't know but it's not expensive and worth looking into if it's been bad for you too 
Holidays can bring all sorts of things out of us they brought back drinking nightmares for me. The most effective way to stop a craving is to ignore it they'll go away again if you keep turning them away : ).
I had that a couple of times. Someone told me to wait a week before drinking and sure enough it worked. I didn't want to drink by then. 
That's harsh. I will not drink with you today and sorry that it's hitting you hard right now.
