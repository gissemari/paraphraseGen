I've been struggling for a while now trying to cut back / stop drinking. I've been more serious about quitting lately and have been having regular bouts of sobriety but then would go back to heavy drinking (usually the weekend). I've noticed a couple of things from going without alcohol for a little bit that are causing me trouble..First thing I noticed is that I have so much more time to fill. I find myself struggling to pass the time especially in the evenings when I'd usually be out drinking with friends. .This brings me to my next issue my social life has always involved drinking. I have a regular group of friends and acquaintances who I would just always see out at the bar. And the only plans I ever made were always to grab some drinks. I'm having trouble trying to figure out how to have a social life without alcohol..Also I've had terrible insomnia. If I'm drinking I usually pass out. Granted it's not a good night of sleep but I'm still able to fall asleep. And if I'm not drinking it's usually because I'm still recovering from a bender. In which case I'm able to fall asleep because I'm so utterly exhausted. When I'm not drinking at all I find it extremely difficult to fall asleep and really hard to stay asleep..And the last thing I'm worried about is sex. I haven't had sex since trying to quit but in the past I've always had at least a buzz on when I performed (usually much more than just a buzz). If I had a serious girlfriend then I wouldn't be drinking every time but I also always noticed a lack in my ability. I can't last nearly as long and I find myself lacking confidence and I'm less assured in what I'm doing. And most importantly it's not nearly as enjoyable for me..I just wanted to voice some of my concerns and see if anyone who has been through this has any ideas / thoughts / advice. It's my first time posting and this is the very beginning of my journey..

Glad you're here!..Evenings were my weakest times.  I went to a meeting right after work did some exercise ate a light meal and went to an 800 or 830 meeting.  Then home prepare for the next morning and then bed...A few weeks of that and I was pretty stable...Meetings and sober activities introduced me to new sober friends...Whadda ya think?
Thanks for posting with such honesty. Here are some thoughts..When I found myself with spare time I also found an opportunity to discover parts of myself that had been slumbering. I could go for walks and discover nature parks and the city enjoy finer arts and culture and even have better quality time with friends at caf s etc. I discovered a lot of stuff that I liked but never had time or resources to look into..I've slept poorly for years. Some things that works for me: Moderate exhaustion in particular taking a walk 30-60 min before sleeping. Hot baths (eases joints and muscles). If I can't sleep in 15 min I get up for 15 min and try again. And no phone in bed (breaking the last two as we speak...).Sex; do you need to perform? Meaning what is really your role? Drunk sex made me more macho sober sex more gentle leaving more space for her making everything more evenly balanced taking pressure off me. If I performed better when drunk it was because I was less inhibited and it was harder to get off. Being sober adds tons to the emotional connection that is so important to build a strong relationship - which is a really liberating way to go. In my experience enjoyment performance and confidence are all connected and when the uncertainty that comes with sobriety wears off it all just gets better..Keep quitting alcohol is a deceitful friend you will be better off without. It takes time adjusting but it is worth it.
