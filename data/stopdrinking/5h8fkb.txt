Hey SD I am looking for song suggestions to a "Trail to Sobriety" playlist. Please comment with any songs that have helped you along the way songs you relate to songs that inspire you songs that make you cry or just anything to put on this playlist. ..On October 20th I got sober for the first time then I relapsed over thanksgiving and now I am starting over and I'm on day 4. Recently I was listening to The Mountain Goats song "No Children" and thought of it as a metaphor for drinking. I used to love singing the line "and I hope I never get sober!" But now I think about it as a song about the relationship between an alcoholic and alcohol personified. Anyways the song was helpful and The Mountain Goats are great. Now I'm going to go shovel the snow off my driveway instead of having a PBR.

This is my favorite songs right now for sobriety ...Migraine- Twenty one pilots .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1aiohrm7ro...Ode to sleep- Twenty one pilots ..**This one in particular resonates with me**..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi105P5bX-g
After reading your first paragraph I was like The Mountain Goats and then I read further haha.  'This Year' by them is pretty good too.  "I'm gonna make it through this year if it kills me." Also 'Save Me' by Aimee Mann.  
before you by jon mclaughlin is like a love song to my sobriety. 
also anything from jason isbell. especially cover me up and if it takes a lifetime. 
I like "Walk" by Foo Fighters.
These are my favourite bands and they both have songs about sobriety/recovery....311:.Get Down .It's Alright .Sun Come Through .Trouble .Whiskey and Wine...Dredg:.Zebraskin .Hungover on a Tuesday .Bug Eyes
"You Can't Rush Your Healing" -Trevor Hall."You Are Enough" -Sleeping At Last."Roll With the Punches" -Colony House."Won't Stop Running" - A Great Big World."You Are Loved" - Stars Go Dim..These are all my favorite selections from someone else's sobriety playlist on Spotify. I have "You Are Enough" and "Roll With the Punches" on repeat when I go anywhere. 
Ceremony-Rohnert Park was an album I spun regularly during those early months...helped me.
