Pro's.Improved memory.Clearer skin.More true to my actual personality.More money.Better money management.Improved relationship with SO.More forward planning.Improved performance at work.More ambitious at work.Less anxious.No hangovers.Improved articulation of sentences (spoken and written).Passed exam.On the way to another passing of exam.more ready to stand up for self (as don't have to deal with anxiety)..Con's.Combative behavior has led to worsening relationships with family.More selfish with my time (could also be a pro).Underlying problems still exist.Have taken cocaine twice in the same 107 days.Realized my BFF is probably not actually a great person to be around.No time off from myself .Still smoking 2-5 cigarettes per day.--------------------------------------------------------.Further reflections..Overall not drinking has been the second best decision I've made in my adult life. You literally couldn't get me to drink now. You would have to fight me to get me to drink. ..As someone who has also abused drugs for many years the habitual unsupervised self medicating with the use of alcohol is material and pervasive among large portions of society...Alcohol is the only drug that you're legally allowed to self medicate with unsupervised. I keep coming back to this thought because of how insane it the truth is...Generally it appears the more a person drinks is directly related to the severity of that persons own perceived problems. ..Struggling to find a true "happy go lucky drinker". Appears that all heavy drinkers have obvious issues either overtly displayed or just under surface.

Congrats on your 100+ days. Funny I found myself way *less* combative with people.
Good job! I'm right their with you at 101 days. I was always self medicating bit I've noticed that my emotions that used to be like a swinging pengalim have gotten a lot more stable and manageable.
