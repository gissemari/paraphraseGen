Today is Day 4.  Still not back to normal but all the more reason never to do this again.  I can't afford to lose 4 days because I drank alcohol.  That's just not acceptable.  The worst part is I didn't even drink as much as I used to.  I drank a somewhat normal amount meaning I was drinking pretty much 1 for 1 with the other people I was with.  How can people function like this?  I can't think straight.  I'm a nervous wreck.  My motor skills are still a little wonky.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm reading This Naked Mind for the 3rd or 4th time.  I'm going back through Chapter 1 trying to really soak it in.  Here are two passages I'm thinking about this morning:..&amp;#x200B;..&gt;When you make a conscious decision to quit or cut back on alcohol your unconscious desires remain unchanged.  You have unknowingly created an internal conflict.  You want to cut back or quit but you still desire a drink and feel deprived when you do not allow yourself one.  ..&amp;#x200B;..&gt;Today's society has conditioned your unconscious mind to believe alcohol provides pleasure enjoyment and support - that it is vital to social situations and stressful situations alike...&amp;#x200B;..I'm thinking back to my relapse on Friday night.  I allowed the conflict to come back.  I went to a place that served food and alcohol and I was with a coworker out of town and everyone was drinking and watching baseball.  I allowed myself to think the way everyone else was thinking - that it would be nice to relax and drink some beer and watch baseball (my personal favorite sport).  Two beers in I realized I couldn't even pay attention to the game.  My attention was completely shot.  Instead we had a conversation that went all over the place.  I'm pretty sure I repeated myself a few times as we got into beers 3-4.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Having beer at a loud restaurant was *not* relaxing.  I have no idea what happened during the game because my attention was shot and I talked about nothing that mattered.  I got nothing accomplished.  I could have had a quick dinner (and a much healthier one) somewhere else and I could have gone back to my hotel room and done something that *actually* relaxed me - I could have continued the book that I had been really enjoying up to that point or I could have done some more research on how I'm planning to make a Raspberry Pi emulator.  Instead my attention was so shot that I couldn't read and I had no interest in using my mind to do something like plan an emulator build.  When I get to this point the temptation is always to just drink more.  My attention is shot and usually I'm pretty revved up from the carbs and the inundation of dopamine.  So I can't really do anything **but drink** because I literally can't use my mind for much else.  Luckily on Friday night I fought this and forced myself to go to bed.  I didn't sleep and I felt terrible the next day anyway but I guess it could've been worse.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Drinking does not cure boredom.  It creates fucking boredom because you can't do anything but just continue drinking to try to feel like you aren't actually bored.  Honestly if I'm in a position where I feel like I need to drink to cure boredom it really just means "hey why don't you actually *do something??*".  I can prove this to myself by trying to do something sober that I think that I enjoy when I'm drinking.  For example I can try to sit and watch a couple of hours of shit TV.  By 10 minutes in I really can't even stand it.  I'm bored out of my skull.  So alcohol is really just dumbing me down so much that I *think* I enjoy it.  ..&amp;#x200B;..OK.  Back to the passages.  I can't just say "Hey I'm not going to drink".  I need to continue to change the way I view alcohol.  It's really amazing how much the image of alcohol has been programmed into society.  It's because it's so well etched that we really have to work at reprogramming this view.  So I say "**No alcohol you do not cure boredom.  You make me fucking bored!**"..&amp;#x200B;..TLDR: Drinking is boring.  ..&amp;#x200B;

This is really insightful and I can relate big time. Whenever I do drink I cannot enjoy anything but every time I first think  ooo what am I gonna do first  but then I find out there isn't anything in this world I want to do at all. Anyways we got this!! Just have to go one day at a time. 
I've thought about this too and Alcohol definitely makes you think you're doing something fun but in actuality you're just sitting on the couch doing nothing.  Time could be used so much more efficiently or other things.
