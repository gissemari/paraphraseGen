Just throwing this out there for anyone who might have some mobile app dev experience: it'd be great to see an app that installs a big red button on your homescreen (for android at least I don't think iphones have that feature?)..At any rate it'd be intended for people in any kind of recovery or support environment. If they feel that they're struggling they hit the button and it brings up all their support contacts as well as other resources such as forums webchats etc. Not sure how easy it would be to do but an inline IRC client that can connect to support line chats and places like #stopdrinking would be great for real-time feedback...I'm sure there are many apps like this out there I just like having the idea of the big button on the homescreen...Hope everybody's having a good one and focused on their goal of sobriety for the day. Be well :)

I like the big red button idea too! It's a bright visual to go beyond just the thought of "I should probably reach out to someone right now". I know that someone (offtherocks?) said that there have been apps developed in the past but I don't know anything about them or if they're still in existence...Hope you're having a good sober and peaceful day too. :-)
I have a note saved in my iPhone like this. It's called "Freaking Out?" and lists suggestions of what to do and who to call and some things to remember. ..It's been remarkably helpful twice now when I was panicky and wanting to escape with alcohol. It includes stuff I generally forget about when I'm upset. Things like "take a hot bath" and "how about a snack?" and "text a friend" and "don't forget to give yourself a break" and "maybe it's okay to feel down for a little while."

Easy way to do this would to have a link to wherever  saved on your screen  making it red  can't tell you.
