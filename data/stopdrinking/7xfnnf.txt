It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** A woman who has been my lifelong friend has a teenage son who suddenly got into some serious trouble. She called me and said  I really need a friend  and I immediately said  I'll be right there  and then made the three-hour trip to go be with her. This was only possible because I was sober...**Struggle:** I am still paying for the many bad financial decisions I made as a drinker and will continue to pay for them for many years to come...**General:**  Sometimes things just don't go right for me. There's a word for that  LIFE!'   Garfield the cat
----------immediate responses--------

Sober Valentine's Day.
Triumph: I've started writing again. I don't know where it's going yet but I have finally decided just to man up and do it rather than be controlled by my fear of failure...Struggle: Now I'm neither drunk nor fighting every moment to stay that way there's no buffer between me and my crippling fear on the future. The spouse house and kids route makes me feel so trapped I can't breathe but not doing that leaves me vulnerable to dying alone and penniless. I don't want that either... ..General: The snowdrops are out they're my favourite flower because they look so fragile and beautiful but they're the badasses that take on the frost. 
Still bored in the hospital  ..Is there any other good info support subreddits for alcoholism?..IWNDWYT 
IWDWYT !!!
Triumph: my nutrition and exercise regime has been ON POINT over the last few days. I look better and feel amazing!..Struggle: I slept funny and have some kind of pain in my shoulder/neck region that no amount of stretching seems to have sorted yet...General: I always thought I was powerless over my addictions but I'm not. I'm powerful. I have a choice whether or not I cave into them. Knowing this and the fact that this has finally sunknown into both my conscious and subconscious mind has made me feel the strongest gest I have ever felt in my entire life.
**T:**  Passed my second exam... 2/2 so far this semester.  I've got a validation tomorrow and I'm nervous as hell about it but I actually feel somewhat prepared...**S:**  Single on Valentine's Day.  I usually don't mind being single but being single on Valentine's Day kinda sucks.  I'm going to make a good dinner for my daughter and I so at least I won't be alone.. .**G:**  As a kid (and teen) I thought Valentine's day was celebrated because of the Valentine's day massacre.  Growing up I had the hardest time trying to understand why we celebrated such a thing.  That's being Italian living in the shadow of Chicago! 
T. Trying to find the time and to think of excuses to get away from my family or work colleagues to have a drink drink was very stressful. I feel so much better now not having to worry about it. ..S. I feel a bit bored in the evenings so I need to find something to fill my time. That should be easier once spring is here and the evenings are bright. ..G. I am taking my son to work with me today. He is very very excited. I wish I had just a drop of his enthusiasm to go to my office. 
**Triumph:** I've gone to 2 meetings this week. I can't say I'm in love with them but I recognize they are good for me..**Struggle:** I have severely neglected my career over the last 3-4 years. I dislike my job and have trouble seeing options out of it. I waste so much time if I could figure out how to focus on my work I might get some enjoyment out of it again (and stay employed).**General:** There is a local bonsai show on in a couple weekends I'm looking forward to checking out. I'm old enough now I can get into old man hobbies with no shame i.e. bonsai.
IWDWYT !!!
Triumph: one of my friends is getting married today!..Struggle: Many many people around me will be hammered!..General: it's getting lighter in the mornings!
Triumph: After a year and a half (when I came off of 10 months of sobriety) I've finally been sober long enough not to feel depressed when I'm not drunk. I feel bubbly and happy and productive and ALIVE. I feel like me again...Struggle: I miss having friends. They all disappeared when I dried out...General: Do the carb cravings ever go away? Seriously when I'm sober I think about potatoes like two hours a day. I thought it would go away after the first couple weeks like last time I sobered up.
Triumph: I've taken up new activities which I always put off during my drinking.  I started rock climbing (indoor) and fly fishing.  I also lost 10 lbs in my first 30 days off alcohol... without trying whatsoever.  I literally gasped when I weighed myself today.  ..struggle:  existential fear - like I have practically never felt.  Being sober has left me feeling like I have no actual friends that live near me and like I may never have friends again.  or a girlfriend.  or a family or anything.  I've been pretty social my whole life so it's probably bullshit mindgames but it's a really scary feeling. ..general:  So happy for Shaun White.  What a gangster.  
T: I have learned so much from my relapse last week and it's given my even more strength than before. Yes I am using my relapse as a triumph! I think sometimes it's the way you deal with disaster that makes you a stronger person. ..S: Had minor surgery yesterday. Feeling a bit sorry for myself. On the sofa today and these are the type of days where I might struggle with bad thoughts. I will remember HALT and scroll this Reddit throughout the day...G: someone posted today something that's really resonated with me! "I got 99 problems but booze ain't one" Yes we have many problems so let's remove booze from the equation and that's one less problem...IWNDWYT
**T**: First time in a long time I have woken up without a hangover or a buzz!..**S**: I am starting to remember why I hated being sober. ..IWNDWYT
**Triumph:**  Got my blood work back.  I've never had it done before so I have no comparison.  But they said that all my levels are excellent.  Blood pressure cholesterol thyroid the works.  Phew...**Struggle:**  Living sober is making it hard to ignore the fact that I am totally miserable in my married relationship.  I love my husband and I don't want to hurt him but I've loathed living with him for years and I need to be independent.  I have to find the courage to tell him.  I want to try a LAT (living apart together) relationship.  I doubt he'll respond well. ..**General:** Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving. -Albert Einstein
**Triumph**: Met up with an ex I hadn't seen in years tonight and felt zero desire to drink and also zero anxiety about the meeting itself. If this had happened two months ago I surely would have had a beer or two on my own before the meeting (rationalization: I have anxiety) then continued to get buzzed during it. It felt good to handle it sober and have a friendly catch up with clear boundaries. ..**Struggle**: Long work hours and spreading myself too thin wearing me down feeling a bit zombified but also crazy productive compared to when drinking.  ..**General**:  Life is objectively getting a lot better! I start to slip and rationalize around 60 days so I am staying vigilant and continuing to check in here. 
**Triumph:** This week is deadline for a quarterly magazine with a circulation of more than 20 000. I m the editor this is my first edition. It s a pretty big deal for me because I was asked to do it *and* to redesign and redefine the publication. The part that makes me dizzy is that *everyone* I ve spoken with (and we don t do polite white lies!!) are stoked about my plans. This has given my self esteem a boost that it sorely needed...**Struggle:** In January I lost my whole income. Like *lost* due to clerical errors partly mine partly someone else s. That was a blow that will ripple on until summer...**General:** I m set up for a root canal in a month. Due to chemotherapy and radiation treatment as a kid I will now have most of this - like all said treatment - covered by public health services. A huge phew to the struggle...! Earlier this year the leader of a great nation wondered why they got immigrants from sh** hole countries in stead of mine. That s why. Apart from that I love said nation :-)
**Triumph:**    Today is my 2 year soberversary :)...**Struggle:**    Not today! ..**General:**     Happy Valentine's Day and Lots of Love to All of you beautiful gals and guys! &lt;3
Triumph: 4 months sober and 4 months fully committed to powerlifting training have not missed a single session of my program. ..Struggle: therapy and realising all the ways I'm fucked up that I now have to face sober. ..General: Can't believe how easily  life stuff  flows when sober - dog walked bills paid bed made bins out etc... I spent so much mental energy on sweating the small stuff when I was drinking all the time now I can't believe how simple it can be. 
Truimph: Sober almost 60 days. ..Struggle: Valentine's Day when you are single is a nightmare. Also trying to find another woman to date who also would think Sephora would be a great first date is nearly impossible. The loneliness thing has kicked my ass this week. ..I forget the the third thing but I will not drink with you today! 
Triumph: I'm not constantly thinking about drinking and can walk down the alcohol aisle of the supermarket without feeling anxious anymore...Struggle: still feel tired all the time and unmotivated to exercise - worried about what all that drinking did to my body with lots of aches and pains I shouldn't have and don't even get me started on my once beautiful teeth  . ..General: This will be the 32nd Valentine's Day I've spent with my husband and I love him more than ever x
Triumph- Made it through jury duty unscathed and didn't have a meltdown..Struggle- Had a serious alcohol craving this past Sunday it passed but I had actually considered it.
Triumph: I filed for a tax rebate spent it on some sweet clothes and paid off my student loan yesterday (not with the tax rebate!). I'd never have got my finances in order if I wasn't sober for such a long time last year...Struggle: On my FB feed a fun night at a local pub with music by a band I like is on in two weeks. I'd love to go and dance but think it's best to give it a miss as I'll probably relapse...General: I'm learning to play tennis and went to practise my serving for an hour this morning alone. Trying to get it right like trying to get my mental health and sobriety right
Mary your triumph made me cry a little - that is so beautiful. I hope your friend and her son and you are doing ok. ..Triumph: The past 8-10 days have been a bit hard on the work front. It happens in everyone's job/life right?  Instead of collapsing in defeat and exhaustion I just kept going doing what needed to be done and weaving in some self-care where I could. Am now over the hump. Proud of myself ..Struggle: Not losing weight despite several months of trying. Feeling fat. Well I can only assume that if I weren't trying to lose I would have gained so there's that. ..General: 200 days today 
Triumph: We often leave our home by climbing over the front fence because otherwise the dog can be a real pain with trying to get out the gate with us. The weight loss decreased bloat and increased agility I am feeling was really obvious to me today as I climbed over the fence - felt heaps good!.Struggle: I am seriously over one of my long-term gigs. She's a nutter to work for [constantly going back on what she says being unreasonable exploitative yadda yadda]. I just can't find the mojo for it right now. Not sure if I can afford to let go yet not sure if I should as I value the readership and my contacts network associated with this publication. guess it's a "watch and see" sitch..General: Still amazes me that different mineral waters have different tastes ditto still waters. One of those "painful" friends who tells me THEY could never stop drinking insists she thinks I should replace booze with tap water only because... that's what she thinks. Obviously she just doesn't understand how awesome a cellar [of sorts lol - it's actually a big box in the kitchen]  of different mineral waters can make a gal feel :) .
Triumph :   My house is so much cleaner!!..Struggle : Impacted wisdom tooth is killing me.    ..General :  Feeling positive.    Not struggling to wake up.    Feeling well rested.  
**Triumph** Just staying sober I guess...**Struggle** I'm in a bad mood a lot. My coworkers irritate me. I need a vacation but don't really have any money to go anywhere and have very little PTO. My bf will not commit to any plans of any kind and basically I feel I have nothing to look forward to in life short term or long. I used to think these things but know I could take solace in my bottles. ..**General** I guess I need to make some sort of plan to do something with what's left of my life and stop waiting around for boyfriend to decide to further commit to this relationship and/or plan a future for us. 
Triumph: I'm still here and my family still loves me...Struggle: Work is a major drag and it's been tough to break that cycle recently...General: Happy to have another chance today...IWNDWYT
Just that...IWNDWYT
T: starting day 10...S: that damn craving won't go away...G: able to deny the craving because life is so much better even if the after work struggle still exists...IWNDWYT.
Question: How much consumption is considered problematic?
Really wanted some wine last night which is weird.  I'm not a wine person.  I think it was my brain saying "It's not beer or vodka so you wouldn't have too much".  But I didn't.  I did have a dream about getting a beer at some beach bar and hiding it from everyone because they knew I'd quit.  The mind is crazy!
T - I'm almost 1 month off the drink! I've been eating healthy I have a routine every day im exercising and I'm  generally feeling better!! I might be starting volunteering in my local heritage community centre next week too I want to gain some more experience and have something recent on my CV before I feel I'm ready to start work! ..S - The days I'm not doing anything  boredom kicks in big time! This gets me down and miserable I guess. I'm sorta struggling with socialising too I depended on drink to be bubbly me and now minus the alcohol I'm paranoid I'm a bore! Feeling kinda isolated most of my mates are drinkers and I've had to distance myself from them so I don't feel tempted plus I  moved to a new area almost a year ago and I'm finding it hard to meet new people now I'm not spending the weekend in a pub! ..G - I haven't had a craving in a while! In general I'm feeling much better and healthier!  I just need to find more to fill my time so my ole friend boredom doesn't kick in! ..IWNDWYT 
Loving this new lifestyle!

Triumph: I got through day one! I got to sleep easily last night with 5mg Melatonin.  I got about four more hours of sleep than I usually do. ..Struggle: I got irritated with my husband last night. My dog who'd been at the vet getting shots updated yesterday peed on the floor last night and this morning.  Hoping she's feeling okay. I feel kind of rough this morning. My best friend is asking for me to do a happy hour with her. Drinking wine is our favorite activity while catching up. ..General: can't get my flair to set on mobile but I'll do it on the computer tonight. Trying to get a bottle of water in me before my shower. I packed healthy lunches for the rest of the week so I don't eat out. ..IWNDWYT
Triumph: It's 5:48AM and I'm about to go to Crossfit. I would have never been able to accomplish this 49 days ago. I'm tired but stoked...Struggle: I've gotten into this habit of not eating breakfast having a small late lunch and then eating a massive amount of food when I get home at the end of the day. I come home super hungry and don't stop eating when I should. Something to tackle if I want gymnastics and crossfit to pay off aesthetically...General: For the most part I feel great. I can definitely feel some P.A.W.S action happening. My moods swing pretty crazily. I'm either hating life and everyone or loving life and loving everyone. There is no middle ground right now...Hope you all have a wonderful day I won't drink with you!
Triumph: feeling the calming combination of no booze and extra yoga on my mind. Calm but with more energy who knew? .A big improvement on the last time I quit booze where I felt exhausted every day...Struggle: more like anticipated struggle... I'll be going back my home country for a week at the end of this month and I have planned to meet up with a bunch of people. .I am worried about staying sober for all these events especially as everyone I meet friends or family is used to drinking with me. My plan is to seriously write down everything I am doing and visualise how to get through each event without drinks...General: I am glad that the rain has stopped here for the past couple of days. It makes a big difference for me as when I am feeling the cravings in the evening I put my headphones in and a podcast on and go for a looooong walk.
Triumph:.I've been hitting my daily work goals all week....Struggle:.I hate my project again (these phases happen)...General:.I watched Dave Letterman's new thing on Netflix.  He mentioned that his dad was a very funny outgoing guy and an alcoholic and that AA saved him both by keeping him off booze and providing him an outlet to entertain people in his AA meetings.  
Triumph: Signed up yesterday for my third Full Marathon. I'll be 1.5 years sober when I run it. I'm already much faster than this time last year! I'm amazed by how quickly the body can heal itself when you take care of it!..Struggle: I think I've developed an allergy to peanuts. I mean c'mon I gave up wine don't take away peanut butter!! ;) ..General: My Husband is not big on Valentines day but he hid little cards for me to find throughout the day. So sweet. 
**Triumph:** Got to take [pictures for Above &amp; Beyond](https://imgur.com/a/Onrob) last week and it was a blast. ..**Struggle:** Haven't heard back from the job I applied to. ..**General:** I bought new pants yesterday and wore them to work today not realizing that I am wearing pink pants on valentines day and I look like a dingus. Whoops.
Triumph: I've made it to day 2 which is a pretty big deal for me...Struggle: Changing how I think about drinking. I need to remember that life will go on just fine without booze. ..General: Looking forwarding to seeing Keep er Moving at UWL this Friday for my love's birthday!
IWNDWYT 
Triumph: I convinced my brother to come visit for the week! Next week I may be posting this as my struggle. ..Struggle: The flu is rampant in my town. I'm dying over here. When is that healthy living I've been doing going to make me you know actually healthy? I wish I could stay home sick every time I'm sick but don't we all...General: I can't think of anything nice to do for my husband for Valentine's Day. I'm going to be looking for suggestions all day. Fortunately we put the day on delay due to flu but now I really have to come up with an idea.
**Triumph:** The past week has been a little rough but today I'm starting to feel better!..**Struggle:** I've been a little depressed the past few days and stayed home from work. I just said I was sick and working from home (which I did) but I gave a lot of serious thought concerning my future from grad school to startup ideas. ..**General:** Are there any board games inspired by Norse mythology? I have an idea for a deck-building game where you try to protect or conquer Asgard depending on which character you choose. It's just an idea but I'd love to pursue it further.
Triumph: Today I am on day two of no drinking for the first time I really have intentionally stopped and admitted to myself that it is a problem..Struggle: My cravings yesterday were ridiculous their intensity made me feel like a such a user..General: Met with some friends this morning and heard an inspiring story. Made me excited for the future.
**Triumph:** I've felt so great this past week! No dramatic mood swings energy enough to do everything I have to do very staisfying workouts and wonderful peaceful sleep...**Struggle:** I learned my boss is looking to sell the company very soon. I knew it was coming but I though I had a good 4-5 years ahead to turn my life around career-wise go back to school if necessary. This is stressing me out...**General:** I'm finally getting to play Zelda Breath of the Wild and it's awesome.
Triumph: I've been sober for one full week something I haven't done in a good long while. I've also gotten a bunch of emails from dear friends in the past week wishing me well and offering support on my journey of sobriety and when I'm feeling particularly rough I go through and re-read them to remind myself why I'm doing this and to give myself motivation...Struggle: I'm still so exhausted from not getting any particularly restful amount of sleep. And I'll be scheduling a doctor's appointment soon to see if there's a low dosage of anything that can be prescribed for the extreme nausea and headaches I've been having because nothing I've tried on my own is working...General: Valentine's Day? What's that? Today's just another Wesnesday where I'll say IWNDWYT!
**Triumph**: Today is day three for me I actually got out of bed early this morning to workout...**Struggle**: Work continues to be my #1 stress. Here's hoping it will lighten up soon or I will be looking for another job elsewhere. I'd prefer not to move. :(..**General**: Playing video games without drinking is slowly becoming fun again.
**Triumph:** I woke up today in a pretty decent mood and my parents invited me over for dinner.  Tacos for Valentines Dinner with the rents I guess it could be worse!..**Struggle:** I decided it was a good idea to fall off the wagon Sunday night.  In a flash I threw my good days to the side.  I've been hard on myself for doing this but the silver lining is it's actually worse than I remembered...**General:** It's the beginning of the Lenten season and a great time to pick something to improve in my life.  The obvious choice is to give up drinking which I plan to do.  But I also want to reinforce other healthy habits as well.  It's a good time of year to reflect and work to improve myself.  I wish you all the best and a great day!
**Triumph &amp; Struggle:** I'm posting on slow internet from a tiny cabin at the end of the road Montana. It's an incredible spot and my dad and stepmom are fortunate to call it home. But I'm also in their home and the only doors go to the bathroom or outside. It's a delicate balance of joyful and forced intimacy a stumbling dance around space and boundaries...**General:** I brought a [cooler full of ginger beer](http://i.imgur.com/scPlafx.jpg) to share. So excited to have found Bundaberg!
Triumph: made it through yesterday and I finally felt strong enough to tell my SO about my decision to stop drinking. Previously I was keeping it to myself because I didn't want to tell her "I'm totally done" only to fail again. But this time I really feel strong. ..Struggle: I thought after a week I would feel so amazingly healthy and great yet i still have days where I just feel kinda crappy and I'm just kinda pissed off that I don't feel that much better than when I was drinking. Of course I feel slightly better but I still get headaches stress and generally just feel kinda bored sometimes...General: I really hope my sober life starts to throw some benefits my way because other than not fucking up I haven't really had too many mind-blowing differences since I've stopped.
Triumph: Made it a week!  Had a big development at work on Monday that may help solve some problems that I've been dreading for months...Struggle: I still worry about "real" tests.  Upcoming family gathering and planned 3-day music festival.  Am I really a non-drinker or I am just in the "honeymoon" phase?..General: "New Year - a new chapter new verse or just the same old story?  Ultimately we write it.  The choice is ours" - Alex Morritt 
Truimph: Yesterday I had an great day checking out the other craft coffee shops in the area and enjoyed being able to talk with the baristas and owners of them a lot. Got a lot of cool ideas for the Indy shop I work at....Struggle: Since quitting drinking I've been getting all sorts of aches and pains. My upper back hurts the areas where my kidney and liver are located hurt. My neck. I get weird tingles on my hands and feet. The list goes on...General: I've started wearing make up again :)..
Triumph: 8 days sober! None of my neighbors thought i had an issue with it so at least I kept monster me under wraps apparently. ..Struggle: every time I do something I used to incorporate alcohol into (nail salon trip yesterday for example) I have to kind of relearn the experience.. and it makes me thinj of drinking :/ ..General: I'm so so happy I don't have to worrying about trying to control my drinking at parties so I don't ruin the occasion but I miss boozy brunches. 
 I'm on day 10 and am feeling good about this time.  Feeling different about it.  Less fearful more hopeful.  IWNDWYT!
Triumph: Managed to get to sleep at the wee hours of the morning and still woke up early no head pounding or need to self medicate with pot.Struggle: Still have to figure out how I'm going to repair my vehicle I drunkenly ran into small trees with never mind explaining it to people.General: I still want to be done because I've been down this road too many times and seen where it leads
This community is amazing. First post here. Happy humpday everyone. IWNDWYT!
T:  Ive made it a Whole Week. Still got urges here and there BUT I'M making it through - one day at a time...S:  Business is slow... I'm self-employed am d know there's ups and downs  but I hate being down right when I decide to quit drinking. Good news is that I recognize that drinking will only dull the pain temporarily until I wake from my stuper only to find I'm still slow and need more loot...G:  It's ValenTine's Day  NOT  ValenTime's Day! Don't make me smack you! ;)
T: I got a bonus at work when I was expecting a "need to improve" talk so I guess I was worrying for nothing. ..S: Still not sleeping well. Struggling a lot with depression which is probably exacerbating the not sleeping. Need to find a new therapist. Don't wanna. ..G: I'm taking my daughters to see Frank Turner in Boston in June and none of us can wait. We saw him last year and had a blast. 
T: I managed to go another day without a drink even though I felt I needed it. ..S: Even though I have managed to stay without a drink I have started to smoke more though I want to quit it as well. Emotionally I felt really shit because of my ex. I'm really hurt what he did to me. I'm filled with anger. I got a urge to stalk his female friends today to see if he has liked their pictures cause I know I had a reason to be jealous of them. I started shaking and on a regular day I would have gotten myself wasted again. I really don't know how to deal with all of those negative emotions. .On top of that I regret losing a connection with one of my friends because he confessed his feelings for me back in the day. I knew that we wouldn't work out because I expect a lot just like my mom. But he was the most amazing friend I have ever had. I'm too afraid to contact him again cause I think he is angry and disappointed in me. ..G: I had a lovely talk with my sister. No one pissed me off at work. I had a small chocolate waiting for me at work for Valentines Day - it was really lovely :). And I had one of the best dreams tonight. 
what a great friend you are mary! she is lucky to have you...triumph: continuing my meditation streak and really feeling the results. more present and focus and able to set boundaries!..struggle: still searching for hope in a dead-end relationship..general: i tend to think about things to get anger. i know my relationship with anger is rocky. but i am trying to think of it in a new light: if i can work on something with the anger do so - if not it is just an obsession i am finding escape with.
**Triumph:** I am finding that by staying present and non-reactive I am finding new depths of love and acceptance with my partner.  It's pretty wonderful.  I hadn't realized how much I had been guarding myself until just recently and this certainly wouldn't have come about if I had been escaping through booze...**Struggle:**  I am really saddened by and worried about my dad.  He's doing okay but between the effect I think alcohol has had on his both brain and his fear of change and the fact of having to move in his mid-70s after 18 years in one house he just seems so overwhelmed and upset.  There's not a thing I can do living far away but I'm just trying to listen and bring a little humor into the situation.  It's hard when your parents become the vulnerable ones...**General:** I dreamt I came to work in my robe after not showing up on the day I was meant to train a new employee.  Guess I'm feeling a little unprepared for all of the constant work here at the moment.
**Triumph:** Keepin' on!..**Struggle:** Fitting it all in..**General:** Years ago I trained to be a vicar. God knows why...
Triumph: Made a dinner reservation for tonight and wine pairings are available with the tasting menu but I am committing to NOT having the pairing. San Pellegrino it is! The bottle is lovely and mineral water is healthy for me...Struggle: Still trying to stop biting my nails but this habit is still less painful than drinking...General: I'm pretty proud of myself if I do say so myself. 70 days!!
Struggles:  Escorted my brother to bars and generally hung out with him while he drank..Triumphs:  Did not drink..General:  It's weird watching someone drink heavily from a sober perspective.  However work's been crazy busy this week so the extra energy sobriety has provided is a blessing.
I've been in medical detox for a week hopefully going home tomorrow... Wo0o0o0o0..After 27 years of hard partying I am finally ready to get back to becoming a fully activated human being...I mean I sang in bands I skydive I've got 3 degrees and was great at my job...Alcohol has been the cause of all of the major disasters in my life.  I can't wait to see what I can do without this monkey innmy belly :)..Safe Wednesday won't drink with you today x
**Triumph:** I've been terrified of trying to fix myself. Paralyzed by the fear of failure. This week I finally went and saw a therapist. He gave me a reality check stating I need help with my alcoholism and addiction. I've gone to two consecutive A.A. meetings this week   my first ones ever. It's been humbling. But more than anything else I feel relieved. I'm finally accepting that I have a problem but that I can also do something about it.  ..**Struggle:** A clearer mind is forcing me to realize that breaking up with my girlfriend of 7 years was a mistake. We had our fair share of problems mainly due to long distance. But I miss her like hell I see her face and hear her voice everywhere. ..**General:** I'm reading *Enders Game*. Pretty stimulating so far!
Triumph: I survived this shitty commercial man made holiday I am feeling particularly bitter about this year. .Struggle: I didn't quite make it through the day without bawling. .General: life goes on.
Triumph: Sobriety has helped things fall back into place with my family...Struggle: Saving a ton of money by not drinking but not quite enough to tackle this mountain of debt I now have to actually deal with. Also it's after 11pm and I'm pounding some candy I pilfered from my daughter's Valentine's Day stash. Oops. Gotta work on these sugar cravings...General: Science Fiction is cool
