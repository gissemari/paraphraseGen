My friend is having a birthday party for her 2 year old daughter this Friday and she invited me. We talk every day through text message but we haven't seen each other in over a year. Whenever we do get together we drink way too much. In fact we have never hung out and not had drinks. I am working hard on being sober (I'm on day 3 again) and don't feel comfortable telling her that I'm trying to quit. I have social anxiety and I'm not ready to tell anybody. It is important to me that I show up to the party and it is also important to me that I don't drink. I am thinking of telling her I fell at the gym and am taking a strong pain medicine and should not mix it with alcohol. Thoughts? I just don't think I can deal with her trying to convince me that I'm not an alcoholic. My own body wants the drink I don't need another person telling me as well. The struggle and anxiety is high right now. My husband will be at the party with me for support if that matters. ..What is the best way to manage this situation?

It seems like a 2 year old bday party is a perfect place to be sober.  I'm sorry about social anxiety.  Maybe the anxiety will lesson being sober.  For me alcohol caused anxiety because I said stupid things.  I won't drink with you today.
Tell her whatever you need to tell her.  It's really none of her business.  Say you're on a diet.  Say you are on antibiotics and it will screw them up. Say "no thanks".  
Just say you're on a diet or doing a detox cleanse or something like that. I think things like that are pretty common these days. 
Definitely do whatever you need to do to get through. The pain medication excuse is good. I think everyone is different when deciding when and how much to share and who they want to share it with. .It's great that your husband will be there to support you!
