Lurker not poster but I feel it might be time for me to get involved around here. A week ago I decided after a long struggle that I'm not very good at moderation and need to slow my roll - I'm one of those functional problem drinkers always last to leave and the only person that has spoken to me about having a problem is my bartender. He was right and confirmed something I've suspected for a while - my drinking is not "normal." I was at the point of a few blackouts a week I've gained 3st and it's probably only because I have a VERY patient husband that I still have a husband...So I decided to quit started myself an X effect card and said "you can make it 49 days!"..I made it 4. Halloween plans already made a bit of drama with a good friend that is visiting and I blew straight past the softies last night. So I'm back to square one. BUT and here's the great but .....I slowed down only had a few and spaced them well and realised that I don't really enjoy that kind of night out anymore. And my sensible-and-moderate drinker husband agreed with me - we're both a bit over it. So he's chosen to be supportive of me on this little journey and we're going to do it together! Silver linings and all that...Thank you r/stopdrinking for making me feel like I can kick this. We won't have a drink with you today :)
