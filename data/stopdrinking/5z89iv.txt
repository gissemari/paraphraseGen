My buddy and I rented a cabin a month ago and took a trip over the weekend.  Until 10 days ago my entire plan was to just drink all weekend and hang out with my buddy.  I told him a week ago that I had stopped drinking and he was really supportive.  He's not a big drinker anyways.  When we got to the cabin someone had left a beer in the fridge from before.  I just laughed.  So instead of drinking I went fishing.  Shot a bow for my first time ever.  Played a little poker.  Found a nice jeep trail to go on.  I went to the movie theaters and saw a movie something I haven't done in a long time because it interfered with my drinking.  It was great to realize I can have a great time without drinking.  It's definitely a retraining of the brain.  Over the past week I've been in the gym six days.  I feel great.  For anyone out there struggling just know I've been there and it's worth it stop.  Thanks everyone
