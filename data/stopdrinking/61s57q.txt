If I drink a 5-6 beers on Saturday night I'm really depressed on Monday. Sunday I feel fine no hangover nothing. Feeling fresh as a daisy. The rest of the day goes fine until the next day. I wake up Monday and feel rubbish all day. No headache dizziness sickness etc but I feel very angry and irritated. I also feel uncomfortable all the time whether I'm standing walking or sitting. I have no motivation or self esteem to do anything. I struggle to concentrate or do simple tasks and I become frustrated with myself. It feels like I could lose my temper and become aggressive any second. Just typing this post was bloody hard work!..The first reason for my post is because I am unsure that drinking is the cause for my current mood. Anyone I've spoken to about this before doesn't get what I'm talking about at all so I'm hoping someone who reads this gets it...The second reason is because i need to come up with a solution. I don't usually drink more than 2 beers at any time but when i do and then i don't drink the next day I feel this terrible mood creep upon me maybe like a feeling of withdrawal. I don't want to give up alcohol completely but I don't know what else to do...TL;DR..After drinking 5 beers two days later I feel emotional and physically uncomfortable. Am I going through withdrawals or is this something else?
