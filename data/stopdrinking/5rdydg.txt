Eight months ago was my last drink. ..I always played with substance. I explored years back when I first moved out on my own. Did my thing with many substance and found that I really didn't like that lifestyle. I was on heroin or Oxycontin (whichever was available) for about three years daily till I did 320mg in about six hours and was "sober" or not high. In AA sometimes I have known that moment as the "moment of clarity" when I looked around my life which was falling apart and decided that I was done. I detoxed for a few days and immediately substituted mary jane for most other things. I still did most other substance but I stayed away from opiates thinking that was enough and in some ways it saved my life. ..It didn't save hers though. I lost my ex to the black and that was another moment that I looked long and hard at my life and I knew that I really was lucky to be alive that it was likely the best thing that I have done to get clean. Yet at the time I was not sober. Still smoking herb hallucinogenics from time to time it was easy to stay away from the oxy and in some strange way it still is. ..But I was still drinking alcohol was there through the whole experience. Like that one habit that just won't go away. ..Not till last year did it really kick in that I didn't need substance in my life. I realized that my life is better without it. Or that is what I am telling myself. I see it of course. I have more money in my pocket it is nice not having to explain myself the day after no hangovers is nice all the things that I learned in treatment...The purpose of life is to live a life of purpose. ..I get all that I do and it is strange to talk to others that are in recovery. When I go to groups (twice per week tyvm!) and I love hearing the stories. I love offering mine in return (hello! that is why the reddit account and the post... first post...) because I hope that I can give back. I don't get cravings though. Not like some describe. I walked away from many things over the years and alcohol was no worse for me than opiates or pot or anything really. ..It has been eight months and of course there has been temptation. It never lasts long and there is always something better to do. Even if it is as simple as reading something inspiring here or on another site. That makes me feel guilty at times. I see others in recovery that struggle and here I am not struggling. I still smoke cigarettes but even those I will forget about if left alone. I am completely clean and sober and have been for eight months now. I guess I am proud of that and want to tell someone. Yet even as I find a tiny bit of pride I feel like I skipped a part some hard part. Through recovery I have found that there is no place for substance in my life that my decisions made regarding substance (minus not doing it) have all been poor. Additionally I find the greater power of the universe around me uplifting in that I can give myself over to it and not fear the future or regret the past. One day at a time right?..This is getting long. I guess my main point is to say that this sub really is an inspiration and I am sick of lurking so.. here you all go.

Welcome and congrats on eight months sober! I can relate to having a moment of clarity too when I seemed to look on my habit with a fresh perspective and realised I needed to stop for my own sake.
Congrats on 8 months! You may feel it's been "easy" for you but it's still awesome to be clean for that long! You never know when a craving may sneak up on you. That's my experience anyway. Cravings pass though and you've got us and your meetings to help you through. I'm glad you're here and not lurking any longer. I toast to you with my first cup of coffee.
