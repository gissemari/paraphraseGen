Damnit after 7ish weeks I relapsed. Trying to diet working harder to keep occupied and isolating is a habit after years of drinking. Remember guys if your hungry angrylonely or tired your at your highest risk.

7 weeks is amazing by no means a small achievement from a hard addiction. HALT has saved me many times myself. .Happy to not be drinking with you today. 
Welcome back and I'm very pleased to say I will not drink with you tonight x.3 Days and counting x
Over the weekend I was all of those. Definitely thought about it but thankfully didn't cave.
