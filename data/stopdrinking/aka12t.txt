I've been struggling with cravings after getting back from a long (and otherwise very good) international trip. I'm also jet-lagged 17 hours which is fine in some ways because I work night shift so am already back on a nights schedule...I still feel isolated because I'm mostly up during the night. The FOMO is real when it feels like *everyone* I know is doing cool normal weekend things even though I know that's a social-media driven version of reality...I need to move apartments on monday and tuesday but my family is working long hours/have told me they are not that interested in helping me. I don't have a lot of stuff but it will take a while to move by myself. I am scared to tell my (many) AA friends that I need help because it doesn't seem like an appropriate thing to share in meetings for example...I am posting here because I feel hopeless discouraged isolated and overwhelmed about it and I don't want to turn to drinking to cope. Thanks for listening :)

You need someone who comes with a least *some* kind of recommendation. How about asking a local minister if they know someone who wants to make a few bucks lifting?
Hi your post caught my eye because i too am moving apartments (yesterday and today).  I was amazed at the support I got from people after simply asking if they could help...I feel like people want to be there for each other so we should give them a chance to.  I'd ask :)
Where I'm at people ask for help moving at aa meetings all the time.  We consider it service work.  Being able to help another alcoholic move really helped me in early sobriety.  ..If your meetings have a non aa announcement time ask then.   You needing help could help someone else.
