This will be day 3 for me.  I have decided to check in daily and post on the daily thread (i.e. today's thankful Thursday).  I feel like just the act of checking in may make me stronger it did help me yesterday when I started to waiver!  Went for a run instead...It is nice to be more clear headed in the morning but I feel like I need hours more of sleep.  Also have been surprisingly hungry I guess I am missing those empty calories.  ..Thanks to all for sharing your stories it helps to see I am not alone in this struggle.  Have a great day!

You too! :-)
We are here for you.  Have a good day!
Hey there you got this! I'm On day 8 and barely sleeping still. Everyone is different and I hope your sleep comes soon.  But one thing is for sure... I will not drink with you today;!
Hope you have a good at too. Stick around here it's a good idea. That's what helps me a lot anyway with focus because my mind wanders so much.
Thanks! I've been waking up feeling groggy &amp; hungover like a truck hit me but as soon as I chug water it's so much better. Amazing. ..I've also been having the craziest and sometimes very disturbing dreams but I'm also on day 5 of no cigarettes and having "quit" cigs a million times I expected that to happen.
