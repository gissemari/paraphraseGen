Still weigh the same but my clothes fit differently.   So dropping inches but not pounds.  Expecting that to come soon though.  Sleeping a lot better.  Waking up is a LOT easier. ..Dark circles under my eyes are getting smaller.  A lot more energy and I feel an order of magnitude stronger. ..Went out to friends for New Years.  They were trashed hanging out by the chiminea.  I realized how stupid it was to drink that much and how superficial the conversations were.  Why? Just why I thought to myself. ..Friend who stopped drinking with me got into a huge fight with her drunk boyfriend that night.  Of course he didn't remember anything the next morning.  ..Last night went over to a friends house for  fire-pit and beers .  Just drank my tea and it really wasn't that hard!  ..Everyone that's struggling hang in there!  It only gets better.  .

I'm 10 days in and I notice a difference in my face. It's not puffy and my eyes look brighter. There's also this weird thing on my face I've heard people call them smiles.
