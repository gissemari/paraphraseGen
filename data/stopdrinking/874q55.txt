Twice I have given AA a try twice in my past. I've been going to meetings lately and have been sober since July. The meetings have been helpful and I have a support by going to the meetings. However I opened up to one of the members about my hesitation about doing the steps and getting myself into the program full force. He understood and he told me his approach to going through the steps and how he works through it and it really settled well with me on how he works through them and really takes it slow which I told him I would want to do. I asked him to be my sponsor and we are meeting tomorrow evening to begin working through the steps. ..Even though I have been sober since July I feel like this will bring me to another level of understanding sobriety and why it is important for me to stay sober as opposed to relapsing. I'm excited nervous but ready to grasp my sobriety even more-so than before. With that said I am very happy to be sober today and will be going to sleep sober tonight. Tomorrow is a new week so with that said IWNDWYT. Happy Sunday folks and for those that are new here or struggling keep working on it and take it a day at a time. You'll feel awesome even though it might not be so fun at first. Rest easy peeps!
