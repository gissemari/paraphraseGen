Wow.  I'm having lunch and catching up on SD as I do frequently.  There is a LOT of heavy shit today.  Prison stories and bar fights.  Black outs and child beatings.  There's a "that's not normal get to the doctor to find out if you are dying".  And there are relapse and regret stories.  ..Well I'm at 300 today and I'm loving it.  I was happy on the way to work.  But reading the shit above puts it in a whole new category.  ..I don't know how to link my old postsbut I know I've posted some previous milestones.  I recall commenting when I got a number in my flair circle.  I may have posted for 30 days.  And I'm pretty sure I had a 99 or 100 day milestone post.  I doubt they were earth shattering posts for anyone else.  I wanted to link them because 300 kinda feels like a lot.  And to all of the people here on day 1 or week 1 it probably looks HUGE!   But my first star also feels sooooo recent. ..My point is that this is TOTALLY achievable for all of you.  I highly recommend it.

300 today for me too congrats Trip1234.
Congrats on 300...The world is a different place to me now than it was when I was drinking.  I am optimistic and confident and when I drank I was angry pessimistic and devoid of self confidence.
Closing on the big 1!
Woot!
Congrats  on 300. Makes me want to yell 'this is Sparta!' .
