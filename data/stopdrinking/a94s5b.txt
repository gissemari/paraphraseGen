This my 17th day 2 in 219 days. Day 2 to me has always been the worst. Bad nights sleep nausea lethargy headache. Thankfully the withdrawals so far on my 1 day relapses have not been excruciating like the first was (after 20 years of daily drinking). ..Last night was compounded by my youngest having a 104 fever and being up practically all night. I have a half day at work than my brother's Christmas eve party which is a booze fest and year after year a shit show for me.. and we are hosting Christmas at our house tomorrow..God give me some strength today to get past this and get some momentum into a sober New Year.....Happy Holidays to all who believe in something...IWNDWYT

The first 4 days are always the worst. Day 1 is usually the easiest because I have a bad hangover. Day 2 I am still very jittery. Days 3 and 4 I am feeling good enough to start doubting I have a problem but still addicted to get cravings. You can do this!! Also I have found that no parties are mandatory when it comes to protecting my sobriety. 
I think I may have had over 100 day 2s  in 2.5 years of trying to quit.  Every time I had a day sober it was putting in the work to get to a better place. Sending thoughts of strength to you this holiday season! IWNDWYT 
Also on day 2.  IWNDWYT.
