Hello all I've been sober for a little over 2 months. Started my journey into sobriety a year ago with an outpatient treatment program had a couple relapses and have now been sober 2 months. I'm a mom and wife and I struggle with some of my behavior and actions I did when I was drinking. I get these  flashbacks  to some horrible times of things I did that makes me cringe. This disease definitely affects the entire family and I hate that. So just wondering how others have moved forward with their shame and guilt. Any quotes ideas or stories that helped you would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Been there. the Headspace App really worked for me in dealing with regret and anxiety.  
I hear you.  The way I cope is by actively trying to learn grow and improve as a person each day.  Negative self talk was getting so bad that I was afraid I was going crazy.  It's part of why I decided to quit drinking.  When memories pop up that make me cringe and I start to hear the negative self talk chime in I shut it down and think of three things I love about myself or ways that I am proud of myself.  ..It seems silly but it has really been helping me and I think it boosts my confidence in other areas too...Example:  Memory of making a total ass of myself at a friend's kid's party.  *Shut it down.*  Think of **1.**  how I spend hours helping to set up and clean up friends parties all the time. **2.**  how I am nurturing my kids with quality time and homemade treats **3.**  how I am pushing forward in my career even though it scares me and it takes a ton of work. ..I can think of three great things about you and I don't even know you. **1.** you are actively trying to improve your health and relationships by not drinking.  **2.** you are honest with yourself about not being perfect in the past.  **3.** you are humble in that you seek advice and wisdom from others...You can do this!  :)
Try to practice self-compassion &amp; be kind to yourself is what my therapist advised. Think of how you would comfort a friend going though these same feelings and say those things to yourself. We are often hardest on ourselves than anyone else. ..I don't have the link handy but Brene Brown's Ted Talk about Shame is really powerful. It's helped me a lot. 
One of my favorite quotes: "Guilt. It's like a bag of fucking bricks. All you got to do....is set it down."..Here's the thing: If I take a GOOD look at my drinking the person hurt the absolute MOST BY FAR is me...Why should I feel guilty that someone's feelings got a little hurt because I was a bit too honest when I wake up with hangovers day after day?..I could give a dozen examples of where things hurt me worse than those around me. Now this in NO WAY excuses the behavior or gives me permission to repeat said behaviors...But it does allow me to realize that I have ALREADY paid for my transgressions. There is no good that comes from harboring shame. ..
I'm struggling with the same thing right now and I know it feels terrible. I wish you the absolute best. I will not drink with you today.
Forgive yourself. Please. Write a letter to yourself. You will see what troubles you. I  wrote a letter to myself when I  was a child and it was powerful for me. 
You definitely aren't alone in struggling with this. 
I found I had to embrace the shame.  It ensures I will never repeat the behavior and helps me strive to be a better Mom wife and person each day. 
Thank you all for your kind words encouragement and advice. For the most part I do my best to be kind to myself but some days seem to be more haunting than others with these negative horrid thoughts of past behaviors that affected my family. I'm a PTO mom have always been a huge part of my children's lives and this disease snuck up on me and it does not discriminate. I know healing takes time and this is a journey. Can just be one hell of a journey some days. Thank you al for your support! IWNDWYT
I 've started to laugh instead of cringe at past shame. and how dumb I  was. Helps stay positive.
I just had a vivid flashback to something shitty I did when I was 20 and wasn't even drunk. I think this issue going to happen a lot until my brain chemistry settles down to pre-alcohol levels.
Shame and guilt suck...but if they help me not to drink maybe they suck a little less.
I'm in the same boat. Thank you for posting. I will not drink with you today.
With the knowledge that I don't want to be that person anymore and making actionable changes to insure that I'm not going to be.
