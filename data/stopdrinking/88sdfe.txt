I am currently training to be a whitewater rafting guide and I feel so at home in the community of guides at our outfitter but there are often post-trip beers &amp; frequent "happy hours" on weekends to relax grill hang out together and swap river stories. ..No one makes me feel out of place for not drinking booze and there's often seltzer water etc. in the cooler too but grabbing one of those over my favorite IPAs is almost impossible. My partner also drinks and a large part of our weekend fun has been frequenting local breweries. ..I try to stick to the path by reminding myself of all the countless benefits of not drinking that I can still have fun and (try to) be outgoing at social gatherings without alcohol but I just so heavily associate a beer with relaxation celebration and being more at ease around large groups of people. It's just that for me one beer easily becomes wayyyyy too many. ..I'm really struggling to break these positive associations with alcohol and begin to truly associate negative things with it but damn... Right now it's all just sounds like empty logic and feels impossible to internalize. Any words of wisdom? How do y'all do it? I've taken a year sober in the past but this time just making it a week seems insurmountable.

I'm involved in the mountain biking community and it seems everything revolves around alcohol. Post ride beers beer gardens at mtb races etc.   .I totally understand what you are going through being in an outdoor adventure lifestyle.   
I have made a fool out of myself at so many mountain bike events because of alcohol.  ..I just took up kayaking ( my boat will be delivered tomorrow yay) and I wanna be clearheaded while on the water...
