Kind of sad that this tiny amount is such a huge achievement. Now for the rest of my life one day at a time.  ..Think I got to 17 days over a year ago before that wasn't counting. I remember that relapse out jogging and seeing people in Harbourside cafes drinking. Think it was more people all together having fun that got me. Why didn't I call a friend? I had friends then.  Now I've moved somewhere new last fortnight so none here yet.  Think I'm starting to see a pattern. Anyway worked 12 hours today off to bed feel pretty good
