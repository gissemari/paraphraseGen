7 months without a drop of alcohol but I don't feel proud about it anymore. I feel like a hypocrite marking my "sober" goal on my Productive app as "done" because I don't feel sober anymore. I haven't had a drink I don't even want one. But I've been behaving the way I used to when I was drinking. I've been trying to act against who I really am. I've been angry and resentful towards the genetic hand I've been dealt and I've been trying to figure out ways not to feel the emotions I'm feeling because they are inaccurate and unwarranted...The first 5 months or so of my recovery were about being thankful for sobriety and feeling confident that everything would keep getting better. Except now I've hit a wall a very familiar wall and I'm faced with a reminder : this is as good as it gets. There won't be any miracle. The reasons why I started drinking in the first place are still here and they're not going anywhere. Just because I stopped using this one particular unhealthy strategy to put up with what I am didn't change what I am.

what are you then?
You're definitely correct insofar that relapse isn't just about drinking. For me a relapse begins much earlier before the actual drink. It begins when my behaviors start to change and I am led back to the drink. It's a lot more complicated than simply drinking...Removing alcohol from my life has never been enough. Sobriety by itself isn't enough. I need recovery and recovery means that I have to work on what I do and who I want to be in life. Behaving like you did while you were drinking but now sober is generally referred to as being a 'dry drunk'. The alcohol has been removed but we haven't changed. I have found that the best way for me to not just stay sober but also to have an active recovery is a three-pronged solution. I take medication for existing related but separate mental health issues. I see a therapist for those mental health issues and for my problems with addiction. And I participate in a support group which for me is AA...Recovery looks different for different people. What works for you might not work for me but I have found that without help from others people don't enter or progress in recovery. I've acted like a dry drunk before and it sucks. It's the worst. Ironically all it makes me want to do is drink. Fortunately if I take care of myself properly (i.e. do those three things) my behavior changes for the better and I actually enjoy life. It's amazing because it actually works and for a very long time I refused to do those three things. ..Life is full of happiness and sadness ups and downs flat-boring-stupid plateaus where nothing seems to matter. If I only believe that life will only continue to get better - I am going to end up disappointed. It's important for me to maintain healthy realistic expectations. Sometimes I struggle - but that doesn't mean I'm still not headed in the correct overall direction. And I NEED help of others to keep on track. ..Personally I think you are right. There isn't going to be some sort of miracle that happens. My recovery is something that I have to work at and sometimes it's less than pleasant. Sometimes it flat out sucks. Sometimes I see red and want to destroy everything I see. So I get help. I do my three things. Life moves on and I end up feeling better. I end up learning something about myself. Maybe you are just learning something about yourself? It sounds to me like you realize that you are basically the same person as you were before. What are you going to do differently about it this time? 
Last summer I hit a mental relapse before I actually had a drop I started making irrational decisions one was moving out of the sober living with a paycheck in my pocket. I had a huge resentment and many other smaller ones I took with me and it was only a matter of time I literally put my blue book and my chips in the drawer and said fuck it.  I haven't had a spiritual awakening and the dimension I am living in is the same. ..I am sometimes short with people and are still introverted to strangers because I don't trust humans. I get cranky and irritable and I know that this is some mechanism still firing in my brain wanting a drink I usually inventory this or meditate because if I don't arrest this disruption I will get drunk. I guess I don't expect any rainbows or sudden windfalls from getting sober but I remain confident I have a better chance at a quality of life more satisfying than the one I was bound to receive living the other way.
personally i think no emotions are inaccurate or unwarranted.  to me all emotions are signals to be decoded.  often when i'm feeling rage or anger if i allow myself to vent or process it in a healthy way i'll find more vulnerable emotions beneath it... sadness grief hurt pain.  often these feelings can be linked back to something in my history... childhood usually.  a point of wounding or trauma...to me it's all part of the healing process.  i try to allow all emotions to be to accept them to meet them with loving awareness...when i resist or deny that they are real or tell myself that they are inaccurate or unwarranted i work against what my body / heart / brain are trying to tell me.  ..hope this bit is helpful but either way i'm proud of you for posting here and sharing what you are going through.
&gt;I've been angry and resentful towards the genetic hand I've been dealt..I feel this way too. Angry resentful terrified anxious and lonely. It's totally common not just among addicts but people with cancer and other illnesses. It takes a long time to come to terms with something like this...&gt;I've been trying to figure out ways not to feel the emotions I'm feeling because they are inaccurate and unwarranted..I don't think it's fair to discount your emotions like that. Your emotions are what they are. I think it's entirely warranted to sometimes feel frustration with having a chronic lifelong potentially fatal disease. The question is how you deal with those emotions. ..The other thing to remember is 7 months is still considered early sobriety. So I think it's still too soon to say whether this is "as good as it gets". ..Anyway please don't drink. It will only make things worse..

Yeah I'm feeling this too. It's one thing to know rationally that being sober won't change everything fix everything etc. and it's another to feel it to live it and experience it. ..The tough one for me is having anxiety return. The big stuff- dread full on panic attacks stuff I haven't dealt with since quitting really. And it's been getting to me. Sometimes it's just so exhausting. ..I still want to escape and there are reasons for it. I find other escapes and I'm still working on that. I still stay in too much probably play too many games too much tv not enough sleep not enough exercise not the best diet and so on. This is a pretty good number of areas that could use improvement and that directly affect my mental health and general happiness and it's just a list off the top of my head...Alcohol was probably the single biggest factor of imbalance in my life- but it was far from the only one. And I have to wonder if it came close to being as big as the rest of them combined. The collective influence of unhealthy sub-optimal choices and behaviors has to be pretty significant. So I try to keep my focus on working a little at a time on the next one. It doesn't always "work" but I think it keeps me going in the right direction. Sometimes I wish I was enjoying the journey more though
This is a hard one for me because I have this really bad form of arthritis that mainly effects my spine. So when you said you were bitter/resentful of the genetic hand you've been dealt I definitely know that feeling. ..With all the chronic pain it's hard to stay positive and  notice myself being edgy for no reason like I would be when I was hungover. So that's hard for me because it reminds me of my using self. ..What I do know and am grateful for is that I am much happier and nicer when sober and I throw way less pity parties  
Just because I stopped using this one particular unhealthy strategy to put up with what I am didn't change what I am. ..No but I think it gives **you** the opportunity to **start** the change. Sounds to me like you're moving from "not drinking" to "recovery" or "sobriety." The "not drinking" phase is where we learn to function without alcohol. The next phase is building a life where we don't *want* to function with alcohol. Maybe your life is as good as it gets or maybe your life is just getting started. You've developed some tools over the last seven months. Time to use them on a new project.
This. A million times this. I had the exact same thoughts when I had six months last time. I know I will this time too. I'm trying to break the addict mind patterns but it is really hard as in not running away (literally or metaphorically) from the feelings switching addictions or overachieving. I won't drink with you today.
Hang in there! You're right where you're supposed to be! ..I hit the same wall at about the same time. Sobriety wasn't a magic pill for me either. I had some REAL PROBLEMS in my life when I got sober. If I hadn't I probably would have kept on doing what I was doing. I had a bad marriage a crumbling career ruined relationships and I was certain I was going mad. And when I first stopped drinking a few of those problems actually got WORSE for a while. ..For me removing alcohol just gave me the ability to start working on myself and trying to become the kind of person who didn't have those sorts of troubles any longer. And I was incredibly fortunate to have found some people who were willing to put up with me for the first couple of years while I was sorting it out. "Keep coming back" they would tell me when pretty much everyone else in my world was saying the opposite...This is NOT as good as it gets. There is a great adventure ahead of you. Cheers...
