Sure I relapsed a few weeks ago... but I've been mostly sober for 2 months now which is the most I've been since the great 4 month abstinence of 2013. In the last 2 months I've accomplished more than I have in years.  ..I've been working on Clair de Lune by Debussy for 10 years. I can play it all the way through (with a bit of difficulty) with the sheet music in front of me but never had the ambition to memorize it.. Memory is not so good when you're drinking I guess? Anyway I can finally play the shit out of that fucking piece and I have most of it memorized already..I also learned Waltz in B minor op. 69 no. 2 by Chopin in 1 week. ONE FUCKING WEEK. All it took was an hour of practice a day.  .  .Anyway I'm writing this because I realized that I was wasting my whole life by drinking. I wasn't motivated to do anything and I lacked commitment in everything. I couldn't even sit and practice for an hour a week let alone a day. I had less than one gig a month singing and now I'm doing at least one a week. It's been hard but I finally feel like I'm worth something again. Like I'm working towards something again. I like who I am and I am actually proud of what I'm doing. I can go to brunch with my family without worrying if I still smell like whiskey from the night before.. and I can tell them that I'm working towards a goal and not just squandering my years at the same old job.  ..I can forgive myself for my small relapse but I know that none of this would be possible if I was still drinking regularly.. and that's why sobriety means so much to me. Thanks for listening.

Thanks for sharing.  "I wasn't motivated to do anything and I lacked commitment in everything."  You are so right about that and I can definitely relate.  Before I knew it years had gone by and nothing in my life had changed.  You can do this -- we all can -- thankfully the rewards of NOT drinking outweigh the 'benefits' of drinking.  It's so rewarding to wake up and see positive differences...no matter how tiny.  I love classical music and especially enjoyed reading your post.  Keep up the good work!
Way to go man! You're an inspiration to us all! ..I'm in the same boat trying to write up a screenplay that I KNOW will be good it's just the time commitment to figuring everything out. It takes a lot of effort to sit there and rehash the story over and over again but your post got me thinking I am not the one to blame. The drink can make us feel like we need it to do as good as we want to do but we both know it's the drink that holds us back.
