Today is my 6 month point of trying to resolve my problems with drinking. I had 2 one-day relapses in the first 100 days. Since the last of those I've been very committed and not wavered...Somewhere in that time I've realised that I no longer see a friend with a beer and get jealous. I don't sit at home and think whatever I'm doing would be improved by drinking. In the last couple of weeks I haven't even been tempted by NA beers or mocktails or other things that I used in the past to dampen cravings. I'm no longer fighting with myself in situations where I'd previously be drinking alcohol. Now I just don't drink...Maybe this is just delayed pink cloud syndrome or maybe it's because being in control of myself is empowering. Maybe something else has changed. I'm not sure. I am though very grateful for it. It feels like I'm entering a new phase where I can just get on with my life instead of fretting about alcohol. ..When I set out I never though this would happen. I thought every day would be a fight and it certainly has been. I know I'm still in the early stages and that I should still be vigilant but it seems to me like there's brightness over the horizon. ..Love you all SD. This community is amazing. IWNDWYT.

What I like about sobriety is peace.  At first every day was a struggle. Then slowly one day at a time it got easier.  Now I'm not torn in two. I'm whole again.  ..Yes there are occasional times where the old thinking pops up and I have to fight a craving ...but now I have the strength to deal with it.  And those cravings are farther and farther apart...I'm so happy for you! Congratulations on all your progress! IWNDWYT
