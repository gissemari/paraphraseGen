I really feel like I made it over the hump and I honestly don't think I could have done it without this community. The commitment I make everyday here has just enough extra weight to keep me clear headed and focused even after the loss of a personal hero and fellow warrior of addiction. ..I'm also really grateful to have friends that aren't threatened when one of us is taking a break. I actually had one of my friends say he might join me next week in staying sober. ..The last time I was sober I made it fifty days and every single day was a struggle.  I knew I was going to relapse because I wanted to. I feel so much different now. I'm confident I can do this but I'm still going to stick with you guys for that boost. ..I can't thank this community enough for everything you do for each other. It really is an incredible place and I'm so happy to be a part of it. ..So much love for you all and everyone stay strong! ..R.I.P. A.B. IWNDFYT

I came here to say... those are real friends you have. Not the phony type.
