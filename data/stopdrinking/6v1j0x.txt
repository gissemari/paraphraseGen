It's been 76 days since my last beer that was my last relapse after a rather brutal argument with my SO. Anger and sadness have always been real big triggers for me and I've been absolutely tempted to drink over the summer. I miss patios. Today I realize I miss my "friends" even though they aren't even really my friends anymore I just wonder if they're proud of me...This isn't a milestone for me really I've gone longer without relapsing I'm just really happy to be where I am today. I needed to quit to get my life together and I'm finally doing just that. I needed to quit to stay alive... and I'm happy to say I'm doing just that...Thanks for reading take care guys you're all so awesome.
