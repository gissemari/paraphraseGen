So I was thinking about this today.  I am neither smart nor a physicist so don't criticize my basic understanding here....I understand that the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is essentially the Law of Entropy.  Basically in an **isolated** system the 2nd Law is **always** at work taking that system from order to chaos.  Apply this Law to your recovery process for a minute......If your recovery is basically "I'm going to use my willpower to not drink ever again and I can do this because I am different or unique" then you are creating an isolated system for your recovery.  You are not feeding your system with necessary things such as human support growth education exercise diet meditation spirituality etc.  By relying upon willpower alone you are creating a system that will never get stronger or grow.  The 2nd Law is constantly acting on an isolated system to do what???  **Bring it to chaos!**..It is no wonder that people who fail or relapse in recovery frequently report that they either never did anything other than willpower or if they did do things they stopped doing them after a while.  After they stopped doing things for their recovery slowly but surely the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics began bringing their Order of Sobriety back to the Chaos of Drunkenness.  ..So my hope for all of you is that you continue to do whatever is necessary to feed and grow your system of sobriety so that you prevent the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics from bringing you and your life back to chaos...I know this makes little sense.  But it sounded good in my head earlier..... :)

I liked this :D
Wut?
It makes sense. You have to have a plan. All the things I used to do were replaced by drinking. When I don't drink I just sit there. Time to go back to who I was before this. 
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is you do NOT talk about Thermodynamics.
Since this is reddit I might as well say it:..*How can entropy be reversed?*
Nice. I like how you got all science on  our ass.
awesome post! 
Surely the laws of thermodynamics might apply to other people's recovery but I AM DIFFERENT...:P
