And right now I'm hating him for it. We're doing this company get away thing for a day and carpooling. He just told me that while we wait for someone else to show that we're going to a bar to play pool. He didn't ask he said it. He knows I'm not drinking not that I have a problem with it. He said I can watch him drink instead. I don't want to be fucking around booze and I don't want to be around him. Id rather work than go on this stupid thing. ..I don't think I'll drink but I'm in a bad mood and just want to be left alone. I'm really struggling with sobriety and depression lately and life is raining shit from left and right. Seriously what's the point of trying if life is constantly shit. I hate everything about this.

Ugh!! Hang in there you can get through this. Also if you are sober will you smoke him at pool? 
Is life raining shit on you or is the universe presenting you with an opportunity to learn and grow?..In my own experience what helped me to move on from depression and feeling that life is not worth living was to simply view everything that comes my way as something that can help me grow and become better no matter how difficult it may seem or how bad I don't want it to happen. You've got yourself a difficult situation no doubt but you can use it to grow. People can be difficult and life doesn't always go our way and we have no control over either. We do have control of how we react and realizing this has helped me tremendously on this journey. Good luck!!
This too shall pass.  I won't drink with you today.
Your boss sounds like a bit of a jerk.  Hopefully you can smile your way through this ordeal and spite him by not drinking:).  Speaking of which I will join you.
