I hope this isn't TMI but has anyone else really struggled to be intimate since getting sober? I just can't seem to relax or let go enough. My poor husband. I'm nearing 90 days and it hasn't gotten any easier. Should I just give it time or hit up a shrink?

I discovered pretty quick that sober sex is out of this world! If you are on any new meds that can have a pretty drastic effect on your drive or lack there of. Going to therapy is NEVER a bad idea I schedule mine like it's a tooth cleaning. Your gray matter is the driving force behind your overall health if not functioning properly all else fails.  
Did someone say SEX!  I love SEX!  It's right up there with food sleep exercise and breathing--a top 5 for sure.  It's such a big part of our sober lives that the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book actually deals it with separately acknowledging that this can be a real issue in early sobriety.  And /u/Ms_Dziobak --this is still earl sobriety for you so relax.  You are normal.  Counseling is always a smart thing in both new marriages and new sobriety so I vote for that--it helped me tremendously.  One other thing I was taking an anti-depressant when I returned to recovery in 2009.  When I weaned off my psych meds my libido came zooming back like nobody's business.  That's my story--please don't misconstrue it as advice.  But you may want to talk to your doctor if that sort of RX is in the picture.  ..Good luck this is going to work out for you.  I have no doubt about that.  Just some more time.  
Totally normal.
