I've been struggling a lot with not freaking myself out over what could be wrong with my body after years of drinking. Despite assurances from multiple doctors I keep convincing myself I'm suffering from all kinds of symptoms. I've always suffered from pretty severe anxiety which I think is a big part of why I drank so that's probably why I'm having a lot of problems...Either way I just completed a 60 minute spin class at the urging of my wife this morning. It was a hard work out but I feel fantastic. It's also a nice assurance that if a lot of these problems existed I probably wouldn't have been able to do that. ..Typically on a Saturday I'd be drunk by now from brunch. This beats the hell out of that.

Amen to that.   ..I am one of those people who BSd themselves into thinking that exercising regularly balanced out drinking beer.  I'd workout burn 500 calories then go home and consume probably twice that via beer and bad food ha.   ..After about three weeks or so of no alcohol I really started to notice a difference exercising.  I had a ton more energy.   
Well done! You'll find that a lot of us here drank to "help" with anxiety which of course is a disaster waiting to happen. Have you tried meditation? I started about a month into my sobriety and it's been a huge help.
