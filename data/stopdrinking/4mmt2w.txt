Hello all...My drinking problem wasn't an every-day thing.  My problem is that every Saturday I have a few drinks with a friend of mine and after he leaves I can't stop.  And I drink well into Sunday morning and I'm left with a hangover that lasts for days.  It was ruining my life stealing one of my only two days off a week...So I had two friends over last night.  The second one doesn't drink.  My drinking buddy arrives and asks if I want one as he goes to make his and I said "not right now."  And he just sort of never asked about it all night until after my sober friend had left and right before he left he asked me if I decided to quit.  I told him no (I don't want to make a big thing of it).  He was like "So you haven't found Jesus or anything have you?"  "No I just didn't feel like it tonight."  And that was pretty much it he left and I went to bed sober on a Saturday for the first time in *years*...However the next day there was a party in my old neighborhood.  I contemplated drinking and decided to have a few beers since I was controlling myself so well lately.  I had a few more out there and by the end of the night I struggled to remember just how many I had drank and I felt so DISGUSTED with myself.  Now I'll have to start over.  I'll have to reset my badge.  I didn't prove diddly-squat to myself!.....and then I woke up.  6AM...  Sunday morning.  There was no party on Sunday.  I had hung out with my buddies on Saturday night and successfully not drank.  And then had a dream about drinking...I have never felt more relieved in my LIFE!..Here's to Sober Sunday!
