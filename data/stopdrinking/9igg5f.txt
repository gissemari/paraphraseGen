Just over a year ago I had 6 months under my belt. Then I caved in. ..Today marks the first time I've been a week clear since then. In truth until this 7 day streak I've not gone more than a day without caving in; stupidly making excuses to have a glass of wine. ..Now I have a big ass shiny "1" badge signifying way more to me than just seven days. It's been a mountain of a week...Thanks to you lot my wife and a huge amount of reading "This naked mind" over and over I'm on the right path again. ..In a weird way I'm almost glad that I had those 6 months and failed with a slow demise over a year into heavy drinking. I know now that I hadn't addressed my deeper issues and was mainly running on motivation and willpower. That shit can only get you so far if deep down you still think booze is good for you...This time I'm changing my subconcious so it knows that alcohol sucks camel dick. No more relapses for me. That stuff is evil...My wife suggested to me last night that I write out all the pros and cons to drinking so I might begin to journal this experience to help going forward and such...My response?  ..There are no Pros. It's all a con. Every single one of the excuses I could want to come up with would be bullshit. We've all been sold a lie and it's time to fight back. ..Screw alcohol I won't let it brainwash me anymore! Hoorah!..So there you go. Just wanted to write something down and get my head right this beautiful Monday morning. Thanks for reading...IWNDWYT folks! So so glad to back with you guys..

Good to have you back buddy and nice to hear about your supportive wife and the motivational quirks you are going to use to keep you focused.
Great to see ya Silvo!..Congrats on that big ass shiny **1**!..You're right...there are no pro's when it comes to booze ;).
Great that you're back such an inspiring post - I will not drink with you today  
Alcohol does suck camel dick. Congrats on your week and I will not drink with you today
I'm really proud of you brother. Welcome back :)
Brilliant 1 week. Soon 1 month then 1 year !!
Welcome back Silvo! I realize too that I need to work on my deeper issues. There's a reason we became alcoholics.
Good to see you're back!
Yes! You are so right! There are no pros whatsoever to drinking. It's all lies. 
Really? There are no pros? I find it interesting that one would dump gallons of a toxic addictive carcinogen down the hatch for nothing. Alcohol gave me things but at too high a cost. My job is to find new nondestructive ways of getting them.
Congrats on your one week. That's awesome. 
I think writing down all the cons could still be beneficial! It is similar to using the cognitive behavioural therapy that is included in the SMART handbook :) somehow writing it out into something physical and tangible makes it easier to see how ridiculous we were with all these cons so apparent. ...Welcome back though! I relapsed the day before my 6 month badge a couple years ago and that experience made me learn a lot. ..IWNDWYT you got this!
Shiny!
Thanks I needed this.
Well done from getting back on it  
I'm so happy for you!  Congratulations!   I hope to be where you are soon.  Keep up the good work!
The only "pro" when it come to alcohol and addiction is that when you stop people are so supportive forgiving and understanding (I know this isn't a 'pro' for drinking per se but bear with me haha). I'm still amazed and thankful how good 'normies' are in regard to this. So so many people go through it or live with it. When you make the effort to change and to stop drinking more people than you think understand. 
Im still new to the game and haven't made it anywhere close to six months yet but the idea of the pros and cons list really resonated with me.  One thing that really propelled me into quitting was keeping a note on my phone containing all the reasons I desperately wished I **could** stop drinking.  All the feelings of withdrawal shitty hangovers dread about what I said or did the night before disappointment with who I was and what I was letting myself become etc.  There were a few times in the first few weeks where I'd be tempted and those notes were a very very good reminder as to why I was doing what I was doing.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I **still** add to them as stuff occurs to me now...&amp;#x200B;..Glad you're back!  IWNDWYT.
Cheers for the replies everyone. Glad you're all doing good today...These Liminal chapters in Annie Grace's Breakdown of perceived pro's really stuck a chord with me. If you haven't already the book does a great job of revealing many of the issues with our social conditioning. I'd urge everyone to read them if you can....Are We Really Drinking for the Taste? ..Is Alcohol Liquid Courage?..Drinking Helps Me Loosen Up and Have Better Sex ..I Drink to Relieve Stress and Anxiety ..I Enjoy Drinking; It Makes Me Happy ..Is Alcohol Vital to Social Life?..Really digging deep down into these questions has helped me a tonne already. ..Peace n love n shizzle. 
IWDWYT!
IWNDWYT.
Im right there with you i stopped yesterday after a 2 month rage bender. Have court today no matter the outcome will not drink with you today!
I can completely relate to you on this one.  When I was 27 I said enough is enough and got sober.  Got 18 months in and decided I can get away with a little drinking here and there.  Well I'm 34 now and as of today I am on day 63.  Between those first 18 months and now I have at most 9 and the past 8 months I maybe had 5 days where I didn't drink.  This addiction/disease is a real tough cookie and the moment there is any doubt or question that devil on your shoulder will be right back in the drivers seat.
Just hit 7 days without a drink myself. Never gave it a real effort in the past. Just stop for a few days after a rough night. Hoping to go the distance and just be done with it.
