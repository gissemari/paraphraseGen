Hi Everyone..Yesterday I celebrated four years clean and sober. Sobriety is something I have struggled with since I was 14. Before I came back in I was suicidal. I was truly hopeless. I had so many  things  but these  things  didn't make me happy and in the end weren't meaningful. For mean I have found hope and a meaningful life in sobriety with other sober people. Today I no longer want to take my life. I love life today. This year I took the jump as a college drop out to start going back to school. Before sobriety I had no idea how to do school. This year I have obtained six A's and one B in my classes. That alone is a testament of what sobriety can bring you. If you are still new at this I ask that you just hold on. My first year was tough as nails but it has been so rewarding! I wish you all the best and good luck with your sobriety!!!
