The second 30 absolutely flew by. Survived a long business trip to Asia where I always drink. Last bender in December got me to my sobriety date. Anyway it is true that it gets easier. No where near the struggles for early sobriety. I still have issues but those terrible cravings have mostly gone away...So...for all you new people listen - do whatever (and I mean WHATEVER) it takes to get to 30 days. It took me two years of trying to get to an honest 30 days of no alcohol - what did it was having a plan a program and some tools that helped me...I know what it's like to read this sub with people posting 60!!! and 90!!! and one year!!!! and think "you might as well say go climb Everest cause there is no way". Here's the deal - get through the next hour next period of time the next craving but chose not to drink. Don't worry about the wedding next month or the office party - that's your brain trying to trick you into drinking right now. You can't be sober for 90 days in one day. Take care of yourself today right now in this moment...Eat sweets call people post here - hell - I had a staring contest with my minibar in China two weeks ago and I found a guy from Norway at 4:30 EST to chat with (see sidebar). Thanks bluerum whoever you are!..I know it's a cliche - but seriously I said a million times I couldn't go for a week...and here I am...We can do this people! Don't drink today.
