I had over 2 months sober and experienced happiness in excess of what I have felt in almost 20 years. I was free I lost the crippling anxiety I was everything I should be in life in myself. I had a relapse which I thought would be a one night thing. It's been 16 days since I was sober (I am right now not one drink today) and I desperately need to come back:( I am not putting this out there so people say the amazingly nice things this community is great at I don't want to post this as a  I need extrintisic help to get sober . This is a plea to myself.....please bassibear please get back to the path you should be on. Stop doing this to yourself. Find your worth again. Know that you can do this and say I will do this. I'm the micheal Scott of soberity no one talks me down like myself!!! So do this girl. I'm sad seeing my badge number because I've been too cowardly to reset. ..This is my honest pledge to myself that I will do this. To my son my dog my cat  to my future....please do not drink tonight.

This is a hard time. The self punishment that i used to do when i fucked up and the best way to fuck up was drink. ..The most natural thing for an alcoholic to do is drink. You did what you were programmed to do. Dont beat yourself up. ..Start over again. Ask yourself how you managed to get some sober time last time around and ask what you did right and wrong. Dont just focus on the wrongs. Find what worked and what didnt and try not to repeat the same mistakes. 
Reset the badge be honest with yourself.  And remember you could do 79 days before.  you can do 279 as well.  And then 479.  And then 679.  A lapse is not a total loss it's momentary lapse... You're still on the wagon get back on..
I'm glad your back. I'll will not drink with you tonight!
