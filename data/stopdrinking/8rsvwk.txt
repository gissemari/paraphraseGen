I know I can't be the only one that today is hard for.  My father passed two days before Christmas last year and yesterday at work it hit me what today was.  I was so tempted to drink through the pain and get through it that way.  I'm really glad I didn't.  Just wanted to through out some support to all of you out there struggling with today.  Don't do it.  Your fathers would not want that...IWNDWYT!

Big hugs to you on this Father's Day. Being sober is a wonderful way to honor your dad.  .IWNDWYT.
