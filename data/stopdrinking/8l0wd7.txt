7 days now without any alcohol following a terrible week which began after carelessly leaving a receipt in the car a few weeks ago that revealed my secret habit often of a bottle of red wine a night when I am away for work accusations of my betrayal of both of them with my abject lies to conceal my behavior risking our entire livelihood if this were ever revealed in the work setting followed by the silent treatment for a week with threats of divorce and not ever being a major part of my son's life again.   ..We have been down some version of this road several times before but have again reconciled as of last night.   Still  based on what I am seeing with many others' struggle with alcohol on this site I will probably be posting again soon as my  trigger  (being away from home for work) happens again tomorrow and I am sure the feelings of entitlement and the need to relax with a drink (or 5) will return.   Especially now that things are no longer so contentious at home. ..But have to push through for my well-being and especially that of my spouse and 2-year old son   too much at stake to risk it all for wine!

I am in a similar boat wife threatened to kick me out she finally did shes moving in a month and I'm not allowed to move with them until I have been sober for 6 months.. basically Thanksgiving.. the thought of it taking that long is overwhelming and right now she lets me home on the weekends I leave today and I know that urge to seek solace in a bottle of wine will be there. Trust me I know after like reconciling you're like yep now I can slip back in but trust me.. eventually he wont want to and you'll end up like me away from your spouse and kid and for what? ..That's what we have to focus on.
