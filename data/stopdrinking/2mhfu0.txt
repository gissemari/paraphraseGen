Little background. Currently a senior at a big university. Not an everyday drinker but would go pretty hard from Thursday - Saturday. I had the realization last Sunday after pretty much blacking out after a tailgate wiping out at the bar hitting my head and waking up several hours later with a big bump on my head that I needed to change something. Also the realization that I spent Thursday to Sunday either drinking or in heavy recovery mode. Then spending Monday's getting through the day just to get home and be able to relax. Tuesday's feeling pretty good getting to the gym usually. Wednesday feeling good getting stuff done. Then Thursday restarting the cycle...Took this weekend off completely (not without a struggle. Was being tempted to visit another college which would have undoubtedly been a shitshow. Good on me!) It's really nice not being hungover today after the typical 3 days of boozing. The crazy anxiety that I usually have to fight through on Sundays is nowhere to be found. My usual move of getting chipotle laying on the couch and watching football from noon until 10:30 doesn't feel like something I want to do especially with my team being a catastrophic letdown. I'm headed to the library now to work on my job search for a few hours. Productivity on Sundays is a new phenomena to me...Gunna keep running with this and see where it takes me!

Congrats on a week! Glad you can see the difference in yourself already and keeping busy. It's amazing how much we can accomplish without struggling through that hangover. I was a binge drinker like you and wasted so much time on recovering from the night before. Keep at it!
