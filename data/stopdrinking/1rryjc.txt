reddit this living as an alcoholic is awful.  I've just relapsed once again and I can't handle it.  I would rather be dead than be at this condition.  how do you guys do it?

Don't drink today. Repeat.
You want help or you wouldn't be here. It is possible to be sober but you have to want it. Life has to be better sober than drunk or you won't stay sober. Sounds like rehab would be something to seriously consider. ...I did it with a lot of help. I protected myself from alcohol at every turn. I went to detox inpatient treatment had a counselor sponsor went to AA meetings did the steps and stayed away from people and places that were triggers. No alcohol in my home never alcohol within arms reach. Had phone numbers to call when I needed to talk. ..I did it by working the steps understanding the disease of alcoholism and accepting that I have the disease. I embraced sobriety because if I continued to drink I risked losing everything including my life. I accepted that being sober was the only sane solution and asked for help from every resource. New friends and experiences must replace old behaviors. ..I'm sorry you are suffering.  You CAN get well. I had to stop arm wrestling with alcoholism and do some things which I thought were drastic at the time. However I got a counselor and did what she told me to do. I got well. You can too...

I'm fairly new to this as well but I've figured out that the time I get "squirrely" and really want to drink is 8:30-10:30p.m. Lo and behold there's an AA meeting near my house at 10:00p.m. ..I can't walk into an AA meeting with a shot of bourbon in me so I've been going nightly. Even though I don't much buy into the higher power stuff the people have similar struggles and nothing replaces the comfort of booze like not feeling alone...That's what I've got. You lost the battle but you didn't lose the war. Chin up.
Do not admit defeat. Start again. Do more do different. Let people help. 
**Honesty** - I find people I can tell anything to. I acknowledge and even embrace some of the sick thoughts urges cravings using dreams etc. They are part of me and by not suppressing them I am able to deal with them. I also tell people about them it takes the power out of them...**Patience** - No matter how bad I feel or how strong the urge is I sit tight and wait. It will pass. I can drink anytime I want to and when I want to drink I make myself wait until tomorrow. I can look forward to it think about it and tell my friends what my plans are...After the last really powerful craving I had I went to a meeting and told a room full of about 30 people what I was feeling and thinking. It killed the urge. I have mixed feelings about AA but there are times it really helps...My doctor also knows my entire history. He helps by prescribing medications to help deal with some of the chemical imbalances and underlying issues. There is no miracle drug though. I still have to do the work the meds just help out a little...Things get easier and they get better. It just takes time. The only way to make any situation worse is to have a drink.
Living as an alcoholic is easy.  It's the drinking that's hard.  I pick the easy path.  Get back on that wagon and take the easy route.
Don t let yourself get bored do anything whatever it is reading a book playing videogames. Whatever.
AA for me.  After 7 years of trying and failing.  
I was ready to do anything. ..Really anything. I was so done. ..Somehow I'd found this sub and I trawled through comments for those that clicked. ..I started with a decision to go 30 days. But a little voice spoke up and asked what then?..I'd no doubt I would pick up and needed to get help in the real world. There are so many options smart / life ring / 12 step.   Find one that rings true for you and be willing to change. ..That's the hard bit if you're as stubborn as I was.  ..But dealing with the fear of change became preferable to living is such pain. 
It's hard but not impossible...  But it does seem impossible when it feels like it's getting to big...There's some good stuff in this thread.  It helps to find something you love.  Before I spent most of my time killing myself with a bottle I loved working on stuff.  I've recently channeled that into doing small parts work with firearms and I REALLY want to start turning wrenches on my truck.  Honestly the thought of doing a complete spring replacement in one of my J-Frames is way more appealing than drinking...  It's also way harder when your hands are shaking and you're drunk-sick...  :D..
I've been there too and it sucks... Sorry to hear that. If I could offer some encouragement is that it gets quite a bit easier to stay sober - the hardest part is up front t if you can make it through that I bet you will see lots of improvements to general life quality. But I can't say anything other than you have to do whatever it takes to get there... It's hard but you can do it. Dust yourself off think about what happened and how you can avoid it again and move on.
I haven't been sober for very long but what has been keeping me sober is that I want to see how far this rabbit hole goes. I wanna know what its like the longer I am sober. I want to see what I can accomplish how much money I save who my real friends are and I want to learn how to cope with things and face them without alcohol. I also want people to like me for me (and they do) but I wanna be that person more and not the person who is "so fun when she drinks" because its hurting me. A lot. To do that....Thanks.
