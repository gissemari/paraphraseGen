I wrote this in my journal earlier and felt compelled to share.  Some background: my father passed away very suddenly three years back from hepatorenal failure brought on by a lifetime of heavy alcohol abuse.  Good luck in your struggles.  I believe the mind is capable of overcoming all addictions. ..***..I fell asleep in the car by the ocean.  I slept with the windows down to the sound of the waves and the breeze blowing in.   I had a very unsettling dream as I slept.  I'm in my mom's house only it doesn't look like her house.  In the dream its a crumbling adobe building  with a single door that opens to a narrow unpaved alleyway of sand...The house is empty except for rusty wire racks holding pots and pans and dusty old furniture.  I hear footsteps and look up and I see my father standing in front of me.  He's not the way he looked the day he died - he looks the way I remember him before - plump and healthy looking skin and that mischievous smile he always had right before telling a crazy story.  He's staring in my eyes and that smile says to me: "I never died.  It was all one big joke but I'm back."  I am too shocked and overjoyed to move all I can do is yell: "dad!  dad!"  There's so much I want to ask him so much I want to say.  How is he?  Is he real or a ghost?  If he's real where has he been these last years?  Why didn't he tell me he was alive?  I want to tell him all the incredible things I've experienced in life since he left but I'm still too shocked to put any of this in to words.  I just keep yelling excitedly: "dad!  dad!"..Suddenly he lunges forward and shoves me out of his way. The smile is still on his face.  He starts tearing through the house like a madman knocking pots off the racks and tossing the furniture.  I follow behind him still yelling "dad!" but he doesn't acknowledge me.  ..Once he's turned all the furniture over he yells out and becomes raging mad.  My excitement melts - I am consumed by fear.  Intense fear that he is acting this way because he is about to hurt or kill me.  I feel the same fear like a masked intruder has broken in.  I run out of the house to the alleyway and back up against the wall gripping the adobe wall with sweaty palms.  My heart is pounding as I hear him crashing through the place.  I no longer wonder where he has been I am only consumed by fear that I'm about to die and a need to escape. My mom notices me and comes outside calm as though this is normal.  She looks at me and in a reassuring tone says: "he's just looking for his whiskey".   Then I wake up.

I liked that passage.Hope your writing is therapeutic for you. .My father never drank or smoked his entire life and we found out he has cancer about five months ago. I've been drinking pretty heavily for the past year and it ramped up considerably when I found out his diagnosis. I just found out last week he has 3 months to a year which is a major factor in me finally wanting to get clean. Thank you for sharing
