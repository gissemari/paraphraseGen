Hi y'all. Disregard my current badge number (ninja edit: it's been updated and accurate now!)... I was here about two years ago and challenged myself to stop drinking for 30 days. I made my goal and even went a couple of weeks longer before I realized that alcohol wasn't my big problem at the time. But man 2016 has really been a fucked up year for me and I've realized that while I'm not a daily drinker or even usually a binge drinker I'm not drinking healthily. I soothe my anxiety with beer and wake up with feelings of shame guilt and regret the next day even when nothing happened to substantiate those feelings (though there have definitely been times I've put myself in bad situations or made an ass out of myself in one way or another). ..The last couple of months I've been thinking "Okay I'll quit on the first." And then some event comes up and I think "Alright just this one night.." and pretty soon the month is over. I lurk around here and read peoples' posts sometimes and today I just thought "Fuck it why wait till the 1st? Why not today?" And so here I am. ..I struggle with calling myself an "alcoholic" so I'm not going to for now. I do feel a little anxious about not drinking over the holidays and what I'll say when my family asks me why I'm not going to have a drink if people will notice at our work's holiday party what friends will say etc. In true commitment-phobe fashion I don't know if I really want to quit *forever.* But what I do know is that there are so many things I want to improve upon myself so much time I could be spending doing productive things and so much money I could be saving/paying toward old debts and stuff. I know I want to at least take a break. ..So maybe not forever.. but at least just for today I will not drink.

Awesome. Nice work!
&gt; So maybe not forever.. but at least just for today I will not drink...And that is the true and only way. Small steps. I recognise the "special date dilemma". Stop at the 1st stop after X is over hey it is August 13 I'll stop at August 16 (I am a number geek cuz that is 16-08-16) then I stop or get close and my mind is already finding new dates to use so I can still drink. I settled on 11-11-16 and stuck with it since. It helped that this was a week before my medical exams and I wanted to stay sober. Afterwards I could have easily drunk so much to celebrate nothing bad was found but since my abstinence my complaints got less so I stuck with it. ..I will join you today I will not drink.
