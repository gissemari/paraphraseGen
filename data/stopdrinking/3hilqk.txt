Made it through the first week without much trouble. Having a get together at the house tonight and we have some cool ones in the fridge for the guests. I've even been to a bar this past week and it wasn't an issue. But this just looks so inviting right now.  .   I need to remind myself of the craziness I was going through for the past 25 years. It was no fun. Not worth the cool taste of a beer to rekindle that madness. F'it!  Holding strong. .    Thank you fellow redditors for being here to vent to when the going gets tough. I'm not going to drop after only a week. One day at a time is truly the way to think. Not drinking today no matter what.

NOTHING is worth a relapse based on my own personal experience.  But 9 days in and you would even consider it?  For a few cool ones in the refrigerator?  ..I don't know about you  but I'm going to bed sober tonight with a plan that I am going to get up clear-headed tomorrow and repeat.  
Good on ya for recognizing a potentially dangerous situation and for reaching out.  Whenever drinking seems like a good idea to me which is (thank God) rare these days I play the tape forward call another drunk &amp; meditate.  Works like a charm!
