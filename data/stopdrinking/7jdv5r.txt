One thing that I have learned in my last few attempts is that it takes a long time to go from consuming alcohol to not being affected by alcohol anymore. For me it's at least a month probably longer. The other way around is much faster...I recently relapsed after 60 days sober and the experience was very different from how it used to be I think getting drunk isn't as enjoyable when you aren't using it to relieve withdrawals. More importantly I got to experience not being a drinker and then being a drinker very soon after. I could so clearly see the enormous difference in how I felt and the amount of things that had improved without me clearly noticing them since they had taken months to happen. Over the last 20 days the magnitude of the effect alcohol was having became clear...With both choices clearly in memory I was able to make an informed choice. It has cemented my resolve for me even small amounts of alcohol have a big negative impact on my whole life. As I come closer to being unaffected by alcohol again I grow more certain that I've given enough of my life to alcohol...I remain sober with all you awesome people!

Great insight!
Yes!  I haven't been drunk in 4 months.  I had one beer at the company party this past Saturday.  The thought of getting drunk there felt absurd.  In the past not only would I have drank plenty there but I would have continued at home.  The thought of even one beer today after work seems so foreign but I drank at least a six pack every evening for years.  I will not drink with you today!
