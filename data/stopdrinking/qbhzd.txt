I dont know what to do also my aunts house i was staying at is no longer an option my family is normally super supportive but some jewelry went missing at her house recently and they obviously think i took it which honest to god i didnt and im not going to admit to something i didnt do even if it would probably be easier.

Sorry to hear this.  So can you provide more details on what happened?..We all have made those mistakes.  I was sober for 14 years and relapsed.  This is the the beginning of a better understanding of yourself.  So 3 weeks is what they are recommending in detox?
Just hang in there you've learned alot from your relapse and that's the most important part!  Use that knowledge to solidify your recovery going forward...re: detox:  I know in my town there was a 2 week wait to get in but I found it was really a screening process; they were getting a lot of people who go into detox to evade police or hold off some time until the next welfare cheque stuff like that.  Call back every day give them your name ask for the current availability and plead your case and sincere determination to get better.  I'm willing to bet it will be like me and I got into detox in about 3-4 days.  ..
not judging...just asking so i understand where you are: what was the thought process between "there are some pills on the counter" and swallowing them?
