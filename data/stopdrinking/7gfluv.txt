I'm in this sub for a while. I just love it. I was nearly two years sober in AA then out of the blue I relapsed. I thought I'd never have to visit alcoholism again. The first relapse lasted 2 days then I was sober for 22 and fell again for 4 days (back to the  normal' morning drink). I managed to get a new sponsor after that and I was 97 days....and got drunk. So technically this is my fourth attempt. 10 days not drinking is just a miracle for me. Thanks for everyone who's been trying to fight the good fight:-)
