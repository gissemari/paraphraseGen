196 days today...not in my wildest  dreams would I think I wouldn't give my right arm for a drink...I dont miss it...I walked out of the store with a six pack of tea...and ran into someone that knows me.  "That doesn't look like beer"...."i gave up drinking".......If you are struggling right now...keep fighting...it gets better and easier...

It really does.  It's amazing not to want to drink.  It makes me feel at peace. I'm so happy for you! IWNDWYT 
It's amazing and I never thought I'd get to this stage. I'm 6 months though laced with a handful of slip ups before I became really serious about this so officially 8 weeks. There have been so many instances in the last 8 weeks where I would've caved and picked up a bottle (or two) of wine (hence the slip ups) but once I really set my mind to it and stuck with it those temptations have become easier to ignore/acknowledge and push to the side...
I just stopped in because I'm really struggling with tonight but I'll make it through! IWNDWYT
It's truly wonderful let's keep at it 
Good job! Over a year here and I don't miss it at all! And I lost 30 lbs   
AWESOME
It does get better! IWNDWYT sober buddy!
IWNYNDYT!
I sure hope so. I look forward to the day I can say what you just did. Right now just taking it one day at a time
I'm hitting week 2 of no caffeine (so no drugs at all) still wondering I'll ever have energy again...Never did I think I could give up caffeine but it was a lot easier once I stopped drinking alcphol. Most things are.
IWNDWYT..
Thanks needed this. 
Great work!  Nice that you don't miss it that helps a lot!  I've been struggling lately hopefully it will pass soon.
Well done! Approaching the first 100 and am looking forward to thinking about it less. Iwndwyt! 
It really does get better..Kinda like this Bitcoin [graph]:.(https://ixquick-proxy.com/do/spg/show_picture.pl?l=english&amp;rais=1&amp;oiu=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic4.uk.businessinsider.com%2Fimage%2F586b99af5d0bc41d008b4d04-1190-625%2Fthis-chart-shows-just-how-much-the-price-of-bitcoin-has-soared-over-the-past-year.jpg&amp;sp=cd129eb4707c194f06a9d619d3bd3982)
It took me about a month to feel good I think but it gradually improved over time after the first week for the first few months. It does take a while for the brain to adjust so feeling flat for a bit is normal but it does pass.  From what I read on r/decaf the timeline seems to be similar to the one posted in the sidebar here on r/stopdrinking. I had to sort other things out first like low iron levels and that's still a problem but I now have much more energy than I did on caffeine. 
" not in my wildest  dreams would I think I wouldn't give my right arm for a drink. "  ...I had to read this part like 4 times. Glad you didn't give up your arm!
