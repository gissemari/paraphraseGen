My counselor suggested vivitrol to me in my session this morning. I have read reviews of it online and am concerned mostly that if i relapse i will risk putting myself in danger - as i feel i will drink myself into a coma due to not feeling the euphoric state and continuing to drink to try to attain it...Has anyone taken it and experienced anything similar?
