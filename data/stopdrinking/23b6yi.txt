I'm 69 days sober today and I just wanted to tell all of you that your stories of struggle and personal triumph are very encouraging and inspirational for me. Things aren't exactly peachy for me right now. I got my 2nd dui in february after a pretty bad crash where I stupidly decided to check my phone while driving home. My license is suspended for a year fortunately I'm not looking at any jail time just a lot of community service. I'm still working and going to school and on top of that attending AA meetings and going through an outpatient rehab program. The urge to drink creeps in every now and then as I'm sure it does with all of you but I'm scared to go back out there and get a 3rd or even god forbid to injure or kill someone or myself. I'm working the steps with a couple different people 1 in AA and 1 in NA as I've had problems with drugs in the past and I've finally come to the realization that I cannot take that first drink no matter how innocent my brain might make "having just one" seems. This is a disease and it takes people out. In the moments when I can't make it to a meeting this subreddit helps me stay grounded. Thank you all!

Hey I just posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23bfj2/hello_im_pumpthebreaks_and_i_may_be_an_alcoholic/).  .  .I got a DUI 5 years ago and I understand completely what you're going through. I did the same thing. Took my phone out tried to make my turn hit the fire hydrant and then got arrested (blew a .194). Lost my license for 6 months community service etc.  .  .If you wanna chat just hit reply or pm me!.  .
I'm feeling weak today and this sub and my wife not enabling me helped me so much. I'm washing the work off me in the tub then calling it an early night.
Glad you posted this /u/skygreen2 --congrats on the 69 heh heh...
I know it sucks. I picked up three years in February. I'm not where I want to be but I'm where I need to be and sure as hell am not where I was. Don't drink keep going to meetings work the steps honestly and do the next right thing and everything will work out the way it needs to.
Thank you for doing the same for all of us!
Get it dude. It gets better. Don't stop before the promises start to come true :) 
69 *snicker snicker*..Well done!
