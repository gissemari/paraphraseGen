Time has flown by. Today I am thankful for the relationships I have built in sobriety so far. My relationship with the my partner has improved and I have made so many new sober friends. I have also been able to help those still struggling to get sober which has been the most rewarding part of recovery. Today I have a job working in behavioral health and substance abuse a job I would not have been qualified for 4 months ago. I never want to drink again. It's not worth throwing away what I have today and all the things I will gain as I continue to recover..I will not drink with you today.
