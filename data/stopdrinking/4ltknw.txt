How much time in sobriety before this recent 'relapse'?
All of us who have given up alcohol have felt the same way. It's hard to give up something that makes you feel good. ..It's when it starts to interfere with your quality of life is when you have to ask yourself "do I have a problem?" ..If the honest answer is yes then you have to make a choice for the better. Things will only get worse the longer you continue to drink.
