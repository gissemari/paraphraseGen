I like myself better when I have a glass this is the longest I've been without a drink in the last 4 years. I am more tolerant to the boys in the evening. Hate myself in the morning but while I'm drinking I'm good. Before that I had the pregnancies and breast feeding so there was a purpose and I didn't struggle now this sucks. I thought it was getting easier. All I need right now is a glass of wine to keep the evening going. This sucks..

Hang in there! What other benefits have you noticed since stopping? 
If you haven't read  this naked mind  I highly recommend it. Changing my perspective about wine was critical to making this journey easy. That's what I got from the book. We are both at the same place Day wise but I really feel like the book has made it easy mode. Give it a go. I'm sure it won't make it worse. ..Sometimes the distance between drunk and sober seems like a Grand Canyon but this is exactly when you need to take a leap of faith. It is possible. The reward is worth it 
I had one of these nights last night where the boredom almost got me. I made it though and I am currently at work feeling refreshed. I thought I liked myself better with a glass of booze in my hand but I don't mind a bottle of water nowadays. I can actually talk to my coworkers now and am able to look them in the eyes. I'm fully present. ..We have the same amount of days so hang in there my friend! We are STRONG. IWNDWYT
Hey! I'm also on day 19 and the depression /cravings are hitting hard. I'm with you in this. I decided I'm going to treat myself to delicious pizza for dinner. Can you do something like that for you to look forward to?
