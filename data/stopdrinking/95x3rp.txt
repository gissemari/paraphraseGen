Yesterday I had so many feelings to deal with but figured I could push them aside. But my feelings got to me and I started getting angry and considered drinking. ..My roommate tried talking me out of it but I left and ran to the bar. I sat there with a drink in front of me when she came in and kept discouraging me. I could've drank but after awhile I called my sponsor. Of course he was concerned and told me to  leave immediately  and  get the hell out of that bar!  ..I did leave while my roommate kept telling me my sponsor wanted to talk to me... but I was too mad to talk to him. When I arrived at my apt I went on the couch and cried. ..I feel like such a child and am so embarrassed of what happened last night. I thought I was immune to possibly relapsing but obviously not.

One thing I have learned is that you HAVE to deal with feelings when they are there in front of you.  Pushing them aside and/or isolating is dangerous which I think you saw.
Don't worry you didn't hurt your sponsor's feelings. 
You fought through it!..Talking to a sober support person is a great resource!..Each time I do that I build  muscle memory  and weaken alcohol's hold on me.  Eventually it can die!
Your roommate is a good friend. You don't have anything to be ashamed of; not drinking is pass/fail. You passed.
