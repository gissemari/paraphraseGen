I had a relapse I thought just having one drink would be ok then I started craving more so [here is what I did](http://imgur.com/8xQUBr0). I can't have a drink if the temptation is gone from my home.

Congrats this is my first day sober as well! Good luck to us both. 
Congrats on pouring out the bottle. I poured out a few bottles in my day and even though I didn't plan on drinking them it took some fair amount of effort to force myself to pour them out...Good luck. You can do this.
Yeah no booze in the house no going to bars to have a ginger ale at this point arms length is too close.
Welcome back...1. What were you doing to support your sobriety?..2. What are you going to differently this time?
Only? That's an achievement! It's better than .5 of a day. As long as you get back on the horse that's what's important. Keep up the good work :-) 
Good job. I remember about 30 minutes before I went to rehab in October I chugged a beer then took the rest of my 12 pack outside and just started chucking them against my wall. It was really good to destroy what had destroyed me.

Just start again it takes a lot of people some false starts probably most people. 
I think it's really important that after relapsing you're not giving up removing temptation and trying again.  Great job!
Good. The old test your own will trick I know it too well lol. are you currently in the military?.Edit: If so look into ASAP it has been pretty helpful to me.

[*I can't have a drink if the temptation is gone from my home*].Yes you can.  You need to get the temptation out of your life not your home.
Avoid even driving by the liquor stores. Fuck it if it takes an extra couple miles. You don't need to see that shit right now...Also 1.5 days without a drink. That's some progress right there.
