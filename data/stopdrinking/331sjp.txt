I don't think I ever could have imagined this.  It is amazing what changes I have been able to make in the last 6 months. I have lost about 25 pounds have developed a deeper relationship with my wife and just completed two second round interviews for two different jobs. Hopefully sometime next week I get to pick my new job. ..Prior to each interview though I was nervous as hell I just said the serenity prayer and I was able to go in there calm and confident. ..It's still a struggle but a day at a time and you begin to see the positive changes.  I haven't posted in here that much but have lurked and appreciated the advice and positivity of this sub so want to say thank you!
