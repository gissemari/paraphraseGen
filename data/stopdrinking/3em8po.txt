Hey all..Been a while since I posted last but thought I'd share in a recent development.  ..It seems to me that I have stopped thinking about drinking.  I've stopped fantasizing about what it would be like if I drank and the desire to drink in times of celebration or agony has subsided.  ..I don't attend AA as it just doesn't seem like its for me and I have just been going through my life without worrying about it.  Life is still difficult sometimes and easy others.  I really feel like I'm on an even keel with everyone else except I don't use or need alcohol to enjoy or get through life. ..This is a complete 180 from where I was a little over a year ago where I struggled every day reminding myself of one day at a time and telling myself that it was getting better...I can't stress how valuable this sub was to be starting off and I can't thank everyone enough who helped me through all of that.  Every little encouragement every push.  Thank you /sd...It got better.  I believe it will continue to.  Just wanted to post this and hope you're all doing well on your paths whatever they may be.

How long did it take to get to this point?
I've experienced the same relief
