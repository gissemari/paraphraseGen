You've got this. And you can still be an actor. Hang in there. It ain't over till you quit trying. 
Thank you. Although need to get out of LA. Anyone have success with leaving their current situation?
Positive energy coming your way...!  I will also be leaving my current situation in about 6 months.  It's daunting especially since I have no idea what the future holds after that.  But I will tell you this: I have no doubt that it will be easier to face sober.  My mental state has improved significantly since I quit (I'm on 100 days but my badge rarely works).  Even if you end up leaving don't give up on your sobriety!  It will help you.
