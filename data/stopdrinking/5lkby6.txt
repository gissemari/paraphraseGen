I'm an empath. I am so happy that I get to say "I love you" without being inebriated. .I mean it. .Drinking made me way too tired to feel these feelings. .It's slowly coming back to me now my humour and my smile..I've got the burning in my chest that I had before life things occurred and the drinking things too. .Things. (Sigh.).Have an operation in a few days not surgery per se. .I was diagnosed with cervical cancer in September. .That doesn't even phase me. .I just hope this isn't a sign of relapse that I'm ignoring or if mental health is playing a part of this. Will visit my doctor soon. .I do love all of you. .Your posts and comments have been my friend. .I lurk a lot.

I love you too - I have no clue who you are but you sound like a good person in need of a second chance...Everyone deserves a second chance heck even a 3rd...4th... as long as there is the drive to want better...Wish you the best and an awesome 2017. 
Hello fellow empath! I love you too!..I'm so happy neither one of us is smothering our true selves with alcohol right now.  ..I will be sending you loads of healing vibes.  ..And hey I'm proud of you! =)
I love you too! I won't drink with you today. Instead I'm going to focus on healing. Stay good to yourself! Happy 2017
I'm an empath as well! I found that alcohol made the stress and emotions of others weigh even more heavily on my mind. Now I am able to process my and other people's feeling much easier and without as much anxiety. Wishing you all the best. Sober on!
