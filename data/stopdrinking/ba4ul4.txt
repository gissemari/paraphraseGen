Hey Reddit-my dad has struggled with drinking for over 40 years and two weeks ago he received some shitty medical news.  Long story short for the first time in his life he is trying to stop drinking.  Yesterday he hit a full week of sobriety.  I want to do something or get him something for this achievement any ideas?

I think thisll really depend on your relationship with your dad and what type of guy your dad is. I would think digging into what he enjoyed as a kid or a teenager. A blast from the past reminder of when he was ALOT younger. A life before stress work parenthood and most importantly alcohol. Did he enjoy a sport or a specific recreation? Maybe a day or weekend away doing that. I think and it's just me that time with his kids doing something he loves or loved with the people he loves might be the way to go. Building great memories you know? I think those gifts are better than anything material. Or you can get material mementos at the same time. 
As a father there is nothing that makes me prouder than to hear one of my kids say  I love you  and  I'm proud of you  and  Thank you . For what it's worth
a nice steak dinner?.
My two weeks was hard-  I really just wanted to play cards or do a crossword with my friends.. something very calm and just enjoying togetherness.
