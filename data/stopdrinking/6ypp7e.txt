The past few days have been emotionally rough. Working on trying to find solutions for my stresses is definitely easier said than done. On another note I feel focused on not drinking. Even though I feel like everything else sucks I continue to do good at this. I just got a couple self help books and I'm excited to talk to the doctor today about medication that can help prevent a relapse. ..I will not drink with you today.
