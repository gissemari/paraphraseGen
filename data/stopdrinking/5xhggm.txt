Historically I've used SMART to the exclusion of other programs. I still go to a meeting periodically. Recently someone I know casually and generally like admitted a relapse to his drug of choice. ..He had been sober for close to a decade before a relapse last year and had recently completed a six-month inpatient rehab program. Within two weeks out he'd relapsed again. ..Now don't misunderstand this - I'm not defending it  - but I really *felt* both angry at and let-down by him. Generally I don't feel this way when someone relapses. I usually feel compassion and offer reassurance and support point out we've all relapsed and that we can learn from it etc. But in this case I really truly felt like: *"come on you can do better than this - you are just not even trying."* ..It's been over a week since this happened - my learning about it that is - and the feeling is pretty much the same even after reflecting on it and trying to parse out different angles if I'm identifying with him etc. ..Have others gone through this? A rare instance where you're mad because you feel someone is really not taking seriously something that you're very committed to? And where the relapse felt more *lazy* than anything else?..I am of course not sharing any of this with that group or the individual but I wanted to vent and see if anyone else had the same feeling. TIA.

Hmm I don't know man. Any time someone makes bad life choices because of apparent lazyness there is something behind it. Low self-efficacy depression or whatever. Something else than just being 'lazy'. Especially after almost a decade of sobriety. Lazyness as a concept is an incredibly ineffective way to get at the root causes of someones bad choices.
I understand. Sometimes I feel irritation even just reading here when I log in and it seems to be one relapse post after another. I never voice that because I know it's my issue but that doesn't mean I don't find the feelings kind of stick for a bit. I think the best thing for me is to try to figure out what is triggering me emotionally. So I've figured out that I feel resentful about relapse posts sometimes because I want the whole SD team to be pulling together because that makes me feel safe. It's like I'm worried if some of us can't stay on the horse I won't either. Having seen that's where I'm coming from emotionally I try to reframe realise that my sobriety is in my hands and I'm comparing my insides to other people's outsides. Maybe worth asking what did these relapses seem to take from you or weaken that you depended on implicitly? Maybe faith that after 10 years it wouldn't be a danger? Maybe a rock to lean on? I don't know what it is obviously but for me figuring out what I feel like is being taken or broken however 'wrong' the feeling might be helps me dissipate anger.
