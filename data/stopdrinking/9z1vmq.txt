4 weeks sober yesterday. The road to sobriety thus far has been quite a roller coaster ride. Here are some notes I've made:..1. *The cravings are quite real*. Not a day has passed that I haven't yearned for a drink. Though this has gotten easier every day and serious temptations are growing rare. I feel like the worst has passed even if this isn't as smooth sailing as I would wish..2. *Smoking.* I've been smoking like a motherfucker (who according to 2010 Cambridge study smoke almost double of what the regular fuckers smoke) ever since I quit drinking. It has been my go-to method to resolve stress and while I understand the evident harms of smoking I'm not in a rush of quitting that - atleast it's not drinking..3. *Happy wife happy life.* My wife has been supportive and kind she even mentioned that she felt like she'd gotten "a part of her husband back" now.  It feels quite good to have someone encouraging me on my progress despite my own self loathing..4. *Holy shit.* Pardon my vulgarity but I have been surprised to find my moments of bathroom relief to be regular and solid - I'd say even normal! While drinking daily I had grown accustomed on irregular bowl movement I didn't even notice it anymore. I have to say the morning routines are far more pleasant now that I don't wonder what unholy abomination I had given birth to every time I go to number two..5. *None of my friends abandoned me.* No one has said that I'm a weird or despicable because I've turned off the drinks. On the contrary they have been supportive and understanding and I've had some good in depth conversations regarding drinking experiences and life on the whole. My worst fears of being branded and outcast and hunted with pitchforks didn't come true..6. *There's extra money!* I'm not complaining. I've used the extra cash for healthier food and enjoyed cooking again. Who would've thought that drinking soda water is quite cheap compared to beer - some bartenders don't even charge for it and treat me with extra slices of lemon that make me feel pretty..7. *My other problems have not magically disappeared.* Since I had the unhealthy habit of self medicating anxiety and depression with alcohol the sobriety has not made me suddenly sane. On the contrary I've had to struggle with mental health problems more now that I can't dull my senses. The existential dread and general Weltschmerz weight heavy on my shoulders and I have little to nothing to combat these thoughts. The search for a suitable therapist is ongoing and I hope to get help soon..8. *The nightmares have arrived.* The haunting nightly terrors keep disturb my sleep. I've had those dreams where I've relapsed and feel shame and the dreams where people mock my for my alcoholism. I have been told that my psyche processes my emotions through dreams and having nightmares are a sign of progress. Doesn't make them any nicer though...On the whole I've enjoyed being sober. I don't miss hangovers or embarrassing messages in social media. I fear the upcoming festive season - the temptations to have a sip and explaining myself for not drinking. I've given my home-brew set for a friend as a gift though it felt weird giving up a dear hobby and a bit sinister to pass a source of addiction to someone else. ..I still hope being sober would be easier but at least it's not as horrible as I feared it to be. SD community has been very useful and I thank everyone in here for the support.

Congrats bro great progress! 
Congrats!!! That's awesome! One thing I can tell you is that the cravings eventually calm down. I was worried they wouldn't. It takes time though so I hope you're prepared to be in this for the long run. (: You'll learn a lot &amp; you'll feel accomplished because it really is a big thing to overcome &amp; if you can get through quitting drinking you can get through anything. I wouldn't worry about having to explain yourself about not drinking. &amp; if you do explain &amp; they don't understand or support it they aren't worth your time.
