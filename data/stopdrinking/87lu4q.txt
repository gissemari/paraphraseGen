My opinion nah. It isn't. Unless you're dependent on it in a similar way as alcohol. 
nope heck it helps prevent relapse for some folks 
Not if your goal is not drinking...If your goal is not smoking weed... then yep. =)
I've been using it to calm down the panic attacks I'm having going through this 7 year break up sober.Even if I didn't have the weed I don't want to drink it will ruin everything I worked so hard for .A lot of times the weed doesn't do anything its just there
