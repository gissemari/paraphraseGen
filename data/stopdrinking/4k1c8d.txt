... and I am still fucking here. Like why the fuck can't I die first. Why do all the good ones have to die. I fucking hate death. I do know what I hate more than death...  .  .Any of you fuckers visiting this subreddit have a god damned chance. Fucking take the leap reach out get help... Stay sober. Stopping is easy I did that shit a thousand times. Staying stopped is the hardest part. Especially when life happens. I fucking know it. Yea yea I fucking curse and I don't really fucking care to be policed right now. So you relapsed?! BIG FUCKING DEAL. Get the fuck off your pity pot and join us. I can't stay sober without you and right fucking now I desperately need you. Any time spent sober for someone like us is a great day in my world. Don't like the way some people get sober? Cool story. Find your way. This is just a fucking mountain we are all trying to climb. Some find this pathway easier than others some find that pathway easier than others... DOESNT FUCKING MATTER. Keep climbing. Fall down? Get the fuck back up.  .  .My only wish is that you understand the desperation it takes for you to keep climbing to keep fighting this shit. Don't let your mistakes become your swan song. Own that shit. Own your life. Own your spot on this mother fucking awesome as shit sub. Get active somehow in your sobriety. Cling to the Earth with every ounce of strength you can manage. I am doing a terrible job of speaking from the "I" but this is something vitally important to me. Run into the wind screaming that you won't fucking give up **NO MATTER FUCKING WHAT**. I don't care what it takes for you to get sober and stay sober. The only thing I care about is supporting you to the end so that we the sobernauts of the universe know you went out fighting this god damned terrible fucking problem with a mother fucking smile on your face gasping that last sober breath.  .  ./end rant

What I lack in desperation I make up for in GORP...On a different different tack: Joe Ish died in Maryland this week. He was several decades sober and a kind helpful man. Dying sober is not the goal but today I can rejoice in having spent a part of my sobriety enjoying what he could teach me.
I make that 19 fucks in one post- Surely there's some sort of prize
Thanks for this.  ..Yeah when I think back it's clear the hardest part was untwisting my thinking 
Yes!  You have to be **Desperate**!..I was.  I never want to go back to that!..Sorry for your loss.  Thanks for your post.  Sometimes hard cold reality is the recipe.  ..
I am finding my way.  I won't give up.  Thanks for the post. :)
Audrey?
I don't just run into the wind I spit in it too. No alcohol screw you. I fart in your general direction. 
thank you...this is something to save for me
:( 
&gt; So you relapsed?! BIG FUCKING DEAL. Get the fuck off your pity pot and join us...The way relapsing is handled is probably the most harmful to people in recovery. They drink once in a month and then they feel like failure and write here about being failures. They say "failure is an event not a person" so they can't be failures...There seem to be no "instruction" on how to handle relapses. Maybe it's just "fuck it" and go on with sobriety but few people seem to manage that. There's that fucking badge here that will remind you that you relapsed recently and you're "not as good" as someone with 118 or 33 days.
Keep fighting never stop. Fuck yeah. Owning it. 
You only fail if you quit trying.
Bravo. You have your head screwed on right man..
Everybody's shit stinks...Everybody here has had at least one Day One...We're *all* in the same boat...This Sobernaut ain't dying today. Tomorrow? Who knows...
Great post. Thank you for this. A good kick in the ass is what I needed today. 
&gt;Own that shit. Own your life. Own your spot on this mother fucking awesome as shit sub. Get active somehow in your sobriety. ..I read this even before I did my check-in this morning.  I love this.  Ownership and accountability are the keys; playing victim and martyr are sure draggers-down.  Are you afraid of what it will take?  No shit Sherlock.  It takes a lot.  Each and every day.  Until *maybe* you become one of the lucky ones who does not have to dog your sobriety every last day of your life.  For me Pedro will be yammering in my ear forever.  So one day at a time I get to tell him to fuck off...And for something more New Age:.."Where there's fear there is power.  Passion is the healer.  Desire knocks open the gate. When you're ready it'll push you through."
I don't think I've ever seen you fired up like this but this would certainly get my attention if I was first getting sober or trying again after having a rough time of it. I hope it strikes a chord with someone here tonight and saves even a minute of misery if not a life or two.
I'm with you today ET standing walking or running. And I'm fucking smiling. Maybe in joy maybe a grimace with teeth clenched but I'm gonna keep that smile in place.
Just getting out of detox a couple days ago this is exactly what I needed to read. Tears in my eyes my thoughts and my prayers.
I love this. you have no idea how much I needed to see this. 
This is an interesting post. At one time in my sobriety I got angry when people I knew died from our disease. My views have softened over the years and just understand that some of us get it and some us do not. I wish that more us got and kept the gift of sobriety but unfortunately most do not. I will try to take care of the gift that I was given today
I'm going to fucking stay sober goddammit. No matter fucking what. Thank you!  This is the stuff I respond to. 
My condolences to you.  ..I will keep on climbing I will keep on pushing. What really helps is knowing people like you have got my back it's what keeps my head from slipping up my own arse. You keep it real. Very real...Thank you 3v3ryt1m3 much love take care x 
&lt;3 this post. And you for posting it.
