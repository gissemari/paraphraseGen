Happy Thursday everyone!   ..**theme** : strength   ..**quote** : "Anyone can give up it's the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart that's true strength.    Unknown    ..Every day every one of you goes out there and fights to make today just a little bit better than yesterday. Somedays you succeed and others you fall short. But I wanted to tell you those of you in the deeper troughs of sorrow due to your job or a relapse or a relationship that you are so much stronger than you know. You can't see it right now because you're right up against it in the middle of it and it feels like nothing will ever improve. You're sad but scarier you're *tired*.   ..It really is the easiest thing in the world to settle and give up. Especially if those who know you wouldn't fault you for it. But I read so many posts every day of people struggling not just to make it through but to make it through *sober*.   ..You're all wonderfully inspirational from the dinos to the newbies. This one's for you.   ..Not Today

I don't think I have any strength at all. I can fake it I am even capable of convincing myself that I am and acting the part. But when the chips are down I fold my strength is a delusion I am weak. 
I am praying for strength this weekend. I will be home alone (SO does rally so I'm a race widow on weekends) and I know how easy it would be to zone out with a big bottle of wine. No one would know. But I'm playing the tape forward to having a Monday without a puffy face and stomach ache. I am responsible for my own soberity.
