Today I am stopping drinking and ended my long-term relationship where I was unhappy...I've had mood problems and addictive behaviours for most of my life which were well-managed for about 1 year prior to this relationship. I was so proud of myself yet slowly my habits of drinking or other addictive behaviours came back as a way for me to avoid emotions and anxiety. ..&amp;#x200B;..I saw myself spiralling downward over the years but didn't realize the full impact or maybe I wasn't ready to face it. I have experienced this "relapse" in a past relationship so I recognize now what is happening and how severe it could get. I do like many aspects of my life and don't want it throw it away...&amp;#x200B;..I'm scared I'll never find a relationship where I won't relapse and I'm scared of experiencing my anxieties and emotions. Even as a young teenager I've always used addictive behaviours as a way of relieving anxiety or bad moods. I can imagine if this cycle continues I won't be able to handle stressors or big change as I get older. I'd continue to rely on wine and unhealthy relationships to make me feel comforted instead of taking control. ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm excited to see if sobriety will make my anxiety and emotions less severe. I'm am optimistic of seeing what I can achieve when I don't waste my time drinking and having poor sleeps. I hope I am able to develop self-esteem to like/accept myself and live independently. I guess this will be a year of new experiences; there are many things I haven't done sober before.

I've been sort of thinking about the relationship front also and realizing how on my own I seem to learn so much and more about life in general.  I wonder sometimes if I might be missing out but really I doubt it.  I feel like when it's right I'll just know.  And it will feel like the right thing to do.  Getting sober and living sober have been an epic adventure of extraordinary proportions for me... I hope you come to feel the same I know it can be hard at the start but it's worth sticking to it I swear.  Best wishes I won't be drinking with you.  Beaming over good vibes    
Thank you for sharing this. I'm with you... I want to change and have a better life alcohol has made me so unhappy yet I still want it.  But I'm holding strong and won't drink with you today!
