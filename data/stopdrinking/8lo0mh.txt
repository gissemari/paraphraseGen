I haven't been active here the last month because it's been one relapse after another.  I hope this is the last one or at least for a long time. ..I mentioned before I've been laid off for some time went through a break up with someone I wanted to be with forever found out she's with someone else and just lost it. After a few weeks I kind of accepted it but lately the thoughts have been creeping back...So Monday I downed an endless supply of beer and a 40 of whiskey. I paid for it yesterday by hugging the toilet most of the day and even today I still feel sick. The worst part is the anxiety and existential dread in the pit of my stomach. It's been about 6 weeks now since I've left my place and the blinds are always closed. It's basically summer it's hot and the sun has been out all month. I still can't bring myself to leave...These past several months have been the worst times of my life. I want to talk to someone yet I don't. I've always been an introvert and happy being by myself but these last months are the first time in 8 years that I feel truly lonely...So once again I need to reset my badge and get back on track. There's an AA meeting nearby this Friday night that I'm considering going to maybe something as simple as being around like minded people is what I need. At the very least I know I have to get out of the house starting tomorrow...One step at a time I suppose. IWNDWYT

I'm too new to all this to offer much advice but I wonder is it too late where you are to get out of the house now? Even if you just step outside for a few minutes breathe different air look at the sky clouds sun or night sky if it's night where you are. And then see if you want to take a short walk. ..Hugs!
Welcome back...I have a tendency to isolate if I let myself which doesn't do me any good. I've found the remedy is to get out and help someone. By getting involved in AA you might get the opportunity to do that as others help you too.
