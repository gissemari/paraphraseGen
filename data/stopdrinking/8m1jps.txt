I made it it has been a daily struggle but I MADE IT. Now on to the next week it's getting a little easier. I still struggle with filling the time I would have filled drinking. I find myself roaming around my house staring blankly at things forgetting what I was doing. I can only do laundry so much dishes vacuum and whatnot. I do try to get some exercise outside weeding the beds and vegetables. That takes up about 3 hrs of the 8 hrs I would drink a night. I used to burn a lot of hours playing WW\-2 and Far Cry 5 but always drinking. I haven't played them since I quit because I can't stop thinking it's time for a beer. I would drink a beer every time the map would change when playing WW\-2 and non\-stop playing Far Cry. My saving grace is fishing while the river here is high muddy and isn't fish\-able the lake a few hours north has been fishing really well. I haven't had to stay in this crappy little town over a weekend since I quit drinking. I do have some anxiety about the first weekend I will have to stay in town. Not much to do here but drink. Rambling now I am just really happy being sober! IWNDWYT

Congrats! 2 weeks is a rough run. Now it gets better. ( not easier of course :)
Awesome!  Congrats!  I personally seek out things to do non\-stop to fill my time.  I love fishing too :\-\)
Congrats!! 
Nice job filling the time...changing the thought patterns and behavior patterns is hard...i.e. I play games so I drink while I do...there were a few activities like that for me that took getting used to w/o alcohol
