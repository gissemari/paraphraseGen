I just got out of the hospital yesterday morning....? I think. Was finally able to sleep off and on by the afternoon. I've been through physical withdraws from substances many times in my life but definitely underestimated the struggle of coming off of alcohol. Goddamn. I'm still ridiculously anxious and uncomfortable so I don't know what to say. If anyone has any experience with having to cut people out of your life please comment. I'm having such a hard time trying to fix inappropriate relationships and defend myself make amends etc. I never really learned how to walk away and take care of myself. Thanks guys.

A lot of us came from that place.  It gets better with time.  No drink no trouble.  Get a lot of rest eat and drink water.  Worry about others when the time comes. Fix yourself first then try to fix things with others.  That is how it worked for me.  [There is a lot of help out there](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_resources_and_groups) try to use it.  Take it easy and good luck
Welcome! Right now it's all about you and sobriety. If you need to stake out a place of your own there are organized sober houses that might suit you. A counselor can help you determine your best course of action. Organizing the help we need should be our first step toward responsible self care. You can live an awesome sober life!

Think about taking care of yourself.  If there is someone out there that is a positive relationship for you today it will be apparent.  (oh and tomorrow start all over with the same thoughts as today)
