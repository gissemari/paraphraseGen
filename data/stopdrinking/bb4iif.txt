I've finally gotten to where I don't desire to drink myself stumbling on the weekends. I miss being able to have drinks at restaurants and catching a good buzz but it ultimately turns into a bad situation even if I'm at home alone away from others.  .  .Sleeping peacefully has returned with a bit of help from a small dose of melatonin.   .  .Just found out today the offer I placed on a house was accepted. No more renting! No more landlords! Normally a reason to celebrate with a 1/5 of Jack but now just another step in the right direction.  .  .For those struggling with the early days I was there very recently. Even after a little over a month and a few meetings I've begun to see how fast life turns back around. Don't give up don't fall back in and give sobriety a chance to run its course. IWNDWYT.
