Hey SD it's been a while. Just want to check in and thank this sub. After struggling many times someone here told me that you don't just quit to drinking for the sake of quitting you quit so that you can do ______. A year ago I sat down with a captain at my local fire department knowing that I needed a change in my life. Since then I got hired as a call member got my EMT license and I am finishing up my firefighter 1 course in hopes of becoming a full time firefighter within the next year and a half. The polygraph still scares the shit out of me but at least now I can honestly tell them I am truly committed to abstinence. Honestly I've been so busy with my toddler and night classes alcohol really has no place in my schedule. I've made it through a couple bachelor parties and numerous weddings so I've had really tough days. But my dreams are more important and I've accepted alcohol is not an option. Again thanks SD.
