So I'm getting close to 80 days of sobriety and how it has been a roller coaster. I almost ruined the relationship with the woman of my dreams who had recently given birth to our beautiful son. I am 28 years old and have drinking heavily since I was 12 years old. To me alcohol is one of my longest lasting friendships. Including the hardships. With as much great things that I have going for me since putting a hold on drinking I've been struggling with a depression settling in the absence of my good friend alcohol. Tonight my girl went out to celebrate her mother's bachelorette party (she re-marries in a week). I was taking care of the baby and went to a restaurant that was playing the Dodgers and Brewers Game 7. Now I've been a Dodgers fan longer than I've been a drinker so their recent success is bittersweet. I get to enjoy my favorite team move on to the World Series but Im doing it sober. I craved nothing more than a cold every inning of the game but instead of caving in I watched the whole game while taking care of my 4 month old son. There were moments he was watching it with me. There were moments I missed to make him a bottle. Then there was the sweet joy of victory as the they ended the game 5-1. The whole time a family was sitting next to me and on their way out the father and mother complimented me on being such a great father. That moment made the loneliness go away and I can confidently say again  IWNDWYT .

I want brewers but this is a wonderful post. It is hard to watch sports with friend without drinking. I will not drink with you tonight.
This happened me when my beloved Limerick won the All Ireland hurling final this year. Didn't drink for it and I survived.  
This is going to be a fantastic World Series.
