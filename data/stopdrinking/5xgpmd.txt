Thanks for sharing man.  It's a reminder for me that I need to work on my program.  I have been procrastinating in my step work making less meetings and acting out sexually with people who are not my wife...And I **know** that all of those things will lead me to relapse so it terrifies me that I keep doing them.  ..I actually feel the same desperation about fixing my sexual actions right now as I did about alcohol in early sobriety.  
Ouch. Thanks for your honesty. That was a painful free fall in slow motion. ..You're doing what you need. Acknowledging learning from your relapse and making changes. I can only add that for myself I found the use of a therapist trained in CBT invaluable...Good luck to you and keep moving forward.
You have a disease that is trying its best to have you.  Fight back against it with every ounce of your strength and intelligence and courage because this enemy will kill you if you let it.  But you can stop it.  Don't drink today.  Just today.  Show that beast that you are the one who controls your hands and controls your brain and you are the one calling the shots.  You sound like you are working hard with the group and working on yourself you can fight this soggy monster on your back and you can win one day at a time.  Not drinking with you today friend!
