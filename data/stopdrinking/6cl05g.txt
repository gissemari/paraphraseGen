Everybody climbs through shit. Find the strength to get through each minute. You are worth more than you think. Maybe find some friends at a local church to support you... even if you aren't religious. Stay strong! 
Sorry that u r being harrased and bullyed. Thats not cool or nice to be happening no matter where u r. I hope u keep on with being sober i no things can be hard but u got to try ur best to push thru. I dont no u but i really hope that u dont kill urself. Good Luck
