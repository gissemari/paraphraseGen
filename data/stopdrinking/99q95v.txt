I made it through the horrific day after and all the anxiety that entails.  Well I'm still anxious and must keep muttering to myself like a mad person-this too shall pass.  Day 2 and I've got a plan after work and a backup plan for that one.  This aint my first relapse-rodeo however I wanna make this the last one.  I'm utterly defeated and completely--TOTALLY fed up with my own bullshit.  I knew full and well the emotional toll of drinking and it aint stupid drunk pics or how'd I get home last night texts.  All that cute shit was many moons ago for me now its a dark and fucked place that I'd rather stay the fuck away from it undoes me from the inside out.  All that inner peace and self-confidence I spent months and months building is now vanished and I'm a shell of who I was Tuesday morning.  I'm just writing this so I have a timeline and something to refer back to when the memory of this horror fades and I think its okay to start fantasizing about a lovely glass of wine or a cold beer.  As it stands right now even the thought makes me retch.

Whew I hear you loud and clear.  It was one too many (or just the right number of) visits to the dark and fucked place that brought me here.  If I kept walking that path it wasn't just going to be damaging relationships but seriously hurting myself or even worse someone else.  So I chose to turn around and make the long hard walk back up the dark path until I could get my bearings again and make a conscious choice about what direction I wanted my life to go in...not allow the bottle to make my decisions for me.  More power to you!
I hear ya... let's make this one last!
