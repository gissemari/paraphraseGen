Today is a week sober. I feel great with little cravings (lucky streak I guess). Two weeks is the longest I've ever gone. I celebrated my week by buying some great vinyls and some self care. Here's to making this time the last time.

Good choice of celebration gift! You know it's funny. Six months ago alcohol was my biggest problem and it was seriously ruining my life. Today I have a dozen other problems but alcohol isn't one at all. I barely think about it.
Good job on the week! I'm finding life in general easier (by no means perfect) by taking alcohol out of the equation. Someone on here said it automatically makes your life 55% better- just by itself.. Can't remember how that number was reached but it sounds right. Everything else good that comes along is gravy.
