I made it over 48 hours and then I got home after a long day of work and trying to do sober activities (worked out had coffee and read met Lois Lowry at a reading) and as soon as I got home realizing my roommate wasn't coming back I just broke down and I've been chugging wine ever since. My sober time didn't even feel worth it. I'm really struggling.  Anyone else?

You have to ask yourself after you wake up from this guilt trip and a hangover. Will you be better off? Now you got two problems. One is your roommate is gone two you feel like utter crap. You might think it is your fault that you deserve to feel like this. But instead you borrowed energy from today to cope with this loss in a positive constructive manner. Find a new roommate or deal with the loss by actually processing or reflecting on it. I wish the best for you but the logical fallacy here is that you blame bad things happening on "being sober". Just as much if not many more bad things can happen when you're intoxicated. Sending positive vibes your way and I hope you try again! 
If you haven't already download This Naked Mind. ..It was a slow starter for me but honestly it's changing the way I see my wine. ..It has been my "go to" when sad or stressed but now I'm realised that it's the poison that I'm putting in my body that's making me sad and depressed and unable to deal with the other things in my life. ..I won't drink with you today.

It's really REALLY easy to fall back into it.  The first days are the worst and once you realize that going longer gets easier and you won't want to have to repeat your first days over again.  That's how it's been for me at least.
