After making it nearly 2 weeks I relapsed. And I relapsed hard. My partner walked in on me boozing and threw my drunk ass out. It's taken 3 days of pleading begging crying looking at myself over and over and over and over. I feel like a sack of shit I feel worse for my partner...  I have to stop. I must stop. This is going to ruin me. Back at day one.

Welcome back. Life is a marathon not a sprint. You made a mistake and now you can learn from it
It's a shame about your relapse and I'm sorry to hear your partner threw you out but the fact that you went more than a month without drinking is a great accomplishment you shouldn't dismiss just because of one setback...If you can go that long without drinking you have what it takes to get back on the wagon and go even longer this time without drinking...Wishing you the best.
