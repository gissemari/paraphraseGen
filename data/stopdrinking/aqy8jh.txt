To anyone struggling in their early days of stopping drinking hang in there. I'm about to hit a month sober and it feels great. ..You will become so much more conscious of your self worth find more meaning in social interactions and just enjoy life so much more!..I still have lows of course but so does everyone regardless of whether they drink or not. ..Hang in there and look forward to the start of a better life! It's around the corner.

Same! I'll be a month tomorrow and I honestly didn't think it would feel this amazing in those early days. 
IWNDWYT!
