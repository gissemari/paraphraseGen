I had a dream last night about my ex that I was deeply in love with. Not helping my emotional state this week...I'm hoping today gets better though and the hangxiety will start to wain usually by day 4-5 I feel ok. I also had my first real full meal yesterday been snacking otherwise since the anxiety has been so bad. (In positive news I've probably lost a pound of two haha)..I emailed my old therapist and will be scheduling an appointment next week to talk about my anxiety and depression. I haven't committed to the appt yet don't know how to find a way to squeeze it in between work but I'm trying to commit to it...My gym schedule is completely ruined and I just don't have the motivation to go. This is probably the second biggest struggle because I was just getting down a 3-4 day gym schedule and running a lot...Idk there is my rant don't know why I'm posting again. I guess I hope anyone who's thinking about drinking sees this and doesn't.
