Made it 28 days before relapsing this weekend. The good news is that is double my previous record of 2 weeks. The bad news is I woke up this morning feeling like a lost cause. I'd never think that about any of you but for some reason it's hard to extend the same patience and compassion to myself. I'm proud of 28 days though and so am determined to keep going. IWNDWYT

Are you able to pinpoint exactly what your line of thinking was that allowed you to drink? Can you figure out a way avoid falling into that trap next time it happens? Those 28 are still under your belt. Get back up on that horse soldier!

Those 28 days count for something and coming right back is a very good sign that you are back on the journey. Wishing you peace and success as you navigate this new way of living. I will not drink with you today.
I agree with Papi as usual. Get back on that horse soldier and hang on a little tighter. You have 28 sober days!! Get back up and keep going. You CAN do this! It's hard as hell but you already have 28 days!! Not 0. Even that can be worked with. Come on Eli. IWNDWYT
