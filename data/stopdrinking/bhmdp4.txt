Title says it all. I drank last night and feel like absolute crap this morning.  I think I would blow numbers if I had a breathalyzer and its 9:30 am. I know I blacked out. I have been in a relapse for a couple of months now. I guess the first step would be getting back to AA meetings. It's hard though I live in a rural area where the closest AA meeting is 8 miles away and I dont have a license. I hear about people being willing to give those without a license rides to and from AA. However I have never run across these mythical creatures.

Is there uber in your area? Or how about biking?
Kill 2 birds with one stone bike there get some exercise and go to AA. 8 miles is NOTHING on a bike too
I believe SMARTrecovery has online meetings and there are blogs etc. that may help in the meantime. Best of luck to you!
I have been there 100 times in the past year.  I feel your pain!  Don't quit quitting!!!  Keep posting and reading here and also there's a site called In The Rooms that has virtual meetings around the clock.  Hope that helps.
If you wanted to attend in person I would do what you have to do to show up once.  At the meeting I would mention in your share that you would be very appreciative if someone would be willing to swing by and pick you up for future meetings.  I am sure someone would be more than happy to.
