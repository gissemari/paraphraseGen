Have any of you below the age of 40 found A.A. helpful at all? Especially those that aren't religious. I'm struggling to see the value lately. In her book "This Naked Mind (Control Alcohol)" Annie Grace says that people that simply quit without outside help are more successful and that "instead of sobriety becoming a daily focus...it fades into the background allowing them to be truly free" (131). .I'm personally getting sick of thinking about not drinking lately. I'm tired of my sobriety being a main focus on my daily life and am to the point where I just want to figure out fun things to do to replace the boredom that lead me to want to drink IPAs in the first place....Hello I'm Melissa and I am not comfortable with labeling myself. 
----------immediate responses--------

Hi Melissa. I'm Monique and I am an alcoholic. I label myself because for me when I take just one drink I can't and won't stop until I pass out. ..Do whatever is necessary to live a happy joyous life. Only you know what that is. ..I utilize AA. I take what I want and leave the rest. .
I was 39 when I joined AA and it saved my life. Period...I had all the issues ALL of them most of them turned out to be my own resistance to change or prejudices (to people who have faith)  I was and still am agnostic.  ..Quitting without help A was not possible for me and B would have kept me from getting to know an amazing assortment of people in AA.  ..As for labeling myself nobody cares  Sometimes I say "I'm Todd I am a confused puppy."  People laugh and thats it..Thing about the AA steps - which can have the religious parts removed and still work is they are a set of tools for dealing with the issues that made me drink the way I did and (boredom was just an excuse for me - it turned out to be about self esteem and not feeling comfortable in my own skin)  Yes there are other ways to do this - try one try em all
AA helped both of my parents get sober. And millions of other people. So no not complete bullshit for them. But it didn't fit for me at all (32yo agnostic). I couldn't buy into it. This Naked Mind to change my thought processes this sub and a daily rejection of alcohol are what work for me so far. Adding in talk therapy and better diet have been bonuses...I gave my dad a copy of TNM and he didn't like that it felt anti-AA. The fact that AA offers a spiritual path of self improvement and the service and community components are invaluable to him. So I'm really glad there are different paths to sobriety for different people...The AA model predates a lot of what is now known about the neuroscience of addiction. I see it as the best people could do while they were still flying blind regarding what was actually happening in the bodies and brains of people who drink. 
Whatever gets you through. Hugging a "tickle me-Elmo" might work for some people. If it works roll with it.
I found AA very helpful. I started when I was 25. I don't go to meetings anymore but it was a very important part of my early recovery...There are people like myself who needed their sobriety to come first and then started to use other methods...There are also millions of people in AA who don't fit Annie Grace's somewhat judgmental view of people who go to AA everyday. What an unfair thing to say.
One of the main reasons people relapse is they forget how bad it was when they were drinking. This is why I choose to keep thinking about my sobriety. I need that constant reminder of why I can't drink. It's why I still come here to SD and why I still go to AA meetings.  I am under 40 and I am an atheist. I've also been sober almost 1000 days and I haven't relapsed.  Remembering how bad my addiction was is an integral part of my recovery.
I'm an atheist that for sober in AA in my early 30s. I have just over 4 years sober. There are tons of young people in AA (Google "YPAA") and about the same percentage of atheists agnostics and non-believers in AA as there is in the larger society as a whole. The idea that AA was a bunch of sad old men being jesus freaks was an admittedly ignorant (as I hadn't actually investigated it) misconception that I used to justify not going to AA. I only gave AA a chance when ALL my ideas failed to get sober and able to enjoy sobriety (which is important). ..Here's something that I didn't know or expect - when I started practicing the AA programme (the 12 Steps) in my life with the guidance of a sponsor I stopped wanting to drink. I don't think about drinking and haven't in years. I can go to bars and hang out with people that are drinking and not be tempted at all. I also haven't been bored in years. AA people know how to have fun. I've been on campouts hikes concerts to conventions boating beach bonfires playing glow in the dark Capture the Flag in the park at midnight gokarting etc. All with sober people in their 20s and 30s (and even some teenagers). ..It's amazing how much my smug know-it-all mind thought it knew all about AA and why it was bullshit and not for me despite having never actually been to meetings nor discussing it one-on-one with people that were doing the AA thing. I'm fact I'd never read any AA literature; I sought info and sources that would only reinforce my anti-AA bias and thought foolishly "See! I knew it!"  My drinking and my failure to maintain sobriety by doing things "my way" eventually forced me to get open-minded and to investigate AA. Turns out AA has a ton of people happily staying sober and enjoying life and willing to show me how to do it. 
I wouldn't know because I never tried it. To be completely honest AA never appealed to me because of some of the dogmatic aspects of it. But if some people on here tell me it saved them - who am I to say that's bullshit?..A lot of people get sober in many different ways. What works for you works for you. Until now being honest with friends and family and checking in on this subreddit regularly seems to work...About focusing too much on being sober: I don't know if it matters that much to me. I do spend a lot of my time thinking about not drinking but if that is what is keeping me sober right now I'll gladly pay that price. I'll probably reach a point where it won't be so important anymore but if it takes a few years I don't mind. I really don't. I'm not going to force myself to pretend to be so cool and completely beyond drinking that I don't have to give it any thought. I'm taking the time I need. Daily drinking is such a living hell that thinking about sobriety every day pales in comparison.
Excellent points by everyone: for me also  TMN+this sub+ social accountability with family/friends/doctor + a daily and purposefully and concious rejection of alcohol is my strategy too.  ..I completely agree that having our sobriety as the main focus of each day does get tiring and I'm at the point where I just want to live and focus on other stuff and just be like a non-drinker; this is very very frustrating and tiring.  I havn't figure this part out yet and it does continue to be a daily frustration.  This is why TMN speaks to me so much; I have not finished the book but hopefully by the end and by reading other books like it it will help the process become a bit more natural...I am leaving the AA option open for the future. I have made a note of meeting times and locations in my area should I feel that the first 3 strategies are beginning to give way a bit.  ..In my opinion the enemy is alcohol and the ONLY enemy here.  It didn't serve me well to reject any anti-alcohol strategy this early in my sobriety so all options are on the table.  Any and all anti-alcohol strategies however I may agree or disagree with them are the enemy of my enemy so to some extent they are my ally and my friend.
AA has been working miracles in my life. For years I thought being sober was about willpower which meant any time I stopped drinking I was miserable. It's amazing how different it feels with AA. I would never talk someone into it; it works for me and I'm blessed to have had the courage to walk into the rooms. ..I'm ok with labeling myself an alcoholic and thinking about it daily because I have a progressive lethal disease. It can and will kill me if I start thinking I might not really have this disease which unfortunately many people do. ..

I'm not sure what kind of answer will be useful to you because I don't think you've fully articulated the question you meant to ask. Have I found AA useful in my 2 year trip on the wagon? No. For my money AA meetings were heavy slogs through an emotional swamp that only reinforced my desire to drink. What I needed was alternatives that established habits that didn't include the possibility of drinking...So what kind of answers are going to be most helpful to you?..Are you asking what kind of hobbies other folks have found useful as replacements?..Are you asking whether there's something you're missing in AA?..Or are you just looking for validation that lots of people don't need or want AA to get and stay sober? Cause that's totally cool too.
There are people in AA with double digits of sobriety. I would trust the thousands of people that have been sober for decades and succesfully lived full lives over one person's opinion in a book.
I'm on team "what ever works for you". I try to remind myself that it took me years to dig the hole I found myself in and it's going to take some time to dig myself out I just have to focus on heading in the right direction and using any tool that helps..
I've attended AA a few different times in my life and found it wasn't for me. It certainly isn't for everybody this is for sure and it is absolutely possible to remain sober without it.
oh hi ..I mean SMART recovery speaks to this specifically.....but I am buddhist with 22 years sober I got sober in my teens.  Ive found that AA is a fundamental pillar in my life but I would not describe it as religious.  People in the program are religious at times but its not a religious organization (despite people saying that it is)
Got into AA as a atheist 17 year old. I can say that although recovery is pretty central to my identity it has faded to some degree although I have never felt that I wasn't free.
I went to one AA meeting.  What struck me is that they all identified as an alcoholic first before all else.  One lady has been going to meetings 45 years.  I think it becomes like a social thing for many of them in the "rooms".  I say whatever works great.  To each his own.  Personally I am putting wine in the rear view mirror and looking out the front windshield and moving on.  I won't drink with you today.
You could also check our SMART Recovery and Refuge Recovery; they still offer the regular meetings and support group without many of the aspects of AA that many people don't like. 
I'm 26 and have been attending AA for 13 months and currently attend 3 meetings a week. I've never tried to get sober seriously before so can't say whether I could have done it without AA or not. I do find AA to be helpful. I was agnostic and didn't find the higher power thing to be as confronting as I thought it would be. Working with a sponsor and with other alcoholics is rewarding and I believe working the steps is making me a better happier person. Things like examining resentments and seeing my part then handing them over and letting them go honestly sometimes I look at non-alcoholics and think they could use a program. I was incredibly isolated and socially anxious so I've found AA events to be a game changer for helping me get out and become part of a community. I'm part of my local YPAA committee and have people i consider friends. Maybe one day I won't need AA as much or at all. I'd like to stay involved though I get enough out of it that it doesn't feel like a chore for me and I believe in carrying the message on and would like to help others 
I am definitely not a fan of AA and feel that one of the most dangerous aspects of "traditional" treatment is that in many ways it is nothing more than expensive indoctrination into AA. I had that type of treatment and spent many years of my life trying to fit myself into the 12 step philosophy. I think this is wrong and counterproductive...With that said...and in my opinion.....AA is not bullshit. It helps a significant number of people and for those people if not for all of us it is a good thing. ..Dislike of AA is not a tool for recovery. It understand that it can be frustrating and painful to find a different path in a world where it seems that all roads are supposed to lead to AA. It is significantly more work to find an appropriate path under these circumstances. But knowing what won't work is not the same as finding what will. And trust me when I tell you that the options are much more readily available and accepted now than they were in the 90s. Honestly a place like SD would have been impossible then. Things are improving.

I'm 28 and a member of AA. Tons of young people in AA. AA is not religious. 
Got sober at 19 through AA. Don't go as often anymore. Not religious myself but it served and occasionally continues to serve  a purpose for me. YMMV
The very weird saying "theres more than one way to skin a cat" is applicable to sobriety as well as .... I guess cats? Anyway from my experience I am 28 go to AA. This is my first time really trying to get sober. Over the years I would take a few breaks here and there one month 'cleanse' bullshit thinking it would be a reset and refresh for my body and mind or not drinking until a certain date like my bday or end of school as a reward. Never really had the intention of stopping for good just taking it easy for a bit after a particularly heavy drinking period. ..I went to AA for the first time last May after I got so drunk I fell on my face trying to walk home and had to talk my way out of a hospital/jail visit. I went to 4-5 meetings over a two week period as 'research' to see if I was really an alcoholic or just a problem drinker or whatever blah blah I was telling myself too scared to just admit that I shouldn't drink period. I kept focusing on things I didn't like (heavy religion) or things that weren't applicable to me like DUIs divorce losing everything etc. to rationalize that "Hey I'm not like these people I'm a little non-normal but not an ALCOHOLIC." And then in July 2016 I said enough is enough. Very happy I did. ..So far for me AA has been really helpful. It is a tool just like /SD or SMART of TNM. Like others say I take what works for me and discard what doesn't. I try to pray/mediate but its difficult as I consider myself more of an atheist/agnostic. However I do find meditation to be very beneficial not in a zen-buddha nirvana way but just as a way to calm down relax my body and mind. Never have I done a quick meditation and felt worse afterwards opposite really. I always feel refreshed energized and happy... I'm living abroad and there aren't any of those types of meetings available and this is a very catholic country so religion plays a big role in some of the meetings but I've found a couple groups that are more big book centric and not bible centric if that makes sense. Spirituality and sobriety over religion. ..Overall I have found AA more helpful than anything. The accountability factor is huge meeting people and staying in touch with them. It is like a fun club everyone from different walks of life coming together to stay sober. But thats just me. 
Extensive research on this: AA is helpful for probably 10-15% of those who ever try it. For that 15% AA is liberating and life-giving. It doesn't sound like much but in real numbers that is a lot of people. I've never done AA and clearly it's not for everyone but I know a lot of people for whom it's changed their lives like nothing else. There are a multiplicity or treatments &amp; aides for alcohol addicts: mutual help including AA and this sub medications psychotherapy group therapy residential programs intensive outpatient programs and self-help books etc ('spontaneous sobriety'). SD + Naked Mind is what's worked for me so far but that's me and I'm not yet 4 months into this!..I'm pretty skeptical of anyone who implies that any one of these is totally the right thing for everyone or totally worthless. Some work for some and not others it doesn't need to be controversial. My general impression is that it's pretty much never the AA folks saying AA is the only way to go: you definitely hear the opposite however a lot (that it's totally worthless). ..A final wonkish note. A lot of the alcohol addiction research is muddled by complete sobriety being used as a primary outcome. Complete sobriety is great of course it's the ideal outcome but what if an out of control addict a few months from killing herself joins AA and is sober for 18 months then relapses for a few months then gets on the wagon again. Is that a failure? Was all that time in AA wasted? I don't think so. Some of the more contemporary research on drug therapy for alcoholism also looks at additional outcomes: reduced drinking health improvements. If you could design a trial with unlimited resources one could look st social function work mood disorders etc as relevant outcomes of any kind of addiction treatment in addition to complete sobriety and that may help us judge these treatments better. I want to be clear: I think sustained sobriety is the ideal/best outcome it's just not the only one society should care about. 
I tried to go in my mid 20s and AA just made me more depressed and I wanted to drink more. It was filled with a bunch of old guys and I couldn't really relate. ..It didn't help that the facility was right next door to a liquor store either. 
I call myself an alcoholic but i dont go to aa
I tried a variety of things before finding AA. AA challenged a lot of my beliefs and put me in the midst of people I assumed I wouldn't like and had nothing in common with. When I was in college I did a pilot and longer study of the effects of the 4th &amp; 5th steps (moral inventory and admitting wrongs) on self-esteem. What I learned was that hanging around the program improves self-esteem (the study did not include people who hated AA and left) and that working the 4th &amp; 5th steps tripled self-esteem-- from the 8th percentile rank to 24th percentile rank. Said another way 92 out of hundred people felt better about themselves than the person in AA who had not yet worked steps 4 &amp; 5. .What that told me is other than the joy of having friends there is real value to be had from working the steps. There are many things that I dislike about AA but for me the merits far outweigh the annoying things. It will be there if you decide you want or need it. It is not the only way but it has something solid to offer to those who choose to do the work.    
I've never been to an AA meeting. I've looked around for some in my area but there are barely any and there are more NA meetings since pills and street drugs are more out of control in my town. Personally for me always focusing on the fact that I used to drink everyday seems like when you have a new person at work and they keep talking about their old job every day. What was different about it what is the same etc. Your not there anymore focus on the new. I think a group any group like this community is important to sobering up though. Some people have intense cravings and have it worse in recovery than others so talking it out is very helpful. I just want sober friends not to talk about how I used to drink and how I'm sober now. 
I'm significantly younger than 30 and I use AA. Nothing I did on my own for years and years was helping. For me its just one tool of many that I have to stay sober. I live in a major US city and there are dozens of meetings within a few miles of my house so its comforting to know that at almost any time of the day I can walk into a meeting and make some real life human to human connection with other people in recovery.
Do whatever works go to AA if it serves you no purpose don't go back but take into account that AA is a 2 way street as much as you need help getting and staying sober you should also try to help other members get and stay sober strength through shared knowledge and support for me that's the best part of it. I don't go all the time once or twice a month and that's enough for me. I have tried every tool available SMART meetings therapists books Reddit AA Antabuse. Some parts of all of these helped in some way. Just figure out what works for you. I don't spend each day thinking about not drinking but am aware that I do need reminding from time to time that I am an alcoholic. Stay strong.
Maybe it's not right for you or me but that doesn't make it complete bullshit. It's not and either or situation. Some people need that structure and you don't have to be over 40 to need it. I resent the ageism in your comment.
I'm at 5 months and SD is my only support group. I'm also pretty open about my sobriety so my friends colleagues family etc know I'm sober so it helps keep me accountable. Personally that's what works for me. It's how I quit hard drugs as well. For every addiction I've quit I've had a lot of self reflection that led me to put all of the success and failure on myself so that I couldn't blame a group or any one person if I didn't succeed at it. AA never really attracted me and I gave up religion a long time ago. Whatever works for you though your sobriety is yours and yours alone. 
Hello Melissa. ..I got sober at age 40 and AA was part of my support system. I let the god-stuff slide off--I'm an atheist. The fellowship was golden. I learned so much from others. I don't know what you mean by "labeling" yourself. To me alcoholism is a chronic disease that kills and I have it. Just like any other chronic condition it can be successfully treated by not drinking alcohol. Going to AA meetings put me in touch with others who wanted to be sober and I learned how to have sober fun. I made sobriety a priority because without it I was going to lose my children and career. In recovery I am "truly free". 
I don't have much use for it. I use Refuge Recovery which focuses much more on applying buddhist principles to daily life rather than alcohol or drugs -- though abstinence is required.
Statistically AA does not have a very high success rate but it does seem to work well for the people it works for. I disagree with the folks who are saying AA is not a religious organization. I find it very much is. I was told by my sponsor to get down on my knees and pray twice a day. There are multiple references to God in the AA literature and in the meetings. However there are Athiest/freethinker meetings and people around you may have to make more of a concerted effort to find them and adapt the program for you...I run into LOTS of young people at meetings in fact at the evening meetings I am often the oldest person there and I'm in my 40's...I have found it to mildly helpful to me personally but I definitely feel like it is cult like and many AA members just end up turning the program into their whole lives. If that's what works for them and they're happy doing it I don't have a problem with it but I'm definitely not there in terms of my commitment level to the program. 
AA is completely useless to me. I went to one meeting and was so fucking uncomfortable I never went back. Got sober on my own accord AA wouldn't have helped me at all.
Hey I'm a 31 year old agnostic atheist that goes to AA. I haven't been to a traditional AA yet because I found a couple secular AAs (Freethinkers AA and We Agnostics in Kansas City). I don't know if you have any secular AAs in your area but hopefully a quick google search can let you know...I've found that they really help me. Part of the reason I like going is because it's a social setting where I can relate to mostly everyone and I assume everyone can mostly relate to me too. Most of the people I interact with every day are at least casual drinkers if not complete alcoholics. I can't talk about my alcoholism to any of them because it just makes them feel uncomfortable. So when I go I enjoy listening to other people's experiences because it makes me feel less alone. And it's nice when people are legitimately happy that I'm remaining sober. I imagine I won't go as often once I'm a little further into my sobriety but yea... right now I like it. And I'll pass.
Thanks guys. A lot of this is completely helpful. Sorry about those that got a little butt hurt. I wasn't dogging Alcoholics Anonymous in any way. I simply wondered how well it's working for others. .I will not drink with you today. 
I put a lot thought into the 'labeling myself' aspect of aa and ultimately decided that there is so much more to meetings and the spirit of the community to be worried about saying 'I am an alcoholic' so I just go with the flow.  
I think AA is about taking what works for you from it and going with it.  I am totally atheist and was actually quite anti-organisation when i started going - i only attended meetings to please family.  However over the period of a few months i began to hear more feel more and get more out of it.  I was lucky enough to get some support (outside meetings) from a member of the group i go to at a very low time and we spoke at great length which was incredibly helpful and started taking it more seriously reading the materials and attending more meetings and different kinds of meetings and lo and behold the more i put into it the more i got out...I think an open minded approach is essential as well as being flexible in what you take from it be prepared to hear people say things you may not agree with but be able to think "if it works for them that's ok".   AA is about alcoholics helping each other and gaining strength from that and part of that is allowing different people to work it differently.
I'm only 22 but I went to AA a few times . Wasn't very helpful. I'm very religious and even found it cheesy. A lot of the people were also very judgmental it seemed like. For example they told me they had resentment towards me because I discovered my problem early  etc. They were really lost. Idk his forum is better for me
You'll get to the point where you won't have to think much about sobriety: unfortunately that point is likely not 17 days. For me it was about 6-7 months before I realized I hadn't really thought about alcohol in a few weeks. ..AA isn't complete bullshit but it's not for everyone. It's definitely a program that tries to break one's ego though which is part of why it can be so frustrating for newcomers. Alcoholics are used to thinking they know everything and that they don't have a problem. That's part of why they keep drinking. ..If you're in a big enough city there will usually be agnostic/atheist AA groups. And like others have said take what works for you and leave the rest. I've given up working the steps and I just go for fellowship/sharing now. ...
Therapy tends to work wonders for a large majority of people. The many times I've been through it (for various reasons) I have never come away feeling better. I spend enough time psycho analyzing myself and trying to form good habits. I felt similarly of the times I;ve gone to AA meetings. I'm so glad AA works for so many people it's truly wonderful but it doesn't work for me personally.
Coming to terms with my alcoholism was difficult at first and required some big changes in my life. Now the struggle is mostly behind me - maintaining my sobriety has mostly become habit. ..That said I still need to actually do some stuff to STAY sober. I come here I talk to newcomers on the chat and I go to meetings. **It's not a burden** - I have come to like doing those things. I have a history of relapse and they all started with me not doing those things so I just do them now...Working to maintain my sobriety has **allowed** me to do fun things and live a better life. If that means I need to go to a few meetings a week and chat with my AA buddies so be it.
I go to AA meetings very now and then when I am feeling tired irritable and discontent.  It helps me.  I use that in conjunction with reading the AA big book using this sub and going to yoga and therapy.  That has worked for me so far.  There is a lot of higher power talk at the meetings I go to but also a lot of people pushing back against that too.  I take what helps me and leave the rest and although I've been to some that were just fill of old drunk men I've always been able to find some nugget of wisdom that helps me move forward.  The last one I went to talked a lot about finding your higher power and that wasn't as helpful but the conversation around finding contentment in what you already have was helpful.  I don't think you need to go full bore into the AA lifestyle to find that it can be helpful.
There are many different paths to brokenness and there certainly is more than one to recovery. Never let anyone tell your way is wrong if it is working.
I think the label alcoholic is simply a reminder that I shouldn't drink. It is a religious program for me because my higher power is God. I respect people in aa who go through the steps because that honest self-criticism makes for humbling self improvement. That is definitely not bullshit.
I went to one newcomer's meeting when I first quit. I was 25 at the time. It was very eye opening a good mix of young and old people. After hearing the others stories(the people my age didn't share at all) I felt kind of bad since I quit so I wouldn't have a heart attack and to get my life back together but the people I met there really put it in perspective. These people had lost loved ones been to prison. I felt like I was being a drama queen quitting because I had high blood pressure. However everyone was really supportive. I moved away right after I got sober. Haven't been to a meeting since(I'm naturally anti-social). I had a rough time during my first year sober due to life events. I ended up going to therapist and that was immensely helpful. I'm 2 and a half years sober now and rarely think about it. I still have drinking dreams a couple times a month though.
I'm 23 and going to AA after exhausting all other methods of treatment. I can't say that it has worked yet in the long term: I only just got a sponsor and am still in early recovery. But I think a lot of people in AA have a similar experience with me: Everything else they tried didn't work. I know that if I don't get something right with my alcoholism and addiction to opiates soon I will be fucked. ..The thing I like about AA is I've already made a ton of friends. I think the reason people don't give AA a chance is because it truly challenges all preconceived notions about yourself and your beliefs. I'd say that going to one meeting isn't giving it a chance. Giving it a chance would entail getting a sponsor and working the steps. If you can get this on your own that's awesome. I envy you. But after all of the negative repercussions from alcohol and drugs I've experienced? I still keep going back to the bottle or the needle. Something has got to give...I wouldn't say AA is totally bullshit. Some people can quit alcohol without a problem. I haven't met many of those people likely because they don't identify as alcoholics. But I have met people younger than me with multiples of years and people older than me with decades. I want what they have. AA might not be for you but it seems like it is worthwhile for me.
I haven't done AA but it kind of rubs up against a lot of my core values.  I'm under 40 fyi.  Is it complete bullshit?  No way!!!  AA is helped so many people throughout the years.  Is AA the only way?  Here is where there are issues.  A lot of AA people I think... (I haven't done a survey) would say yes.  But in the Big Book it says that AA is not the only way.
Two very close people to me found sobriety through AA. Worked well for them they have multiple years of success. ..I my self didn't like it at all. Honestly made me want to drink. I went to a bunch of different types and they all feel cultish. ..I'm only 26 and the oldest by less than a year of us three. One on one console helped me. The desire has to be there but having a place to vent and lighten your personal load is always good...This place is a start and what's next is up to you. Try everything you can till you find what works. It's out there we just have to find it. 
I'm under 40 and AA has helped me in spades.  When I was first getting off the sauce sobriety had to be my main focus because I was still obsessed with alcohol.  I was on parole and literally would google search to see if I could drink on Friday and pee clean by Monday.  Regardless after a while it wasn't my main focus.  I still do the things I need to do to stay sober but it's not the main thing on my mind everyday.  I do however remind myself everyday that I am alcoholic.  ..So no AA is not complete bullshit.  It's not for everyone but it helps people everyday.  Good luck to you.
This is going to be completely buried and I dont know if you'll see it BUT. I am 25 years old. From ages 21-24 AA worked for me. But then it stopped . The reason it stopped working had a lot to do with an idea held by many of the group's members (including my sponsor) which was that in order to be successful with my sobriety it had to be FIRST AND FOREMOST in my mind AT ALL TIMES. Dating someone outside of my group was frowned upon. Going to school while working was seen as "doing too much" and "counter productive". I felt that as soon as I started developing outside of Aa I was no longer taken seriously inside of AA. ..Now you may think well weren't they right? Look at you with 4 days shouldn't you maybe look at that part? Truth is I quit AA welllll before drinking. I was sick of it and my sponsor had finally just said maybe youre not an alcoholic. ..I have trouble with alcohol. I am addicted to alcohol. But that does not define me fully. I have spent my life developing a whole me and fuck you I am not going to spend the next 25 years focusing solely on this thing I am addicted to. I'm not going to get on my knees and thank whomever for being addicted and recovering. I am thankful I am in recovery but not for the need to. No it is merely part of my story. ..Not all AA groups are like mine though. I did go and try other meetings and found they have a tendency to focus on solution. When I do get lonely I will end up at one of these meetings. But I will not be as involved as in past times. ..For now what's working is reading meditation and self care. ..Disclaimer: I truly believe that what works works and should be left alone. Everyone has their own path. 
I'm 41 an atheist and gay so the idea of going to a meeting with a lot of religious types doesn't appeal to me (and worries me a little if I'm being honest). I'm also an introvert and have little to no desire to share my story in a room with anyone. I truly believe that would do more harm than good because it would make me so nervous that I'd look for avenues to self-medicate the jangled nerves away. I'm also very picky about who I'm friends with so making friends with a bunch of random people doesn't appeal to me...Personally I don't even remember I'm no longer drinking on many days. Life is so much better now I'm rarely tempted. When I am feeling tempted and that "just one is okay" voice pops in my head it takes about 10 seconds to remind myself in a hundred different ways why I don't want to drink anymore. Obviously I still come here on occasion just to remember I'm not alone in all this but to leave my house and drain myself physically and mentally in an AA meeting on a regular basis seems like it would be a pointless endeavor. 
AA's like a grocery store for me...I won't buy everything in it but I go to meetings to get the essentials that'll help me stay sober. ..And if you're not particularly religious check out the book Beyond Belief. It's the AA alternative text for Atheists Agnostics and Freethinkers and it might be your cup of tea. 
28 and did not find it useful. That said my drinking is related to a bipolar disorder and I don't identify as an alcoholic. In my case AA made things a hell of a lot worse. I got a lot of the old timers "you're an alcoholic you don't have a diagnosis" among other terrible advice regarding mental health. There seems to be an attitude among young people as well that medical help isn't a valid way to quit drinking and that moderation is impossible for everyone. So you take this environment then compound a hypo manic episode on top of that and it was legitimately terrifying for me. Imagine feeling high all the time and behaving in ways that are really out of character and potentially dangerous but having it dismissed as "the pink cloud." The depression crash after the episode caused me to relapse harder than I ever had and of course no one at AA believed that depression caused me to drink. No it was the other way around for them. Add on top of this the fact that I have a job that is pretty life consuming for three months of the year. As soon as I stopped being able to go to meetings I was totally cut off by the people I'd considered friends. This wasn't some flippant thing either I'd been going to my home group for a year and always went out for fellowship after. I will NEVER step foot in another AA meeting as long as I live...That said it is helpful for some people and if it works for you then stick with it. Just don't be willfully ignorant about medical options and mental health. As a positive outcome through therapy I gained a greater understanding of how addiction works in relation to my disorder and have successfully been able to moderate as long as I'm not showing any depression red flags. I stay on this sub to remind myself that depression + alcohol = potential death for me.
For me personally I went to AA for one week solid. The day I missed that was the day I drank. It was my crutch. I stopped going drank about four more months got tired of my shit. Quit on my own. I just passed the one year mark and more days than not it does not cross my mind now days. It would truly be terrible to think of it that much in my opinion. For me personally.
I got sober in AA when I was 24. I am now 58 and still sober...So far so good...I will keep you posted if it changes...Yes I still go to meetings.
I would recommend checking out a book on Rational Recovery. It lays things out in ways that make sense to me and has been helpful. I've been to a handful of AA meetings and have many reservations. It's not completely off the table for me but I'm hoping I will never be at a point where I feel like I need to go. In that way it's a deterrent for me to not drink!  
For me?..No...I was in my early 30's when I crawled into AA.  Saved my life...It's the open-minded thing that seems to kill people.
When I quit drinking I signed up for outpatient rehab.  The program required two "sober support" meetings a week and there was an outspoken preference for AA.  Prior to my first meeting I knew nothing about AA.  I attended twice a week for about 6 or 7 months I got a sponsor and I read their book 3.5 times.  I am now 13 moths w/o a drink and I do not attend AA.  I came to the conclusion that AA is a Protestant religion based on a "higher power" that has very little to do with quitting alcohol.  There are certainly people who have been helped by AA but I got nothing out of the program and I believe their philosophy is possibly damaging/dangerous.  If I had to go back and do this again I'd go to a doctor (M.D.) who treats addiction and possibly a non-12 step therapist.  
Some people find it helpful others don't. I'm just about hitting 40 but I have been in in out of aa for the past decade. What it did for me was let me be around others who understood me. When a friend passed away from addiction I went to a meeting. I shared. Almost everyone in the room have gone through something similar. That was where I knew I could find understanding...If you're interested in it what worked for me was trying different meetings because they're also different. I also really enjoyed trying out NA meetings.
 Everyone will have a different story.  I never set foot in an AA meeting.  Not for really any other reason than I was scared to death of it.  I knew some of the tenets of AA and they have some value.  1 day at a time.  Apologizing to people in your life.  Having a support network.  But I sort of applied those in my own way rather than having a group of people helping me to apply them...I am a fan of educating ones self as much as possible and finding alternative activities.  I was able to refocus to other things...I think you would do well to keep reading books alternatives to AA  other activities.  Do you have anyone in your life who would understand what you are talking about?  I have one in my life and he is invaluable.   
Hello Melissa.AA has worked for me.  It has actually changed my life.  There is only one step in the 12 steps of AA that involves not drinking.  Step 1.  The rest of the steps are about living.  What ever lead someone to drink involves a thinking problem.  AA helps people once they stop drinking to understand their thinking problem.  It helps them to understand that the world doesn't revolve around them.  They understand that they are a part of the world and they must flow with it.  AA teaches people how to live to accept who they are and to strive to be the person they want to be every moment of every day...Alcohol kills people.  It kills people all the time.  Not only that it ruins the lives of people that love us.  It allows us to destroy them along with ourselves.  Identifying oneself as an alcoholic is not about thinking about alcohol.  It is recognizing that you are humble.  That the world doesn't revolve around oneself.  It is a way of acknowledging that life is better more truthful real life without alcohol. Even if your contention was right and that someones sobriety was the main focus of their daily life if they are trying to save their life what is so bad about that...I know you are trying to learn.  I understand.  I was completely lost before I had my epiphany.  I had a lot to learn and I still do.
I'm find SMART meetings much better - no religion and no guilt.
If you can stop by your self go for it and more power to you!  I couldn't and AA gave me the help I needed.
AA did not work for me so I committed to a Out Patient (OP) program in a hospital for 5 months.  Which has worked.  I also go to Life Ring meetings.  They have a more positive view.  http://lifering.org/.    
I came to my first meeting when i was 25. The steps and the love of the people in the meetings and there untiring compassion and support gave me a whole new life free from drugs and alcohol. Most of my "using" friends died shortly after i got sober i should have died with them. It's sad to think that people think AA is bullshit. AA not only helped me stop drinking it helped me change my whole selfish personality into one thats still not perfect but for the most part a loving decent human being. I love AA it is full of people whose lives are nothing less than miracles. God bless you i hope you give us a chance! 
It is not for me. I am an atheist. I hate meetings. I don't want to be labeled. ..I won't be drinking with you today. Nobody poured all that beer into me for years. I found my own way to quit and slowly move forward. I hope you find what works for you.
i actually get triggered to drink when i come here sometimes. i use other subreddits that try to help with addictions and my favorite method is just dont think about it. i basically try and act like alcohol isnt a thing most of the time and thats what helps me last for longer without it. when a show comes on and the characters are at a party drinking its those type of things that give me urges.
My favorite line in the 12 &amp; 12 is "John Barleycorn himself had become our best advocate."..I know many many people who are sober with continuous sobriety through AA. On the contrary I know just a handful of people who don't use AA that have multiple years. ..I can say it's tried and true. It does work. The cliches seem silly sometimes until remembering that something becomes a cliche due to repetitively coming true. ..I was sober 4 years from 25-29 eighteen months 2015-2016 and just under five months until a few weeks ago. ..I found my home in AA and the only times AA has failed me is when I failed to apply AA. ..John Barleycorn himself has sent me back with worse whoppings and less time able to drink and use in between. ..There is a lot out there though I'm still with the camp go with what works and also not afraid to really endearingly stand by my words that AA has completely changed my life for the better.
