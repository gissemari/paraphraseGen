So you think you can moderate. You know you think to yourself I am at the spot where if I continue I will become out of control. I know if I keep this up I may regret it. If I listen to myself and stop now the fun may stop; I may become jealous of those who continue to drink and seem ok. But what choice do you make? (Just because other people behave in a way that sober you or inebriated you may feel is not shameful does not mean that person does not feel shame when they sober up.)..If the decision you make is to keep drinking today rest assured it is because the drink told you 'Don't worry it will be fine. You won't act like a raging idiot. It will be fun and people will like you!' Sober you knows better. Sober you regrets the choice to have drink #1 in the first place...If sober you told you that danger is imminent would you ignore it no matter how loud it screams? Or would you listen and GTFO?..This is a tool in my 'play the tape forward' that helps me stay grounded sane and sober...I hope this post helps someone struggling with the choice tonight.

Well said. Thank you!
I remind myself to laugh when a commercial says 'enjoy in moderation.' With my brain it's one or the other; it's never gonna be both.
My drinking was deliberate in the sense that I knew the "level" I had to get to in order to sleep. It was 4 in '93 and went to like 9 by '14. I didn't drink to blackout but to a level where I knew I was "there". So my habit was a bit different than many here in that I don't think I had a physical addiction but a mental one. I didn't drink during the day but at 5pm it was time to start the spiral.
