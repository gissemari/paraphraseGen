Went to a hockey game last night and didn't have a drink. Im always good for several before several during and some stiff drinks after. ..I took a good buddy that doesn't drink and we had a great time. It wasn't a struggle. After a week of struggles last night gave me a lot of hope. ..I'm headed to spend the day with a bunch of friends that drink a lot. I have been with them a couple times over the last week and I haven't been drinking. I've gotten a few comments but they fade quickly and I've brushed them off. I'm typically the instigator so I'm hoping it won't get too crazy and it will just be a fun day. I know I won't drink but I don't know how the day will go. I hope I'm worrying about nothing. ..Regardless of how it goes I will not drink with you all today.

Stay strong!  ..Many people insist on "dry places and dry people" especially at the beginning.  If need be dont hesitate to make a polite excuse and leave your event.   ..IWNDWYT
