Rehab or meetings from day 1? What to do? 
----------immediate responses--------

It really depends how deeply addicted you are. Alcohol withdrawal can be very dangerous. There are outpatient options as well. You may want to talk to your doctor first. Good luck!
Rehab is probably the safesta d preferred option if it is available to you followed up by meetings but after a long time in AA I do know hundreds of people that have gotten sober just by going to meetings. ..Good luck. Keep us posted. 
I attend AA meetings regularly. But if someone comes in with massive amounts of underlying issues mental health etc. I don't see how AA could addresses these issues as well as a reputable treatment center that offers several types of therapies!
