Struggling once again.  
----------immediate responses--------

For me it's always the same simple actions--[start at the beginning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
But being here means there's hope for change. Progress not perfection :) glad to have you back!

The fact that you're back means something.   Remember that.   The only thing you need to focus in is staying sober TODAY.   One day at a time mate. You've got this!  I believe in you! 
My last relapse was at 63 days. I was pretty upset about it but realized I had learned a lot in those 63 days. Learning from the past is part of the process and now you are more knowledgeable and stronger! Time to continue your journey! I will not drink with you today.
