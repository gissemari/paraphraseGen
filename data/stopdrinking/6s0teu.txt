Day 3 with no booze. The first two days were very easy as I was really busy. Today seems to be a major struggle as I have had quite a few emotional situations arise which I would love to drown out with some beer.  Anyone have some tips with dealing with an emotional roller coaster. I can't remove myself from the situation till Wednesday so I have to find a way to deal and not break.

&gt; tips with dealing with an emotional roller coaster..Treat yourself to your favourite consumable things yeah treat yourself to cake cookies steak caviar kangaroo frogs legs or a big tub of ice cream all to yourself!..Comfort eat in other words why not? It is 10000000000x better than beer!..I will not drink with you today and I know you will be strong and you will not drink with me..
