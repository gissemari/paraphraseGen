After 114 days last weekend I bought 4 cans of beer and a pack of tobacco only slightly enjoyed them at the time but that sluggish feeling was definitely not worth it on Monday morning. .I was ok during the week and didn't have any cravings or anything that wasn't to last though and this weekend was so hard I was tempted at least four times to go to the store. This weekend it was harder to stay sober than the 16 before my relapse combined..I've read on here that it only gets harder after each relapse I thought I was different thought I could have a few and then leave it a few months and have a few more. I'm not different and these cravings and emotions I'm going through right now aren't worth it. I have begun reaping the rewards of sobriety and plan on continuing down this path..Hopefully this post helps somebody flirting with the idea of having a couple of drinks I'm finding it so much harder this second time round.

I completely agree. Today has been rough for me. ..It's good that you did not give in to temptation. Tomorrow you will thank you a lot for the perseverance you showed today in sticking with sobriety.
I just do not agree that it is tougher after a relapse. So what give up and go down the pipe. No get up and walk thru that door again. I am no looser because I'm 51 and trying to quit drinking. Fuck that. I am just trying to figure out my life with sobriety no better or worse than anyone else. Simple as that. I wouldn't give it a second thought. Sounds like an excuse to me. Ahhh I relapsed so fuck it I will drink 24/7. I don't think so! We got this. Sober on the big weekend.
