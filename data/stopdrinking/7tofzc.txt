Curious to see if anyone has had luck with this method? ..I was almost a month sober and I relapsed yesterday. I blacked out and I feel like total shit. Hope you guys are having a better day than me.

I tried it but I didnt find it effective.  ..At first my drinking decreased but it eventually plateaued and started going up again.  I realized that "the buzz" wasnt the only reason that I drank and that taking the buzz away wasnt stopping my bad behavior.  ..Plus it didnt sit well with me that I was continuing to drink plus taking a second drug for possibly the rest of my life.   ..I wanted to stop drinking entirely so abstinence is working out better for me.  
I've seen lots of different opinions on it here. Maybe try the search bar for the sub?
