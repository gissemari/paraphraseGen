I joined this group after my last relapse and it's becoming part of my daily routine.  I've been wanting to quit for years but sustained sobriety has always eluded me.  At first it would be a matter of days between relapses then over time it became weeks and recently I've been able to go a month or two. The longer I can make it the better my life becomes!  It's gonna be that way for you too.  Don't give up because the struggle will pay off in ways you can't imagine!
