One month! Goodness knows some days it has felt like a year haha! But I have made more advances in my personal life in the past month than I probably have in at least the past year! ..Its so nice to be excited to get out of bed! Or how long it's been since I went a whole month without calling in "sick "to work. ..Thank you all for being here and sharing your stories! Here's to another 30 days .. but one day at a time! ..<3 ..And to anyone else struggling with sleep starting out.. I am still there with you! Sleepy time tea has been a huge help .. slowly but surely though I think my brain is finally readjusting to the idea of actually sleeping instead of just passing out in a drunken stupor! ..Have a great night everyone!

Great job!  Keep at it a day at a time like you said...I need something before bed too to get a little punctuation mark on the end of the day. Decaf tea does the trick for me too.
congratulations!! I'm just on day 2 and I don't remember the last time I went 30 without :( but it's a challenge I would love to overcome and you are definitely providing hope!
Right there with ya!  Good Job and keep that good attitude!.
