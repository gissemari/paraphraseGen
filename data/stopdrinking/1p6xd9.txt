Until I am 6 months sober.  My battle has been very hard.  I went to treatment and I found MY solution.  I had severe depression.  I am on meds and I haven't even wanted a drink since I started taking them.  ..I wish the best for everyone struggling.

Why only six months? Not sure I understand the post.  Good Luck anyhow!
