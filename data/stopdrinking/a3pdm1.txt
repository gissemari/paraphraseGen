Not sure what to write but need to share so this is out there. At day 2 today after making it 316 days... I have no words and feel incredible shame and guilt for giving in. I watched it happen in slow motion like a train wreck and did everything I thought I had built the tools to avoid in planning my relapse. I stopped being honest with myself and gave room to the darkness. I let the thoughts of where I was last year and what I put my soon to be ex-wife through take over my feeling of self-worth. I did manage to make a SMART meeting for the first time in over 5 years of wanting to make it to some form of meeting in a meaningful way. That plus reading through posts here reminded me that the progress I made is not gone it's not all or nothing and I don't get to wallow in pity or give in to the "fuck it" attitude. I didn't realize what a beautiful thing life can be until recently and I want to hold onto that. Time to get back to it and do the things that made me successful again and hold onto attaining 98% sobriety over the last 324 days a score that is so easy to bring down and so hard to make better. Here's to everyone out there that shares and helps us remember it's still not worth it. Alcohol brings nothing good to my life. Thanks to anyone that reads this and I will not drink with you today. \*video game voice "Round N+1 fight!"

First of all you made it 316 days. I can't even dream of numbers that big!!!! You should be so proud of yourself and a relapse that lasted a night or two can't take away that amazing accomplishment! Jump right back on this horse! The fact you were able to stay sober for the amount of time just shows you'll go longer and stronger next time! Don't beat yourself up and welcome back my friend   I will.Not drink with you today 
I agree you had a slip up. You're here and 316 is fantastic! A slip up isn't ideal but it doesn't take away the progress you made. If you were able to see it in slow motion looking back  maybe you can can pickup on the warning signs if you start to feel that way again. .I tend to get complacent and ignore when I feel things building. Now I'm back at day 3 with an angry spouse that might leave. .If you had that long sober I know you can do it again and stronger than before! Hang in there!
