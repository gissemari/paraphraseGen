Today I received my new blood test results back. This was from May 2015 and November 2015 respectively :..May:..AST.248 [IU]/L (High).Date: May 13 2015 01:21 p.m. EDT Reference Range:15 [IU]/L - 41 [IU]/L.ALT.128 [IU]/L (High).Date: May 13 2015 01:21 p.m. EDT Reference Range:17 [IU]/L - 63 [IU]/L ..November:..AST.20 [IU]/L (Normal).Date: Nov 02 2015 09:49 a.m. EST Reference Range:0.0 [IU]/L - 40.0 [IU]/L.ALT.21 [IU]/L (Normal).Date: Nov 02 2015 09:49 a.m. EST Reference Range:0.0 [IU]/L - 41.0 [IU]/L..Between the first and last results I have also lost 30 lbs through running pilates and yoga and my cognitive function improves every day. I'm enjoying and *remembering* time spent with my wife and kids. I am almost up to running 5k straight and wake up in the morning happy and well rested. ..The only crutch that I need/needed is gabapentin for RLS which prevented me from sleeping after quitting. I have no desire whatsoever to drink and end up asking myself on a daily basis as to why I drank so heavily in the first place. I have also been tested countless times and passed with flying colors...I just wanted to share the good news with you guys here in SD and to let the newcomers know that it does get better with every day. It did for me...I also know that I am in no way clear of my alcoholism and need to remain vigilant every day. I am an alcoholic after it's all said and done anyway...Edit:.1 week long relapse in this time as well

For RLS you might wanna ask your doctor to get your ferritin levels checked and if they're low/low-normal taking an iron supplement might help. Talk to your doctor first though and it's a REALLY bad idea for men to take an iron supplement without getting their stuff checked out first. So my advice is: talk to a competent doctor.
Congrats! And wow 5k?
