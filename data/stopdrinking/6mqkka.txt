I recently made it 3 weeks without drinking then we went to Hawaii. Had lots of fun but there was also a lot of drinking luckily it never got out of hand since I was always was around lots of people. I don't get drunk unless I am alone. Now that the dream vacation is over and life is back to normal I have struggled to not drink especially on the nights I know my wife will be in bed early and I can stay up chain smoking American Spirits and sipping on whatever looked good at the store I pass on the way home from work. It's crazy that I keep doing this to myself it's not like I don't remember how amazing I felt just after a week of being sober it improved every aspect of my life. I want that feeling again so badly that feeling of life. For me that's what that feeling is. It is me me being able to feel the life that I live. I hope I wake up tomorrow with clean lungs and clear pee because that will mean day one is behind me and even though each day after will be hard the feeling of life returning to me will be more than enough to push me though to the next. Thanks for listening Friends.
