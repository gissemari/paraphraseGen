I don't know what to do. ..I am a textbook alcoholic and I am guilty of all the manipulation lies and everything done to destroy the trust of my near and dear. However via some sober time rehab AA and NA I have been given these tools to change my behaviour. I have been very willing and I have used the tools to change my behaviour because I don't like who I became. I have had a lot of success with this and the mere fact that I am sober and not chasing the next beer has made a lot of the manipulation and lies fall away. ...The problem is that the moment there is a bit of tension with my family I have to get them to stop acting in the old ways. They immediately impose old frameworks on current issues without even thinking about it. They don't listen it's almost like they have this expectation of what's going to happen next and act in fear and anger off the bat. This is a problem because I now don't get to show them that I am going to act in a way very different that there is nothing to fear because they are already consumed in it. When I set a boundary I get accused of manipulation.  When I don't constantly smile everyone walks on eggshells and treat me like I'm about to explode. It takes me forever to patiently listen to them react to something that hasn't happened because interrupting them and clearing up the miss conception is disrespectful and avoiding the issue. When I finally get an opportunity to speak I get interrupted with objections about past behaviour even though I haven't acted like that during the conversation.  It literally takes me hours to get them to see and acknowledge that what they are feeling and reacting to is in the past and not in the here and now..And then a little while later it all happens again. ...I understand that it is going to take a long time to regain their trust. I take full responsibility for violating it in the first place. I understand that I just have to keep showing the positive changes until they are noticed and believed. But it frustrates me it makes me unhappy even a bit despondent. .I am doing my best to stay positive but I am surrounded by negativity. I'm really struggling with this....Any advice?.

&gt;I understand that it is going to take a long time to regain their trust. I take full responsibility for violating it in the first place.  .  .Are you sure? Because you also say:  .  .&gt;I have to get them to stop acting in the old ways. They immediately impose old frameworks on current issues without even thinking about it.  .  .This is what lost trust looks like: angry defensive fearful. They aren't imposing frameworks they are responding emotionally. If you accept responsibility then you also have to accept that you can't control their reactions. I'm not trying to get down on you here and I know it is really hard to deal with negativity in really early days. But you might save yourself frustration by shifting your perspective a bit.
you have 55 days which is great but not enough to expect other people to change to forgive to forget. (in fact they may never change there is no rule that says they have to. consider how deep is the hole you dug yourself into?)..the thing I would point out is actually an alanon saying that other peoples opinion of you is none of your business - your only business is staying sober and enhancing your recovery.  Their changing might make it easier but the reality is that you are the only one you can change and arguably the one with the most to change.
