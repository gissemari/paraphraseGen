[Original Post.](http://redd.it/1gitgj)..I'm pretty foggy-headed right now.  I have alternately been very sharp at work when needed this week.  However it was a frustrating work at week overall for reasons having nothing to do with me or my quitting...I have a headache now a low grade number that's been running for about two days and shrugging off my half-hearted attempts at pain-killers...I have also been having a lot of trouble sleeping.  I'll be sleepy tired. But as soon as I begin to drift off I have that "jolt" response that wakes me back up.  One night this week I just collapsed and slept really good.  That was a great morning.  The others have all been struggles to get awake...Tonight I feel ready to collapse again to make up more sleep debt.  My eagerness for this will help me sail right past the liquor store.  But of course next Friday is the real test...Please note all the above symptoms are not really major or dramatic just low-grade annoying.  But this feeling itself is what I feel accumulating that I'm not sure what to do with...I also neglected to mention in my previous post that I smoke marijuana as well.  It has always been "the triumverate" of pot booze and tobacco.  Well I'm not drinking and I've been vaping for my nicotine for a year now but the pot remain unaddressed.  One thing at a time but I guess I better just admit I'm still leaning on that crutch right now and get some opinions on it...Thanks for reading.

I'm sure some disagree but I know that many in the program that I attend would say you should quit all substances. 
I'm with you on the threesome pot being the lesser of all the vices.  I'm two weeks in without the sauce and it just doesn't feel like I should partake of anything if I am to get my head straight. My bf has offered several times out of politeness but I didn't take it nor did I really want it. I'm grateful for that...Keep at it and it will come to you when you're ready.
