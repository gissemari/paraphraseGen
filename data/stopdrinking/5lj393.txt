This is the real danger area for me. I relapsed last week in part because my dad had been in the hospital but in the past it's always been nights like this one when I am so understimulated that I'm reduced to Googling weird phrases ("Farty McFarterson" "buuuuuuuuurrrrp") to entertain myself that I find myself thinking "I could just pop down to the pub and have a beer or five and I wouldn't be bored at all anymore."..Instead I'm sipping Diet Squirt and watching Fleabag for the zillionth time and trying to remind myself of how good it feels to wake up without a hangover. Not drinking.

Man that sucks. I had an old guy tell me. If I don't get up off my dead lazy ass and go enjoy life and stop dragging around my alcoholism with me. It's nobodies fault but my own. And you know he's right. See what y can add to the stream of life
I made a two page list of activities I want to do (places to go restaurants to try hikes to take shops to visit) and I plan my schedule a week at a time. I am too busy to get bored. My danger zone is happy hour...get home from work early+no plans=bar time.
