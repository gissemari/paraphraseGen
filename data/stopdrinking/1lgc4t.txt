I've hit three weeks today and apart from an annoying headache all day today I am feel great. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who posts in this forum I do not post much but I check back a few times a day and read almost everything that people share. It has been a great help to know that other people are facing the same thoughts/struggles/questions...To the next three weeks and more!

To infinity and beyond!
Congratulations!
Congratulations I just recently passed this milestone as well. Weird things still happen for example:..Last night I had a Fantasy Football draft with a bunch of guys from my shop. They all drank I didn't. Fast forward to 1 a.m I wake up from a deep sleep and am wide awake. I'm talking waking up from a black out night wide awake. For a few moments I couldn't remember coming home or going to bed so I thought I had drank and blacked out and I felt TERRIBLE. I went to get a drink and during my walk to the fridge I had the major epiphany that I hadn't drank any alcohol and my brain is just wacked. I was/am wicked happy I didn't drink and am looking forward to not drinking today...Congrats again before we know it we will be at 1 month..
I'm about where you are too.  Feels so good.  Also like BluePatriot I sometimes wake up and forget that I'm not going to feel hungover or work to remember what I may or may not have said or done. Congrats!
Don't drink today.
Annoying headaches. Isn't it kind of awesome that's the worst part of your day so far? We're the lucky ones.
Nice :)
