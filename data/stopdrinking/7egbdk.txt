Time keeps rolling on and I am sober now 128 days. I previously quit drinking for 8 months in 2014 but started up again later that year. I did not have any treatment then and convinced myself that it was ok for me to drink again and that I could moderate my drinking. That lasted just a few days. Fast forward to July 2017 when I finally realized I needed help. I entered an outpatient chemical dependency program for several months which really helped me. I also took a break from work to focus on my recovery. I still miss my evening wine at times but know that I can't go back to that soul crushing habit. Much love and encouragement to everyone out there who is struggling.  You can set yourself free.
