I had a breakdown after relapsing *hard* just before New years had a massive panic attack because of heavy withdrawals but luckily could reach my psychiatrist and she sorted me out...Haven't touched a drop since then and planning on not having ANY ALCOHOL this year. It seems I am like allergic to alcohol now it totally changes my personality which is horrible...Amazing how one's mind and body is connected. I swear one drop of alcohol will lead me back to something bad again...So I will not drink today with you and also not in this year...I'm glad my resolve is strong. Music helps a bit of weed here and then helps my psychologist helps my psychiatrist and the meds also help...Do you guys think this support base I'm building up is enough? I try to think I have the will-power now after 3 relapses...Hope everything goes well with everyone and wishing the best for 2018 for all of us.

I know that I have benefitted from the support I have found at meetings.
