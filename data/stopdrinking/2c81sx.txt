Hello reddit so I'm here to get help for my sister. ..My hope is to gain perspective and find helpful sources for her and I. Although I love her deeply our lives rarely cross unfortunately. And even when they do we are different people; socially and behaviourally. ..She is a really tough woman. She has a bunch of tattoos big dogs smokes a big truck bartender and can be scrappy at times.  I on the other hand am finishing up my fourth year of a BSc (not to say I have my shit together; our issues diverge in substance). ..I saw her for the first time in a long time (she's been living overseas) a couple weeks ago. I shared with her some if my personal struggles. She then told me she has a problem with alcohol and she needs help. ..Her current skill set is serving and she's been a fantastic bartender at numerous bars over the last decade (she's in her late 20s). Going back to school is not an option (she really hates the idea and I respect that). This makes if difficult for her to envision a different life/path. ..I'm the only personal she's told in our family though it's implicitly known. ..**Here's what I'm asking**..- Do you have any books or resources you think she might relate too?..She's not open to rehab. I just need something some of you might think would be a good fit for her. Something to empower her. She thinks her drinking is a personal failure but I've tried to tell her it's much more complicated than that: it's in a disease state. She literally can't fall asleep unless she's drunk. I've looked at Allen Carrs booked linked in the sidebar. Opinions?..I hope this makes sense.

I'm sure you will get a lot of great in depth replies and I'm sorry that I'm only here to chime in with a quick one.  (You'll have to forgive me I'm just scanning through posts before bed).  Have you shown her this site yet?  I lurked for a while before taking any action in my own life.  Reading people's posts let me know that I really wasn't alone and that the things I was experiencing were things others had gone through and had survived.  It also gave me an idea of what I had in store for me and there are countless posts detailing recovery resources that people utilize.  I managed to answer a lot of questions I had that I wasn't ready to verbalize to another person.  Best wishes to your sister.
Please share your caring post on /r/alanon which is where you might get the most helpful and supportive response.  Good luck.
