I can feel my self struggling  my mind is in over drive.  Beer keeps popping into my head  I guess its because I've been working really hard today and I keep thinking 'when you finish work you can grab a few beers  you deserve it' then I have to remind my self that I'm quitting alcohol and its making me incredibly anxious...I've had that thought at least 10 times in the last hour! But I'm not going to drink...I'm doing this for my health  mental and physical and for my family...IWNDWYT

Focus... distract yourself.... sit out those cravings they will go... write here. Fill your time. You're doing great!
I am struggling at day 7 too especially with wanting a drink after work. Let's not drink together. Hugs 
What non-booze reward sounds good to you after a hard work day?  It was important to me to build new habits to replace the old ones instead of just leaving a void.
