Alcohol does not have the power to make your life happy it only allows you to borrow a bit of happiness from the future and it does so at terrible expense. ..It's hard for you to see the positives right now because your neurochemistry has been thrown entirely out of whack.

And it FEELS like it's going to last forever.  And it's SUCH a difficult change to make and accept...If I could impart any wisdom to those newly sober it's this:..Early sobriety is a very short time.  Even if it's 3 months 6 months or 12 months (or more) it's but a short part of the rest of your life...At 3 months I accepted that I am an alcoholic.  Sobriety got better.  At 6 months I realized that it didn't matter what was in anyone else's cup (and it shouldn't matter to them what's in mine).  At 8 months I felt more comfortable being around other drinkers.  At 12 months I realized that I could talk about booze with others and not feel any longing.  Here at 23 months I've gone to the liquor store with my wife talked about the beer we were buying for a party carried the beer to the car and brought it into the party.  All normal stuff.  This is only 2 years into sobriety...There are definitely people who were in my life before that are no longer part of it.  I didn't cut them out.  They didn't cut me out.  I just don't run into them anymore.  And that's OK.  Turns out that we weren't as close as I once thought!..   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|15|_LB_|*Is abstinence my only option?* by redoso|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2jngda/is_abstinence_my_only_option/cldbbc6)|.I second what /u/offtherocks says...>I certainly don't want to admit to my friends and colleagues that I'm a failure when they see that I  can't  drink...Do you think I'm a failure because I'm an alcoholic? Do you think everyone on here who "can't" drink is a failure?..My drinking got bad enough that I saw what being a failure was really like. I don't feel like one now at all...If you feel like going back to drinking no one can tell you not to. For me there is no other option but complete abstinence. What helps me is the idea of staying sober for just today - it keeps me away from that dizzying edge of "you mean I can't drink FOREVER?!?!?!"..Good luck in whatever you decide to do..   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|15|sunjim|*How do I know that I am an alcoholic and not just a 24 year old?* by Action_hero_name|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2jkyzj/how_do_i_know_that_i_am_an_alcoholic_and_not_just/clcpg9k)|.Nice.

They're all beverages they all aren't alcoholic (yes NA beer has small amounts but it's similar to what's naturally found in a cup of OJ) and for some people they can help smooth an otherwise rough transition make them feel a bit more "normal" or provide a flavor the person actually enjoys and misses without the shitty side-effects of alcohol. ..For some people drinking these things can trigger them to want to drink actual alcohol or can stimulate bad feelings ideas and sensations. They should feel confident in rejecting drinking even NA and alcohol removed things if that's what they need. But some people don't experience that and that's totally fine too. Everyone should be able to decide for themself where the line in the sand is and that's ok. Some people are fine going to bars or parties with a lot of alcohol for other people it's not acceptable. Some people don't mind if someone brings alcohol into their house for others it's not acceptable. Everyone's alcoholism is different and everyone's recovery will be different. .   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|14|raevie|*Does being an alcoholic mean you are weak?* by _yourhonoryourhonor|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2jg7x9/does_being_an_alcoholic_mean_you_are_weak/clbep82)|.No.   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|14|Lurkeranonymouse|*One Year Down Today* by yankee4357|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2j16ej/one_year_down_today/cl7g3bq)|.I have day 365 today too! .Good for us and well done! .   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|13|Nika65|*Life's terms are garbage* by Cutty_McStabby|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2jiblw/lifes_terms_are_garbage/clc08ev)|.You have spent 36 days prepping for this....this is the time your family needs you sober and present.
