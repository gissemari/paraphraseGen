I have a friend who's 18 and he's been struggling with anxiety and been having difficulties making friends since young age. He'd often complain to me that he can't find friends or a girlfriend - I always tried to help as much as I could (and he said he really appreciated me doing that) but recently he found a new friend group that likes to go out and drink a lot. So he joined them going out drinking every day this is where I tried to warn him for the first time (I said something like "you may wanna go easy on the drinks it's not good for you") he didn't listen (I can't blame him he seemed happy to finally have found a group he can be a part of)...It didn't go well. In a time span of one week he lost his job got kicked out of his parents house and had police looking for him because he broke some windows in the area...Few days ago he texted me me that all of the friends he was drinking with were gone (didn't ask for details) and whatever I would say at the end of the day he'd still end up drinking...Feels like whatever I do I just can't help him. I tried to talk to him multiple times he even admitted that the alcohol has done only bad for him but he still drinks it. What can I do?

Best thing I did was to recover my self and lead with example. I write the 12 steps it's awesome 
Do non-alcoholic things with him - take him out for coffee during the day.
The best thing I did in a similar situation was focus on my own recovery. I stopped hanging around with anyone who abused alcohol. One of the most important life lessons I have learned is that I cannot help someone who doesn't want help. The only person I can change is myself.
