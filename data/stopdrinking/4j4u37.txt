I'm getting so close to one year sober that I can almost taste it... and it definitely does **NOT** taste like the white wine Bailey's and Listerine that constituted my last bender (I was so physically dependent that my stomach was completely unable to keep anything else but those three things down). I'm filled with emotions: gratitude excitement pride (which I am actively "stepping" to quell)... and as of today frustration and in pain. ..I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed today and the procedure actually went great- I was not expecting it to be so smooth. I declined the Valium they wanted to give me and I was adamant about not using Nitrous to sedate me (beyond being an awful idea for an addict it makes me horribly miserably sick... so that was an easy choice) opting to just be local numbed. Now that I'm home and "recovering" I've been doing my best to manage the pain with just ibuprofen and Tylenol but it is steady getting more and more intense; it's not yet unbearable but it's getting close. Now I'm absolutely *agonizing* over the thought of using the Vicodin that they prescribed me. My partner is in control of the prescription (I instructed him to not ever leave them where I would have access) and he is encouraging me to take one since it's now been ten hours since the surgery and I have yet to take any so I am **well** below the "prescribed" dosage. I don't know though it just feels like taking my dose will be a failure... maybe not a "relapse" but still a failure. ..My alcoholic brain has run through the list of excuses/plots... "Any normal person would take their medicine" "You're only taking it as prescribed- by a DOCTOR!" "You DESERVE to relax and be pain free you had surgery today!" "Even if you don't take it now you should pocket it and save it for a later date. Just in case." I observe these thoughts I note them I dismiss them as my inner-addict talking and I let them pass without phasing me. But now that I may actually need the pain relief the fact that I even *had* any of these thoughts makes me feel like taking it would be succumbing or failing. Like I should only take them if my mind was 100% in the right place?..I don't know... Sigh. I wouldn't let anyone advise me on medical issues like this except for my physicians/dentists so I'm not looking for advice. I just needed to vent- my sponsor is sick and can't talk. I got my ass to a meeting and shared and it was a nice reprieve but now I'm still agonizing and conflicted. Just needed to continue get things off my chest. Thanks all...(EDIT: Just re-read my post and holy shit it's FULL of rationalization and bargaining hahaha. Taking some more Ibuprofen now and declining the Vicodin until it truly is unbearable. Thanks for letting me whine!)
