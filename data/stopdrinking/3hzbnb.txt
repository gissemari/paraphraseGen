Made it past the week benchmark for the first time in ages. While I don't struggle with cravings at anywhere near the severity that some of you do I am nevertheless pleased that I haven't hit the wine a single night this past week.

Congrats to your first week :) I hope many more sober weeks will follow! I was like you the first two or three weeks in. I was just thrilled with how well and easy I'm doing on the wagon. Cravings then came hard after a month and two. Make sure you have activities that involve your heart and mind to keep your demons from getting a hold of you again. And talk to people like you it helps! :) 
Here's to another week!
