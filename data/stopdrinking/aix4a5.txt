It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I am having problems with a person who works at the medical center I go to. I sarcastically refer to him as  Mr. Watch Chain  because he wears a foppish vest with a decorative watch chain and seems to be more concerned about having highlights in his hair than about me having medical problems. But asking whether I can be seen by a different person has gotten me branded  a problem patient  so I don't dare push the issue. Gah!..**Triumph:** A few days ago I visited the town where I'll be going in March for an artist's workshop. I was originally booked at a Western-themed motel with a large hillbilly bar lots of cigarette smoking and parking for bikers. (Also by the looks of it people shooting off their guns after midnight.) Back when I was drinking smoking and riding a motorcycle I would have loved it. Now for obvious reasons not so much. ..While I was still in the same town I found a different motel where I could stay instead a quieter place with a sunny garden to sit in with my morning coffee and a small swimming pool to take a dip at the end of the day. It looked perfect so I have changed my reservation...**General:**  I hate it when I think I'm buying organic vegetables but when I get home I discover they're just ordinary frosted donuts. .
----------immediate responses--------

Struggle: not well at the minute but not serious..Good: a laugh out loud moment for Mary's organic doughnuts..General: lots still to deal with in life...
Struggle: Nothing major lots of minor.  I still can't motivate my butt to work out my boss is driving me nuts. General stuff...Triumph: I finally focused enough this weekend to get another draft of chapter 1 of my dissertation off to my chair for comment...General: I need to make key that dentist appt today and schedule that guy to clean my dryer vents before I get fined by the condo association... I never get to these kind of chores at work then remember when it's too late. 
Struggle: Nothing major...hate the cold...impatiently awaiting spring. Also a tad peeved at what I just saw on early morning news. Ludicrous comments by news folks about a celeb announcement that she is not going to drink for 18 years. I immediately thought the celeb must be pregnant and good for her...Triumph: Just got up off floor after laughing hysterically! Thanks mary!..General: Going grocery shopping today &amp; will pay special attention in the organic vegetable section. SD is a great way to start my day..Stay strong &amp; Sober on! Peace 
Day 10 today and 1/3 of the way to my initial target of a month.
Struggle: Back to day 1. I hate this. But I'm going to own it...Triumph: I woke this morning and my house was clean so that's cool...General: I'm really angry that I'm back at day 1. I feel like I have these long excellent stretches   and then get totally derailed. Last week for example I worked out every day planned all my meals stayed sober and even managed to maintain a vegan diet. I felt great. And then this weekend I feel like I got hit by a train. Clearly I need to strengthen my tools for weathering the storm...Anyway back at it.
I'm so glad that you found a nice more serene motel u/sfgirlmary! I can't wait to hear all about the workshop :)...**Struggle:**     SO and I are both working crazy hours I'm taking care of mom so we haven't been able to see each other much...**Triumph:**     I took 1/2 yesterday to spend time with his mom (who's not feeling well either) then SO and I had dinner and enjoyed a nice night together. No matter how hectic life gets we still need to make time for our family and friends :)...**General:**     I've made a commitment to myself to dedicate more time to my program. I hit 3 new different AA meetings in 3 days; made lots of new friends met up with old ones and I'm feeling much more connected...kinda like a sobriety-refresher lol ;)..
Struggle: just got out of the hospital with an esophageal ulcer...they took biopsies and that's a little scary...Triumph: I've gotten through 3 weeks and 2 days without drinking a drop or going out to a bar. And with this new diagnosis I definitely won't be drinking today! As much as it sucks it's just added motivation to stay sober and home! Also my work life is getting back to normal and I was able to buy a home office set up to make it even more easy to work! 
Struggle: None right now. Just trying to remember why I quit!..Triumph: My snoring continues to decrease and I haven't experienced any depression or anxiety!..General: Anyone else's badge not updating? I'm supposed to be at 22 days but mine has not changed from 19 since Sunday. Was really looking forward to that big 3.
Struggle: Issues at work or rather someone has an issue with me. I'm trying really hard to not think about it which of course makes me think about it even more. I just wish there could be some sense of closure on the situation but instead this person has been avoiding me like the plague...Triumph: I got a pressure cooker for Christmas and I've been having a lot of fun making new things in it. I made my own yogurt! Vegan yogurt at that which is pretty cool I think and saving me some money on that fancy store bought kind. It's become like a new hobby for me that I'm really enjoying. ..General: I cannot wait for it to be Spring I'm so done with the snow and cold and greyness here. I bought an artificial lemon tree this week to put in the kitchen which my husband thinks is a bit odd but I need something to remind me of the sunshine dang it :)  
**Struggle:** Actually selling the inherited treasures we've worked for weeks (spread over months) to separate from the chaff of the storage unit. ..**Victory:**  The end is in sight! We've opened every box and will be rapidly donating what is not of much value to several different charitable organizations.  ..**General:**  Florida ahead.  And then spring! Yahoo. 
Struggle: My doctor and o have decided I can do a trial run of tapering off my antidepressant. While I'm super excited for this I'm on the highest dose and it's going to take awhile for me to back it down. Plus she said I may struggle for awhile so I'm a little scared! ..Triumph: I told that same doctor yesterday about my alcoholism and the fact that I am 5 months sober! Yay! She was glad I told her. ..General: I got to have lunch with some ladies yesterday and had a great time plus I get to have tea this evening and will have yet another great time!!
This is a great idea! I love this community. ..Struggle - newly sober (8 days) so I'm having a lot of mood swings - sometimes I feel peaceful relaxed or euphoric but other times I feel depressed irritable grieving or furious. I'm in my home country where I no longer live visiting my parents and I'm having a hard time dealing with them. ..Triumph - I am reading again! It's been so long since I felt the motivation or could concentrate properly. It used to be my favourite thing and I'm just so so happy and grateful that I can enjoy it again. Also I caught up with a wonderful old friend for a coffee today and it felt so deeply fulfilling to socialise sober. ..General - it is so helpful to reflect by writing things down. ..Happy sober Wednesday to all!

Struggle: Ugh totally thought I was on a winner this January. But I think the long dark nights are taking their toil...Feeling pretty lonely at the moment but also feel like I'm isolating myself. I am ready to move on from some broken friendships which is for the best but my city feels too small and suffocating. ..All my friends are connected and they are al people who just want to party and get fucked up mainly on drugs rather than booze but it's still not great. I just feel a bit at a loss - kind of stuck in limbo. ..My partner isn't great at going out and meeting people either so I feel responsible for his social life too which is starting to really get to me. ..Tough week!..Triumph: I decided to have a go at writing fiction again. My stuff sucks but I guess that's a point and it definitely helps to let my mind drift on that instead of darker things...General: There is too much food in the office I'm scared all the weight I dropped from not drinking will come back in shape of donuts pastries and more! 
Struggle: I'm another here working for the US federal govt and wondering about getting paid. Hubby is in the same boat. We're funded one more week and after that we'll be working w/o pay since we're "essential."  Thankfully we made what turned out to be a very savvy financial decision at the end of 2017 and paid off my student loans &amp; have no mortgage. We're in a much better position than most of the people we work with but it's scary stuff...Triumph: Back in therapy with a compassionate therapist and we're working on my transition from surviving to thriving. :) My main issue in my harsh inner and outer critics but knowing is half the battle as they say...General: The Super Bowl is coming to my town next week and it's going to be a total shitshow. I will observe.  .
I can't see my badge
**Struggle(s):**  Daughter has a late start to school we got a layer of ice followed by 12hrs of snow.  I got stuff to do!  I've basically been stuck at home since Friday!  ..**Triumphs:**  Daughter turning eight.  Last three years have been sober last 2.5 pretty much done it on my own.  People be all like "oh yeah any time you need help I got you!" then it's people be like "uh this Friday??  Let me get back to you on that!"..  Basically what I'm trying to say is that a lot of people that I thought would be there and said they would be there for me haven't been and weren't.  And I did it.  I've done it.  Still doing it.  No one can take that away from me.  Except me....**General:**  I can't control my thoughts.  I read this stuff and watch these videos about how to be happy and they are like "just think positive thoughts"  yeah ok genius.  For me it's like Ray from Ghostbusters.  Trying not to think of anything but instead he conjures the Stay Puffed marshmallow man.
Struggle:  I'm having a really tough time with completely quitting it's really hard to imagine not drinking which is why I want to quit in the first place.  My flair isnt accurate out of the 23 days I've had drinks 4 of those days...Triumph:  I've been sober 19 days so far this month! Out of those 4 days I've drank considerably less than what I normally would have.  I'm proud that I've cut down so much but I'm working on completely quitting for a long time.  I've also lost a total 9 lbs since I quit!  ..General:  I am excited about vacation and hope I lose the rest of the weight I'm trying to lose before then!  'Nother 20 lbs to go!!
Struggle: Getting the motivation to want to exercise. Yesterday I did a 20 minute kids exercise video from GoNoodle with my 5 and 6 year old. Today I can barely move and they are running in circles. ..Triumph: I've needed to travel for work for several months but put it off due to my drinking (not wanting to be drunk on air planes smell like booze or detox). Today I booked 6 trips in the coming month and my co-workers have noticed that I have more energy and a better attitude than most of them have. ..General: I've been setting up dr appointments to start re-focusing on my health prescriptions I quit taking teeth etc. It's time to clean-up the mess I've made that is my body. 
IWNDWYTD or tomorrow!
I love this. ..Struggle: Newly sober (day 3). Longest I've been sober in like two or three months. I just want to be at home sleeping not at work. I feel anxious. ..Triumph: Being sober. ..General: I'm craving pizza. 
**Struggle:** School both college and high school was long ago. I haven't had dreams about them for years until last night. I had a rough night of sleep stressing over work issues and things I need to do for family. When I finally fell asleep in the early morning my dreams were filled with the missing-school didn't unregister for classes surprise test sort of things. Ugh...**Triumph:** They weren't drinking dreams. At no point in the dreams did escaping via substances come up. I was coping--or trying to cope--sober and aware...[Happy Hump Day!](https://imgur.com/a/aRCxROc)
Struggle : got the flu.  Trying to get work done while feeling like shit.  ..Triumph : completed 5 days sober yesterday  and not dinking while sick like I would usually do is fastening recovery.  Before I would take the day off instead of battling through it at work and drink all day. ..General : grateful for two friends who are role models in sobriety.  Grateful to this sub. 
Struggle: I got to 90 days but couldn't make it through yesterday sober. So back at day one. ..Triumph: I made it to 90 days. I love my boyfriend he helped through yesterday en through this morning. ..General: I'm still tired of fighting. I just gave up on fighting yesterday but I know I have to continue fighting again today tomorrow and everyday till it gets easier. 
Struggle: I can't focus on my work missed the day yesterday and I'm feeling overwhelmed...Triumph: I showed up to a meeting with a professor and was engaged. I genuinely tried even though I was struggling...General: I'm gonna try this again. I had four years and they were good. Started again about a year and a half ago but it has turned into a crutch for depression and anxiety. I don't like the person I am when I'm using it for that purpose. So I'm glad to be here and IWDWYT. 
Struggle : a couple of days ago my partner and I had to make the decision to take our elderly cat to receive euthanasia. It was so hard to do and we both cried like children at the vet's. But she was very sick and had been for some time and at some point I had to admit that letting her keep struggling was becoming innhumane. She was 18; that's pretty heroic for an outdoor cat. She was the original Purrpetrator. I was a teenager when I adopted her and she was a tiny rolypoly kitten..I'm still hearing phantom purring around the house and feel nervous about moving my feet in the bed in case of accidentally kicking the sleepy snuggler. ..Triumph : I'm finding I have a lot less phone call anxiety... I usually put things like calling to update my insurance details off for weeks to months. But on Tuesday I called to get my partner included on my automobile association account and... on Wednesday he got a blowout when I wasn't there! Holy good timing!..General : konmari'd my closet walked up a nice hill tried out a new non alcoholic drink from my local superette (it was awful just like irretrievably bad) been getting 8 hours of sleep most nights you know life things! 
Struggle:  I've been a little sick with some sinus issues since last week.  Not too bad though I just wish I could pop my ears...Triumph:  I got a FPV drone last week and have been flying it at work after hours.  I don't have goggles yet but have been running a video receiver dongle on my phone.  ..General:  My parents found a house in Mexico and plan to leave TX by mid-April.  I'm really happy for them but I won't get to visit them as often as I used to.  At least now I can look forward to taking more consecutive days off to visit them.
Struggle: boyfriend had a beer and it was incredibly difficult for me not to join in. I felt like my mouth was watering...Triumph: I didn't drink a thing! Woo!..General: Going to bed early helps :)..IWNDWYT

I know I drink to self medicate .... But I think it is so hard to quit because then my failures will be on me and who i am  fundamentally and not because I am a drunk. That is unacceptable.
LOL on the doughnuts. Good call on changing rooms. ..**Struggle** What could it be with me other than work? I keep looking back on my past self who was struggling so much to find a job that didn't involve some metaphorical equivalent of "you want fries with that?" for several rough years in the mid 20teens here. I say to former Belinda hating being underemployed "look! we got one! we got a real job!" I keep trying to view it that way anyway . . ...**Triumph** One year sober. Me. I haven't been truly sober for this long since I was maybe 12 or 13?..**General** Slogging through a frigid MN winter. 
**Struggle:** I recently stopped drinking and I'm already overthinking on how to make this work on the long term. Also winter please go away! I'm so bored of this cold depressing weather...**Triumph:** Haven't had a drink or a smoke for 4 days I know it's not a lot but I already feel so much better. I'm so glad to be on this subreddit again so far I've had no mood swings or any side effects.
Struggle: Husband is on a business trip and this is normally when I'd go out to a half-price Wine Wednesday get a good meal and get a whole lot of wine in.  .Triumph: I'm still a newb but I'm truly loving waking up with a clear head my energy level is increasing and I have lost a few pounds.   ...General musing: "Be the change that you would see in the world."
**Struggle:** Anxiety. It's time I found myself some better coping strategies than procrastination...**Triumph:** I have been verbally offered a great job on a project helping get young people into work (typically their first full-time gig). I'm not going to let imposter syndrome get the better of me on this one!..**General:** "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"- John Lennon..Great musician rubbish at Cluedo...
A friend is throwing me a birthday house party on a weekend coming up. I'm not sure whether or not I want to drink while I'm there. I'm sure I'll still have fun sober and I have no desire to drink but I think other people will find it really weird if I'm not. I hope I don't get chastised for it...On another note a few things have really made me realise how quickly I got consumed by alcohol. ..I found a message in my sent items from the end of 2017 asking "Hey are people who don't drink welcome to this event?" and by the first few months of 2018 I was staying out until 4am drunk with my friends in clubs...Along a similar trail of thought its so easy to forget that alcohol is an addictive substance. There's a person I met at the end of 2017 who would a cigarette when we went out. A couple months later it was a few times a night but still only while drinking. A few months after that he was slendingmost
**Struggle**: Zero drinks last week until Saturday night. Felt like everything was in control as I'd worked out four times eaten cleanly and my life was neatly aligned. Had boxed on Saturday morning and was reading a book around 2pm when my cousin asked if he could stop by. We ended up having a meal and after not drinking for the whole week had a couple of Heinekens each. On the way back we stopped at the neighourhood bar and had a couple more each before coming home. All was fine until I remembered some guests had left a bottle of cacha a over NYE. End result - Drank a huge glass of Brazilian rum went out again and made a bloody nuissance of myself at the bar having to be walked home by the owner (it's right next to my flat). He knows I have issues.  ...**Triumph:** Still alive for one  (you stop taking that for granted after a while) and went back to boxing training today (Wed). Had to skip Monday's session due to the brutality of the hangover but training again Thursday and Saturday. Have decided to join AA as most of the long-term sober people I encounter (2+ years) seem to be involved. Let's keep on keeping on even when it feels darker than ever.  ...**General:** Still recovering from a painful fall of the wagon but never giving up. Joining AA to strengthen my resolve.
Day 8. The struggle is real.
I think my badge is broken.

I'll do my triumph first since it leads to a struggle.....Today I met up with a fellow volunteer. First meeting after the holidays to make some 2019 plans. I intentionally suggested a wine/coffee bar as our meeting place because I know she loves her wine and it'd raise fewer questions if I drank something that was not sparkling water. I also arrived a few minutes early so I could have my coffee bought and paid for avoiding any questions. She did have wine but we had an amazing chat and made some great plans to further our organization. (She wants our next working session to include wine and snacks but I'll cross that bridge when we come to it... I'll have about another month of sobriety under my belt by then)...Struggle: At this bar they do wine tastings. They pass out little cards with all the varieties and the bartenders talk about all the flavors and aromas of the wines. A few months ago I would have been super into this sort of thing but honestly... listening to them carry on about oaky this and blueberry that and crisp fruity whatever just sounded... ridiculous. So douchey. ..So the struggle for me is this... I definitely had feelings of smugness at other drinkers today. I felt self-righteous about my choice to not drink. But I also felt the ugliness of those feelings. How judgmental can I possibly be? I literally **was** those people barely over a month ago. I played that wine tasting fancy pants game for so long when we all know I would have been happy with any $5 bottle from the gas station...I quit drinking to be a kinder more honest person who isn't unnecessarily mean to others the way I was under the influence. But here I am stone sober feeling better than other people because of their choices... choices I made for myself over and over and over again for years. It makes me feel hypocritical ashamed and just plain rotten.
Your artist workshop sounds amazing! What is it exactly?..**Struggle:** I want/need to get help mentally I do believe. I use to have a therapist do EMDR and have medication for anxiety sleep PTSD and depression. We were talking about me possibly being bipolar when my life fell apart. I have been okay the last two years but with relapsing and basically having a mental breakdown last month I really want to keep my sanity &amp; sobriety. I am going to have to do a walk in at this notorious mental health facility this weekend and see if they can help me without insurance and I am half terrified they are just gonna lock me up - I know ... well think... the wont and I am just being paranoid but I really would like some tools before I hit another major depression...**Triumph:** Back in school loving it left the horrible job waiting to hear back of this decent one that is $3/hr more. Enjoying/productively using the time not working to organize my shit at home and work through some things in my head....[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg).**General:** "those mountains we carry we were only suppose to climb"
Getting close to a year and feeling like a total beginner in terms of dealing with life.  Totally overwhelmed and foggy.  One thing I do know is that drinking over my confusion/anxiety will make me....more confused and anxious.  So IWNDWYT.  Thanks everybody.    
i cant fucking stop. this is going to kill me if my heart doesn't.
