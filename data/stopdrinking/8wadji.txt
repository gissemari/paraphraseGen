So I've been sober for a while now but my life is actually very similar to how it was before. Instead of drinking all night I'm watching movies or playing video games but I'm still struggling to get a divorce still getting stressed at work etc. ..This morning I even fainted in the shower and gave myself a concussion so I'm even feeling and speaking like a drunk person! ..I found out very recently that my girlfriend is pregnant however so life is definitely improving just very slowly. ..How is everyone else doing today?

I'm a newbie compared to you in regard to sobriety but the way I see it our lives are not necessarily gonna change on the outside due to our sobriety but they're gonna change significantly on the inside. In the sense that we become more content and in sync with ourselves. .I'm pretty okay today. Had a couple of rough days - mentally - following my latest relapse but all things considered I'm okay.
