Hello all! Things are going very well with the method. My craving for drinking is going down. I don't obsess about alcohol at all anymore and have started to find that beer tastes pretty bad. I have complied perfectly all of August and found it's not hard at all to take the pill and wait the full hour. I drink much more slowly (a little more than 1 drink per hour) and much less. I am not blacking out or getting into trouble. I am still able to feel drunk if I drink too quickly but I don't get the 'manic' high from alcohol that I used to (The high that my 'normal' drinking friends cannot relate to anyway). I can see eventually I will probably quit altogether with this method but even if it didn't get any better than this I would be happy. I can say now with confidence - this method is working for me...[Here's my updated chart! :)](http://imgur.com/FSTSHkG)..I want to thank you guys for being here through all my struggles and allowing me to share what is working for me. ..*I do not advocate this method for anyone else. Everyone should talk to their doctor/therapist/sponsor/family or whatever support you use before trying a new method. Stay true to your path*..EDIT: If you don't like the method feel free to move on. It's ok by me. I'm not coming to your thread being condescending or snarky. Please treat me with kindness as I do you. There is no reason to be upset over what another person is doing. We're all in the same boat just trying to find what works for us! Please note the SIDEBAR which states: "This reddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to CONTROL or stop drinking." Thank you and best of luck to all my /r/stopdrinking comrades!! :)

I always enjoy reading your updates. So glad it is working well for you! Please keep posting I love the charts.
You realize you're still drinking at binge levels after a whole month?
If it makes you happy keep doing it. Congrats on the progress!

Hey /u/sober_girl it's good to hear from you. I'm glad there's improvement and you are sticking with it. 
Nice post...I think that fully diving in to abstinence and AA is great if you're ready for it. If you're not I think Naltrexone MIGHT be a stepping stone that can be helpful...The BIG danger is that while doing the Sinclair method for a number of months I still put myself in some incredibly stupid risky situations and engaged in some horrible behavior because I was still drinking. With or without Naltrexone when I take the first drink it is too great a gamble...Good luck. Be careful. I'll be reading your progress with great interest.
As someone who also tried this method and ultimately failed I need to point out a few things to anyone else who thinks this "program" is a good idea and offer a few reasons to stay away. ..Naltrexone takes away the physical craving but does nothing for the mental obsession. Alcoholics will still continue to drink even when their body tells them its not necessary. I know this because when I took this drug my cravings went away but I eventually ended up at my usual intake levels because I am an alcoholic. In the end I got a dui on this stuff about 901 days ago. ..I have talked to many alcoholics who have tried this method since I did and not a single one was able to stay sober successfully for an extended period of time. As hard as we try and as much as we seek it there is no cure for alcoholism. This I found out once and for all due to this drug. ..My advice and experience to those thinking of doing this method is that there is no magic pill that will cure you. It would be nice if there is and I have spent a lot of time looking for it but as far as alcohol goes we are fucked like chuck. :)..
It would appear that on 8/19 you had 8 drinks and on 8/23 you had 4. Does that mean you didn't have anything to drink on 8/20 8/21 and 8/22?..All of the data points have gaps. That is if I'm reading your graph correctly...FWIW I take 50mg of naltrexone daily.
If you follow the history of /u/sober_girl I believe you will find that she has tried repeatedly to obtain some sense of sobriety.  She has also failed repeatedly with bad results (I may be wrong here but it is my general memory).  If I recall correctly she was in a very bad place for a while...So she is trying something new and she appears to be taking this very seriously.  From the side bar:  "This reddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to control or stop drinking."..She does not seem flip about this process.  She is working with both a therapist and a medical doctor.  She is keeping very detailed records and sharing them with us.  And she goes out of her way in every post to warn about Triggers and state that she is not advocating this method to anyone.  ..Now I cannot see myself attempting this method in any way.  However I am certainly in no position to be critical or snide with her for her choices.  Frankly I don't think any one of us is in a position in our recovery to do that to her.  I give her a great deal of credit for making a good faith effort at improving herself and honestly sharing her progress with us.  I hope she continues to do so...Just my two cents....

Thanks for checking in again sober_girl! You know you have my support in trying to do whatever works for you. Many roads on one journey and I know you've been on a lot of them. I hope this one leads you to peace and happiness. 
/u/frozenpond made a post [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2f650l/naltrexone_my_experience_how_it_worked_and_how_it/) about their experience with the Sinclair Method.  Y'all should compare notes :)
I think she should be commended for making a great effort.  Not everyone's goal is to stop drinking entirely.  Moderation can and does occur.
