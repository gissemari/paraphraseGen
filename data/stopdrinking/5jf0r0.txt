What do you guys use for checkpoints that may indicate backsliding to a relapse? Asking as I've gotten over confident in the past and relapsed gotten down and relapsed. Learned from those times but could really use some stop lights.

I know my biggest 'stop and check yourself' lately has been just assuming I'm not going to have any problems at a social event.  I used to have an escape plan every time and an excuse/comment at the ready if I didn't feel like talking about why I wasn't drinking.  It didn't mean I would use it but I liked having it.  I've had to remind myself recently to make those plans before going to a social event and not taking for granted that it will be easy for me.
