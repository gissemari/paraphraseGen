It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** For the past week I have been having dizzy spells and a constant headache which makes me think that I'm probably going to have to have another Gamma knife procedure on my brain like I did in April. ..Gah. I don't want to because it really hurt!..**Triumph:** I am tackling difficult and scary medical issues head-on instead of just drinking myself into oblivion...**General:** Hard to believe that the summer is nearly over. Then again I am staying near the Canadian border where the summer is short -- I have already seen leaves on the trees turning red.. I once asked a local man what he and his family did during the summer and he said  Well if it falls on a weekend we try to have a picnic. .
----------immediate responses--------

**Struggle:** I don't hang out with my old buddies. I've been single for a few years. Gets lonely sometimes...**Triumph:** Went to a few AA meetings and disc golfing this weekend/week for the first time in a couple months. ..**General:** As I approach my 9th month in a row without even a sip of alcohol I'll remember to be cautious. The cravings are bad at the end of the month. 
Struggle- I'm truly trying to be mindful wherever I am in life and it seems like a struggle lately. I feel like time is going to slow and too fast at the same time. ..Triumph- I've been going to yoga almost every day recently. I also received three compliments in our weekly newsletter which is something I haven't received in a couple weeks. Another thing is I've been keeping up on my new daily healthy habits journal which is basically where I just write my triumphs for the day. ..General- it's almost time to go back to community college and almost time to get back to basketball. I'll admit I'm a little nervous for our upcoming season. I love college and I'm looking forward to seeing my friends and my favorite professors. 
struggle: I live with regular drinkers who push me to drink. I'm afraid of isolating myself because I love my family but I need some space before I can have the confidence to say no. ..triumph: I'm working on day two and starting to make the realization that I can be in control of my decisions and that I no longer have to feel like a slave to an inanimate object...general: things have been getting better and I'm optimistic for once. 
**Triumph:** I found some awesome stuff at the thrift store tonight.  I bought myself a lovely necklace that I'll wear on my two year soberversary in a couple of weeks and some much needed things for the work wardrobe.  I'm really stoked.  ..**Struggle:**  Since you mention it Mary:  Summer *is* flying by.  I feel like I've squandered it but then when I step back I haven't at all.  It's just that I don't get summer like I used to.  For years and years I had summer break and I actually didn't work.  For the past five summers that's not been the case and I am still adjusting to not having a break.   The kids are out of school but that just means more stuff to do to clean up after them and run them around etc.   I've barely been swimming or camping or anything. Sigh.  At least I know it's not because of lame ass hangovers.  Just too much work...**General:**  It's getting so thick with forest fire smoke around here that I probably won't be so sad when summer is over.  
Struggle: I'm really worried about my sweet autistic grandson starting public school. I can't stand to think of him bullied or afraid.  ..Triumph: Didn't take the bait when dealing with a toxic family member and stayed above the fray! Take that narcissistic old ass punk.  ..General: I'm stuck inside due to forest fire smoke so I guess I'll move furniture around. I miss my hikes and coffee on the porch in the cool morning air!   
Struggle: I made a decision to seriously cut back on drinking and I'm finding it hard to go anywhere at night/socialize. I just want to go home and run away from people. I feel frozen. ..Triumph: had a glass on wine last night and left it at one glass of wine. I'm really trying to find a balance that works for me. I'm not drinking tonight...General: I just feel uncomfortable and I worry that I won't be able to adjust. 
Struggle: I find myself always craving something that sets my heart on fire. I use to get the dopamine kick from alcohol. It's probably the kick I'm truly addicted to. Now that I don't have alcohol I chase other highs. Most destructively in the form of an affair. Yeah I'm that shitty of a person. ..Triumph: I'm progressing really well in terms of running sticking to my schedule of 75-90km a week not missing my training passes due to hangovers or drinking in stead of being out running. ..General: I think of alcohol several times a day and it's pissing me off quite frankly. Besides that I am alive and I praise every morning when I wake up without headache guilt diarr  and all the other ugly side affects of drinking. ..IWNDWYT  
Sorry if this is wrong spot to post this.  Didn't want to start own thread.  Opiate user clean about 7 months never has a drinking problem per say but I'd say that's changed.  Last 3 times I've drank I've binged drank way more than I intended and blacked out for considerable amounts of the evenings.  This has led to incredible anxiety over what I may/may not have done/said...I think it's time I tackle drinking as well.  Was looking for some advice on reaching out to the couple people I know I communicated with to appologize even if I don't know for what I just figure it surely to be embarrassing and hoping it wasn't anything horrible...Second looking for help finding meeting and maybe some advice finding a sponsor.  Also I occasionally smoke majiuana is that an auto-exclude from this community?  Thank you.
Struggle: I'm actually struggling to get good sleep which I was told that would get better with stopping drinking so I suppose I still have that to look forward to. There was a death in the extended family 3 weeks ago which in my family means a major family reunion at which I caught a cold from one of my baby cousins ... and I am still sick 3 weeks later. I'm getting behind at work too...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: I paid a bill tonight and phoned the tax people. Also you know I'm still not drinking! Sometimes that's triumph enough! ..&amp;#x200B;..General: Having been thinking about "work smarter not harder" and how you apply that to non-work things. Like work life balance and relationship maintanence. So ... if you have any insights into that hit me up I guess! ..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks Sfgirlmary!
**Struggle:** I'm sooooo tempted to binge drink. This Friday I poured a mostly-full bottle of whiskey that had been sitting in my fridge untouched for a few weeks down my kitchen sink. Now part of me wishes I drank it instead...I've been watching a lot of documentaries and Youtube vids about alcoholism and sobriety recently. That's helped me control my urges to drink plus thinking things like "If I drink the wrinkles under my eyes will get worse" "If I get drunk that'll be $XX I could have spent on healthy food" or "If I drink it won't do anything to me unless I get blackout #hightolerance and if I get blackout that won't be fulfilling" ...Then there's a part of me that's like "get some more whiskey and drink it all it'll be fun and there won't be any consequences. Just one small bottle on one night won't hurt" and I always entertain it for a bit before telling it to stfu...**Triumph:** I haven't been drunk or binge drank for 3.5 weeks and the last time I drank (August 11th) I only had one drink and cut myself off there. I resisted the temptation to drink any more despite having that whiskey in my fridge at the time...I'm also 2 days without caffeine. I'm feeling more tired than usual without it but I hope to keep this streak up alongside my sober streak...**General:** My life lacks real direction in most areas especially work and school. Idk wtf I want to do for those besides just being successful. I've been making progress in my personal life though. No gf but I do have kind of an fwb atm. I've also dropped a friend group that I'd only really see for drinking alcohol and having lame parties. Those thankfully weren't my only friends in this city I have other friends I see sometimes for more fulfilling things. I've been getting out of my comfort zone by deleting most of my social media especially dating apps cause I want that extra motivation to meet girls irl which I'm making progress with.
**Struggle**  I keep getting better at work and figuring how to do it but it keeps getting busier and my bosses keep adding layers of expectations. Since I started in late June almost every week has been more stressful than the last. ..**Triumph** Made it through an extremely extremely triggering week last week. Work conference where it seemed everyone was drinking in the hard drinking town of Austin TX followed by a weekend with my parents in Arlington who drive me so nuts it's unbelievable and who made (what seemed to me) judge-y remarks about being glad I had finally quit. The whole thing was challenging and I'd spent the 3 weeks prior to it dreading it so I'm pleased and proud to have made it through sober and gotten my blue 7 month star. ..**General** Yep summer coming to a close. Still no hint of the sun coming up here whereas 2 months ago it would have been getting bright by 5:20. And yeah here in MN we have a few leaves already starting to turn too. I love Fall in Minnesota though so I'm excited about it. Have a good hump day everyone. :)
Struggle:  I've realized that in many ways I've lost touch with a lot of good friends while drinking so much.  Re-cultivating said friendships and making new supportive ones may help as I feel like loneliness has been a trigger point for me lately.  It just feels hard to try to restart something that's been left on the sidelines for a while...Triumph:  I haven't had a significant urge to drink and work has been busy enough to leave me ready for bed when I get home.  Even though I am not on a good sleep schedule yet waking up earlier and sober has left me time to work on my morning routine...General: The past month has been fairly cold compared to years past.  I love fall so I don't mind the nip in the air but I wonder how this winter will be?
u/sfgirlmary I want to thank you for hosting WUW for being an awesome Mod and putting up with some challenging stuff and for being a great SBFF. I'm praying for you and hope you're not in too much pain &lt;3...**Struggle:**     I've been getting texts and calls from old friends (non-drinkers and normies). I feel so differently 2.5 years into sobriety...almost like I don't want to be in contact with them because it makes me feel like going back in time warp. Huh....**Triumph:**     I'm being a huge support to my SO. His business it going through the roof and I've assumed lots of responsibility for the house/family/etc. I enjoy being helpful and supportive to others makes me feel good :). Plus I get to cook more!...**General:**     Can't believe next weekend is Labor Day. Summer flew by! I'm one of 'those people' that already started sorting through my Fall decorations - but I won't *dare put them up yet* as that would show my true crazy lol! ;)
Oh Mary scary and painful are hard and here you are meeting them with humor and without alcohol.  Thank you for the beautiful example you provide for us. And for the amazing amount of work you do for SD. IWNDWYT..
Struggle: I'm not sure how to get out and meet people. I moved to a new country almost 2 months ago and I'm scared to make friends. My social anxiety can leave me homebound for weeks and makes me a crappy friend. ..Triumph: I love my new role. Getting a say in company processes and designing solutions is fantastic and I seem to be taking to it well. I was intimidated but now that I'm doing it it feels so natural. ..General: there's bats that fly around outside my patio at night. I really like bats. 
Struggle: in every supermarket there is alcohol and my usual path through the supermarket goes rigth in those aisles so i am confronting myself with the thing i want to avoid...And i see upcomming events dark on the horizon bc i know there will be a temptation and i wonder if i am really as strong as i feel...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: this is the longest i have not had a drink in years! 2 years ago i had a surgery and only did 2 days without alcohol and jumped right back in this feels good!..&amp;#x200B;..General: owh summer :( we had one of the best summers since years! and i missed almost all of it due to drinking and staying inside like al those years before......I try not to mourn everything i have missed in those years and only look forward to the future...But its hard it was already hurtfull when i was drinking bc i knew it was so stupid only now comes the realisation of what i have really done...I am going to get rid of all the empty bottles i have collected tonight! screw you alcohol you are not getting to me anymore!
Struggle: 41 days sober and 24 hours without nicotine. ..Triumph: 41 days sober and 24 hours without nicotine and I haven't murdered anyone (yet)...General: I can do this. The pain is temporary. The gain is lasting.
Struggle:  I've been in a transition period job/career wise for about three years.  I really am more than ready for that transition to be complete and to have the stress and uncertainty behind me rather than all around me. ...Triumph:  I renewed my unplug from the internet regimen and have successfully managed to keep myself cut off for the last seven days. (Except SD and email). I've broken the habit of compulsively checking on things then getting sucked in and wasting hours. Now I just have to resist the occasional urge to  just check on what's going on  or  kill time just for a few minutes .   I don't know how long it will last but it's very nice. ...General:  Summer HAS flown by but I am starting to look forward to fall. September and October tend to be pretty nice here. No matter how fast time goes by summers never feel short in Texas!
I had my first non-alcoholic beer yesterday and it was a really weird experience. I was so worried to even drink it in the first place thinking or hearing from others it might trigger me to want the real thing but happily it's not in fact I don't even want another one of the fake kind. I loved the cracking it open part and the first sip then after that it was gross. I only had about 5 sips and I was done. Even got a little heartburn after. Not worth drinking. I'd rather have a root beer or lemonade or soda water. ..I do realize I like that ritual of getting out a bottle opener cracking the top and taking the first sip from a bottle. There is something stress relieving about those motions. I need to find some really good root beer or ginger beer for this instead just to have that feeling and eat my salty chips with. 
Struggle: we're about to put our house on the market so life is very very tense at the moment. I'm trying to be zen and open to it all and let whatever is meant to happen happen. ..Triumph: going through all this house stuff I haven't wanted alcohol. I can see where it would fit in I've thought oh this would be where I would have had a drink but I don't want it. I can see that alcohol would bring on more stress and anxiety to the whole situation. ..General: I had my first non-alcoholic beer yesterday and it was a really weird experience. I was so worried to even drink it in the first place thinking or hearing from others it might trigger me to want the real thing but happily it's not in fact I don't even want another one of the fake kind.

Here again this morning before I set out for the day to say I will not drink with you!
**Struggle:** My husband wants me to put my business expenses into an Excel spreadsheet. This means I have to go through my purchases for the last ten months and categorize them a task that sounds equally exhausting and annoying...**Triumph:** I wrote a lot of my third novel last night and will probably finish the big finale chapter today. ..**General:** Has anyone else tried HelloFresh? (specially that service not just any meal subscription box) I got a discount code that's pretty good and I really want to branch out and try some new stuff. 
**Struggle:** So many changes this August. I received a notice from my landlord saying they would like to take over my apartment I've got a couple months to find a new place and my landlords are giving me free rent. I live in a college town and the September rental market is disheartening...Then there's some big staffing changes at work. I'm having some friendship problems that I don't know what to do about avoiding is not really an option but I'm also not ready to talk to this person/not sure if she's ready to listen. And the air quality here is very bad due to forest fires which has been limiting the amount of time I spend outside...**Triumph:** I am some how feeling pretty level headed about all of the stuff going on. Not feeling any boozy urges...**General:** Been listening to a lot of podcasts lately. Digging that Duncan Trussell Family Hour lately.
Strugle: Ive quit alcohol opiates and marijuana. Hell I even gave up coffee but now I want to quit vaping nicotine and am having a rough time with that. Its my last vice...Triumph: Im going back to college! Im really happy about that...General: im worried about my spanish class even though its only spanish 1. I took three years of h.s. spanish but that was a long time ago and this college level spanish 1 course is equivalent to two years of h.s. spanish rolled in to one semester. Im worried I wont be able to keep up.
Struggle: With having an ulcer and possibly other digestive issues I can hardly eat anything right now. I'm sick of all the food I can eat. The feeling in my stomach makes me anxious and paranoid. I'm not sleeping great so I'm tired and grumpy...Triumph: A full week without alcohol or caffeine never thought I could make it through the weekend...General: I am so thankful for the life I have and the people who are in it. I should be dead right now but instead I'm fighting daily to be the best person I can be. And for the first time I can say that honestly.
**Triumph:** After some unnecessary stress due to procrastination got a big work project off my plate and in on deadline. That's a good feeling!..**Struggle:** I'm having trouble reaching out to people. I have this internal block I can recognize but still let it keep me from taking action. Maybe the awareness is an indication that I can shorten the height...**General:** What's the difference between acceptance in the unconditional sense and forgiveness? I've learned to accept many things but I don't know if I know how to forgive.
**Struggle**: I live far away from a lot of my friends and family and when I visit I have a bad habit of going *way* overboard. Probably once a year I visit act like a fool and then spend the next year fantasizing about acting responsible for once. Then it all falls to shit when I visit. It is due to this most recent visit I am back on this sub. While I am physically feeling better the guilt and shame is incredibly difficult to shake. Usually lasts a month...**Triumph:** I've taken a few more additional steps this time around. I got This Naked Mind on audible got an I am Sober app all that good stuff. I'm three days in and would rather eat roadkill then smell alcohol. ..**General:** Fall is often a difficult month for me. A lot of Oktoberfests in the area. I own lederhosen. Prior to my lapse I had been practicing my stein-holding for the masskrugstemmen. My wife who is very supportive (and is truly a one glass of wine a year drinker) was shocked I didn't want to attend any. But I think it is too much temptation. 
Oh Mary I'm so sorry to hear about your health issue coming back! . That's scary stuff.  Sending you lots of strength.  I really appreciate that you're sharing this with us and that you're showing us all how to handle the hard stuff sober.  ..**Struggle:**  Just the usual trying to handle my easily triggered emotions with grace and contemplation instead of acting on them.  Easier said than done.  And frustration with the never-ending house projects that inevitably take 3x the amount of time and money that I thought.  Wish I had the $ to just pay someone to do the work instead of trying to figure this stuff out from scratch...**Triumph:**  We finished the xeriscaped flagstone pathway and added in another walkway cutting way back on the weeds and general ugliness of the yard.  And GF is going to be making cool planter boxes out of reclaimed wood to line the new walkway.  Huzzah!..**General:**  As part of recovery and just general spiritual education I am trying to learn how to let go of emotional disturbances when they arise instead of clinging to them and creating blockages to my energy and joyfulness.  The book I'm reading basically says "when you feel this emotional reaction arise just relax and release it before it can get stuck."  I need a much more specific "releasing emotional triggers for dummies" book!
Struggle:  just spent a week at the beach and drank some rum. I'm taking naltrexone and doing tsm but apparently the hard liquor triggered me and yesterday I blacked out. ..Triumph: I woke up this morning hungover for the first time in a long time which reminded me of the times I woke up hungover every day. Really motivates me to continue my recovery. That's no way to live your life. ..General:  the kids go back to school next week so I'll spend the rest of their summer break soaking up every moment with them. 
**Struggle:** I recently started birth control to level out my postpartum hormones and it dried up my milk supply rapidly so after 11 months I can no longer breast feed and I feel a profound sadness and void (I wanted to bf for one year but the hormones needed fixing asap. Also: I never breastfed after having wine.)..**Triumph:** I've been sober for eight days and while my son was very sick over the weekend it was absolutely easy for me to get up in the middle of the night and comfort him for as long as he needed. I almost looked forward to being able to do that (almost). Drunk me would have slept through it and left my husband to deal with it. ..**General:** I had raw chicken all over my hands while making dinner the other night and I needed some more cheese from the fridge. I called to my husband who was down the hall with our son "I need you!" and he called back "I need you to Love. Always and forever!" That goober. It still makes me laugh. 
**Triumph:** I'm doing well on eating healthy this week!..**Struggle:** I've been tired and distracted a lot plus I'm in a rut at work. Not great but I can at least do something about being tired (going to bed earlier to start)...**General:** I'm so excited for fall! Cooler weather = better climbing
Struggle: It's my second day...Triumph: It's my second day!
Struggle:  The absence of booze has led me to be more indulgent in other areas mainly my vaping habit. It's been tempting to distract myself by pushing this other source of stimulation...Triumph:  I've found a couple of alternative activities that I think will help keep me centered in the evening (when I'm most tempted). Broke out the old violin and got a new archery target for range shooting. These are things I could never do while intoxicated so they're kind of doubling as a reward!..General: Been reading a great book called "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhogg. It's a thesis about the internal mechanics that drive both addiction as well as the habits of some really successful people. Definitely recommend!
Struggle: I've been feeling light headed and out of it periodically due to naltrexone. It's also been hard to abstain at times. ..Triumph: getting a lot done! I've followed through on everything I said I was going to accomplish ..General: I feel good. I didn't realize I could wake up feeling energized in the mornings. I'm tired by the evening but I'm more disciplined than I thought.
Hope it's nothing serious u/sfgirlmary...&amp;#x200B;..**Stuggle**: I am still battling motivation. Tailend of jet lag isn't helping. Putting off some major stuff has made it snowball and I such bad anxiety which just makes me freeze up. Also I'm craving cigarettes a bit after a weekend of smoking...**Triumph**: Feel really positive and light-hearted for some reason. I belly laugh with my boyfriend a lot and it feels good. Even when I don't exercise like today I don't feel as bad physically as I used to when I was drinking. (Still going to stretch before I get into bed tonight though. My skin is glowing (touch wood) ! I'm so glad I having been taking care of myself and all my skin nerdery has been paying off...&amp;#x200B;..General: I'm sad summer is going to end soon but some cooler weather will be good. I'm adding some planning/reflection/brainstorming time to my daily routine in September. I feel like that's what has been missing...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: I feel my feelings and I hate it. All I want in life right now is a gallon of orange flavored vodka shitty horror movies and disgustingly cheesy pizza. And no consequences. ..Triumph: I know that's not possible. So I'm just sitting here eating frozen fruit thinking about cleaning instead. ..General: I keep feeling my feelings and I hate it. I don't want to be drunk but I don't want to be sober either. But hey I've lost ~35lb from my highest known weight this year. 20lb since I last reset my flair. That's cool. 
My husband has decided to try to cut back because I've inspired him. He just told me he cut back to 8 beers last night (from 10-12 regularly) and is ready to try 7 tonight. He said he likes waking up not hungover. 
Struggle:  Its the first week that everyones back at college almost.  Between learning disabilities a concussion in my high school years and mental health issues causing me to withdraw from college on multiple occasions  Its just been a weird week of mental wrestling coming to terms with what happened and where to go from here.  I won't ever give up my higher education pursuit nor the pursuit of bettering my mental health(been in therapy since the start of the summer which has been a tremendous help.)..Triumph:  I went on another incredible mountain bike ride last week.  I hit the trail super hard earlier in the summer but its been either too damn hot or too smokey  but getting on the trail at least once a week is a highlight.  On top of therapy physical therapy and other stuff  the desire to drink has been going away almost everyday in small increments.  I still cant believe its been over a month and some change.  Its been a tremendously positive impact...General:  Met a girl and we've been growing and getting much closer day by day..  I know dating isn't entirey suggested when dealing with all the stuff that I mentioned  but she makes me feel alive and we both make each other feel amazing.  Its strange but also sort of a blessing in a way.  
**S:**  Several.  My back has been bothering me a lot.  Puppy.  Daughter is already half through her second week.  I've got a lot...**T:**  No puppy accidents this week.  So that's good...**G:**  This is my favorite time of year so I'm going to enjoy it.  I missed the whole damn summer from studying and driving.  
Struggle: My temper is pretty bad. People ARE often idiots but it isn't my personal responsibility to inform each one of them what they're doing wrong. Sometimes (often) I can be an idiot too like when I'm stumbling around in a sober brain fog. I have to learn to relax a LOT and just let the small things go. People are just people. ..Triumph: Last week I was curious how many push ups I could do. I used to be fairly fit now I'm super fat. The answer was barely one. I've been doing them every day since and today I did 10. Better than barely one. ..General: I'm in slight mourning because I feel like I'm really finally done with drinking. It's a bittersweet feeling which I know is illogical. Unless you're an alcoholic which I am. I'm sad to get exactly what I want. I'm filling my time and sticking with sobriety in spite of my erratic emotions. 
**Struggle:** What am I doing with my life? What do I want to do with my life? How do I accomplish that? Oh shit better question: where are my car keys?!?! ---- priorities..**Triumph:** Haven't drank in a few days back on SD I have been productive these last few days and I am trying (and actually acting on) cleansing my life of things that aren't positive or productive. I have done some art gave attention to my poor neglected plants and looking forward to going to a meeting Friday...**General:** I live in Florida... it is alllwwaayyyssss summer. So if anyone would like to trade I am down. Warning: Our seasons are hot hot hotter and hurricane. ...[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
**Struggle**: I've been feeling a bit down the last couple of days. I think I just need to spend my evenings more productively and also I've been feeling ill I don't know. I'm hoping it passes. ..**Triumph**: being able to spend time with my nieces sober and being able to make commitments to them I can keep because I'm not worried about drinking or being hungover. And throughly enjoying a movie with them. (*Christopher Robin*)..**General**: I dunno. I'm proud of this sobriety thing but am feeling bored and a bit blah. Therapy tomorrow and work the next few days and seeing my boyfriend so that should be good - and holiday next week! 
**Struggle:** My wife's father was vocal many years ago that his 2 adult children 'owe him' and that he was going to 'lean' on them when he retired.  He and his now deceased wife chose an extremely hot place to retire (as it was very affordable) so for the past 20 plus years they have been coming up for extended stays to escape the heat during the Summer months (but also many holidays as well)...It's put a strain on our marriage and our sanity.  And my drinking and outbursts of rage tended to increase the longer they were around (not an excuse and I wish I had just not tried to escape with booze)...Now he is too old to live on his own so he's either living with us or his son's family full time (we take turns usually for 2 to 3 month stints).  He's been a big trigger for me in many ways other than drinking as I was raised by a 'world class' narcissist.   ..**Triumph:**  It was a big drunken (on my part) blowup with him a year ago that led me to stop drinking.  He has been living with us all Summer again this year and not only have I not fallen back into drinking I have actually been damn patient and mostly very kind towards him (even though he can be a pain in the butt).  This has also helped me in dealing with my own father who continues to do his narc thing...**General:** Our giant Tulip Magnolia tree just started losing some leaves so Fall must not be too far off. 
Goodnight. Another day done!
S: Still feeling not so great about being broken up with due to my recent relapse and I'm still feeling a hangover three days later. ..T: I'm finally working the program! I went to AA and it was welcoming and amazing. I'm going again today. ..G: I am really getting my mental health in check. I feel really proud to be apart of the sober community. 
**Struggle:** It's just too much.  I am working on a huge presentation I must give and defend on Monday.  I'm overly slammed with chart notes from my busy days at work.  I have another project due Saturday that I haven't even started.  I can't see how there are enough hours in the day.  I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead?..**Triumph:**  Once I do get past Monday I'll have completed a chapter of my life I have been working on for a year...**General:**  I am craving oven baked French fries and a long nap.  Well I can have one of those.  
Struggle: My sleep still isn't back to normal but the other withdrawal symptoms like shakiness and extreme anxiety have pretty much gone...Triumph: I actually picked up and organized my home gym today. Not only that but I cleared away the cobwebs and USED it! ..General: Really loving Allen Carrs book Easy Way to Control Alcohol it's helping me big time  in changing the way I view alcohol.
**Struggle**: Patience.  Waiting to hear if I make it into the third (final?) round for a job I've applied for.  And...frustration with the organization I'm with now...**Triumph**: I'm actually not getting too spun up about the above; taking it fairly philosophically.  That's a triumph -- staying present and not riding the roller coaster of emotions (too much) AROUND IT...**General**: The forest fires have been awful and the air where I live has stayed in the "unhealthy" to "hazardous" levels for weeks.  I'm going to try to get away from it a bit higher in the mountains this weekend but it seems to be everywhere.  Not much of a fun summer out west here.
