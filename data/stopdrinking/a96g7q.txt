I got an OVI this weekend after flirting with this kind of crap for far too long. I blew a .113 and have court on Thursday. I'm so ashamed and nervous but honestly it's about fucking time. Idk why I needed this to wake me up but here we are...I peruse this sub often but still struggle finding a real life sober community. I would love to hear both sides of the AA experience. I know a lot of people here swear by them but does anyone have any negative experiences?..Thanks for being such a great group.

I don't have a negative experience but I never felt like it was for me. I've never been. BUT lots of people I respect swear by it. I go to Refuge Recovery meetings and those are awesome.
There are many paths of sobriety. I've tried many over the years.  By the time AA was suggested to me I wanted to quit drinking I identify with the disease model of alcoholism of AA.  I was familiar with using  spiritual  practices for other diseases.  I wanted the sobriety joy and happiness I saw in the rooms of AA.  I stuck close to the group read  the book asked a million questions and got into action on the steps. And I'm still an atheist but I have a much more humble and reality based perspective on my own capacities and limits.  There is hope for all.
