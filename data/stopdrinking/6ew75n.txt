I quit cold turkey a few days ago got tired of feeling and looking like shit and I was tired of pissing my money away. The hard part has been getting through the night without grabbing my keys and buying beer somewhere. I try to keep myself occupied but the thoughts still linger gnawing at me as I trying to focus on a game or something. It's rough I want to make this work. I've tried so many times to quit in the past and it usually ends with me being bored and relapsing. How can I get past this? What should I do to keep my mind off drinking?

Time is a key buddy. You're not the only one having same thoughts. For instance... me. But close to 60 days it's well well easier. Time solves a lot of that. But to get to the point you can finally start thinking about something else than drinking you need to invest the time. It's fucking worth it. 
Replace your unhealthy addiction with a healthy one like exercising or some hobby you enjoy. (If you don't have one you now have time to find one.) whenever you feel the urge to drink do the ladder instead and eventually the thing you replaced drinking with will be the thing you start having the urges to do.
