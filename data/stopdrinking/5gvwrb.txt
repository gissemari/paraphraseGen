Hey folks..I just had to sent a difficult text that gave me some heartache and made me turn to SD. There's a woman I was seeing for casual sex and had to tell that we better stop doing so. When we met on the weekend she told me that she both had sex with some other people and also regularly sees a guy that I know. Immediately I was really sad but also stayed calm to tell her that that's not my cup of tea right now...What I also realized but probably don't need to tell her is that whenever I talked to friends about her I was lamenting how she was much younger than me partying a lot living with people who party a lot drinks quite a bit... I mean we met at a party where I was stone cold sober and she was a little drunk yet I liked to make out with her and she wanted to go home with me. On the way she came up with the topic of drugs (I guess because I said I was sober) and I immediately felt a little more empty inside. Nevertheless the sex was great the three times we saw each other again. ..Yet what I realize is that I think I can't trust anyone that much who is partying like I did in the past. She might well be but that is not for me to fix and obviously not really what I want...Arguably I came here with quite a knot in my stomach because this kind of insights suck in a way. When I saw the nice and round number 800 next to my name which prompted me to write it down instead of keeping it bugging me. Maybe it is of help to some who are struggling and it certainly takes my mind off things. ..Let me just briefly finish with a few great things that I achieved because I got sober. Among the latest is turning 25 and celebrating without alcohol. Even though I had a party where it was mostly my roomates and their friends I realized that I rather would have wanted to have a small gathering in restaurant with my close friends many of whom couldnt come that night. Yet we had a good evening danced and laughed and the most important thing: I stayed sober...I also managed to write my final bachelor's thesis which at times caused me a huge fucking deal of anxiety stress and even suicidal thoughts in turn leading me to SD and counseling at university. Turns out it got graded with 10/10 and my supervisor is publishing a part of it with me in a journal. Just now when I started writing this text here I got a confirmation that we can also write a book chapter for another print publication that we applied for together. Even though going back to my work after it was done felt horrible I now enjoy the fruits of my labor and also enjoy the close contact with my supervisor. ..Last thing: I also celebrated my birthday another time with my mother since our birthdays are only few days apart. After all relatives were gone I sat her down and took the courage to talk about a taboo that was haunting me forever. Long story short when my parents split up my mum got depressed and started drinking trying to hide it from me. At one point I found her in the kitchen with a knife attempting to kill herself. Though it wasn't  that serious as she is still around (and doing better) I am still stuck with that image and we never addressed it. Now my mum broke out in tears and told me that she suffers also from the silence and offered me to keep the dialogue about it running...Thanks guys for giving me the space to draw this out a little bit maybe it is of help as well. Either way thank you for reading and stay sober!

Wow - what an amazing list of things you have done lately now that you are sober.  Even after a year sober for me life is still hard - but having the space to deal with the hard stuff is such a blessing for me and sounds like it is for you too.  ..Congratulations on breaking things off - it sounds like it was the right choice.  I'm happy to be sober with you today!
Wow this is coming from a stranger but I'm proud of you for everything you've accomplished. 800 days is incredible. It must feel like so long ago to look back on who you were almost as if it's another person because you have so much to be proud of today. That's great you were able to talk to your family about things that have remained unsaid for so long. That is something that just the thought terrifies me to this day. .Good call on letting her down and breaking it off. Whatever is best for you right now is what you have to do and it's good you broke things off while it was still somewhat early. It sounds like you have a support system and things to look forward to. For that you are lucky. .Lastly I hope things continue to go well for you. Again you have so much to be proud of. Part of me is a little jealous because that type of contentment and pride is something that doesn't even feel remotely possible. But I hope things continue to go great for you.
