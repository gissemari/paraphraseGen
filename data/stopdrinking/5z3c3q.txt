Hi everyone ..So I just got home from spring break- spent a week in Disney World with my parents boyfriend sister her husband and my nephews. It was beautiful so much fun and an escape I really needed from my last semester in college the anxieties of finding a job for when I graduate complete all of my last courses... ..But I relapsed. I feel so guilty writing this because I was so excited and so ready to quit drinking. I was only five days into my very first attempt so part of me thinks I should have known trying to go sober less than a week before vacation was a little naive but here I am. Feeling like garbage up way too late the night before classes start again feeling shame and nausea from a week bender. ..I wish I could say I even was able to moderate drinking this week but I didn't. I drank heavily almost every single night felt like hell all day at the parks with my nephews and repeated that cycle the past seven days. I still had fun but looking back on how much time I wasted feeling like crap drinking to get rid of the feeling etc while on vacation only strengthens my resolve... So much money and time spent so much of it wasted on alcohol. ..So here is my confession and badge reset post. I'm ready to get back on the wagon and give this another shot. Not drinking with you all tonight.
