This is the longest I've gone in 10 years at least. I've never felt better. For the entire period I've bicycled to work exercised eaten right...However it hasn't been easy. I still have some of the same feelings that had once led to me drinking. It hasn't been easy to reconcile my behavior and actions...Thanks to everyone on this sub and on IRC #stopdrinking. I haven't missed a day there and on many occasions just talking about nothing on that channel has prevented a relapse.

Congratulations man. I too am dealing with a lot of feelings that I would dull/amplify with my alcohol abuse. It's not going to be an overnight revelation or epiphany but I am really REALLY trying to be more mindful of my shortcomings (emotional vampirism abusive tendencies general "not giving a shit about stuff") and am continuing to work through them. ../r/stopdrinking has been a great resource and support to me as well. I can only hope that I can continue to heal and grow the relationships with those who love and care about me and be grateful and accepting of the forgiveness that comes with it...Once again congrats.
Thanks for sharing pudding!  Glad you're here and in the webchat (see the sidebar for those that don't know what IRC/webchat is).
