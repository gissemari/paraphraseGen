My relationship with alcohol has been something that I've struggled with for a while now. I definitely abuse it sometimes heavily; I've had my share of blackouts though fortunately nothing bad has ever happened as a result...My lack of anything resembling discipline or self-control went out the window after I left my full-time 60-hour-a-week job to go back to graduate school full time because I could phone my work in and still pass--and the drinking became so habitual that I just stopped thinking about it after a while not noticing that I was putting on weight and losing interest in other things. After I finished school and got back out on my own again things didn't improve--I landed in an extremely small extremely rural extremely boring town where the liquor store-to-person ratio is (not kidding) 1 store for every 550 people. The habit I had created for myself didn't get any better because I'd figured out when it was okay to drink--mainly to kill time between workdays. Not a good place to be in...I've never been chemically or physically addicted to alcohol; it's always been more of a habitual psychological dependence. I can (and do) go days or weeks at a time without drinking (e.g. while I was at my parents' house over the Christmas holidays--they're teetotalers which meant no booze in the house) and I don't have any withdrawal symptoms... aside sometimes from being incredibly bored...I think my motivation to cut back significantly really has to do more with the weight gain than anything else mainly because (a) I'm not getting any younger and (b) I'd like to pursue a long-term relationship but I'm self-aware enough to know that I have to take better care of myself and start respecting myself more fully before someone else is going to do the same...So... Day 2 is now wrapping up and Day 3 will be here very soon. I've set an initial goal of a week since on Monday I have to go to get bloodwork done for a routine physical. My hope is that the lack of booze in my system (coupled with the actual exercise I've started doing!) should result in my blood counts being better than last time around. Maybe it's not the purest of motivations but it's something--and something is better than nothing.

Going back to school in 2011 is what turned my 4 beers a night habit into a 1-2 bottles of wine a night habit. The irregular schedule and the ability to basically be drunk all the time and still pass was like throwing gasoline on the slow burning alcoholic fire that had been my life up to that point.
I too used to drink out of boredom and ended up creating a habit for myself I ended up not wanting. On my own personal journey towards a more peaceful state of mind I've come to find boredom is a creation of our mind in order to take us out of the moment. We've allowed ourselves to become far too wired for stimulation and instant gratification from a bombardment of imagery. We may be advanced creatures but it wasn't all too long ago in relativity we were just like every other animal. And many of our traits from that time have followed us. My point being with all this is that we all need to find something to block out the constant noise from the outside and start looking within to find a way to accept this current moment and not run away from it with drugs or alcohol. ..Has it been difficult for me? Absolutely but I get better everyday and I've done so by accepting the current moment and not letting myself fall into the mind traps of boredom and waiting. (as much as possible at least I am by no means perfect at anything) Anyways there's obviously more to it and idk if this will help you but your post gave me a vibe that says youre bored of things. Picking up hobbies is great for boredom too. Good luck on your journey!
