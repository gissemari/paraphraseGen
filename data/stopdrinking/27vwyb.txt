So in the past few months I've had a habit of hanging out with a few different guys hitting up bars etc. drinking and having sex. It turned into a cycle that I was somewhat complacent in. Yesterday I was 3 days into being sober and had plans to go out with this guy and I knew it was going to be hard to not drink so I started rationalizing (I'll only drink beer etc.). He ended up bailing on me.    ... Sometimes I have to relax take a look around and understand that maybe sometimes the universe is looking out for me.    This sub has helped too even in only a few days. I struggle with reaching out for help so this is good for me.

Good deal /u/goldzounds -- yeah my alkie-mind in early sobriety was my worst enemy and your tale of the busted-up plans demonstrates just how subtle cunning baffling and powerful it is in setting up relapse.  Good work: remember: dry people dry places in early sobriety!
