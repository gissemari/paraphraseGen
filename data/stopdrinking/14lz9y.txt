After relapsing this weekend and spending an entire 3 days drunk I am going to my first meeting. ...I'm super nervous and I just found out that I have a friend who attends meetings at the same church....Now I just have to woman up and go in. My brain is telling me that I don't know where I'm going because I've never been here so I should just leave.

Get your butt in there! You are not going to regret it I promise. Report back ok?
Get in there.  It'll be a good experience and could be the start of your wonderful new life.
When you go inside the hardest thing you'll ever do in AA will be over. Its all up hill from here. You'll find out the problem and they will help you with the solution. Can't fix a problem if you done know what it is. I had no idea what was wrong with me at my frist meeting. Now I do and the obcession has been lifted. Please go inside.
I hope you made it in. If not don't give up try again!
im glad you had a good experience. it took a lot for you to walk in there! the hardest meeting is over with they get easier as time goes by. once again congratulations
The next thing is to go to another meeting. Sooner or later you will hear someone tell your story.  Be open identify don't compare.  One day at a time you will be amazed.
