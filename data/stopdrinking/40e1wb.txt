One month ago today I had my last drink. It's been a surprisingly easier ride than I thought it would be & I'm happy I've made it this far after two plus years of drinking everyday. I replaced my alcohol drinking with tea & it's helped a lot with keeping my mind off of alcohol. This place gives me a lot of hope & inspires me to keep on going even when it's tough. I know I'm not alone in my struggle & I thank you all for the positive words & constant encouragement! I will not drink today! :-)
