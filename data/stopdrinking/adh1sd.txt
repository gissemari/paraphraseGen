I really want to be sober for my own personal and spiritual growth. I've always loved alcohol but I started to really struggle after giving birth to my second child when postpartum depression hit. I quit for 3 months while on Wellbutrin and it was *awesome* but once I stopped the meds I started drinking again. I'll binge drink maybe twice a week after work. ..I can usually make it to day 4 and then give in. I'm really afraid of failing this time around but I'm sick of struggling with simultaneously loving and hating alcohol. I really want this time to be it. Wish me luck

Welcome.  What's the plan?  ..Have you considered AA or Smart?  Some formal meditation or therapy maybe back on meds if a doctor concurs?
You can do this!!!! 
I read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace and it made quitting a much easier transition.  It reshaped my thoughts about alcohol and changed my life.
