Hey. Motivated to post as recently got sober but hit a bit of a lull so wanted to share my experience just for a bit of catharsis and bit of perspective from other people...I got sober about five and a half months ago after realising that id spent 4 months just sliding deeper and deeper into drinking after my relationship of five years ended. I finally accepted that will power wasn't the answer and that I had a problem. I found the first couple of months amazing lost a load of weight felt a lot calmer and happier in myself.  I did struggle a bit with things I couldn't do now I didn't drink so The choosing to avoid a work social because its at a beer festival because I don't feel comfortable or having to explain to people that I don't care if they drink. I guess at the moment I'm just feeling more of a sense of loss. I also recently started dating somebody for the first time since my break up and that I think is bringing up a bit of a sense of loss over my old relationship. The idea of a beer felt appealing for the first time in a while this week and I've been drinking a bit more non alcoholic beer and the frequency of that seems to be creeping up. So thats where I'm at.

After drinking some NA beer myself last week I found it somewhat triggering. Is there another drink that you enjoy you could perhaps switch to? That might help reduce your cravings? It did for me. 
So.. romanticizing drinking again?  Or wishing for a sense of your old lifestyle just without the bad parts resulting from the drinking?  If you're getting bored or feeling like today is less full than you would like maybe it's time to focus on building new connections hobbies and a lifestyle that's more You?
