[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..----------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I spent the day with my bother and his girlfriend. We had lunch at a Vietnamese place in the Tenderloin then went out to the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park and walked around looking at the pagodas and bridges. It was a clear day and the sunlight shone through the red Japanese maple leaves and it was really beautiful. I realized only later that it was a day I couldn't have had if I were still drinking because I didn't go out. Or else I would have gone with a bottle of booze in my purse drinking in the bathroom and fooling no one.. .**Struggle:** I am spending much less money than I used to but I still have credit card debt I racked up as a drinker. How in the world did I ever think that living beyond my means was okay?..**General:** The day after Thanksgiving is the busiest day of the year for plumbers in this country according to Roto-Rooter (the nation's largest plumbing service). Apparently it's normal for household guests to overwhelm the system with extra flushes after the big meal. In addition  Virtually every traditional Thanksgiving dish is a supreme drain clog culprit  according to a Roto-Rooter spokesperson...**Have a Happy Thanksgiving everyone and don't overwhelm the plumbing!**.
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I'm still going even though I've been in a few situations where other people have been drinking and even offered me a drink...Struggle: I have so much work right now and also so many other things to do...General: I'm a bit nervous of telling people I don't drink any more because they might figure out I used to drink a lot.

**Triumph:** I got a very good reference from one of my clients yesterday that I can use as a testimonial to my services too. There's no way they would have written what they did if I still had my drinking head on. We were introduced in February this year. Although we've never been in a situation where we could have been drinking they only know me as a non-drinker (even if they don't realise it)...**Struggle:** I'm feeling a little bit of overwhelm at present I've a long mental list of professional things I'd like to achieve and struggling to prioritise the tasks...**General:** My own plumbing behaves in quite a different way in sobriety to how it did as a drinker.
Triumph: still feeling positive and not beating myself up about not being able to drink like a normal person. I feel like this time it's going to stick. This is the longest I've been sober in three years and I don't hate everything!..Struggle: brain fog is effecting my job and it's really irritating. But sober me isn't freaking out just dealing with it the best I can until I can be more on point. ..Musing: is it possible that when you quit drinking everyone around you can sense it and therefore ramps up their alcohol conversations by 150%?  No. you're just more attuned to it. Keep it moving sunshine. ..Not drinking with you all today!  :)
**Triumph:** Went to dinner with friends last night. It was several hours of loud laughter. The other guys all went through the same therapeutic community serving their last couple years of prison time in an addiction rehab. I didn't but while an outsider I'm not that different. They accept me...**Struggle:** I'm not good at finding gifts for folks. My wife's birthday is coming up and I'm struggling to find the right kind of special thing. She also places much greater importance on birthdays than I do. I'm worried that whatever I do will be a disappointment...**General:** We're taking a little family vacation. Won't be clogging our pipes. Not even sure if we'll have a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving since only 1 restaurant is open in the little town we're in and turkey isn't part of their menu.
Triumph: I made it to two weeks!..Struggle: I over shared earlier this week. Thank you for the support r/stopdrinking..General: I got off work early yesterday. Did a five mile rule and am still riding an endorphin high. Is it possible my drinking way blocking my runners high? I used to always get them.
Triumph: 5 months tomorrow! Sometimes it seems like just yesterday when I woke up on a Sunday morning to drink a warm beer on the patio left out from the night before as I tried to piece together the blurry events of the previous evening. I decided it was too much to face and spent the day drinking away the shame. Then again it doesn't seem like yesterday at all time is a funny thing and I've come so far from the person I was five months ago. ..Struggle: I was woken this morning to the sound of ice cubes hitting the glass as Captain Morgan fixed himself a drink. And why not his long holiday weekend started when he got off work at 5 am.  Despite how thrilled I am for my impending milestone days like today have me thinking; if I had just kept things from getting so out of control I could be fixing myself a drink when I get off work this afternoon also. But it don't work that way not for me and I like who I am now too much to go back there. ..General: I don't usually discuss pooping but since Notorious SFG brought up plumbing here it is... So most people here can probably relate to how nice it is to have normal movements when you quit drinking. It was something I was pretty happy about after years of liquid awfulness almost daily. But then about two weeks after not drinking I went vegan. I tell you it's like next level pooping. I won't go into detail but who knew it could be so great.
See you Sunday night!
Triumphs: didn't drink yesterday didn't want to..Struggle: wife hates my guts worried family will see me as weak over Thanksgiving and not want to drink around me..2 down just ready to fast forward to 21+. I know I will do this but I'd like to have shown the people who care already..C'est la vie I will not drink with any of you today. 
Triumph:  Had a talk with the wife about how I'm feeling about us and what needs to change (she has zero libido) and she agreed to go see a doctor about it finally.  ..Struggle:  I keep thinking about drinking again.  I've got one friend that I haven't seen since I've stopped he was my go-to get hammered pal. I miss him and from what I've gathered with talking to him is he's embarrassed to hang out around sober me because he knows he'll get super drunk and be annoying.  I commend him for that at least. ..General:  I'm looking forward to seeing the fam tomorrow luckily the only one that really drinks out the bunch is my sister and she doesn't get stupid drunk during family stuff.  I have a feeling I'll get a call tonight seeing if I want to go hang out at a bar I might (not drinking of course) who knows we'll see.  
I'm on mobile so hopefully this formats correctly....Triumph: This is my fourth day of not drinking and the longest I've gone without a drink in 5 years. I'm super proud of myself for not drinking....Struggle: While super proud of not drinking I'm still ashamed of the events that brought me here. If I didn't fuck up so bad last weekend I would never have had the guts to quit. Sober thoughts about drunken shit shows amped up my cravings last night but thankfully I kept myself occupied and didn't pick up a drink....General: My house should be relatively safe this Friday as it is just me my girlfriend and my brother and we're not hosting anyone.
**Triumph**: Last weekend my bf went to a big drinking event with some mutual friends of ours. I really thought I'd have extreme FOMO but I just didn't. I didn't feel like I missed out on anything! This was a big win for me. ..**Struggle**: I injured my Achilles and have to rest for a while meaning I can't run and I love running!..**General**: Found out I can go to the cinema for  3.50 on a Tuesday close to me. I love films. I will pretty much go there every Tuesday.
Triumph: Bronchitis getting better and I'm getting my energy back. Even though I couldn't exercise I meditated every night. I'm up to 11 nights and I think this is becoming a habit...Struggle: I realized this week that I don't know one single adult who doesn't drink. Well there might be coworkers who secretly don't drink but we drink enough at work functions that I feel like drinking me would have sniffed them out...General: I'm at work and the office is empty. It occurs to me that we should all get one day off a year to read books. Yes I know I had personal days and I probably spent them hungover. That's hardly the point. :)
**Triumph:** I am alive and kicking...**Stuggle:** Staying alive and kicking...**General:** I had no problem blowing $30 or even $100 to get fkd up but spending $10 on tampons I think is ridiculous lol. I didn't ask for pissed off ovaries and all the joys of being female why punish me more financially?!
Triumph: I made it through the first half of the move and selling the house sans drinking. So much stress but it wouldn't have gone nearly as well as it did had I been drinking. ..Struggle: #1: leaving on an international vacation tomorrow with my husband for a week. He's been very supportive and I'm not too worried about being tempted to drink but I'm weirdly sad that I'll miss out on tasting some of the regional specialities. I shouldn't be but I am. #2: Struggling with some emotions that are coming up been spending a lot of time with a close friend who is also sober and sometimes we overshare and it feels too close (danger territory!). Trying to maintain my friendship and distance myself enough to where we can maintain our relationship without damaging relationships with others. Feelings and adulting are hard yo! Especially when in the past I wouldn't have been clear-headed enough to make the correct choice with regard to affecting others...General: I think I've stressed myself out enough that my ulcer is back. I really gotta find more time for myself and managing stress. Also I'm going to miss eating stuffing tomorrow. Totally going to make some when I get back in December. Nom nom nom.
Hey Notorious SFG! The Tea Garden sounds amazing!..Triumph:  Went to Benihana last night with my family for my nephew's 7th birthday. The last time I went there was about 2 years ago and all I remember from that night is drinking too much sake (the chef's used to fill empty squeeze bottles with sake and squirt it into patron's mouths from over the grill...yes crazy). And I'd go to the bar early for pre-game so yea...I was very drunk. Last night I felt a little twinge about not having sake and thankfully I was with my non-drinking family and the chef's don't do the sake thing anymore. I felt relieved and made it through. But DAMN those thoughts still linger!..Struggle:   I'm not sure if I'm starting to isolate but I've been finding it difficult to go out. I'll do shopping errands etc. but when it comes to going out for lunch/dinner or even just for coffee I don't want to go. Maybe I'm feeling the effects of darkness and bitter cold at only 4:30PM these days??..General:   I have an herbal tea that I drink every single night that keeps me 'cleansed' and regular. Keeps me on schedule lol :). 
**Triumph:** I realized recently that I'm not as anti-social/introverted as I thought I was. When I'm consistently sober I find going out and seeing people during the day much easier. When I'm drinking I just want to be left the hell alone where as I thought it was a personality trait...**Struggle:** Relapsed last night mildly hungover today I feel bad about myself and I look like shit when I have a dinner to go to. ..**General:** I'm going to take a hangover nap hopefully my last one ever!! 
Triumph: I scheduled body work next week with a friend which is a huge treat I have not had in a looonnnggg time. Also triumph:  I joined a rock climbing gym and am finally getting upper body strength for the first rime in my life!  I feel like such  a bad ass! ...Struggle: I have not had REM sleep in several days. I never set  'new years resolutions' but I think I am going to resolve to take up my tai chi practice again and I think I am going to start before new years. The daily practice alleviated so much of my discomfort my first two years sober and I really want to start again. ..General: the holidays are always tough I am going to another sober friend's house for thanksgiving. Their family is great last time I was there I played cards against humanity with her 75 year old grandmother who understood what every word on the card meant.... priceless. Other than that I gotta remind myself to practice extra self care right this time of year which should be easy since I always make extra tips at work! I plan on baking for holiday gifts and am going to try To shop as local as I can. OH- if you haven't heard already several state parks in california give out free passes on black Friday to encourage us to get outdoors!! I believe a couple other states participate too added in the second link! Happy turkey (or tofurkey) day!! ..http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/21/free-state-parks-passes-running-out-for-california-green-friday/..http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/16/free-admission-to-116-california-state-parks-on-friday-after-thanksgiving/..
T:  I'm not drinking today.  I'm not planning on drinking today.  I'm not worried about what I will be drinking today or tomorrow. ..S:  My life is in absolute chaos.  Finding any order  is very difficult. ..G:  Big Thanksgiving parties equals a good chance septic tank overflows.  Dealing with a full overflowing septic tank with a massive hangover is absolutely horrible.  
Triumph: had my 30 day review at the new job today and I got a 50 cent/hour raise! Totally unexpected but they said they're really happy with me. I know I have my sobriety to thank for this. When I was drinking I was unmotivated. Also there's no way I'd be able to get home from job A at 11 pm and wake up for job B at 5:30 am with a hangover...Struggle: I have been feeling depressed lately but I know I can get through it. ..General: got off work early today and I'm ready to spend most of the night cooking and baking. :)
I fucked up. I had 33 days then.. Something happened.. Not sure if It's denial or whatever but l dont think l was fully aware of what l was doing just boom 4 day bender SO says she wants to leave me yeah l fucked up...I am so fucking sick of being me.
**Triumphs:** Not having T-day at my house but the house is clean anyway.  I start my new job on Monday.  I've had some great retail therapy to buy clothes for my new job because I've lost 65# since I quit drinking and none of my professional clothes fit!..**Struggle:** My son is not coming home for Thanksgiving for the first time ever *and* he's at his girlfriend's.  I refuse to be like my own MIL who resented me taking her place in her son's life but I miss my boy.  I am also really missing drinking...it's the holiday trigger and I know it and it's ok but it's harder than I expected...**General:** My elderly cat and young dog are both being very "verbal" today; she is meowing almost dementedly and he's growling and barking at shadows for some reason.  I'm not being very patient with either of them. I think my impatience is related to my struggles above.

Triumph:  I did not drink today.Struggle:  I wanted to drink today and for a minute I had convinced myself that it would make me happy and less stressed.  Lies!!!.General:  I am going to be haunting SD a lot over the next several days.  I need to keep my commitment to sobriety at the forefront of my mind.  
**Triumph:** I went to an open mic last night to perform and although the monkey on my back was raging I stuck with water. I performed last but absolutely killed it. I definitely don't regret not drinking...**Struggle:** I'm an emotional wreck from being heartbroken. I've had to go to the bathroom during work multiple times just to compose myself and let out a few tears...**General:** It's weird being away from America during thanksgiving. Oddly enough it kind of makes me more appreciative of the people and things I am thankful for. 
Triumph : Still sober and doing good..Struggle : week end is coming  this will be a big test..G n ral : Signed the papers going to own a house in june
