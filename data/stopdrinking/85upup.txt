After a weekend relapse I finally decided I can't do this on willpower alone. I got a sponsor and started an intensive outpatient program yesterday. 3 days a week for 3 hours a night and I'll be attending meetings with my sponsor the other 4 nights a week. It's time to get fucking serious.

Sounds like you're on the right path! Almost 2 years ago I did the same. Found a program that works for me sprinkled in some new activities to keep me sane and busy and did my best to get through every day clean. ..I think you'll find IOP refreshing. It's good to get around other people who are struggling in the same way that you are. My advice would be to keep an open mind and keep busy. Everyone is different so what works for other's may (or may not) work for you. This is your journey and your sobriety not anyone else's! Good luck!
Sounds great!  Look forward to hearing any of the good stuff you're learning there that you could share on here!  IWNDWYT
What kind of program is it what hospital?  Curious about how much it costs.
