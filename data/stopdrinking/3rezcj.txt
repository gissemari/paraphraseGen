Just hit the two month mark. Almost missed it. Today was huge for me as I dropped almost 1500 dollars into my savings account today. This is just the money I've saved from not drinking the last two months (booze+eating crappy+drunk purchases). In addition to this I'm feeling much better physically and mentally. I still lack motivation but I'm slowly relying less on caffeine to get me through the day and I've upped my gym attendance from never to about three days a week now.  I'm really focusing on taking it slow as I've had many relapses in the past from letting my extremist tendencies put me in a place both mentally and physically where I found drinking to be the best option to deal with life. So far been reading this sub a lot and it is really helping. Thank you everyone for posting and commenting. ..Hope everyone has a great day!

Congratulations! Two months is fantastic. Be proud of yourself! And three days a week at the gym is nothing to sniff at too =)
Running start on a whole new way of living. 
Incredible! So glad to hear of your success. ..Taking it slow has been really helpful for me too this time. The first time I tried to stop I threw myself into my old habits full force expecting to just pick up where I left off and all the reasons I used as excuses to drink to just disappear... Didn't happen! This time I've ramped up and am feeling very solid because of it. It also has helped me to practice being in touch with myself emotionally and physically as well as to practice kindness towards myself - rising above the negative thoughts when I don't make it to x days a week at the gym or sleep in a bit later.
