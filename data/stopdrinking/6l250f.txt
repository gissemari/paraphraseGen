I went to a meeting today and my biggest problem with AA is trying to get past the submitting to a higher power. As an atheist I struggle with this on many levels. What else is out there besides AA that isn't so dependent on this and is there something else to submit to? My suggested wife suggest I make her my higher power. ( She is a funny woman). I will not drink with you today.

I don't know that it's "submitting"...It's *recognizing* that there is something more powerful than me...That was easy for me - I'm more powerful than ALL the alcohol in the world *Outside* of me...One glass of wine *Inside* of me is more powerful than my willpower...There are an infinite number of things more powerful  than me - grizzly bears; solar flares gravity the ocean's tides invisible to my eye radioactive isotopes the driver who crosses the center line and hits me as I walk across the street...........Again not sure about "submit".   ..I did "surrender".  That was a hard word for me because I'm normally pretty indomitable in sprit and character...I did surrender to alcohol.  I laid down my sword and shield and walked away from the battle.  ..Everytime I jousted with wine it brought me down.   ..When I refused to enter into an engagement.....when I surrender the *struggle* with it...... then I WIN ~!..Whadda ya think?
Here's the version of the steps that I used. ..______________________________________.Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal.. .Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. ..

There are lots of alternatives to AA depending on where you are--SMART Refuge Recovery life ring etc. Smart also has online meetings. 
Like it says in the big book many AAs use the group as their higher power. Two alcoholics working together are more powerful than one alcoholic. That's all it takes.
Most people go into AA and stall at the higher power suggestion. Remember in step two it says 'came to believe not had to right away.' Spiritual faith can be a slow burn. Keep an open mind and move from there if you can. Nobody should be pushing you to do or commit to anything it's your recovery. The AA group is generally enough for most. Take it steady and don't sweat it.
I've only heard good things about Refuge Recovery...Just like everyone else here I've been reading "The Naked Mind." She says and cites the stat that 1 in 15 people that choose AA specifically are successful. This is not to say that people aren't benefiting from it on this board but it does say that it is in no way the end all be all solution...See what works for you.
Fellow atheist here. What if you just had to "turn over your will" but not to anything in particular? The way I see it it's basically a commitment to letting go to not trying to control everything so much. The theists say "I'm not going to sweat XYZ because God has got me. I'm turning it over to him/her/it." I say "I'm not going to sweat it because the universe is huge and way bigger than me and taking it personally when things don't go my way is a waste of my time and can only get me in trouble. I choose to turn it over to let it go. I choose to practice acceptance of the world and all of its people."..So if I "submit" to anything it's just to the idea that this world is way bigger than me that the universe doesn't revolve around what I want. Hope that helps!
