Relapse. Was doing great had close to a month under belt and drank again. It's been said and I agree wholeheartedly now that sometimes the first few days sober are easier since guard is up. Well I can consider this my 30 day test to evaluate relationship with alcohol and I know where I stand; moderation doesn't exist for me and time to own up to tee-totaled life.     ..I've also seen it asked of others in this boat "what will you do different?"     ..* I'll use the daily checkin (slacked off)     .* I won't make excuses for myself everyone has stress      .* make a professional and home to-do list for projects so I may be productive and move forward     .* start exercise again      .* be more active in SD..I toast my coffee to you all on our sober journeys.

Welcome back!  Things can be so much better.  Good luck!
Hello again. Looks like you have a good plan..
Sounds like an excellent plan! I wish you luck :)
Welcome back
Nothing helped me as much as actually going to local recovery meetings.
If you grab a badge we can help you celebrate the passing days.  I know it really helped me :)
Me too.  I'm so sad.
The most important thing is that you are back here and you have a plan!! Welcome back.
I'm curious about the circumstances and why you decided to drink. What happened? I ask because it helped me to identify particular situations in which I typically drank and then focus on changing my habits in those particular circumstances.
