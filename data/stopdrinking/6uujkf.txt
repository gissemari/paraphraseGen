My cousin is working on joining us in not drinking but she is struggling with quitting cold turkey. What are some methods you've used to quit drinking?

First of all speak with a doctor. If they've been drinking a lot going cold turkey can be dangerous without supervision...Lots of people seem to find value in using Naltrexone which apparently stops that first drink triggering an intense craving for the 2nd...Personally if i had the capacity to taper off alcohol in a controlled way i wouldn't have ended up in this situation.
Tapering off. I am coming to the end of doing so. Tonight I will have 1/3 of a bottle of wine  yesterday I had 2/3 the day before 1 bottle. And so on going back just over a week when I was on over three bottles and day...It does work but it needs discipline. It's easy to think fuck it and finish the bottle. But if someone really wants to stop the incentive is there.
&gt; she is struggling with quitting cold turkey...It is Not easy to break an addiction.  It takes "Dogged Persistence" to Not take that first drink.  If she can't stop on her own there is always rehab..."Tappering" for those who can do it is also an option but for alcoholics like me once I start I cannot stop.
