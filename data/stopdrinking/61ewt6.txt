I'm 21. I've been drinking every weekend since I turned 16 I think. 2 weeks ago I actually stayed sober for a whole weekend to prove to myself that I could handle the need for alcohol and I felt really good about myself but the weekends after I've been getting drunk AF again. I just wanted to tell someone that I'm struggling right now. How do I get out of this nightmare?

When I have the craving or the desire to drink I think about the reasons why I want to be sober and for me they far outweigh the reasons to get drunk. I won't drink with you today. 
Well there are a lot of tools and resources out there and in here for you to use. You are a weekend warrior it sounds like...how do you get through the regular weekdays without drinking? (I was a daily drinker so I was up against not knowing how to do it at all!) What worked for you the one weekend you did stay sober? I'm always glad to see young people here waking up to a problem I wish I had tackled my drinking much earlier. It's worth it welcome and best wishes!
