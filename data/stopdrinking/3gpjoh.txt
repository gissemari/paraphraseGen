Hey guys!! Hey guys!! [Happy Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD-gp_QphoU)!..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. ..**Triumph**: I was out last night at a club I used to patronize when I used to drink. I didn't feel the need to tell the people I was with all my crazy stories about the wild  goings-on I used to have there. It feels like I'm finding new ways to define myself and needing to fall back less and less the kinds of stories that I used to tell to make me feel "cool." I like that.  ..**Struggle**: I have a friend who's really struggling and it's hard to watch her drink over it. It's twofold -- I'm jealous that she gets that "out" and I'm sad that she's using it as opposed to other more healthy coping mechanisms. I can do my best to be a good friend but it's challenging. ..**General Chat**: What's something you did in this past week that you could/would have NEVER done while you were drinking? I did a great closet clean-out which was hugely rewarding. You?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** Going to go with the obvious one which is that I hit 90 days/3 months of sobriety! Holy crap! It's so funny because at the start the days took forever and now the days just fly! Other triumph is that the awful things that were happening in my life with my marriage and my job are both starting to get better. Not out of the woods yet but I'm hopeful...**Struggle:** I am feeling tired all the freaking time. I think being out at AA four nights a week is starting to take its toll. I've also started working Sundays on top of my full time job for some extra cash so I think it's a mix of that. I'm trying to stay positive but being exhausted all the time isn't great. ..**General Chat:** I think I've done this wrong previously where I would just talk about something random not the subject /u/cake_or_radish  put in the post. That's kind of awkward. Something I've done sober that I never would have done drinking eh? I think I'm going to say AA. Not only the fact that I am going to meetings but I go and honestly talk about my feelings to strangers!!!!! WHAT?! When I was drinking I a) Wouldn't leave my house on a weeknight that cut into my drinking time b) Wouldn't feel my feelings c) Wouldn't talk about my feelings to anyone even people close to me d) Would never talk to strangers about anything let alone my feelings and e) if someone tortured me and forced me into a situation like that I sure as hell wouldn't have enjoyed it! Sobriety is a tough journey but I wouldn't trade it for anything :) ..Edit: Formatting
*Imagine there's no predators. It isn't hard to do. Nothing to kill or die for. And no lions too.  Imagine all the [elephants &amp; camels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFywg7CSgec) living HUMP DAAAAAY in peace^e^e^e^e^e^e^e........*  ..&gt; What's something you did in this past week that you could/would have NEVER done while you were drinking? ..Dude... I have developed a serious berry addiction.  Each day I say "no more!"  But then each night I'm rushing out to the store to pick up more berries before closing time.  HA just kidding about the closing time.  Berries are available 24/7!  Suck it alcohol! .
**Triumph**: Got up early on a Saturday meditated ran stretched and did a motivation check-in with the housemate all before 9 am! That's something I could not have done while drinking! A wonderful way to start the weekend..**Struggle**: I still need to see a therapist for help in moving forward towards my goals and just found out my insurance won't cover it until deductible is met. Total BS. "You have to get sick a lot before we'll help you!" So now gotta find cash to make it happen. Grr. It'll happen but now will take longer. .**Chat**: I'm continuously amazed at how full life is without alcohol. So many books to read meals to cook vegetables to garden! And runs and hikes and trips to plan and....
**Triumph:** After 3 months of processing my firearms acquisition license has been approved. Shooting range here I come!!..**Struggle:** Sleep. I have a lot going on at work and at home and have had a hard time shutting my mind off at the end of the day. I haven't meditated in a while either which makes it worse...**General Chat:** I was on vacation last week and did 330km on my bike several hikes and a 3 hour tour on the SUP. I couldn't have done all that if I was still drinking. No way.
**Triumph**: I'm almost 1 month into my sober journey and starting to feel so much better. My mind feels so much clearer and I woke up this morning before the sun came up and went for a run and workout. I saw a beautiful shooting star and loved watching the sun come up. I live in a pretty urban area so it felt like I was out in the country. ..**Struggle**: I hate my job with a passion. I do not like living in Georgia and I hate traffic. This is a daily struggle but I am grateful that I have a job a place to live food healthy kids etc...Just found out my neighbor who has 3 young kids was just diagnosed with stage 3 cancer in his throat. It's crazy because he's younger than me. He's 35 and scared beyond belief. I feel so bad for their family. ..**General Chat**: I never would have set my alarm for 5:50am to go workout before work during my drinking days. 
**Triumph**: Being able to work out issues with my wife in a calm respectful thoughtful way is so much better than taking everything personally and fighting dirty.  We've been dealing with some issues in our marriage that have pretty much always been there but I was never equipped to handle them maturely because I was always drinking.  So I'd fight dirty be an asshole and really fuck up any chance of having my concerns heard...Now though we talk rationally.  I'm able to get my points across without making her feel bad.  And we can have a great discussion that leads to positive changes in our relationship...**Struggle**: It's been over 2 years since my last vacation.  I'm getting stir crazy.  Luckily we've got something planned in a couple weeks...**General Chat**: I do stuff all the time that I never would have done before.  Let's see... on Saturday we went to the Citi Open and spent all day at the tournament.  It was pretty hot out (our seats didn't get any of the nice breeze that DC had that day).  I was sweating some but no more than anyone else.  My wife and I had a wonderful day out in the sun spending the day together.  In the past I would have been drunk by lunchtime and we would have gotten into a fight.  I would have been so disgustingly sweaty that it would have been embarrassing to both of us.  Sometimes it's the normal things that are so completely awesome about sobriety.
Triumph:..I finally got to take my wife to Martha's Vineyard after promising her since we'd met to do so. I went to a restaurant with a bar I used to he a regular at and didn't even want a drink. God damn dirty bananas have sucked enough of my life money and energy away. It felt good to keep a promise to my wife and to myself ..Struggle:.The roller coaster of emotions has been interesting. When I was drinking I didn't think things bothered me. I'm finding out now I've got a metric shit ton of resentments thst I was just drowning for the last decade. Looking forward to working the program and a dressing them when I'm ready...This week I got to spend time with my little sister and her husband. She had an ultra sound to find out the sex of the baby and I got to be there to watch her reaction. When I was drinking I never would have went let alone feel any sort of happiness for them in that situation. I'm happy to be sober today and thankful that you all are here for me whenever I need a swift reminder of why I'm doing this.
**Triumph:** When I first stopped drinking I signed up for a half marathon and started training. I've always been into exercise but I've never taken running seriously before. Shortly after I signed up I did a little calculating and figured out that I would be at the four month mark on race day. I spent many of the runs during the beginning of the training thinking about how great it would be to have four months of sobriety and what an accomplishment that would be. And also a lot of thoughts about how impossible that seemed. Race is coming up this weekend. :)  .**Struggle:** I'm working on my faults and damn if that shit isn't hard as hell.  .**General Chat:**I went for a run after seven o'clock last night and I really never would have done that while I was drinking. That part of the evening was always reserved for the possibility of drinking.
Not only did  I used to drink everyday I also ate out pretty much every meal. Ever since I've quit I've cooked at home for every meal. It's actually been fun and holy crap I'm saving money. It's like having a second job. I used to *dread* cooking and especially cleaning. Alcohol made me feel like washing a dish was the end of the world. ugh.

I have a ....friend.... that I've largely decided was probably more of a drinking buddy...I've noticed he's really kind of a horses ass and I have far less tolerance for him in my sobriety...So unfortunately I think we are all bound to lose a friend or two as we move into a different section of life...maybe it's for the better. 
Waking up at 4:30AM everyday without the constant feeling of tiredness or headache from a previous night of drinking (yes that includes weekends as well).  Feels very liberating to head into work with NOBODY on the road...I'm charging forward with sobriety.  My co-worker and I would often drink heavily together but I put the kibosh on that after my unfortunate incident with the highway patrol.
**Triumph** - 472 days..**Struggle** - Disordered eating has kinda gotten out of control.  Am thinking I should start resetting my badge based on that rather than drinking. ..**General Chat** - This week has been pretty boring but I did manage to make it through a wedding a week and a half ago sober including staying at a "party house" where there was drinking constantly going on around me and I participated in games like beer pong and flip cup with my cups of water. And I DD'd the bachelorette party.
Triumph: Oh man! I JUST got lab results from my latest trip to the doctor. Last time I had blood taken since my heavy heavy drinking days and my liver enzymes were through the fucking roof...Well... theyre in normal range!!!!! So was everything else so from a medical perspective I am very healthy!..Struggles: Losing weight. I'm tryin damnit!!!! Been a few days since I had any sugary snacks. I'm not tryin to lose weight too fast and fuck with my strength but I figure if I can cut out the nightly sweets I should be in a better place...General chat: Squatted 365 for 2 reps today after some heavy triples. Wanted 3 but my second one it got a little forward on me so I racked it. Not bad... still struggling with the squat but its all comin together.
Triumph: I went to a wedding last weekend with a really well-stocked open bar and I made sure to treat myself to a delicious non-alcoholic drink and stuck with water and coffee for the rest of the event. I ended up having a great time dancing and chatting with people without having to always have a beer in my hand to look "cool"..Struggle: It's almost been 4 weeks since my breaking point and I'm still struggling with the shame of some of the things I would say/do when I was drunk. I've recently had a lot of time to reflect on the pain my drinking caused and the root of why I drank in the first place (mainly depression and anxiety). I know that stopping my self-medication of drinking is a step forward but I still have a long way to go and I'll probably need professional help along the way...General Chat: On Saturday I joined a running club which included a 4-mile morning run and breakfast and coffee afterwards. I probably would have been up for running even when I was drinking but I would not have been able to enjoy the social aspect of it as much. As it is I met a bunch a great people and I can't wait to go back and see everyone!
**[Hump Day!](http://i.imgur.com/3lHeGaL.jpg)**..**[Hump Day!](http://i.imgur.com/zlwgE3y.jpg)**..Yeah I hung with Bactrian camels today. Camel kisses are *gross* and these love to snarfle guys with beards. You can touch me after I shower.
Triumph: similarly to radish I went to a popular craft brewery/delicious restaurant last night. I had a lot of fun and was able to leave solo in peace. I can't think of anything super eloquent to say cuz there are many little observations that come up around 'going out' and I do it very occasionally. Only when I'm feeling 100% about being around alcohol or weed (weeds legal here and seems to be becoming a part of the bar culture big trigger for me)...Struggle: it's hard and painful to reach out to people and be vulnerable. Not only are we sober now (no buffer around rejection) but feeling heightened emotions or I am at least. Example: I asked my mom if she wanted to grab a burrito tonight and she shut me down and immediately started talking about groceries and money and how's she's eating at home. I just said 'okay cool never mind' but I felt rejected. 'She obviously doesn't give a shit about spending time with me' even if that's illogical...General chat: I've been eating lots of raw vegan meals. It makes my body feel amazing. A lot of the time it's a fancy smoothie. I got a super fruit sangria recipe (virgin obviously) and I almost cried it was so good. The thought of eating stuff like that daily when i was drinking or taking drugs...FORGET IT. The thought of drinking a liter of coconut water would have made me dry heave with a hangover. Now freaking love it.
**Triumph:** Went to see new therapist today.  Went well.  Having more productive day then yesterday.  Coming back up out of depressive slump...**Struggle:** Laptop is broken.  I was in depressive slump and need to not best myself up over wasted time.  This is hard for me to do.  I want to be better but whenever there is setbacks I think "why bother?"..**General Chat:** I went swing dancing! and made one of the spare bedrooms into collage/art studio. 
**Triumph**: I went out for a work function last week.  I expected people to be pushing me to drink like they do with the other guy that doesn't drink.  They were actually really encouraging I mean everybody there wasn't a single person that tried to pressure me into drinking...**Struggle**: It is a lot easier to tolerate drunks when you're also drinking.  A few times this year I have wanted to get drunk just so I could handle the person I was with...**General Chat**: This past Sunday I was out in the garden for hours usually I'd wind up with a bad headache after just one hour but those have gone away since I stopped drinking.
**Triumph:** I am staying engaged in my own recovery with the help of a new guy who I've been taking to meetings and spending time with. I got a little side tracked with being self centered for a while there and it was time to get back to the basics...**Struggle:** I've been having some cravings that I have not been opening up about...**General Chat:** I am starting a new job next week in a field that interests me as a possible career path. I was ready to completely leave my current job instead I offered to still be available on the weekends because I have **actually** developed a good relationship with my current employer.
