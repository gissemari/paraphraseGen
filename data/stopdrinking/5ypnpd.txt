Cravings are really bad at the moment. Just struggling with being present and responsible. I want to cry scream punch something. It feels like i'm drowning in silence. No amount of exercise sleep or chocolate is giving me the release or satisfaction i need...Really thought I would be past these feelings by now.

We seem to be in the same darned place right now.  I've sort of felt it coming on for that last day or two but damn it feels like a punch straight to my chest.  What are you doing to get through the rest of today?
That sucks so bad. I am glad you made it through stay strong. I use a quote from a song by Halsey to help sometimes. "I'm meaner than my demons."
