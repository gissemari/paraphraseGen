My children are asleep upstairs for the first time in ages.  ..I am happy and at peace.  ..I am smiling.  ..For anyone who thinks happiness is not possible anymore than I am here to tell you it is.  ..I never thought I would smile again.  ..Anyone struggling give me a shout.  ..Iwndwyt.

What a beautiful post! Thank you :)..Can I ask how long did it take you to feel really happy again after you quit? I find my own journey still feels like a bit of a grind even after a year. I can see things improving bit by bit though.
It's better being a "lifeaholic!"
I'd be happy too if I had kids and they were all asleep haha
