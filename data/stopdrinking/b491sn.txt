Haven't drunk today and I'm pretty sure I won't but today is a struggle day no real reason... just feel a bit meh and want to drink. This group is a good reminder that there are highs and lows and we just have to go one day at a time...Much love SD..X

Also struggling but we can do this even one hour at a time. 
I believe in you! IWNDWYT! 
Have you checked the halt list hungry angry lonely tired?? Friday is always a bit of a struggle end of week and I'm tired
Congrats on 76 days! I think it's normal to have days where everything feels a bit  meh' and you don't know what to do with yourself. I'm feeling a bit like that this evening not sure what I want to do with myself! So let's not drink together and find another way to waste some time that won't leave us feeling like shit when we wake up :)
