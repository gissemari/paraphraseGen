This is my 3rd day. At the start I woke up with the lingering and powerful nausea head fog depression and anxiety. I forced myself to go out and run one simple errand. I then found that with the help of enough caffeine to kill a small horse was able to clean up around the house...Worn too think to talk I surrounded myself with the people I live with. Simply sitting in their company seemed to slowly calm my nerves. Then eventually my appetite came back. I ate for the first time in almost three days...My mind is still foggy but I was able to finally feed myself physically and emotionally. I can sense sleep will be just a tad easier as well...My point is to all the people struggling with the disgusting fallout of detox it does get better. Ride it out and it becomes slightly easier with each passing day...The struggle to remain sober has just begun. But it's nice to not feel like a complete wreck. ..I'm not drinking with all of you tonight.
