Does it count as a relapse ? :p
----------immediate responses--------

Not in my world unless you were trying to get a buzz. I think intent is more important than literally consuming absolutely zero alcohol. I had some tequila habanero mango dipping sauce with some wings a ways back and don't feel bad about it because I wasn't getting it for the alcohol.
I've always wondered that - like can alcohol in food actually set an alcoholic back in their recovery - as for accountability or whether it counts as a relapse I guess it comes down to would it lead one to drink.... there is some information in the FAQ I think about how much alcohol stays in food when cookin but in my case I'm not hardcore enough to insist it's not in my food
I would say that it doesn't count but I would avoid very strong alcohol based desserts.
If wouldn't consider it a relapse if I ate it.  I wouldn't have broken my sobriety date.  Although I wouldn't have intentionally had it.  Alcohol in food can trigger cross addiction.  It doesn't always 'burn off'.  Chefs like to add wine last for taste...Best to steer clear. 
I'm not sure if it's a relapse but it sure could lead to one. For me no alcohol in my food or my medication no alcohol period. Not risking a relapse for a hamburger.
My only 'relapse' was tiramisu. It honestly did not feel right...I miss cooking with red wine... But i am not doing it. The smell of the evaporation would drive me wild and i would be having an opened bottle in my hand. Not there yet.
No.  I won't drink with you today.
