Today is my first day sober. I decided about 2 weeks ago to become sober and relapsed about 3/4 times. I know i must take it one day at a time. I just get the urge to drink a bottle of wine and tell myself no. When i am alone at night that's when i want it. Then that's when i give in. That's when shit hits the fan and i end up drinking a whole bottle...Words of advice?..I will not drink with you today!

It sounds like you might need some replacement behaviour. If you know the time and place you usually drink is consistent then all I have read so far has said that removing yourself from that place and location is the most effective way to start...Could you go to the gym in the evening? Or a friend's place? Get one of those cinema passes and just go there whenever you get the urge? Anything to kill that time until you no longer have the urge (or it diminishes). 
I needed to distract myself with other activities at witching hour.
Have you tried a jigsaw puzzle?
