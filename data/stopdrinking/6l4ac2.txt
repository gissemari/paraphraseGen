Hi I am in my mid 30's. I have been sober for a little more than 22 months. Most importantly I am sober today...I attended the wedding of my best friend this past weekend and I...didn't have to drink and I didn't drink! It was awesome...I found this sub at 2 am today. It reminded me that I am not alone in my struggles or resentments. It reminded me that I am an alcoholic/addict. I am grateful for this today...The reason that I am starting to be grateful for these truths is because I am beginning to love myself again. In order for me to fully love myself I have to accept unconditional truths about myself. The one unconditional truth I have discovered thus far is that I cannot drink or use. It will take everything good from my life that I have worked for and been granted...I have experienced a relapse after being sober for an extended time (years) and everything that I was told would happen happened. I thought like everyone else "I think I can control it now." But once again it ended up controlling me...I am so lucky to have the opportunity yet again to meet my full potential as a functioning human. So.....Today I will not drink!

Wow awesome. So happy to hear your story. I can't wait to get to 22 months and hearing someone similar to myself that's a little ahead of me that's happy and healthy is inspirational. Thanks!
This sub is amazing. I don't want to think about where I might be had I not found it about a year ago (took a while for me to commit)...And a beautiful part of soberly is I don't have to think about that - it didn't happen  
Glad you're joining us!
Welcome!
That's great. 22 months is no joke...Strong work.
What an awesome story!  This sub is awesome!
