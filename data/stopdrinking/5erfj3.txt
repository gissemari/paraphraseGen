First off may you all have a wonderful and peaceful Thanksgiving. I'm reading a lot of the posts today and the struggles that are coming with the get-togethers that involve alcohol. The family is either being supportive or the complete opposite. To all of you I wish you strength and inner peace. It is quite sad that our culture embraces drinking and yet reviles it at the same time. If one refuses people question why and act like you're the odd one out. Give in and face the judgement of people who don't get it. ..I'm having a challenge today and it's no where near to the level of a major family visit. You're all warriors...I'm not drinking with you.
