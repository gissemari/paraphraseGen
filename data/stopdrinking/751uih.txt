So happy and doesn't even feel like it but today I just reached 91 days sober. I have struggled going more than 3 days and constantly getting tempted. But after getting in legal problems while only had 2 drinks made me realoze that it wasmt worth it and that I only kept hurting and disappointing all the ones i love. ..This is for my family my friends people in my past who ive hurt and for myself I am a new man and today going forward I will not drink with you !!! ..Thank you all for an encouraging sibreddit community we have here so grateful for everyone and it has kept me so strong to steer away from temptation.  Ive also been able to help others when they feel weak because we have all been there at some point and can relate. ..Cant thank you enough !
