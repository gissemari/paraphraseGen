We do this all the time and /u/raevie maintains a recovery music archive check the wisdom link on the sidebar.
Definitely relevant! This would fit right in with the list of songs in the sidebar that has been put together by /u/raevie. You can send /u/raevie a message to have this added to the list. Thanks for sharing!
Yes!  Let's make today Terrific Tunes Tuesday!  ..Since we've already got that list of recovery-related music &amp; since I probably don't know any recovery-related songs that aren't already on it I'm gonna submit [Van Lear Rose by Loretta Lynn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-MvbfhIIwc)  This song was released in 2004 &amp; the whole album was produced by Jack White. You know that guy from the White Stripes.  I think that gives my quaint little country song submission hipster cred no?  .
I'm usually skeptical of random music suggestions on the reddit because peoples music tastes vary widly.  This is not bad.  I wish Taproot had less Korn and more Alice in Chains in their sound but this a decent group nonetheless.
Also:  If you like metal/grunge the lead singer from Alice in Chains and the lead Guitarist from Pearl Jam met in Rehab in Seattle and had some jam sessions.  They recorded an album inspired by their desire for recovery.  I listened to this on repeat in my first month of sobriety...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT7hQaRhHms..The album opens up with the lyrics:..Wake up young man it's time to wake up..Your love affair has got to go..For 10 long years for 10 long years..The leaves to rake up..Slow suicide's no way to go oh..Blue clouded grey..You're not a crack up..Dizzy and weakened by the haze..Moving onward..So an infection not a phase.
I'm starting to see a theme of rock and down temp music. Maybe you guys can give this a chance? It's a nice upbeat song and lyrics are simple and easy to relate to...Also I will not drink today...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN2Q62uMew0&amp;list=FLo9yUxpo6YUXDg_r8DvgnXQ&amp;index=26

A new meeting in Akron started that's pretty cool it's a "music" meeting which is awesome...[this song has been on my mind recently](http://val.fm/residual-fear-anders-manga-mp3/) although not in as negative a way as you might think
The Science of Selling Yourself Short by Less Than Jake has been in my head lately
I again promote [John Hiatt - Paper Thin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdzyMRtjvt8) which seems to not be on the list..This song affects me very strongly....."You write it down in alcohol fire/'That's the only thing that wants you".....it reminds me of some pretty dark places where I and a bottle spent time.
[Just cause I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQF0hs9Rzus)
Thanks for introducing me to this song. Great thoughtful lyrics... I never listened to Taproot really but their voices really reminded me of my favorite band Alice in Chains.
I try to leave a good impression..But it's hard when my obsession's in a wine glass..And when you're only 23..It's not attractive to complain about your sore back..Yes I can bitch until my eyes are blue..And you're in bed with someone new..And I guess you deserve him..Wish I could waste my time without wasting all your time..You say I'm fixable..A classic case lack of will..I say I don't wanna try..I'd rather stay here all night..[Alkaline Trio - Standard Break from Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GE7e8ZziSc).--This song has gotten me through so much. Over the last 12 years I've identified with it in so many different ways and in so many different contexts.
