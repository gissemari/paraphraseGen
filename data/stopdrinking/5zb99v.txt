I made it nearly 2 months and then I relapsed. Its the longest I've ever gone without drinking since I was probably 14 years old (31 now). I wasn't in a good place afterwards (or before I had the first drink lets be honest!) and I gave in. It was the day after my first therapy session where I finally after years and years of holding on just sobbed my heart out to a professional who was so supportive and understanding. I felt like a weight was lifted off me and I saw hope for real recovery from my past. I'm trying to connect the dots: how did this really positive affirming experience lead me to drink? I don't know. I know hope is still out there which is why I'm here sober posting and still eating my chip sammiches. ..So I'll be here. I'm gonna hang around and post and read. I can do this again.

Seeing a therapist is imperative in my recovery. She helps me stay accountable and doesn't judge me for my disease. I can tell her everything that I might feel uncomfortable telling others. Welcome back.
