I relapsed so I'm on day 10. My badge counts getting out of the hospital and getting serious...Day 10 is rough. And Friday.

Well I bet that lapse was tough --- WTG on starting again --- top performance.
WTG from me as well. I have stumbled many times myself. I think the courage and success  comes from picking yourself back up. Dusting off and coming back.
Hang in there!  Getting through the weekend will be a HUGE step in your favor.
Way to hang in there and great job getting back on the horse I'm a chronic relapsed so I feel your pain. Stay strong!
