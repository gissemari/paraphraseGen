I am currently at the beginning of a week long vacation at our family cottage. We aren't exactly a  drink all day in the sun  type of family but we always had cocktail hour(3?) on the porch overlooking the lake before dinner...This was and still is my favorite time to spend with my father. My plan is to just sip on la croix/virgin cocktails. I am not necessarily worried about a relapse but I just needed to get on here and process my thoughts I think...I am going to be at 6 months sober at the end of the vacation so that milestone is a nice motivation to keep from thinking  I'll just have one.  I'll be posting a lot all week! IWNDWYT

You got this mate! ..IWNDWYT 
We're with you!
I love doing this with a fancy glass and a San Pellegrino. :)
I'm on a family trip as well! Same as you not drinking all day but the typical cozy beers..Maybe in your case you can make a non alcoholic cocktail?.Is Crodino available where you are? Also a very nice drink...IWNDWYT! 
Make this vacation one to remember! 
Stay strong friend -- IWNDWYT
You can do it! We are going to our mountain cabin this week around family who drink a lot and I always drank a lot with them. (And there's no phone or internet up there so no pocket support!) instead of drinking with them I'll be not drinking with all of you. And I'm sure I'll feel better because the altitude and alcohol combo was very dehydrating and hangovers were ugh.
It will just be another in a long line of firsts that will come along in the next six months.  You got this.  It was the setting and the people not the booze that made this place wonderful right?  You got this.  IWNDWYT
