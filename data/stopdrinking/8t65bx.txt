I happened to come by tickets for Willie Nelson's outlaw tour tonight and while I'm not a country fan I do admire Willie as a person and musician. And it's kind of a life rule that if you get the chance to see Willie you do. ..I've been battling alcohol for about 2 years now and except for a 2 day bender I've been sober for almost a month. It's still a struggle some days. I keep coming back here for reminders of why I don't need to drink and why sobriety is more than I could ever imagine. I enjoy people watching quite a bit and I'm as I watch the crowd I'm reminded of a line from a song by Mumford and Sons.  You must know life to see decay.  Intellectually I've known my whole life that alcohol can have some awful consequences (many of which I've been fortunate to avoid) but it's only been in this past month that I've truly begun to understand those words. I'm grateful that I've made the choice to be sober today. I'm having a blast and I'll be able to remember the night I saw Willie Nelson sing. ..In the wise words of Red Green  keep your stick on the ice we're all in this together.

Good job. Easier to seize the moment sober :-) IWNDWYT 
Did he play "Reasons To Quit"? That one is real...
