After about a month sober it was relatively smooth sailing. I still came to this site daily and when I would read about people who had months of sobriety post about their struggles I assumed I was a lucky one. I love Halloween and I always drank lots and since Halloween didn't bother me at all and since I had survived a 7 day all-inclusive in Mexico while 2 weeks sober (with a nightmare flight home) I was 1 million % sure I was OK now. And then the holidays hit me like a f#cking brick wall...It feels like the holidays lasted months...I had so many lows (of course lots of fun too but I'm speaking of booze related stuff) so much pain &amp; confusion...I had moments when I just couldn't remember the point in being sober. I had booze purchased for me (people literally bought me bottles of expensive wine at suppers/parties!!?? I haven't told too many people but it's not like anyone bought me shit when I used to drink...everything was like a constant test!!). Plus I used to LOVE the holidays...I was the person who cheered everyone else up. I was the one who laughed and made jokes and asked questions to get conversations going etc. but this year everyone was extra annoying everyone seemed down...people seemed bummed by me being 'quiet' (in my head I kept making everything about me)...I had horrible anxiety and it was like losing my mojo - I just couldn't be bothered to carry on talking and socializing and no amount of self-coaxing was going to work. I felt quiet and anti-social. I was eating clean exercising sober resting daily meditation...did everything right but my anxiety was horrible and I hadn't had anxiety like that since I started meditating 7 years ago. Anxiety was another thing I had put behind me. So it was freaky &amp; horrible to have that feeling again.....Looking back...since I somehow survived I realize the extent of my alcoholism or how alcoholism in general is a complicated thing (or even substitute alcoholism with whatever word   PAIN). It took a while to realize what was happening that my filter had been removed and I was feeling EVERYTHING. I started to truly see how much I drank myself into oblivion on a daily basis in order to deal with shit and even some of the shit I loved turned out was only awesome because I was tanked. I wasn't allowing myself to really feel reality and most of the time reality sucked and the exit door was sealed shut. Xmas music and jingles stirred up old memories...happy memories but I don't know it made me anxious as hell.  And my parents get super super depressed around the holidays and put a lot of guilt on me...nothing I do is enough constantly telling me how they are down no one visits them etc. etc. it's not personal but it's heavy stuff &amp; I couldn't drink that away and I had to feel my resentment...I also realized that life is going to have a hell of a lot more gut punches waiting for me in the future. Living with alcoholism is what everyone says one day at a time (luckily it's generally pretty easy these days). Even though I'm OK now that can change very quickly. I made it through thanks in large part to this site. There's no question I would have had to go to AA or I'd of crashed without this site. A few times I felt so lost...almost like I was losing my grip on reality. I even accepted a glass of wine at a xmas supper because everyone kept asking and the more I said I was OK the more it created tension (people don't like drinking alone! haha) - my wife was at the table and the only person who knew I was sober - I pretended I needed more potatoes and went into the kitchen to dump out my wine (heart pounding a million miles an hour). I was confused flustered...grumpy "wtf are you doing man!??"...And yet the bad is sort of going out of focus as the good memories rise to the top - already. I was even a little sad over the weekend because the holidays were wrapping up kids back at school...and "another year over". It was a learning experience. ..Getting groceries with my wife yesterday I said "hey you know what today is?" "no what?" "100 days...somehow I survived that f*cking train wreck I'm still sober and I feel like old me again" we both burst out laughing...Thanks everyone for helping me survive the holidays sober!!! Life is good the bad is even good if sober. ...
