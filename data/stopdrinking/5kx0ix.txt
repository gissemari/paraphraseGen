Right? I am on mobile and can't even see it ha!  .Sounds obvious but by just not drinking the days eventually begin to pile up. ..I was a chronic relapser I have reset my badge dozens of times reliving the first week and Days 1s over and over again.  I was a pretty functional drunk which allowed me to believe that I was getting away with it which fed my denial that I wasnt really an alcoholic.....Which kept leading me back to relapsing and drinking alcoholically. And I truly was in an emotional and mental hell... About 30 days ago I was compulsively listening to the Bubble hour podcast and realized there was nothing separating these women from me I am every bit of an alcoholic as they are and not only that...I want what they have...Peace contentment freedom a sober community of friends....And I guess what everyone means by surrendering once I stopped fighting to control manage hide continue my drinking this first 30 days not only became possible but actually hopeful and even peaceful. ..The benefits are obvious like no hangovers no memory problems the weird aches I would get in my abdomen are gone my nighttime hygiene routine is way better I think I look a bit better no fights with my husband I am considerably less anxious and depressed and feel better equipped to deal with life as it comes although I am being  very careful to continue to make things as easy for myself as  possible...I am still struggling with energy levels and am being pretty lazy.  I am eating a lot of cheese and crackers and ice cream.  I smoked a handful of cigarettes this month when I just needed *something*.  I spent more money than I should have spoiling myself with fancy coffees new shoes hair and nail appointments.  I gave myself a pass in all these areas acknowledging that I am changing a dangerous 15 year habit/addiction and that is the only focus for now...Anyways thank you for reading and all of the unwavering support because after over a year of coming to SD and starting over with all the resets Sophie got her star!!!!!!!! .

Congratulations on 30-days! I can hear my own voice in what you wrote. I just reset my badge again. :-( But the more time I spend reading other peoples posts on this page the more determined I become that I can do this! I will not drink with you today!

Hello! Congrats on 30! I am inspired by what you've written. I'm on day 5 and I have eaten so much cheese and crackers; so many jelly beans. I was just sitting here thinking I should buy myself something! Sigh. That ache in your abdomen? Yup. ..Also: Just last night as I was going to sleep I thought Damn! You brushed flossed and used mouthwash! And you used that fancy face cream you were told to use every night! I used to brush and call it a success when I drank every night. ..So happy to hear things get every better after 30 days. I'm listening to the 30 Day Sobriety Solution (day five) and it's helped immensely this time. ..You are an inspiration like so many others here. Good work! I won't be drinking with you today. 
Nice! As a fellow recipient of a new star I hear you about how good it feels and I HEAR YOU about the inordinate amount of treats. Sorry not sorry. Went to my first sober concert last night and had a blast. My friends who were drinking bourbon like oxygen had no clue what was being played by the end of the show. I woke up singing the songs. I'll bet they're still sleeping. ..Sorry to hijack the post....anyway great post and other than me not being female I probably could've written it. Keep it up!
Sophiestar is a star!! Sophiestar is a star!!..The good news is that for me at 2 months in my memory is getting even better. I mean you can see how witty I am. No more weird abdominal pains or diarrhea. My nightly face cream has my skin looking better than it has in years. My husband and I are getting along great. My anxiety is greatly reduced. So all those benefits you listed have been cumulative. They just keep stacking up!
I love your post! .I am only on day 5 but looking forward to what you have! ESP the nightly hygiene routine!.Great job!
Congratulations on your 30 days!  I relate to so much of what you wrote.  I highly recommend adding some daily exercise to your routine to help with the energy even if it's just walking 10 minutes a day to start or doing some mild yoga stretches.  I try to think of it as part of my self care along with the hygiene improvements and other efforts for self-maintenance that you mentioned.  Keep up the good work I will not drink with you today!
Yay! Good work!
Congratulations! I think it's great that you've been treating yourself--I've been doing something similar. Well done!
Good stuff!! I'm not drinking with you today
