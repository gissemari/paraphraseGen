https://open.spotify.com/track/34hnNivtjbAzrpoy4L75uk..Funny how a song makes you come clean. 4 weeks ago my sponsor said I wasn't making sense and thought I was headed for a relapse and instead of saying "ok how can you help me stop this" I said "I got this no biggie"...Remember when your mom or dad said "don't make me say 'I told you so'?"..I've been told. ..My new clean date is 11/27..Without proper maintenance we'll never have this. Put it before anything I threw away years for no better reason than "I can handle this"... I couldn't. .
