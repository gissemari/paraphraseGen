Two years ago today I was hungover and in a deep pit of shame and self loathing after saying some pretty awful things to a good friend...Today I'm a lot better...I'm just going to run through my philosophy on addiction but I need to pre-face it with a little paragraph...What I have done and how I feel about this illness is quite different to other approaches but it worked for me. However I'm concerned that some of my writing might read as if I am trying to be rude about what others have done. That's not what I am meaning to do. I just want to present what worked for me. And I'd love to discuss any of this stuff with people too...Anyway here goes...In terms of the early days I'm pretty much in agreement with everyone else on the best way to get through it. Get medical help if you need it and just get one day at a time. Keep doing this until you have several days racked up. Only you can do this and the part of you that is ill will want to keep dragging you back to how you used to be. ..In the first few weeks you will just have to white knuckle it and get to bed without drinking...Pretty early on you will need a support network. For me I used this sub. It made me accountable and I also told close family and friends. This also made me accountable. Accountability helped. Other options include stuff like AA. The important bit is to make yourself accountable to some people somewhere...That is how I stopped drinking...But stopping drinking is not the same as being sober...You can keep sober by using self hatred. But it's much harder that way. Much harder. You can deny yourself a drink every day for the rest of your life because you believe you are a worthless drunk. It's easier however if you don't have a drink because you love yourself. And if I love myself and I want to do the best for myself then it's pretty hard to do something that actively harms me...That is easier said than done. Like I say. In the early days I had to white knuckle it. ..Soon though a few months in things started to change. Now that my life was not devoted to a harmful cycle of hangover and binge I had a lot of free time and a bit of free money...I started to take up some hobbies. Beginning to learn Wing Chun led me towards a new way of thinking and I began to pick up emotional and spiritual tools. This led me towards Alan Watts and the philosophy of now and how it applies to bettering yourself and overcoming addiction. But that would need a whole post all to itself.....I started to ride horses and exercise regularly as well as getting back into painting models. Bit by bit I became a real person with real interests and slowly I started to like myself. I built an identity which I was proud of. And because I built this identity I wanted to stay sober because I was worth sobriety...Most days now I do not remember that I am an alcoholic. I almost forgot this anniversary and spotted it only by fluke. The last time before this that I thought about drinking was probably some point at Christmas. And when I say thought about drinking I mean to say that I thought 'Oh yeah. I don't do that'..There is a lot of advice around that sings the praises of promising yourself every morning that today you will drink and today you will get to bed sober. For me that would have represented no growth from the first day of not drinking...For me starting every day by reminding myself of my alcoholism would start every day with a negative. Every morning would be about alcohol. Well you know what fuck that. No part of my life is about alcohol anymore. ..This would undermine the very basis of my recovery...Instead I struggled through the early days and then I fed the part of me that had been withering inside. The me that wanted to ride horses and learn how to fight. ..As I fed that person I grew to love him and the alcoholism withered and died instead. ..You get more of what you think of. ..If you start to focus on your feet you will notice you can feel your socks. Focus on that long enough and you will realize you can't get them comfortable no matter what you do. There's a ridge of fabric somewhere that's just not quite right. Most days though you don't even notice your feet...Thinking of yourself as an alcoholic is the same. For me years into recovery waking up every day and reminding myself I am an alcoholic would be a risk...You get more of what you think of. ..Inviting alcohol into my mind every day would only serve to feed the old me the addict the drunk. I would then have to make efforts to keep him shackled and in check but still alive still a risk to my health. The fight would never end. Instead I stopped feeding him totally. And he died. Drinking is nowhere in my thought process. No pattern of events in my life leads to a drink anymore. There is no map or road that leads there because I changed the entire topography of my life...Thinking of myself as an alcoholic is not part of my personality anymore..Saying 'I don't drink' is very much a part of my personality along with riding horses eating healthily going to the gym and so on. It's one of many things I do because I love myself...My name is Sam. And I am not an alcoholic...I just don't drink...Edit: The reaction to this has blown me away. Thank you all for your lovely words and shared enthusiasm. In a few weeks I will try to write this Taoist 'Now-ism in recovery' post. Western interpretations of Eastern philosophy by people like Alan Watts changed my life and I'm thrilled to see that there are others out there who would share that same enthusiasm and excitement about recovery.
----------immediate responses--------

I guess that's one way to think about it. I need the reminder that I'm a drunk as that's what keeps me from drinking-- knowing that I can't control it.

I love this! Thanks for sharing! This is what I'm going for - ultimately I want alcohol to not be any part of my life. The tough part is that I'm really into SD... Like I freaking love it here! I spend a good 1-2 hours a day on here.....So here I am stuck on two sides of the coin. One stop focusing so much on alcohol (ie. recovery) and the other is keep doing what I'm doing. ..I've still got a bit a way to go; I'm still pretty terrified of alcohol but I'm reading every book I can find to empower myself to genuinely not want alcohol. ..Congrats on the two years and thanks for the awesome post! .
Interesting take. Glad it worked for you. 
Hi Sam who is not an alcoholic.  My brain functions the same way yours does in that I need to not focus on alcohol or not more like grow in myself develop more interests and friends and as a by-product say that I don't drink.  I have said to friends that I'm not drinking for 30 days as that seemed the easiest thing at the time..And of course day at a time I will extend it for longer i.e. 60 days 90 days etc.  ..The only difference is that I am an alcoholic.  I do have a problem.  And I don't drink.
I don't personally tend to use the alcoholic label despite the cap fitting me. I am committed to staying sober and my focus is building better coping tools and the right balance of things into my life and to enjoy living sober as much as I can.
Yes I think later in sobriety you are able to cut some of those chains loose but early on it is critical for me to have the constant reminders.  I need them.  A lot of people need them early on.  I might even need them a lot later on.  I dont see them as a negative.  I see them as FACT.  However you choose to view it is obviously up to the individual. You have done well and you should be proud.  I am proud of you
Great post. I hope to get where you are. 
Good for you!
'Oh yeah. I don't do that'.That is the approach I used successfully to quit smoking (20 years ago) and that is what I am applying now to alcohol.  Thanks for this post Sam it is golden!   And kudos on 4 years!
Great post. Thanks.
I hope this can be me in the future although I would like to be able to pay forward the help I have gotten from others during early sobriety in the form of mentoring in my IRL group. The thought of having crushing negative thoughts about myself all the time does not appeal to me either.
&gt; For me starting every day by reminding myself of my alcoholism would start every day with a negative. Every morning would be about alcohol. Well you know what fuck that. No part of my life is about alcohol anymore. ..This is a magnificent point. I really appreciate the idea of rebuilding the topography of your life. I've taken a similar approach and don't label myself anymore. I just don't drink. If folks ask or really want to know why I tell them the truth: It doesn't do anything positive for me...The idea of working from the positive has been such a crucial component of my recovery. Thank you for sharing your insights and best wishes for future joy and success.
"It's easier if you don't have a drink because you love yourself."..Thank you for this. I hope you will write that Alan Watts post for us someday!
&gt;My name is Sam. And I am not an alcoholic...Not to be rude but that's not how it works... but congratulations on 2 years sober
This really resonates with me. The end result of the thought process is the same i.e. NOT drinking but the focus of the energy is different. ..I'm looking forward to a time where alcohol is not at all present in my thinking either the craving FOR it or the abstinence FROM it. Right now I think of alcohol as a poison to me or an allergen. I just can't put that into my body without having a bad "reaction." Eventually I'd like to not think about it at all.
Thank you for this Sam. Wonderful post.

Thanks for this. This approach sounds a lot like the Rational Recovery model which really helped me. There is an uncomfortable transition period at first but essentially you make a permanent plan to never drink again. Any thought feeling or emotion that raises the possibility of drinking is the addictive voice and can be ignored because a plan was already made that doesn't include drinking. 
I think this is a great post thank you for sharing! I agree and have a similar philosophy. I don't drink because alcohol has for the most part only had negative effects on my life and only provided false positives. Whether I meet some definition of an alcoholic is irrelevant for myself the key was enjoying my life and loving myself without alcohol. Once I returned to that then the rest just fell away. 
Thanks for your post! I have found myself including something I WILL do today along with the thing I will NOT do today in my daily check-in.  Hadn't thought about why it was just something I wanted to do.  I think your post nails it - emphasizing the positive and moving the focus to something that is good for me.   Congrats on 2 years!!
I love this. And not bashing AA because I recognize and laud its inherent worth for many people....but I personally could not get behind the "character defect" part. Every time we recited I kept thinking - wait I'm not defective! I don't like saying that! I'm fucked up NOW I have an addiction NOW...but I'm not always "a drunk!"  Anyway your post resonated with me. I understand that others may vehemently disagree with me...but recovery is individual to the one going through it.
Our approach is very very similar.  And it's more popular in SD than you'd immediately notice.  If you say "I don't do AA" you immediately get barraged by counter-commenters who claim you're AA-bashing then it's "well both sides are doing it" so then the self-proclaimed peace-keepers come along and tell both sides to shut up so the AA partisans get what they want...But keep your eyes open for those of us who mention our successes and challenges without throwing in "and then I went to my nightly meeting" or "called my sponsor."  There are a lot of us.
I love your post and your approach.." It's easier however if you don't have a drink because you love yourself. And if I love myself and I want to do the best for myself then it's pretty hard to do something that actively harms me.".That's beautiful! I'm only one week into using SD so I still don't know what "approach" will work for me. I will not drink with you today.
I like this approach you focus on what you want to become (two years ago) and now you become that person. You don't focus on what you didn't like (the drinking part). I like it.
Let me get this straight you are no longer and alcoholic yet you are posting and boasting and letting everyone know of you anniversary. Everyone takes different paths towards there recovery.
Thank you for posting this. I too am not sure it is helpful to label yourself an alcoholic ad infinitum. And I *completely* agree that it's crucial to recover the parts of yourself you lost while drunk. Me I'm knitting like my hair is on fire!
Whatever works for you is awesome.  Nice take on things.  :)
That's an interesting perspective. ..I am conflicted though. Your reading tugged at the feel strings a little bit and made me think that I focus on the fact that I'm an alcoholic too much. ..On the other hand I'm a fucking alcoholic. I can't forget that. If I forget that I'm an alcoholic I will some day think that I can drink like a normal person if I felt like it followed by a relapse and probably right back to where I was when I came in. I've done too much and worked too hard on myself the program and others to give that up. I'm an alcoholic I can't drink like most people and I can't forget that for my own good.

I don't tell many people I'm an alcoholic. I used to and people thought I was crazy or still drinking. So I just say that I don't drink to most people - people who don't have a drink problem themselves which is the vast majority of people I come across in life...The only people I say it to are other people with drink problems. I let them know that I had the same problem that they have (couldn't stop drinking) but I have found a way to live a happy life without drinking. It's up to them to then ask me how. These days I believe in attraction rather than promotion so I don't go around telling all and sundry that my name is king_baby and I'm an alcoholic I'm just that guy who doesn't drink.
this is my second day on this format.  i like what you said.  i can feel the eastern philosophy pouring through.  like attracts like.  you are what you think you are.  saying 'i am a drunk' is such a negative because our society sees it that way nowadays.  gone are the goofy days of W.C.Fields.  'i don't want to harm myself' is a great way to think about it.  'i deserve to treat myself better' is a note i posted on my computer so i see that every day.  thanks for your post..
I can relate to this. Right now I'm loving myself and I'm loving my life and I go whole days without thinking about alcohol in any form. It's been hard to remember my daily check-ins the last few weeks...The reason I'm keeping up with the check-ins along with the other routines I committed to when I quit is that I can't always predict or prevent the feelings of self-loathing. Sometimes I hit a fit of depression even when I'm doing everything right and that's where the danger is for me. For now I can't get rid of the preventative measures and risk being blindsided with a fit of melancholy.
Thank you so much for this. Maybe some people find having a label useful I do not.  I quit drinking because the negative effects had begun to outweigh the upside it does not define who I am I am not powerless. It was a habit and a struggle to quit at first but is not now what I am focussed on when living my life. 
&gt; For me starting every day by reminding myself of my alcoholism would start every day with a negative...I used to feel exactly this way but I'm having some success with the "morning pledge strategy" so I wanted to share my viewpoint.  When I make that morning pledge it comes from a "hell yeah I get to be sober today" place not a "crap I have some defect and I'm going to deny myself what I really want today" place...The morning pledge strategy doesn't have to be associated with a disease model of alcoholism and doesn't have to mean that someone is thinking all day about alcohol either positively or negatively.  I'm excited about the possibility of living a sober life and don't feel deprived or diseased...Having said that I have had past success with your "I'm just not a drinker anymore" strategy.  There are plenty of other people in this sub who use it successfully.  The reason I ultimately failed with it was probably because I was missing the other part of your strategy: developing a sober life...I really liked your post.  Thanks for posting..
Hey buddy! Long time no see! Congrats on your anniversary; I'm right on your heels!..I am on the same page as you here--I prefer to look forward the majority of the time and think about how I can live the best sober life for me versus focusing heavily on old behaviors that I have put to rest. The label of "alcoholic" helped in the beginning because I finally had a name for my problem and people that understood what I was going through. But as I grew in recovery I found that label wasn't helpful anymore. So I stopped wearing it. And I'm much happier for it!
Hi Sam. I'm John. I appreciate this post a great deal and I hope to get there one day...When my sister battled alcohol addiction a decade ago and went heavily into AA I always felt a little put off by the fact of always referring to yourself as an alcoholic. That's just personally. At that time I was only in the infancy of my own problems...Fast-forward to today. I'm 18 days free. Realistically I would say I'm still an alcoholic but I won't always be. I smoked for about 9 years and have been quit for 3. I'm no longer a smoker and it doesn't make up any part of my current identity. Sure from time to time I remember smoking but it would be akin to saying today that "I'm a teenager" or "I love MC Hammer!." Just isn't true anymore and never will be again. ..I have a problem with addictions. If I have a disease at all that would be it. It manifests itself in various ways - some more destructive than others. Alcohol is I hope my last bad addiction. I'm ready to feel like me and to stop seeking the next escape ...I respect that the program has helped so many people. I'm fortunate enough to have found a way that's so far working for me (this subreddit support of family friends meditation self-reflection).
Good on you for not drinking.  Did you ever consider the possibility you never were an alcoholic but someone who drank and decided you didn't like it so stopped?
This is great. Thank you. 
Higher power or hire a therapist or develop my own strategy etc. I don't really care how I get there as long as I can "recover". Sounds like it's working for you and that's what matters. I do subscribe to a lot of what AA offers but I do "modify" my approach to what fits me. I have done a lot of things I didn't want to do but in the end I am glad I did. You sound very positive about your sobriety and that's refreshing! Thank you!
Life-changing thoughts.
&gt;There is a lot of advice around that sings the praises of promising yourself every morning that today you will [not] drink and today you will get to bed sober. For me that would have represented no growth from the first day of not drinking. ..I agree with this. I also don't agree with this. Whatever works! I am in the same camp as you. I don't think about alcohol anymore. I don't start my day that way because I don't need to...When I first started this process I **needed** support. I was grateful for the treatment center and the AA groups I attended then (as I do now). A this point it's no longer about me. It's about helping others. Other people that today are like me two years ago...I also still identify as an alcoholic because I know that if I drink I'm right back there. It's always there and that's that. I heard a share from a doctor in my regular meeting that suggested he wasn't an alcoholic but a person with *alcoholism.* His treatment is AA...Also I added [not] in your sentence because I think that's what you meant :D..
&gt;But stopping drinking is not the same as being sober...Wow...thank you for this post; truer words to me I have not read on SD (not that there aren't *a lot* of kick-ass posts).  But this speaks deeply and resonates with me as well.  ..Since I'm back again to not drinking with a month under my belt this time I've been thinking a lot about the difference between not drinking and being sober.  When I stopped drinking for almost 10 years from 2000-2009 I don't think I ever truly got sober.  I say that because much of my other behavior that I had attributed to my drinking didn't change.  This time I'm realizing that alcohol fueled and masked reactivity anger fear grief and general bitchiness. If I want to get **sober** then I need to take a look at the other parts of my life and my behaviors that have caused me and others harm...&gt;And if I love myself and I want to do the best for myself then it's pretty hard to do something that actively harms me...So that's the journey this time that I am on too.  I've talked the talk about the *now* accountable communication and self-awareness etc. for years but I know that this talk has often been only intellectual.  Making it real is what will make my sobriety real.  And that is what I want in my life...**"Where attention goes energy flows."** .
This is exactly the way I see it too- only you were able to put it into words. Thanks for taking the time to post this. Well done and much appreciated!
Hello Sam! My name is Lauren and I am not an alcoholic as well. ...Your post really hit home for me as this is very much the approach I am beginning to find. The more separate my life becomes from drinking the more it is just not part of my identity. I just don't drink. I am choosing to love myself and the part of me that drank into oblivion was sad hated herself. She didn't have self respect. The woman I am becoming loves herself takes care of herself lives a healthy lifestyle is active in hobbies. There is no time to drink. There is nothing that makes me feel I need to drink. I have learned I am smart energetic and loving. ..When I give alcohol the power it in a way to me says I am weak I am a slave to this substance my whole life and that's that. And I just don't believe that. I am stronger than my weaknesses and my weaknesses absolutely do not define me. When I decided to love myself and accept myself looking for acceptance in the wrong places just stopped. It was that simple. ...Sure as I am still early in my sobriety there are some days where I find myself thinking of alcohol but it more is in the sense of I used to do this activity drunk how?! I have made many changes in who I interact with and as I meet new people it becomes known that I don't drink not that i have struggled with drinking in the past so I say I'm x days sober or I don't drink ANYMORE. Nope I just don't drink. I accept all my sober weirdness and awkwardness at times and love myself for that now rather than try to hide behind drinking...Thank you so much for posting!
I absolutely love this. I felt some of the same negativity through the morning convincing myself. Don't get me wrong I needed that at the beginning. And some people may need it forever. Approaching 3 months I'm really starting to like who I am. I am excited to start new hobbies even though I have a hard time motivating myself to do much outside of work and school. And a lot of the hobbies I want to do require a lot of money. Ha!. .Congrats on 2 years friend!
I like this. We are what we want to be. We choose our way and what keeps us sober. 
Thank you for sharing. While I still hold the "label" alcoholic as part of me like you've alluded to I don't define myself with it. Being an alcoholic is like being left handed it's true but I go about my day with little regard for it. It is neither positive or negative it just is a part of myself that rarely comes up- often when the can opener is stupid or when someone doesn't want to take a "no" when I say I don't drink...My identity is positive and finding a positive identity has been so important for my recovery: yogini quilter wife minister cat mama. These are what people are going to know about me. These are the roles I identify with and most of my thoughts operate around. The practices related to these roles help me grow. 
Beautifully written and not far of from what I believe AA truly is. ..Ur clearly smart dedicated to recovery and most importantly working to create a change in your self regularly...The only thing that saddens me is reading the posts of the newly sober through the comments. ITs amazing how many of them think they can be where you are without doing what you have done! Ah the ignorance of the newly sober. ..Keep it up Sam ur insight is beautiful. 
I agree with your post. It's funny because it honestly reminds me of Allen Carr's Easy Way books. Once I removed drinking from my identity of myself it has proved much easier to let that flow externally into the rest of my life. 
I love this post. I totally agree...Short story.... I went to a friend's AA celebration and there was a speaker after the coins. He talked about how everyone is a drunk and they are worthless. He said everyone from workers at McDonalds to the police officers that protect our communities are worthless drunks. I was blown away. (So was my police officer friend haha) It much be such a shitty life having to remind yourself that you don't drink because you are a shitty human. I personally don't drink because I LOVE being sober and drinking or drugs couldn't make my life any better so why risk it getting worse?.. Love this subreddit as well. Keep it goin boys! 
&gt;then I fed the part of me that had been withering inside. .. All the things that I talked about doing and never got any closer to. All the things I was curious about but never had the time to explore... Thank you well written... .
Thank you for this post! This resonates with me very much. Over the past few months (even while I was still drinking) I've been thinking about who I am and who I want to be a lot and a few of the things I noticed in my early sobriety is that it feels already like I am becoming a fuller person. Like I will have more time and money to do actually fulfilling things. Not just escape life and gradually get more addicted and more depressed. I think loving yourself and loving life are extremely powerful tools and you only get there by positive actions and positive thoughts. I wanna get "high on life"! 
I'm in the middle on this across your OP and the comments.  The general approach you describe works best for me.  Rather than fighting the evil wolf and giving it attention I choose to focus on life.  ..However I do call myself an alcoholic just to help me not go there and I do need to remember the pain from time to time.  I don't go on mad trips to that dark place and I don't like to be reminded with too much consistency (b/c then I start thinking about IT).  ..Thanks for sharing.
Great post. Sounds like you have a very fulfilling life!
For me it's important to work on the reasons why I was drinking and not do   ..1) Force myself on a daily basis not to drink   .2) Distract myself ..This might work in the early stage but from my personal experience (I relapsed after 1.5 years of sobriety) it didn't work. For me there was a point where willpower wasn't enough anymore and *everything sucked I need a drink*.
Your story is very motivational and I am glad I ran across it. I will try to think less about my problems and more about their solution.
Fantastic POV looking forward to your future post! Alan Watts is the man!
"I don't drink" is something I stumbled across in this sub almost a year ago and it was that phrase that did it for me. So simple. No drama.  Thanks Sam for sharing. 
Best post Ive ever read on here. Thanks.
What Alan Watts books would you recommend?
I kind of posted something similar to this. I used to wear the "alcoholic" label proudly and I used to think it is what made me SPECIAL...but now after 2-1/2 months of sobriety I am starting to identify more with the "ok I don't drink anymore. I can't drink anymore...and that is all I have to know" mindset. I don't focus on it anymore (or I try not to)...I am too busy living my life. Period.  :)
Thanks for the words Sam... officially saved
I love your post!  I am 29 days sober and during my first month I have realized that I am not a good candidate for AA.  I am researching other options like a program called Smart Recovery.  I am attending one of their meetings on Monday.  I'd be interested to read about your Taoist approach as well.
This post was very inspiring and eye-opening to a different way of thinking. I think I'll take some of these words of knowledge thanks Sam for helping contribute to my sobriety! You're awesome!
I'm happy your sober.  
It's been a few days but I'm still thinking about this post and the comments here on self love and identity especially after going to my first meeting yesterday where everyone introduced themselves in the usual way: "I'm Sue and I'm an alcoholic."..The definition of alcoholism according to Google is "an addiction to the consumption of alcoholic liquor or the mental illness and compulsive behavior resulting from alcohol dependency."..My goals are to free myself from that dependency and mental illness not to be permanently trapped and defined by it...I'm wondering at meetings why don't people say "I'm a recovering alcoholic" or "I used to be an alcoholic"? Can you go to a meeting and choose not to say "I'm an alcoholic?"
I am looking forward to reading your "Now-ism in recovery" post! Thank you for sharing:)
I just stumbled across this and I want to say this was very inspirational and thank you so much.
