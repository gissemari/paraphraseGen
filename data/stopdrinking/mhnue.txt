1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable.  ..2. Stopped trying to maintain a usage of alcohol and stopped drinking it completely.  ..3. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.  ..4. Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.  ..5. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others.  ..6. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.  ..7. Having had a rational empowerment as the result of these steps we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs...I am quite new to AA and have been attending an 'agnostic' meeting. They use the standard 12 steps. They all struggle with the 7 God-mentioning ones and I wonder why they don't just drop them. I suppose then the group wouldn't be a part of the AA infrastructure in the same way.  ..Notice I created a new step 2 as actually stopping drinking isn't mentioned in the 12. I have a sense of perspective and I know that the 12 steps have a long track-record. I know my qualification to amend them is only my personal opinion and I don't even have long in recovery. However there is a big confirmation bias at work as all the long-term AA members that vouch for it are the ones who succeeded with it. Those who failed or who succeeded without the 7 religious steps are not hanging around to tell their stories.  ..Anyway what do people think?

THANK YOU....I wish there was an 'agnostic' meeting in my town.  Maybe there is I'm pretty new to town.  I had an AA disappointment tonight- I attended a meeting that's closest to my house and they ended with the Lord's Prayer.  I don't think I'll go back there.
