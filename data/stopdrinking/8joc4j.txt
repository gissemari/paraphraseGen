 I don't drink often however when I do I consume more than I want to more than I say I intend to and so I am slowly reconciling myself to accepting that drinking at all is not good for me anymore. It's a once in a while behavior that has taken on a sinister repetitious pattern. Last night was such an occasion. I had 4 beers instead of 1 or 2 over the course of the evening. I only drink like this when I am alone. When I am with others I can easily moderate my drinking and most of the time when I am with others I don't drink at all. So I am rededicating myself to not drinking today and will continue to do so.  What I struggle with most is that tiny edge of anxiety that I have been numbing with alcohol. My tolerance for the anxiety which often manifests as an almost giddy feeling begins to wear thin and I soothe myself with one drink that then becomes 4. I want to find a better healthier strategy one that will help me develop my self compassion. I will not drink with you today.

I hear you! I started drinking more to help with my anxiety and I drank more when I was alone. It took 15 years but I eventually went from drinking a few beers a couple of nights a week and then to drinking 8 beers every night. The one thing I've learned is that things can and will get worse. I see now that my anxiety is actually worse than when I first started to self-medicate with booze. I'm trying everything and anything to develop a healthier relationship with myself - AA therapy exercise meditation yoga writing...being kind to myself is one of the hardest parts of the journey. 
Yep. I used to use alcohol as a relief from my anxiety. I now use running walking music meditation michael sealey sleep hypnosis on YouTube. I just kept on trying stuff till I found what worked for me (so far). My theory is to do these things regularly BEFORE the anxiety hits. If I leave it to build that's when the cravings hit..IWNDWYT
