I was a bit hesitant to put pics of myself up here but on the off chance that it helps someone else struggling then its all worth it. Here you go - plus a list of things I've done before & after drinking/drugs...**BEFORE**.[Before 1](http://imgur.com/k4WZaIC)..[Before 2](http://imgur.com/wN0yiK8)...**AFTER**.[After 1](http://imgur.com/91jiwsp).[After 2](http://imgur.com/dy3k57K)...**BEFORE**..- Broke my nose blacked out got into fights regularly.- Drank vodka in the morning while commuting to work (also drank vodka/whisky during and after work...).- Pissed the bed.- Consumed so much drugs/alcohol that my dad had to check for my heartbeat because I wouldn't wake up one night.- Lied cheated stole.- Felt less than worthless angry and resentful at other people.- Constant anxiety and panic attacks.- You get the picture.........**AFTER**..- Saved my drink/drug money and went on a 10 day holiday to Turkey (where I didn't drink!!).- Fell in love with a girl.- Got honest with myself went to AA meetings (and set a personal best 49 days in a row with a meeting every day).- Cried laughed smiled.- Got closer to my family.- Got an amazing new job/career opportunity .- Went to Wimbledon .- Showed up to work on time.- Read books.- Traveled explored and visited new places.- Spent money eating out for dinner (who knew that was a thing?!).- Visited family in NYC.- Watched the sunset over canary wharf in London.- Watched the sunrise over rolling blue hills and a magnificent ocean as far as the eye can see in Turkey.- Went to a Chelsea match.- Bought new clothes.- Ran 10K!!.- Went swimming in the sea at morning.- The list goes on.....I can only share my experience - but life gets better richer and more meaningful every day. Sometimes I don't notice it at the time but it's in those ephemeral moments of grace when I'm reminded how lucky I am to be free - today - from drugs and alcohol. Take care friends.
