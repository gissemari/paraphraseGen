It gets easier. I hit a low-bottom and really couldn't stop even after 4 detoxes in 3 years. I literally could not stop drinking once I had 1 drink. My binges would last for days morning noon night. I lost my job my savings everything.  ..It was horrible and dark and I wanted more than anything to stop but kept drinking because it was the only thing I could do...It gets easier. A week gets much better than a day and a month gets much better than a week. ..If you are struggling and are in over your head like I was just know it is possible to turn it around.
