I'm new to this.  I've struggled with bing drinking for 4 years now but just recently admitted to myself and my new therapist that I have a problem.  I relapsed again on Tuesday.  It's the third time in two months.  I hate myself so much right now.   This is all I can get out right now.  I feel like I'm coming apart.

No need to hate yourself. Hate alcohol for what it did to you. ..You can work on this just like the rest of us and you can succeed. 
Welcome. IWNDWYT 
I just recently made my first post here too congrats! ..I believe that admitting to yourself and others that it's a problem and joining a community are such enormous parts of getting and staying sober that we're already on the path to success.
