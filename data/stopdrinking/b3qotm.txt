Just woke up from a dream within a dream (something something Leo Dicaprio) where I was at a social gathering and started drinking out of habit. In this dream I woke up to realize I had been drinking the night before. I was legitimately very ashamed and disappointed in myself and felt hopeless because of how easy it was to fall back into that pattern...Woke up half an hour ago to realize it was all a dream...I take it as a good sign that I associated this behavior as an absolutely bad thing and didn't try to justify my behavior or tell myself it was worth it because I had a good time and maybe I could only drink on special occasions...Still sober though (except in dream world). 17 days and counting. Anyways thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.

I had my first one last night too. I woke up so ashamed that I'd have to reset etc. Phew!! 
I have these with tobacco and drinking.  They definitely mess with your head but it is such a relief when you wake up and know you didn't drink.
