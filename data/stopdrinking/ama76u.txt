Thank you fellow sober warriors for your posts detailing the struggles for messages of encouragement advice suggestions empathy and most of all for  letting me vent without judgment...I get on here like a fiend. Word vomit hits and I become a typing fool. Clickety clack clickety clack on my keyboard. Anxiety which is usually at an all time high either increases or decreases as I type and post. (Weird how that works...).Then come the messages that bring me back to earth..... that remind me that this too shall pass that things outside my head are a lot different from inside it. That inside my head I'm all alone. But outside here there are friends well wishers and genuine human beings...9 months came to my attention more because today is cake day but 9 months ago I couldn't even fathom getting to 9 days let alone 9 weeks or 9 months. Life has definitely taken a turn for the better..I pray for grace to continue along this road. ..Sober on my friends! I love you all and IWNDWYT!
