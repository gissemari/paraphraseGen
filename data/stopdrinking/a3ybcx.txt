Today I celebrate 60 days of sobriety. I am currently in treatment for alcohol addiction with my discharge coming in approximately one week. ..I must say that I have a healthy fear of relapsing again. I pray God continues to strengthen me as I work my program and develop my aftercare plan. ..I lurked here quite a while and the encouragement and support this community had shared lead me to register and subscribe. ..I look forward to celebrating a million more with you.

What's that?  4 seconds per breath?  Sounds shallow - slow down and take deep breaths.....Seriously though congrats!  60 days is a great accomplishment.  I kind of like the notion of thinking of it in breaths or heartbeats.
Congratulations!! I will not drink with you today   I will never drink again and I will never change my mind!! You can do this!!
IWNDWYT!!!!!
