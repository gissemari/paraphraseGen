I have tried and failed to stop drinking before. I want to do it but don't know how nor have faith that I can. Happy to be here reading about others' struggles and successes. Day 1 sober.

I think you can do it. 
I've been in that same boat and still am at day 7.  It's the hardest thing I have ever done including stopping smoking.  I've come to the conclusion that the rest of my life will be one day at a time regarding alcohol but I'm up for it and I know you can be too Muntumwe.  
You can do it.  No question.  ..Can you identify what's tripped you up in previous tries?
