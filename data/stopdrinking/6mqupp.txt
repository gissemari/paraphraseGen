I've not struggled this much since quitting. I'm feeling depressed things are not going so well with the job. On top of that husband left cold beer in the fridge for a week. I ignored it and then I found myself wanting to pop the tap. I want to escape right now. I want to take my mind away from my struggles. I'm really suffering and it's a shock considering how far I've made it with minimal struggle. Does this still happen from time to time? It was bad bad last night I told my husband and I my friend I felt like I was weak right now. He went and dumped the beers. I am feeling hopeless and desperate. These are not my normal feelings. I feel attacked almost. I need insight. I've literally considered just drinking one - but that would not END WELL. I'm feeling so lost right now and reaching out. I'm mad at myself disgusted with myself. I feel like a failure for feeling this way. I've even considered I may need to leave him is drinking affects me that much which it didn't in the last. Im worried and scared. Please share your stories with me...To edit: NOTHING is interesting to me. No tv. No things to do. Not talking to people. I want to be alone but I'm miserable. My interest feels dead...***edit***..I woke up today back to my old self! I feel strong and in a good mood again! I think reaching out helped. I prayed a lot. But I feel super today so I'm very very happy I did not cave during that test of the struggle. I think it could be a simple reminder that no matter how long I'm sober - I must always stay vigilant and not let my guard down. Alcoholism is SNEAKY!!
