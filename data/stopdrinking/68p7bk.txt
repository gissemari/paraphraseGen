Weird how time flies. I didn't drink for a very long time but I did drink heavily in that period of time. Never had a moment where drinking was fun or normal. For the first five years I was drunk every day bar a few enforced stints of sobriety mostly after my DUI  For the last three years I was tipsy or drunk 24/7. But I don't drink anymore. That's what I tell people these days.  Sorry I don't drink.  It slips off my tongue so easily and they think hey no big deal. She doesn't drink...But it is a big deal obviously. That big deal almost cost me my job. My nursing license.  My marriage. My life. (I once injected an entire Novolog pen into my leg in a fit of drunken angst.)..I'm more of a person than I was three years ago. Fleshed out. I'm not a side-character in my own novella anymore. I have interests and hobbies and friends. I have good days and bad days and a lot of days that I'd struggle to categorize as either good or bad...I still struggle to be kind to myself; learning to like myself always seems like a skill just beyond my grasp and these days it's a struggle to nourish my physical body.  But as long as I'm not dead or drunk which is effectively dead than there is always hope for growth and change....[Me today.](http://i.imgur.com/QiUj2Zz.jpg)
