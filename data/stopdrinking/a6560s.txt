Hi Reddit..I'm a college student currently living/studying abroad in Asia. For the past year my parents have been providing me with money to cover my rent living expenses and tuition fees which roughly translates into $2000 USD per month. This took a major turn around a month ago and my financial position is extremely unstable at the moment. I wrote a post about it a few days ago seeking advice as to how my mother can salvage her savings and avoid debt which outlines what my situation is currently like. .https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a5i16v/my_stepfather_lost_his_job_and_racked_up_a_lot_of/?st=JPO1UBJC&amp;sh=d8c3f66d...This is also my post from a year and a half ago for any of you guys wondering about how I got into this situation in the first place. .https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/75v1un/getting_kicked_out_of_my_home_at_18/?st=JPO1ZFZT&amp;sh=7caaa0c9...To give you guys some more info regarding my background I went to rehab in Thailand around 14 months ago in an attempt to battle my substance abuse disorder. Since being discharged I have managed to maintain my sobriety and got my life back on track. I enrolled into a junior college and from there got into a private Asian university. I obtained an International Foundation Diploma in Psychology and am currently working towards my Higher Diploma. I have approximately 8 months of schooling left until I acquire the HD which allows me to progress into my final 12 month course that grants me a degree from a relatively reputable UK university. ..Upon finding out the news from my mother I began trying to find some means of providing for myself. It's quite difficult in my situation because the country I'm in forbids foreign students from holding any type of employment. I got offered to work under the table at a bar getting paid 6.50 an hour but upon contemplation I chose to turn it down. Being a white guy in an Asian country I felt like it'd have been very myopic of me to work at a busy restaurant whilst wearing a uniform. If any immigration officers ever visited I'd stick out like a sore thumb and risk getting deported losing any chances of obtaining my degree as well as forfeiting the money spent on my tuition fees all for 6.50 an hour. I began searching for other ways I could earn some money which led me to the following endeavor...I got into the field of escorting. I signed up for multiple dating apps such as tinder and Grindr and began promoting myself as a "companion escort". I was willing to have dinner with people accompany guys out for drinks (I drank Coke light) and go to movies. Essentially anything that didn't require me to take my clothes off or engage in any sexual acts. Even though I had done nothing sexual the intent was still there and hanging out with these guys was uncomfortable to say the least. My boundary was that the activity had to take place out in the public and that I'd never agree to go to anyone's home. ..I did that for a week and a half having met 3 guys in total and making $400 in that span of time. It was quite honestly eating into my soul and everyday I'd have to entertain dozens upon dozens of guys asking me for sexual favors in exchange for monetary compensation which I had to deny and explain what my actual services are. The men I did meet with never tried to make any advances but were obviously very keen to have sex with me judging off of their text messages. I'm guessing it was their way of grooming me. It was overall pretty degrading and was becoming somewhat detrimental to my recovery-centered lifestyle. Alas I had no other options. This was my only foreseeable means of livelihood. ..I then met this guy off Grindr let's call him Luke. He reached out to me and requested my services. After ensuring that he knew what to expect from our rendezvous I went out to a restaurant to meet him. He eventually inquired as to why I was doing this shit. I ended up telling him my whole story and shed a few tears halfway through. The man seemed very concerned for me and told me how unsafe my choice of profession is. He emphasized that sooner or later one of my clientele would eventually do something unwarranted and once that happened I'd go all out and start offering sexual favors in exchange for money. He said once I start I won't stop. That once I start within a few months time I'd be saying yes to every single request on those dating apps. That I'd eventually start questioning my own sexuality and start thinking I'm gay in an attempt to rationalize the things I'm doing. That it'd fuck me up more than I could ever imagine and eventually lead to my imminent relapse further exacerbating whatever situation I was in previously. At the end of that lecture he offered me a job. ..The work offered to me was quite simple and the pay was extraordinarily good. I was essentially a recruitment researcher. Luke was the owner and director of his own head-hunting firm and made quite a lot of money doing so judging by his enormous home and his two maids. My responsibilities consisted of searching for candidates on LinkedIn who met the assigned criteria properly vetting them sending them a LinkedIn inmail and inserting their information onto an excel database. I was getting paid $25 an hour doing so. I have been doing that for the past 2 weeks and managed to accumulate $950 doing so. On the days my lectures would start at noon I'd come in at 8 and work until 12 making a whopping hundred dollars which could supply a weeks worth of food for me. I worked with him inside his home office and he'd direct me as to what to do and how to properly vet potential candidates. ..I was ecstatic to have received such an offer. Not only am I getting paid $25 an hour I'm also getting a free home cooked lunch made by his maid. The money I was making was more than enough to support myself. I felt incredibly lucky to have gotten this job. I was getting paid under the table everyday in cash and was gaining some valuable work experience that could potentially be of use to me once I finish my education. I couldn't be happier. It seemed like things were finally looking up for me and that I had for once gotten a break from it all. As you probably expected this took another turn for the worse 2 days ago. ..Upon coming into work I noticed that Luke seemed a bit off that morning. We greeted one another and I began setting up my computer. He was noticeably agitated by something but didn't mention anything. Half an hour into work I asked if it'd be okay if I turn the AC off seeing as how my table is right underneath it. He said yes and showed me as to where the remote is located. I turned it off and resumed with my work. Around 5 minutes later he blows the fuck up saying how hot he is and how entitled I am for having turned off the AC. He begins yelling stating that I'm selfish for prompting him to conform to my needs and not considering his. How I come in and just change the temperature to my liking almost like I'm the boss or something. It was quite scary due to how abruptly it all occurred. I apologized profusely ran over to the remote and turned it back on but he kept going on and on about my entitlement...After 10 minutes of him scolding me he tells me to return back to work which I abide to. I'm now feeling very on edge and super anxious. Half an hour into it he suggests we go over the applicants I managed to find so far. He begins looking at their CVs one by one and begins berating me for every single one of them. He manages to find one thing off with each candidate and condescendingly asks me what is wrong with them. I frantically try to analyze their resum  and muster up some half-assed response as to why they don't fit the job description but it's not what he was looking for. He piercingly stares into my eyes and suddenly starts repeatedly banging the table with an unwarranted amount of aggression. At this point I legitimately feel like I'm in danger. His mannerisms are eerily similar to those of my stepfather who frequently  physically/verbally abused me throughout my life. I honestly feel like I'm on the brink of a break down but try to maintain my composure. ..After another 10 minutes of this he orders me to delete them all and start fresh but not before he berated me for having "wasted those 12 minutes of his precious time" he spent castigating me. By this point I feel like crying but I push through and keep on working. I'm now deathly afraid of asking him any questions even though I'm technically still in training. He asks whether I can update the spreadsheet with some new information to which I reply "sure" and begin doing so. The prolonged piercing stare makes a comeback as he looks away from his computer. As I start fulfilling the task he begins mockingly mimicking the way I said "sure" for the next thirty seconds. He just kept on repeatedly saying "sure" over and over with a grin on his face while staring at his computer like a goddamn madman. To say it was unnerving would be an understatement.  This ordeal goes on and on all the way up until I had to leave for my lecture. ..The whole time in class I couldn't focus on what was being taught. I ended up sending him a text message stating how I felt about the events that transpired at work that day and asked if he could please refrain from doing that. I reminded him of my abusive childhood that I previously told him about the first time we met. I emphasized how today's situation triggered the same feelings I've had to endure all those years and how negatively it affected me. I politely asked him to be more patient and sensitive with me because such a work environment will be detrimental to my performance and efficiency...He replied back saying how I'm again being entitled by telling him what to do and acting like I'm the boss when he's in fact my employer. He said he had nothing to do with my past and to keep him and this job out of it. He essentially just disregarded everything that I had said. I'm really not looking forward to going back. I was so eager to work up until that day and now I'm genuinely scared to go back. Even if this was a one time event I'm afraid of it happening again. The man is just not mentally stable. Going back to escorting crossed my mind but I really really do not want to do that. ..I have 2.3k that I managed to save up over the year along with some of the money that came from him. A lot of it will have to be spent on food and rent. The only thing that is paid for is my tuition fees. I need at least 1.4k coming in each month in order to survive and get my goddamn diploma but I'm set on getting my degree. If I leave this country without it I'm quite honestly fucked. The diplomas aren't recognized in any American universities and aren't considered as transferable credits. I'll essentially go back with nothing to my name and it'd all have been a massive waste of time. I need to stay here long enough to get this degree but that's 19 months away.  I have no clue as to what I should do. There's no way I'm going to abandon this job right now despite the recent events because there's just no other viable solutions. ..I really need advice on what the hell I can do. This took me a long time to write out but I hope I can get some insight into what the possibilities are for me. This is really starting to affect me and I already had thoughts about just pushing the fuck it button and relapsing. I just don't know what to do. Please help me.....

Unfortunately I have no advice for you in this difficult situation...I am sending my compassion and hope things improve...All I know is that adding alcohol to any situation will only worsen it...Please let us know how you're doing.
Man that sounds really hard sorry you're in this situation. ..The only thing I can think of would be to lower the amount of money you need to live. You said $100 could buy weeks of food but you need $1400/month to live which makes it sound like your rent must be way too high. Can you rent just a room or move in with a roommate? If you can lower your rent expenses you could take a different lowkey (non-abusive) under the table job and make it work if $100 buys weeks of food. ..But I'm sure if you posted this in personalfinance or financialadvice those folks might have more ideas to share!   ..Good luck to you I truly hope this works out (and quickly). 
I would book an airline ticket home asap while I still had the money to pay for one...If the diploma isn't recognized by an American university it will not be recognized by a reputable employer.  Sorry to say that but that's the facts...There are plenty of full-time jobs in the U.S. that would support you while attending school on a part-time basis.
To me it seems like you feel trapped because you feel you *can't* leave him *can't* leave the study without the credit *can't* leave the country and get back to resources. ..I sometimes wonder where I got the idea that everything was always at stake and that I had to persevere unprotected and alone through danger until I was rags and bones. I had never known another way...I believe we have the freedom and time in life to make a new vision that puts our healing and protection first to get away from abusive and trapped situations to think creatively from the wide view and make our stories meaningful and useful in a new context. But we only have the power if we stay sober.
Something has got to change...One skill / resource you seem to have is your sobriety...Have you tried networking at AA meetings where there are expats?  Perhaps you could find work in the rehab?   
Use the money to go home to the States. See if your mother can break her lease. Get a small apartment with your mother in a cheap city ideally one with a strong Russian community. Get a job in fast food or retail and save hard then get back to college. ..My first thought is that this man is grooming you. Yes he said all those lovely things and sounded like a rescuer. He also hired you as an escort in the first place and I can almost guarantee wanted to have sex with you. He was kind so you confided in him and now he has a wealth of material with which to manipulate you...Use your savings and get out *now.*
For emphasis here is a quote from a pimp:..&gt;If you meet a female she don't **got no family** she don't got **nowhere to stay** but you got a little bit of money you doing for her you putting a roof over her head feeding her ... she going to end up trusting you depending on you...And this is an article about how pimps operate:  ...[http://apps.urban.org/features/theHustle/index.html](http://apps.urban.org/features/theHustle/index.html)..Does this sound like Luke's behaviour at all?..&amp;#x200B;
Yikes! This interaction with Luke sounds all kinds of bad. You're only 18. I'm in my late 30s and I've had to manage people in their teens and early 20s - it is critical to avoid any touch of inappropriate behavior and every single thing about this interaction is a red flag. I will give you one piece of advice to try to help you out : to some people you are a commodity. I hope that you choose to come back to the US before you run out of money and get into problems - you don't want to be under this guy's thumb. If you aren't aware there are a large network of sober livings here in the US that offer affordable room and board. Good luck buddy and be safe. 
I see lots of red flags here but I'm going to make some suggestions about your study because I work in tertiary education. If it was me I think I'd really check that that this qualification is the right one to get me work (TLDR at end)...&amp;#x200B;..First students drop out all the time for family reasons.  "I have to go home to help out my family for a while" is a really good reason to take a break. Many training providers can put fees in abeyance (hold them til later) until you can come back (if you choose to) - you could ask them about this...&amp;#x200B;..Secondly here's some suggestions of things to check out:..1. I'm not in the UK but from everything I've seen there aren't 'mostly reputable' Universities. There are lots of smallish universities all around England/the UK that are very reputable. The Times Higher Education Supplement puts out an annual list of the good universities around the world - if your accrediting university is on this you're fine. If not you could phone one on the list that's near your accrediting university and ask them if your accrediting university is reputable or not.  ..If your training provider and the accrediting institute are not reputable you may find it hard to get work based on the degree.  Which brings me to .....&amp;#x200B;..2. It could be very useful to contact potential employers at home in the field of work that you're studying and ask what they think of your intended qualification. Do they recognise that? What do they recommend you do if you want to get work in that field?  Of course your training provider says it is - but what do real employers say?..&amp;#x200B;..3. The cross-credit thing concerns me: where I work  we regularly review international qualifications. If we won't cross credit courses at all it's because they don't cover what ours do or are clearly below the standard we require. If colleges/universities in my home area won't cross-credit I'd be seriously wondering if the qualification covers what it should. ..You can download course outlines from many colleges - find ones you know are reputable and offer a similar qualification then dive into their website til you find the individual courses.  Find course outlines or links to lecturers' websites and check that they cover what your courses do use similar textbooks have similar assessment difficulty etc...&amp;#x200B;..4. For cross-crediting we need to see learning outcomes course outlines and maybe assessments that you do for your course - it's really worth saving these for the future no matter what or where you study...&amp;#x200B;..I hope this helps - good luck with your choices...&amp;#x200B;..TLDR: People drop out all the time - it's been a blast but it's ok if you want to cut your losses and go somewhere else. You come back later if you want. Before going further I'd really check that my accrediting university is reputable and  that actual real potential employers think the qualification will help me.
You need to quit that job. The guy sounds like a sexual predator.
