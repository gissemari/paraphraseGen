yeah guys i have totally planned a relapse in my head.  future tripping. i'll be traveling at the beginning of summer and have said fuck everything i know to be right and true and let myself fantasize about a relapse.  how easy it would be..this is the ugly side of this disease y'all..planning out where i'll order booze from have it delivered to my hotel.  take a week off.  i'll be alone my favorite time to drink.  i'll listen to music.  i'll reach out to people i've been meaning to talk to because honestly when i'm not drinking i don't really want to talk with them..i'll pretend it somehow makes me better--better.  that it will be good to "turn my brain off for a few days".  .but oh that fucking slippery slope..honestly.  it would be easy.  drink for a few days. return home. lie to myself and everyone around me but somehow convince myself it's ok and i deserved it and blah blah blah ego ego ego..then get married a month later and know that i'm lying to myself.  .future tripping y'all..take my advice.  don't entertain the thought of a june work trip in may.  and if you do play it out until the end.  if i drink for a few days the beast will be roaring back in my life.  my anxiety will be set on fire for a minimum of a month.  nightmares night terrors.  not enough anxiety medication in the world to tame the beast.  waking up in the middle of the night not knowing if i'm alive out of breath..facing my sponsor and other sober people in my life lying.  actually lying.  because it would suck so bad to have to tell the truth and then do double my efforts i've put in.  when right now--i'm in a damn good place..then knowing i got away with it.  wondering when the next time i can get away with it will be.  it won't be able to come soon enough.  i'll carry anger around with me and it will affect those around me.  .i won't be able to drink caffeine that well.  because with how fucked my body is i can either have caffeine or alcohol but not both.  my body was getting run the fuck down.  .see at 6 months i think it's easy to forget how much fucking better i am.  my days are mostly level.  i work an insane job and still have other life stressors but internally i'm not fighting off a chemical imbalance created by alcohol..now my shitty days are when i eat too many wings and wake up with a salt hangover and i worry if I'll look good enough on my wedding day in 2.5 months. ..i got caught up guys.  but the best part is.  after i type this.  it's just words. i'm still sober.  ..last night i had a drinking drink.  but the best part was.  i woke up sober...it seeeeeeems like the best part is always being sober...i will remain sober.  at least for today. and then after that continue each 24 hours ahead of me.  ..not sure if others struggled around the 6 month mark or just in general got caught up when you knew better and could do better.  i would love to hear.  ..thanks and love to everyone out there.  we're doing something incredibly important for ourselves.

My alcoholic brain comes up with some serious  gymnastics to make drinking attractive despite the mountains of evidence I have to the contrary. ..I don't mind the odd drinking dream - its a  nudge from my subconscious a reminder about all the consequences waiting for me  if I let other things get in the way of my recovery...Here's to another sober 24 hours!
&gt;it seeeeeeems like the best part is always being sober...Well put. This has certainly been true for me.
