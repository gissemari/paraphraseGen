This week as my sugar cravings hit an all time high I allowed myself to purchase some dark chocolate. I read it is good for the heart and some such nonsense. Inside Dove chocolates as you may or may not be aware are needlepoint pillow sayings and platitudes. However tonight two of them really spoke to me. These are obviously not original sayings as one of them is close to a quote from a favorite movie of mine but I needed to hear them nonetheless. Maybe they'll speak to some of you fellow sobernauts (or lurkers) too. ..1. You are never too old and it is never too late. ..2. Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay it's not the end...So for anyone out there struggling it's not too late and it's not the end. There are still good times to be had.
