Hi guys. What is the closest you have come to relapse in your current sobriety and what did you do to evade it?..I had a very very scary night last night where I was overcome with a near psychotic compulsion to drink or take a benzo for 3-4 hours. I havent had alcohol in almost three years and I haven't had a drug in five months. I haven't had a craving like this ever and it was very upsetting. I had to play the tape forward nearly a hundred times. Sometimes I worry if I become engaged enough to enjoy my life my intense grip on my sobriety would losen. It was easy to stay craving-less when I wasn't putting myself out there and wasn't making progress. I think I have to start being more honest about the whole picture even if it's shameful to admit. ..If it is alright with all please share your story and moments of deep relapse related struggle. It would help me and maybe others in these times.

I was just under a year sober and I had decided to test the dating waters. I pursued this woman and she got really into me (because I acted like that was what I wanted) but when she got comfortable and said she loved me I FREAKED OUT and realized I had to end it before she got more hurt...She was sleeping in my bed it was 3 in the morning and if I had had alcohol in the house I would have drank it...My takeaway: I ended the relationship as nicely and clearly as I could. I shared about it at meetings and I threw myself harder into step work. It was an eye opening experience to say the least.
It wasn't close to a relapse but my wife's margarita looked very tasty at yesterday's dinner. I spent a couple minutes thinking about just one sip a tiny taste just one... then went back to my water. Among other factors I was very **hungry** a little **angry**/irritated from traveling with my family father and stepmother and **tired** from a great day of hiking...The closest I've come to a relapse have been quiet times when things are good and I'm alone. There is a strong "no-one would know" component to my alcoholic voice's whispering.
Early on I'm in a constant battle with my mind.  I came home last night from playing soccer and my fiancee had drank most of a bottle of wine but there was still enough left for a small glass.  The rational part of me that wants to make sobriety work suddenly went quiet and in my head I started thinking "One glass is fine since that's all the alcohol we have in the house".  ..I set the goal for myself to make it through the night without touching it.  And I did and I feel good about it.  I know it's going to be harder and there are going to be days where my job or my relationship with my fiancee or other factors will make me want to drink.  I don't know how I'll get through those times but I imagine it'll be a combination of coming here and talking to others I know who have quit drinking.
