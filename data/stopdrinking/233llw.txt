Technically one year and two days. (Sorry I've been busy!)..I don't have much to say except that the past 3-4 months this subreddit has been one of the cruxes of my recovery. For every single one of you I owe an epic debt of gratitude. ..=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=..Here's what I posted on FB:..One year ago today I ended my relationship with drugs and alcohol. ..I lost everything: my mind some of my dearest friends my home in Brooklyn my identity and my only known way to cope with life's ups and downs for the past 16+ years...It hasn't been an easy year nor do I hold out hope for an easy life. It has been a brave year a timid year and an excruciatingly honest year. Bully for me: I love a challenge and I love creating things. This includes a dynamic existence. ..The picture you see on the left was taken 4/12/13 and is the last moment I ever took drugs. I'd popped half an Adderall to nurse a hangover and smoked a bunch of weed. I put the pipe down behind me so the picture could be taken. The photo on the right is me today. ..Everything and I do mean everything is different. My days are often more surreal to me than a Goliath trip (for which I was known). But I am grateful happy and hopefully still funny even on my lowest low day. Besides myself I do not know *one* person who committed to sobriety around the same time as I did who has not relapsed at least once. Relapse happens but the point remains: This is not a life for the weak..."I've always believed clear-eyed sobriety was for the harder hearted." - G.

congrats ..I hope what you're doing keeps working
That's  a big damn deal!..I hope you never have one year sober again. Remember the first year's given the second one's earned
Congratulations my friend! I can't wait to be at that point myself. At this point the irritability is really getting to me and it's all I can do to keep my volatile attitude under wraps...Looking forward to my PAWS symptoms being GONE!
Congrats!
