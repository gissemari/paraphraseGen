I'm now four months sober from Drinking Alcohol like most alcy's I use to be able to down a 5th of whiskey and still stand. I can finally say that I'm glad I've put those days behind me. \(After a lot of struggle and temptation\). I work in the restaurant industry and as tempting as it is I'm at the point where I'd rather drink a non\-alcoholic drink \(virgin Cesar soda water\). I'm about to be a bar back at a new restaurant. I realize now that I may have to be forced to taste beer in the near future esp if I ever get promoted to being a server. Here's the thing. Until recently I was scared and anxious that this would lead to a relapse and all my hard work will go down the drain \(replaced booze with hitting the gym and other activities\). But I remembered what one of my best friends who's been sober for 2 years told me. He stopped counting how many days hes been sober a year ago. I realized that Im reaching the point where I dont feel the need to fixate on how many days of not having even one drop of alcohol under my belt and just live my new life not being a alcoholic anymore. Im not gonna let my whole world come crashing down because of one little sip that I may have to take for a job. I can proudly say that Im strong enough to say fuck going back to getting black out drunk every weekend. Has anyone else ever had a similar experience or realization during there journey?

Good luck !  Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
This reminds me of advice I was given regarding doctors appointments. I used to always drink after them. Now I know they are a trigger I plan stuff to do afterwards to cope with the anxiety. I imagine you can do the same with sipping beer. Just anticipate being hugely tempted afterwards and have a plan in place to a) relieve the stress/ fear and b) deal with any cravings. Easy :)
