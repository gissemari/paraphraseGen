Hi guys!..I'm currently at 3 weeks dry. Yup I've had my badge reset - *again* - only to fall of the wagon. And again. And again. I can't count all the times I've tried to quit in all honesty...This time it feels different though. It feels great. *I* feel great. I feel so much more free. I'm not really sure what exactly changed between all the other times I've tried to quit and this time. Maybe it's the fact that there's more at stake than ever -- this is my own life I could be sabotaging! -- or maybe it's the fact that I'm being so much more honest with myself...I've lied about it hid it been in denial about it been desperate for it for so long. It's tied to my problems with depression (not sure which came first to be fair). It's been the cause of some major relationship problems - actually my only relationship problems: why should my husband trust me if he's caught me in my lies if he's found my secret stash before? It's been detrimental to my health: my sleeping my eating and my very *being* habits all took a toll whenever it was a part of my life...It feels harsh and refreshing to be able to look back on it this way. It's like jumping into a bitterly cold lake. There's an element of shock and pain but you feel more alive that's for sure...Just to give context to what will follow: I'm currently living away from where I consider home as I try to finish up a degree. My husband visited a few weeks ago and from the day of his visit on I've been clean. ..Some progressions:..* First it was the active thinking: today I won't drink. Today I can't drink. Today my husband is visiting and I can't go back on my promise to him; I can't break more promises to him. Today we are going to his boss's party and I will DD. Today we're going to a wedding and I'll politely decline the wine they serve. Today we'll go to our favorite sushi restaurant and I will not think about the plum wine they have. Oh my husband - who perhaps never realized how bad I'd made it for myself and how deeply in trouble I was - is saying I could actually have a glass of the wine? Well today I will say "thank you dear but no thank you."..* The week after my husband left to go back home I had a jolting realization one day. I was headed home after an early therapy session. It would have been a perfect window to make a detour pick up a bottle of wine and drink until my world was fuzzy. Then keep drinking. And eventually regardless of how sick I felt decide to finish the bottle. That didn't happen though: I was on the bus home and I suddenly realized that not only was I not planning to do this *I hadn't even thought to plan to do it.* I hadn't had to *fight* the thought to plan to do it. I was just going home. There was no long internal discussion about how "I could but I shouldn't but I had *time* but I REALLY SHOULDN'T but what's the harm in one bottle? It's only one bottle and besides I haven't drunk in a week." I've had that talk with myself more times than I can count and I usually lose. And instead there I was on the bus home and *I hadn't even had that talk.* It was just... absent...* The week after that at my next therapy appointment I realized I hadn't reveled in how I hadn't thought about it because I was another step further. The pattern of not drinking is getting stronger and easier. The impulsive thoughts are fewer and further between. I can't rejoice in winning that little internal battle because those little internal battles aren't popping up. I don't drink period. Not today not tomorrow...* It's become easier to say no and to tell people I'm saying no. A friend recently confessed that she was getting older and can't drink the way she used to; she suffers more from hangovers. "I recently decided to stop drinking" I told her. It felt good to say it out loud and to be public about it. I didn't tell her how much damage it had done and how much I made my husband suffer from my lies and how it used to burrow in my mind parasite-like bidding me against my will. I didn't tell her that while I feel really good now this is and must be a life-long decision for me. Every day for the rest of my life actively or passively I will have to decide not to drink. Instead I told her that "I feel great" because I do...* From talking to my therapist (and being honest with her about my previous struggles and my current path) I realize that I'm thinking about not drinking differently too. I used to think of all the things I'd be missing out on: I'd miss having a champagne toast on New Year's Eve. I'd miss seasonal beers like that darned pumpkin variety. I'd miss making sangria with my dad when visiting home. I'd miss I'd miss I'd miss. Now I think about what I've gained: relief. Transparency. Honesty. My relationship with my husband is so much better since I don't have anything to hide from him. I'm more honest and open about *everything* since I'm not fearfully guarding my Pandora's Box of hidden alcohol. I've gained memories and experiences. I no longer have to worry about what I might have said that I don't remember or what I might have done or if anyone heard me puking after drinking way too much. Everything that I've done over the last three weeks are things I *know* I've done. That is freeing in of itself! I've reclaimed my actions and with them a big sense of myself...That brings me to last night. I dreamt I left a party and was handed a tiny jar of something alcoholic as a party favor. I dreamt I was weak that I unscrewed the lid and took a sip. It was burning and metallic and unsavory. In my dream it reminded me of tequila - which was never even one of my preferred drinks. I wonder why it was in my dream. Maybe because it reeks of desperation to me?..And after that I felt real and raw emotions - shame disappointment anger at myself a great sorrow that I'd betrayed myself and humiliation that I'd done something so foolish even though I've been riding this great high for the last few weeks in my bone-dry life. In the moments after waking my muddled mind was still thinking of how I was going to break it to my husband and therapist that I'd screwed up *again* and how could they ever have faith in me?..I was so relieved that it was just a dream. I don't think I ever dreamt about drinking even when I was a drunk. I'm impressed that my brain presented this scenario - like a timely warning. "Don't rest on your laurels. If you do something this dumb you'll feel those emotions a thousand times over. **Drinking isn't worth it - not even in your dreams.**"..---..Thanks for reading. I just wanted to share! When I'm done with my degree and back with my husband if and when an opportunity to drink comes up I'll sit down and have the full talk with him - "dear I love that you have faith in me but I'm a recovered alcoholic and I will never drink again" - that I think is best done in person. As it is I will continue to take this day by day and be honest with myself and others that "thank you I'm not drinking for personal reasons."..Stay strong my sobernauts. When I'm off this high - when it gets hard again (as I know it will) - I'm happy to know I have my own little support group right in my pocket to keep me going. <3 ..---..Edits: typos and such..Edit Edit: [great reddit post on drinking dreams for those who haven't seen it yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
