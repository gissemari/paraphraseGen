It's been a long time since I've really posted anything and I just wanted to say thank you to every person on here.  Every day I read your posts and gain inspiration and insight into the daily struggle that we all go through.  I've taken it one day at a time and come a long way from the person I was almost 300 days ago.  So far I've lost 25 pounds and actually enjoy my days instead of constantly worrying about stuff that is out of my control.  That's not to say that life doesn't throw some curve balls my way every so often but at least my knee jerk reaction isn't to run away from them any more.  When I first stopped drinking I couldn't imagine any other life than the one I had been constantly drowning in.  But with time my perspective began to change and the things that really mattered in my life began to shine through the haze.  I still take it one day at a time and remain thankful for the gift of sobriety.  I also remain grateful to everyone on here who shares their struggles joys and sound advice.
