It's okay.  I'm glad you came back to try again.  That takes strength and courage.  You care and you're trying.  I think it's really good that you're reaching out to your family and to us for help.  Please treat yourself with kindness; I've found that being gentle and encouraging with myself does worlds more good than berating myself for my failures.
It's OK to scream and cry to let it all out. And then take it one day one hour one minute at at time back to sobriety. You are stronger than you know you REALLY are. And we're out here pulling for you today. IWNDWYT. 
The devil oppressor knows no end to its evil. Vigilance strength courage and smurfiness to you comrade.  IWNDWYT.
I'm almost sure you know this already but there is the /r/leaves subreddit for quitting weed. I will not drink with you today!
I was in your shoes a couple months ago. I decided to quit smoking and the. Filled the hole with booze. My badge is completely sober time. Get a good support system. People you can trust it sounds like your Mom is a good start. Check out the book This Naked Mind it's super helpful.  It does get better with a lot of patience and determination. Be easy on yourself. It sounds like you have had some really rough times so if you feel like drinking just play the time forward to where it is going to take you. Good luck. IWNDWYT
