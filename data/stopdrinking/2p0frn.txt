A lot of the recent posts mention holiday parties and dinners where there are "free" drinks or "open" bars.  My office party last night featured unlimited beer and wine and I'm sure other spirits were flowing.  So I thought it was time to revisit my there-is-no-free-booze-rant.  ..I was just looking at the 2014 poll results which mirrored my impressions of our demographic from 2013 and before: most of us self-identify as *alcoholics or problem drinkers* so matter who is actually "purchasing or buying" the alcohol we pay big time if we drink if we drink uncontrollably like I was always at risk of doing after the first drink and if we then act while impaired especially drive.  We pay by reintroducing alcohol to our recovering bodies and brains and we risk not only our lives but the lives of innocent others.  ..Remember **there is no FREE booze**--in my case the very idea of free booze is my alkie brain pinging away to see if I am vulnerable to distortions and rationalizations for relapse.  I'm not drinking TODAY only no matter what.

Thanks /u/coolcrosby (if I had a dollar for every time I said that...)..Free ^dom ^from booze is fantastic!
Free add-ons to the free booze include drama divorce death ( or wishing you were)
I'm packing a (*rather large*) chocolate bar in my bag for my holiday party tomorrow as well as driving myself so I can leave when I'm ready. And I'm very looking forward to devouring said chocolate bar without risk of becoming a psychopath in front of my boss. 
There is no such thing as a free drink if you are anything like me.  One drink nearly cost me my life on numerous occasions!
Great post. I needed to read this prior to this weekend where "free booze" will be around. I've been down that road... No more.
Excellent perspective /u/coolcrosby!  Thanks!
Great advice thanks. 
A company I recently left just had their Xmas party complete with open bar. I found out someone was escorted out because they overindulged and performed a very raunchy version of "I touch myself" by the Divinyls during karaoke. ..Booze may not cost you money but there are other prices to pay. 
Thanks for the reminder. I wouldn't drink drano if it was free either...Edit: wow gold! Thanks kind stranger!
So true.  
You'll never regret not getting wasted at the company christmas party. That can have long lasting effects on your career. For me even a little bit changes me and I become obnoxious. I'd rather not bring that into my work life.
