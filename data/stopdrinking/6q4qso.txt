More than once I saved myself from relapse by telling myself "on day 91 you can drink as much as you want. But for these 90 days there are no excuses." On day 91 will I drink? Will I set a new goal of 180 days? I'm not thinking about that now.

That's a great mentality. Reminds me of how I used to get myself to the gym. "If you don't like it after 10 mins you can go home." I never went home until I got a full workout in. 
Sweet! Keep up the strong mindset!
Congrats on 44 days.  I won't drink with you today.  I know twice after 30 days I decided to get some wine.  So beware of big round #s. :)
I use a similar tactic: tomorrow you can drink if you decide to. But for today you've decided to remain sober. Wake up repeat.
