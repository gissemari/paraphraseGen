We are in a college town I knew when we moved in together that she was in recovery. She is a really nice person I don't have any personal problems with her we aren't friends or anything though. I've recently started finding empty beer cans around the apartment she basically holes inside her room except going to class and the bathroom( I don't think she even goes to the kitchen to eat often). I don't know if I should do anything or intervene? Its steadily getting worse and I don't know what to do she was a good roommate when we moved in together but now she doesn't clean plays loud music leaves trash and alcoholic containers around the house dirty dishes and my room is close to the bathroom so I can hear when she goes in to get sick after drinking too much. She doesn't have a job or anything she's a student and I think her parents pay for everything they paid for her to go to an expensive rehab this summer. The point of this rant is that Idk what I could do to help her or should I just mind my business and try to live with this?

Would it be possible for you to move out or to move her on? I would find that very difficult to live with!
The issue is if you call her out and offer no help no recourse and no support: you're just setting her up for having a fucking bad day...If I said anything I might say "you don't seem like yourself today. Wanna have dinner with me?" 
Look into al-anon on campus. Contact her parents. This isn't your problem and you're going to need to find a new roommate. Again: contact her family. 
It sounds like she needs someone to lean on. Alcohol addiction is a lonely disease. God I hated when my brother was a judgemental prick. My parents and friends helped me out of the abyss. When alcohol is involved everything else gets ignored. Be cool with her. She sounds fragile right now.
