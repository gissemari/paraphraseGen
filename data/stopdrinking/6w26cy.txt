I have the day off and just took an amazing nap. I had a dream that I went back to my college town (US town but it was a weird combination of US and Germany...not sure what that was about). I connected with old friends at a bar and in the dream struggled to decide whether to get an actual drink. When I decided against it I then ran around the bar trying to quietly order a non-alcoholic drink so I could have something in my hand...I'm even sober in dreamland! That was weird!

I had the same thing happen to me last night! I had a dream where I went to an old friends house (which we all used to drink and party way too much) and his mother gave me a hug and said she was proud that I finally decided to stay sober. Weird
