I'm into day 5 of being  really  sober. Meaning in the past I've stopped for a month here week or 2 there then felt  in control...but always started again quickly ramping up to daily heavy drinking (then repeat cycle a million more times). But a post I read here on this SD community made something click and 5 days ago I committed to the cause-this time I'm really in. Day 123 I felt super elated happy hopeful...giddy even. Day 4 struggle but success. I went to my in-laws and everyone was drinking heavily and I actually had to field the  why aren't you drinking  questions (as usually I'm the first to have 3-4 into me right off the bat then keep on going). I said I was taking a break. No one really was too concerned. I got the usual bit of pressure but it didn't bother me. The struggle was making drinks. Usually that would be the time that I would be sneaking like 5-6 swigs while under the guise of being a good helper. I was thinking  oh go on one drink is fine...you're doing great! Enjoy the party . I stood there for a good few minutes thinking and trying to unconvince myself. Then I realized I am stronger than that. I've already made it this far and it feels good. That was my success story. I did it! Today is a little harder - I'm struggling to find the happy feeling I had...but hopefully every day gets easier? End rant. Thanks for listening.

I think I would have told them to make their own damned drinks...Sorry Witching Hour here and it always makes me a little agitated.  :)
Definitely be careful making other drinks. You were strong this time and that's awesome great job! Next time it might not be the same outcome though. Keep up the good work and the good thoughts! IWNDWYT
