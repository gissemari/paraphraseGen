I relapsed. That's what happens. It isn't fun it doesn't feel good and it's not under control. Today would have been 60 days sober but instead I'm hungover. I will not drink with you today.

Could you please share the circumstances that led you to drink again so that others can use it as a lesson?

Don't be too hard on yourself. One day drunk and another hung over isn't anything compared to 60 days sober! Get back on the wagon. I hate falling off too it hurts my soul... but just get back on :)

Sounds like your survival instinct still works though. Here you are reaching out to the right people when you felt you needed to. It's a step in the right direction. People have gone through this before you and they will after you. You will never be alone in this. You. Can. Do. This. 
Welcome back!  ..Try to learn from your triggers and do something different next time!
