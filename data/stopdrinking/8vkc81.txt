I've seen others herethey always have some reason to do it.Be it familyfriendsSOsor simply themselves...Lately I've hit a point where I don't really care bout anything. I don't have friends or family or anything. I don't really care if I lose my shitty job anymore.And if I had to do it for myself I would've never done it...BPD makes it hard to believe that anything is worth it.The job definitely isn't tbh.But I don't think I am either....So yeah....guess I don't have a reason...?Do I even belong here?....Also I'm scared I'll relapse when I get paid this month.Any ideas?.

Would you like to know how things possibly could change?  Would you be at all interested if they did?  In that case there truly is nothing to lose by finding out   in the name of finding out what lies down the path less taken iwndwyt.
