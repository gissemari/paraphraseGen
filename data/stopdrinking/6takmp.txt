I am a cheap drunk. I basically only drink Evan Williams ($7-$10 a pint). Sometimes I will switch it up and pay an extra few bucks for Jim Beam...The reason? My hangovers and withdrawal effects from Evan Williams are always more severe. Despite both brands having the same alcohol content EW gets me more drunk and drunk faster and the recovery is always worse compared to JB...I thought I would ask if anyone knew why this is or if they've experienced something similar in their struggles. I have not drank yet today and am hoping to make it through the weekend.

Sounds like you've got conclusive research for an n of 1...Glad you're here!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
I used to evaluate alcohol based on how hungover it would make me. I'd have vodka because it was more pure or whatever nonsense I told myself. It was just a way of justifying my drinking...Changing your drinking behaviors in furtherance of getting intoxicated that's the textbook definition of alcoholism...Do you really want to stop drinking?
&gt; I have not drank yet today and am hoping to make it through the weekend...I needed *In Real Life* support from AA because nothing I was doing on my own was working.  ...And just think of all the money you'll save when you're not making a buying decision based on how bad a hangover will be!       .No Booze = No Hangover
I think it's the impurities. Evan Williams manhattans were my downfall. I was basically in control until I drank those starting in my 30s thinking it was a mature gentlemanly drink. Bullshit. Bourbon is for people who are either alcoholics or becoming alcoholics. It's tastes like crap and serves only to get you intoxicated. ..I never want one again...Because really they taste awful
