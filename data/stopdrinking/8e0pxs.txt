A little bit of a ramble but a call for some insight too so apologies ahead of time...**Resentment:** A mixture of disappointment anger and fear. Often times synonymous with disgust sadness and surprise...With that in mind it should come as no surprise that resentment is the number one offenders for us whether we admit it or not. This is a characteristic that has broken or is currently lighting fires in our lives. I feel this is a recycling of old negative feelings or revisiting the old wrong done to us by others and often times ourselves (upon further inspection)...In my experience I have to look at my role in the resentment. I have to ask myself "have I done anything to make this better or worse?" Am I actively working to identify at any given time a healthy routine to find out what is bothering me? Usually the answer is no but I don't think that is a bad thing. It shows growth in my sobriety that I can realize I'm not thinking clearly so that I can put the brakes on...These resentments usually make themselves apparent to those around us meaning we're letting them show regardless of whether or not we're actually just holding on to them with a death grip so no one notices. Resentments are our "resting bitch face" that everyone can see. When I get my face on the person I think I hate knows it. This is something I have to work on...What someone else does to me I may not always like and sometimes I may say that I hate them for it. Why? I don't know their story nor what they are doing in their lives. For instance I have been holding resentments with old girlfriends and even people in the meetings I go to...knowing full and well that they are struggling too. I have to remember I am human. Which would also mean I have a brain a nice...sober...brain that has a choice. Do I hold on to this resentment be it long or short term or do I swallow it and let go of it (not let it go)? In my experience swallowing that bitter pill is essential so that I can let my sobriety continue to grow. Why in the world would I be so caught up in worrying about someone else when I need to be working on me for me to keep getting better...I was once told that resentment was self-imposed punishment for other people's actions. That still makes a lot of sense to me...a cage that I have locked myself in and now I am pissed off (even though the key is in my pocket). ..Still I struggle with resentments daily. Do I divide resentments into two categories: short and long term or is a resentment just a resentment? What do I do about resentments that won't seem to go away? Should I let myself hold some resentment or make amends pray or apologize? These are some things that I can't seem to figure out...Sobriety is strange. It's great but it's strange because you realize you're spending Saturday night writing posts on Reddit about resentment and have the wherewithal to talk it out and ask for experiences of others. Sorry about the ramble but I haven't and will continue to NOT drink with any of you today.
