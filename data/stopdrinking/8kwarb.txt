Hello everyone.  Really struggling with sobriety lately.  Since February I've had about 6 occasions where I've had a glass of wine or two.  Lately all I think about is drinking.  Interestingly I have beer coolers and hard stuff at home but I only want wine.

Hi Larissa1962 I'm _____1963. Hoping in my assumption that your birth year is  62 if it is; this drinking nonsense is killing our generation. We were bred to be wiser than the generation b4 us. Sadly our age group is soooo associated with alcohol abuse. We all need to right that wrong. It's not how we're built. Tomorrow no fear. No struggling no drinking. ..If by chance you weren't born in  62 the same words apply. No matter what year we were born we're better than stupid booze. We're letting it rob us getting mugged by our desire and will eventually lead to our demise. ..We owe it to ourselves family &amp; our dogs. (I have no family except for my dog so I included him ).Have a great day tomorrow rock the house kick ass &amp; be the awesome person you are. .No fear. No struggling. No alcohol.     .IWNDWYT tomorrow the next day or the day after that
