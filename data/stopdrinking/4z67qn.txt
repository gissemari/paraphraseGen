Today marks 17 days sober and honestly i've been feeling pretty dull. I've become complacent doing absolutely nothing. It's almost as though going out anywhere has become a huge chore. I'm in love with my couch my laptop and my video games. I'm still jogging several times a week and i'm not tempted to drink so i'm supposed to feel good right?...Anyway I've signed up to volunteer at our local animal shelter this week to help get me out of my rut. I'm nervous as fuck guys. Going out and doing something new by myself without any crutches scares me a lot but I believe it's crucial to my progress. For some reason my struggles with alcohol/drugs has lead me to believe that i'm just some piece of shit and that i'll never be able to enjoy "normal people" things. But I don't want to be a shit human anymore and I haven't been for some time. Who I used to be always lingers in my head and tells me i'm scum. I fight it everyday though. ..So animal shelter orientation tomorrow. & absolutely NO BACKING OUT! Any advice on overcoming complacency anxiety & the huge bitch in my head telling me I can't be a decent human being? :-/..I hope you're all having a wonderful week!

Anxiety is a pain in the ass.  I was kind of in the same boat.  When I first started taking jiujitsu I would have to literally psyche myself up on doing something new by myself.  I would pop two ativan's just before I walked in the door.  I'm a pretty outgoing person anyhow but when it came to shit out of my comfort zone I was a wreck.  Just keep pushing yourself to do it.  You'll feel great once you get over that obstacle.  Know what normal people do?  Have every day issues no matter how big or small.  Keep smiling keep moving forward and enjoy those awkward/anxiety moments.  You're doing a good thing to help out at a shelter.  Keep up the good work.
I followed the advice of my AA sponsor and attended 90 recovery meetings in 90 days.  I didn't have time to be complacent.
