I've been struggling so hard with my drinking for 5 years.  Thats when it became a problem. Today is my fiance's birthday.  I never want to put him through the shit I put him through ever again.  Ive been going to counseling to try to moderate my intake but  I can't. and I will never be able to.  I want to live and if I continue to attempt moderation I will die.  That has become clear. My blackouts are getting worse and worse  it's not cute it's downright terrifying. So cheers ya'll IWNDWYT

Good for you! You are right... 99% of us get to a point on here where we realize moderation is not a possibility. You can do this.
I'm into my second day. We can do this together!
IWNDWYT We're all here for support. Don't forget that.
Go for it!
I have come to that point and tried 3 different times and always ended up drinking half a fith every day.
