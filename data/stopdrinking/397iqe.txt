Sober for a while now (thanks Antabuse) and work stress is mounting.   Really really really want to go and jaw with my buddy the friendly Irish bartender and toss back a few punching down and kneading the dough of my knotted-up and overheated brain.  This I can not do. ..I'll exercise later but for now I'm struggling.  Thanks all.

A craving is a "powerful desire for something."  It's an emotion and like all emotions they pass if you don't give into it.  The thing about alcohol cravings is that they lessen with time and the cravings can be totally replaced as with the pursuit of fitness recovery programming hobbies and other pursuits.  That's not just speculation that's my experience.  Keep TODAY sober and let's see how tomorrow goes!
