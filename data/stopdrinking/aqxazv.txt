I've been following this community for over a year now but have struggled to get serious about sobriety. Now I have the opportunity to get inpatient treatment for one month. Is there anything I should know or prepare for before going? ..Thank you

Welcome friend. I did an inpatient back in March/April 2018. Take it serious cause it might save your life. Be honest open-minded and willing. I went because I had a serious honest desire to stop drinking. I learned a set of tools that I use daily to keep me on this sober adventure. In my rehab there were several that were there on court order and what they wanted was for it to be over. Seek out others who are serious about changing their lives. Hope this helps. Stay strong...maybe let us know how it goes. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
It was a life saver for me. I still had a few relapses after I was released but I don't think I would have been able to come as far without the experience. My advice: don't forget to pack nail clippers lol
Treatment was the best thing that ever happened to me without a doubt.  I kept me head down and ears open.  I went in with the mindset of getting back on the well train.  Participate fully listen to what the professionals have to say.  And remember treatment isn't a one and done.  You will need support when you leave either aftercare or recovery meetings or both.  I can't stress this enough.  AA works for me.  
Thank you everyone!
