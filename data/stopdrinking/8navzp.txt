Why do I just keep repeating this cycle. I have all the reasons in the world to not drink.... Yet after 3-5 days I always cave in and get shitfaced.... I can't keep doing this its going to kill me. I have these good days where I don't struggle but then it sneaks in the invasive drinking thoughts.... I guess what I don't know how to do is ignore those feelings. I don't have a plan and I'm not sure how to approach it... I guess I need to just try SMART and just see if it works.... ..Sigh... I have to quit. I will die if I don't.... With my medical condition I will die.... I have to stop.....I just don't understand what is so fucking hard about this.  Fuck my brain fuck the cravings.  Today I sit here with an all day hangover and honestly have been thinking about going home and going to sleep but I'm making myself suffer through work...Grrrr. Well here we go again I guess.....

The fact that you keep tryi g is a good sign. Keep it up my friend it gets easier. Iwndwyt
I know it is hard. I tend to occupy my time and mind to stop thinking about alcohol...A program reading/writing on this sub your favorite non-drinking activity and more can help...The initial week is the worst and sometimes it sucks with even long time sobriety. But stick with it through the hard times and you'll see how great it is...I know how you feel because I am now 2 days off caffeine and have headaches am irritable (I hate everyone even for the slightest infraction) and just want to get some caffeine but I won't. ..I can beat this just like I beat alcohol and so can you.

Right there with you...back on day 2. Just keep coming back. I am deciding NOT to ignore the cravings but to acknowledge them feel them but just wait them out riding the wave. 
&gt;I don't have a plan and I'm not sure how to approach it.....Hey Mario perhaps [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) will help :).
Hey bud- hang in there!  I *chose* sobriety this time instead of dreading it and it has made all of the difference for me in the world!  You are worthy of a healthy happy sober life if you so choose.  Sometimes I don't drink for 5 minutes at a time because "one day at a time" is too freaking long.  Would you like to not drink with me in 5 minute intervals?  Alcohol is always going to be there if I want to go back to it later.

Do you know what is triggering you on that 3rd day?  Have you tired to change up your day?.I have been where you are yea it sucks to admit that alcohol has a strong hold over us.   Admit it and move forward.  You can do this I believe you can do this.  I will not drink with you today  will you not drink with me today?  
I was in your place! I got out of the cycle. Get a program it helps so much...Best of luck sending you love
