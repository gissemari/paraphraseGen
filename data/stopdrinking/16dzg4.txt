I'm pretty sure I've been in denial about my relationship with alcohol. If there's alcohol in the house I'll drink it. Doesn't really matter what it is. I'll sneak it behind my SO's back. ..Every time I tell myself "Just one beer" it's never just one. It's usually "as many beers as it takes for me to reach the point where I realize 'wow ok that was one too many'"...I can't stop once I've started so I'm going to stop starting. I don't know if I'll ever have a responsible relationship with alcohol again. I managed to stop drinking entirely for the nine months my wife was pregnant but relapsed after the baby was born. So I'm going to try again.

Sounds like you are in the same boat I was in. I found AA. Learned about my illness and how to live sober and still be happy. Hope you find some help. Don't do this alone!
&gt;I can't stop once I've started so I'm going to stop starting...I also could not stop drinking once I started. I drank till the booze was gone or I blacked out. The only way to change this was to avoid picking up that first drink...AA worked for me when nothing else did but there are other ways to get sober as well. You could consider treatment or therapy. Like AA they can work if you want them to and are willing to put in the work required to stay sober...If you want to do it on your own and are able to do so that's great. If you find you are unable to stop on your own seek out help. You don't have to do this on your own if you don't want to.
i was like you if i had one i would drink until i passed out. i did it alone for a while then i decided i needed a little support so i began going to AA. just do whatever it takes. good luck
