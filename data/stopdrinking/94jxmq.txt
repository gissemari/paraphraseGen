Last weekend was a struggle. After nearly two months of having no desire to drink after I stopped *woosh* I got a strong craving to drink. I really wanted to buy and drink some liquor ("some" meaning "an entire bottle" of course). I hadn't felt "the struggle" since I first stopped and hadn't any idea where it came from. Job searching planning and attending my parents' anniversary party (where I didn't drink!) a sense of boredom washing over me. All of them conspired to get me to drink. I was kind of close to caving...But I thought "nope I've watched this stupid movie before and I hate it." I was NOT going to endure a hangover. I've forgotten how it feels but I know how it feels. I'm not going to throw this all way just so I could get some stupid "buzzed" feeling for a single night and then wake up with a sore stomach and a splitting headache. Bullet dodged! Good luck everyone you can do it! IWNDWYT!

Congrats on 2 months! I've noticed milestone dates can set up some sort of drinking timer in the brain. Awesome job on playing the tape forward.
Well done on two months sobriety. Awesome. IWNDWYT:-)
Congrats we quit on the same day!  
Well done and stay as strong as you feel now.IWNDWYT.    
Nice...very encouraging!! I'm so worried that I will have one of these moments where I just cave but I just have to think of how it will feel afterwards. Definitely not worth it....thank u for sharing!!! 
Great work! I made 30 days last try at sobriety and I have to admit I am a little worried about approaching that milestone again. You staying strong is inspiring. IWNDWYT. Hugs.
