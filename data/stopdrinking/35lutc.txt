The best thing that I ever did was walk into an AA meeting on Jan 25 2014.  Like they say my life had become unmanageable.  I was on the verge of losing my job and getting divorced which would also mean losing my son.  I felt totally powerless and meeting and sharing with other alcoholics truly saved my life.  But somehow I got myself right back to that terrible place where alcohol consumes your entire being.  It started out as a casual indulgence and quickly led to the awfulness that I never wanted to know again...I went to an AA meeting this morning my first in a few weeks.  I also reached out to a couple of people and just felt like posting this here today.

Welcome back.  Glad you are here.
Glad you're back.  What happened?
Thanks so much for sharing!  In my first few weeks of sobriety I most wanted to hear success stories to keep me motivated.  Now I think what I need most is stories like this one to remind me that the time will never come when I can let up.  I'm gonna keep going to meetings keep doing what my sponsor tells me to do and today I'm not gonna drink.  
Welcome back! I'm glad you're here. I got sober and went out at 18 months. Here I am today. Keep coming back. Peace and good vibes
