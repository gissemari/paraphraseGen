Today I am going to the OBGYN to have our anatomy scan! I found out that I was pregnant at 30 days sober. It was a shock and took a minute to wrap my mind around. It wasn't the right time and I was so worried about everything still am. However it has been my little piece of happiness after some very dark days. Life hasn't let up though. This pregnancy has been tough I thought my puking days were over when I stopped drinking. Not so much. Headaches body aches hormones ect.. Add to that my SO losing his job and my 4 yr olds Autism diagnosis life is a constant struggle. Still I have remained hopeful and tried my best to be positive. I just keep on trucking. Things are looking up now SO got a new job my tax refund is coming soon and I am approaching the end of the semester with good grades so far. I had a really bad dream last night basically drinking while pregnant endangering my 4 yr old and betraying my SO. It was awful and it took me like a solid 5 minutes waking up to realize it was all a dream. Ughhh I think that is was has helped me stay positive through all the difficulties in the last 4 months. Knowing that as hard as things are right now they would be so much worse if I was still drinking. That shame guilt and anxiety. The real terrors of my life would still be haunting me. I don't have that today. Today I have hope and I have positivity where there once wasn't any. I still get down but I try my best not to stay there. I realize that my life can only get better if I choose to stay sober and take it day by day. fingers crossed for a healthy baby girl ya'll. I won't be drinking today.
