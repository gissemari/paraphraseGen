I've been making my own version of AA for myself and you all are helping so much. I've read AT LEAST one post a day that just totally nails it for me and helps me with my sobriety so I thought I would share. .I've quit drinking and relapsed twice in the past 3 years. I quit for a year went on a few month bender quit for about 6 months then relapsed and now here I am at 8 days sober. I want this to be it. I always relapse and convince myself I'm not really an alcoholic and "forget" all my sober tools. I gotta make it last this time. But I have learned you really have to take sobriety one day at a time. That never made sense until this quit. This has been my hardest yet BUT I do know it gets easier life gets fuller and I will feel happy again and know I can have fun again. So I guess in a sense that makes this quit easier. But the determination I feel is making it harder. I keep romanticizing drinking in my addict brain and having to tell myself to re-write the story and see it for what it really is..I've made myself an AA program. Check in here at least once a day and read a little from the big book every night. Keep busy. Exercise. Counseling..I'm doing ok. I struggled this weekend but am PROUD to say I made it. Love reading what you all are sharing. Have a great sober day my brothers and sisters.

I'm glad you're finding a program that works for you! I'd be lost without this sub. Every day someone deposits gold.

That's good that you've got something working for you! I've made this group part of my routine too. Every morning I do the check-in post. Then around two in the afternoon I make a cup of coffee and spend some time reading posts. There is always at least one that I find very inspirational!
