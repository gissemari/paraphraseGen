I've never ever been a "happy" person typical Irish individual; life is always led with a touch of sadness I have a line of severe depression and alcoholics in my family abusive childhood years of drinking and drugging etc.. Every day is a struggle for me just to *be* nevermind actually enjoying my time. When I was drinking I felt at least I could enjoy listening to music for hours with my headphones on or watching a movie but now I am really not into it...I'm not trying to glorify drinking I am here for a reason. I can't be a one or two drink guy without it turning into weeks of getting drunk. I stopped smoking weed last year which is the only drug I've touched in over 10 years at this point. I'm on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds (which I have gone through trying *many* different types and combinations). I currently don't have insurance because of a job change but I need to get back into therapy (not that I ever enjoyed that or felt I got anything out of it after trying many different therapists). The best I have is not feeling as suicidal as I used to barely at all anymore. Maybe a fleeting thought here and there with no plan...Guys I just don't feel *anything* good and now I feel like my absolute love for music is slipping away. I'm not drinking because I need to be healthy and less anxious but fuck man..what do I do? I'm just..here. Just a zombie aimlessly pushing through life which seems like more effort than it's worth...I'm sorry for rambling I am just feeling very down and very bored with it all.

Without mud a flower cannot grow. Water the seeds and rise out of the mud. 
I know how you feel. I think we suffer from "anhedonia" meaning we can't feel pleasure. It's a real physiological phenomenon or so says the therapist who led the group sessions I used to attend. Apparently our brains become rewired after so many years of drinking/drugging and when we stop nothing else hits the pleasure spots in our brain anywhere near as intensely as our drug of choice did. ..From what I've heard it starts to get better after the third or fourth month of sobriety. You gradually resensitize yourself to pleasure. I haven't made it past the second month since I started drinking 15 years ago so I can't say. (which reminds me I probably need a badge reset...)
Man this is really some awesome shit.
I think /u/crane170 is spot on.  I also think it has to do with temperament as you say.  I listened to this [podcast](https://thisnakedmind.com/ep-32-reader-question-how-do-i-overcome-the-trigger-of-boredom/) about boredom and it helped me quite a bit.  When you are raised German Catholic boredom is considered nearly a sin.  So I have noticed that I can be intolerant of boredom in myself or others.  That podcast helped put that notion to rest for me.  Is there a way you can make music novel to you again?  Maybe some live music?  Maybe playing an instrument?  I hope things swing up a bit for you and keep swinging up.
&gt; Every day is a struggle for me just to be nevermind actually enjoying my time...I get what you mean. I'm in this fog as well. Hour to hour I can feel "okay". Frankly feeling "okay" is a huge step up from feeling suicidal I was a fucking mess a month ago. ..It's not easy. I've been forcing my path forward. One hour at a time one day at a time. Sometimes it feels like wading through water or a swamp. Exhausting. ..I've suffered through depression anxiety panic disorder agoraphobia I wasn't sure I'd make it this far. ..I've been losing my sanity over the past month. I've been collecting mantras. Songs videos teachings etc. Reprogramming myself while I'm stuck in this half-autopilot mode. [This talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_david_the_gift_and_power_of_emotional_courage) helped me a lot. When I wake up it's hard to get going. I sit on the couch in my office with a 75/25 decaff/full caff coffee (because my anxiety is on overdrive I can't handle full caffeine) and my dog and I run through my mantras.
Hot banana peel tea usually puts me in a temporarily happy mood.  It mimics serotonin a bit.
