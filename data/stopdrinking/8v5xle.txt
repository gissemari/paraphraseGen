Still going strong. Seeing less of my friends stopped going to work party's. The initial high of my new life without alcohol has stopped and now I feel that I am a normal human again. Work going great no arguments at home mam and dad so relaxed and happy. All is good. ..Why would I go back? I can't remember why I used to drink. Maybe I'm going through a good patch and for that I'm grateful. ..Good luck to all on the journey and hope everyone is free from struggle. Message me if anyone needs a strangers advice or just a chat I know it can be hard. .
