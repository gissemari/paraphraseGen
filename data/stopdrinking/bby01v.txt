Dusting off this old account for this disregard the badge if it says something more than a few days...So far the past half year or so the pattern in my drinking and sobriety has been the following. Drink to get drunk every night for a few days to a week and eat garbage. Quit and eat "normal" while going through the immediate withdrawal period so about a week or so. Relapse into step one...So I tracked my calories for the day's I eat "normally" and noticed I was eating about 2000-2200 calories a day. This is about 500 less than maintenance for me...I've been unknowingly adding hunger as a stress source and never noticed it as such.
