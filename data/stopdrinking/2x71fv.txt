Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Motivational..**"As human beings our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world - that is the myth of the atomic age - as in being able to remake ourselves." - [Mahatma Gandhi](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/mahatmagan163698.html)**..*What I get from it:* I'm in love with this quote and its premise.  One of my favorite parts about being active here on SD is watching people grow and change and struggle and learn and the fact that we do it together as a big quirky family is just icing on the [cake](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/IIFvp4ud8Ng/maxresdefault.jpg).  And I think it really is true that being able to be honest and look inside yourself and make the decision to work really hard to rewire your own spirit and mind and way of living is such an amazing feat and really - [it's such a gift](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/dc/79/cf/dc79cff0627860fc16b8b725dcf66fba.jpg).  I don't always love sobriety but I feel really at peace with and excited about the fact that I have the opportunity to change my ways and live a better life. I feel like - this is it. This is what life is about. Self work.  Learning.  Feeling.  Community.  Helping others.  Loving.  Growing.  It's all so amazing and [we have such an awesome opportunity to be better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4V3Mo61fJM); for ourselves first and in turn for the world and everyone in it. ..Have an awesome day all!

It's all so amazing and we have such an awesome opportunity to be better; for ourselves first and in turn for the world and everyone in it...How absolutely beautiful and true. You've articulated so well why choosing sobriety is so appealing to me at this point in my life. Living a sober life is not just about not drinking. It's about the evolution of the mind and spirit once it is freed from the shackles of alcohol. 
That's a great quote.  Even in the early days of not drinking I feel this electricity within me: the spark of change...After feeling so down on myself for so long it's a wonderful feeling :)..Let's not drink today SD.
