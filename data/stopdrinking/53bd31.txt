...Depression boredom... You feel so fucking low you want to fucking top yourself..-Mark Renton in *Trainspotting*..I get bored. I get lonely. I get depressed. It's nothing new. Shit happens. .Alcohol definitely filled a space. It was a huge part of my life. Now I'm really struggling to fill that space. I know I should fill it with exercise road trips love hope dreams all that romantic poetic shit. But it's hard. I tell myself I don't have time for hobbies or friends or road trips because I need to study but I end up fucking procrastinating and lying in bed doing nothing instead. I was a straight A student and now I don't even complete my assignments before I submit them. ..Maybe I should join the hiking club. But $50 to go on a trip? Fuck that. Maybe I should get a part-time job. But hold on I need a car and a licence and x years of experience and need to commit to y amount of shitty hours? Fuck that. Maybe I should get a girlfriend. But who the fuck wants to date me? I'm not interesting or outgoing or rich or attractive or witty or funny or successful or any of those things that my ex's new boyfriend is...Rant over.

Hey dude it gets better :-) baby steps......I read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/) once that helped so much when I was feeling down and unable to move forward maybe it'll help you too. It's the first comment by ryans01 that matters. 
I got a dog... She listens (always agrees) she fills my hours with walks and she gives me very awkward angular hugs whenever I need one... Oh and unconditional love. 
Hang in.   Exercise in any form helps me tremendously.  I agree with the dog suggestion; if you can't own one maybe you can volunteer at the local shelter?   Doggie kisses rule!
"it gets better" was something I got sick of hearing early on but it's true. I looked around at all the examples on SD and in meetings. I clung to that truth sometimes desperately sometimes in anger. See what helped others and try it out. Find YOUR combination and it will eventually get better.
I can relate. Staying sober AND finding meaningful things in your life is so fucking hard if you've filled that gap with booze for years and posts like this remind me that I'm not the only one feeling it with all the "sobriety is so awesome!" -posts (no offense) here. That being said being depressed and lonely and sad and whatnot beats the shit out of feeling all those + the added hangover effect that multiplies them by a dozen. Still feeling the last bender.. I won't give great advice but I won't drink with you either. You got it.
I found a cost effective outlet was meetings...People who were sober had been on the path I was traveling understood what I was going through and the best part was the price:   ZERO.  No Membership Admission.  No charges.  No hidden fees.  ..I could *voluntarily* contribute to the basket for coffee and other items...Tried any of that?
I find counseling helps. And my dog. Any friends that don't drink? I have no friends didn't while I was drinking either. So I am used to lonely. And one thing I can tell you is talk radio helped. I listen to public radio but whatever is your thing. Maybe reading. The boredom with things I struggled with as well.
