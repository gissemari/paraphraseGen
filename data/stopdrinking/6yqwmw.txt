I think you've talked some sense into yourself! Sounds like you just had a slip up. One shitty warm beer doesn't define you or your journey through sobriety. Keep coming back. We're here for you! Best of luck. 
You obviously don't want to drink--not really--because you're posting here.  OK so you had one nasty warm beer after about a week.  I bet it tasted terrible and made you feel terrible.  You can just stop right there because now you'll have to actually expend effort to get more.  Why do that?  Be lazy go get some snacks and a soda and watch something on TV. 
Sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
