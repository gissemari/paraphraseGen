Really struggling right this moment. I'm at the end of my 60hr workweek with maybe one hour left to go and everything is making me angry...Experiencing my first really strong craving since I stopped. Just shoved a piece of cake in my face to try to sidestep it. Only helped a little...Breathing deep and trying to slowly relax.

Hang in there.  Sometimes it can take some serious deep breaths. 
More cake. :)
Do not drink while sober!! IWNDWYT.
This will pass although it doesn't feel like it right now. How about when you have finished work a nice hot bath and some snacks with a good book. You can do this!
