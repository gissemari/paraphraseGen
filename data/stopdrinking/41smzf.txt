started drinking last sunday and didnt stop until saturday... but im back on the wagon and im feeling so much better the withdrawals are mostly gone. just know its never too late to go back to the good side. im so mad at myself for doing it but i just want to be sober so bad. its so much easier to be sober. just need to remind myself how bad it is when everything gets better.. like i always tend to forget. i also never talk to anyone about anything and finally i told my girlfriend today that i wanted to drink BEFORE drinking and then saying i drank... so im glad i finally opened up and have that support. so grateful for her. ..now i feel like telling you guys too...but anyway ive had withdrawals before but this was HELL. its not so much the physical stuff more the confusion and just im a real airhead still. i drove down the street to grab some chew and i turned around because i started to feel like i was going to pass out or... lose it or something? does anyone know how long that lasts? it really worries me how confused i get. i had that kind of confusion when i was sober this past 5 months too so has anyone had that and does it go away?

What is your diet like? I had this confusion too and that even though I was not drinking I still was doing my body an injustice by eating junk. I started taking fish oil daily vitamin and vitamin b12 supplements and added veggies/fruits to my diet. This seemed to work. ..Good job telling your girlfriend. The more people that know this about you the better. One does not simply quit drinking without a support group. I think there is a meme for that somewhere. hah!
