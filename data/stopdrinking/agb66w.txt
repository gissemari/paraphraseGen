I just finished this book. WOW. I absolutely loved it. I highly recommend it to anyone here! I related to so much of what she wrote about with her struggles with alcohol. It feels so good to not be alone in this!

Yes! I loved it too! 
I LOVED that book!! Sadly I read it like 15 years ago and could relate. She also had an eating disorder (which I have as well) and wrote another book called  Appetites  which was also really good. So sad she passed years ago in her early 40's I think lung cancer although she was not a smoker.
