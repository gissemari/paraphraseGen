I was torn as whether to post this in /r/relationships or here but I settled on here as I think you all might relate to how I feel a bit more...I broke up with my girlfriend on Saturday. I didn't want to. I am madly in love with that girl and it's the last thing I wanted to do. But for the past year we've struggled. Don't get me wrong it's been a wonderful relationship but two alcoholics don't make a normie. She relapsed this past June and since then I've been trying to support her as much as possible but it's been difficult. She's full of anger and resentment. She becomes distant at times not wanting to spend time together taking that anger out on me and then at times being nothing more than just the woman I know and love. To keep this as short as possible a real Jekyll and Hyde...It was taking it's toll on me. Affecting my mental health. I don't want to drink over it but I'm really devastated and I miss her. Thing is I talked to her the other day after it all happened. And she thanked me. She told me that breaking up with her woke her up. That in doing that in knowing how badly she hurt me she hasn't had a desire to drink since. Like she's had some sort of awakening. But now I'm looking at it like "but at what cost"? I know it's selfish of me to think like that but I'm an alcoholic man. I'm so happy I helped her. I was able to be honest with her and tell her everything that's been bothering me. But really I'm more depressed now than I was dealing with the ups and downs of the relationship. ..Maybe this post didn't belong here now that I've typed it out. I guess I just wanted to vent. I really don't want to talk about it at a meeting because we go to mostly the same ones. My sponsor is really less than sympathetic he wanted me to let her go for a while and I listened... and now I have a resentment against him for that... and also against myself. I really hate myself for listening and going through with it. I'm just not in a good place. ..Anyway thanks for reading. Sorry this got so long. I won't drink with you all today.

I sympathize... have been there. Iwndwyt 
Hey I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Break ups are hard. There's no other way to put it other than that they just suck. From what it sounds like I feel like you made the right decision. You have to keep your mental health and sobriety as your number #1 priority. You made a really hard decision and I think it sounds like it was the best one for now. It doesn't mean that you guys won't get back together eventually sometimes people just need time apart to heal themselves. It sounds like you both really love each other. However You both are struggling and maybe she really did need this break up as a wake up call. In a sense think of it as a selfless act you did not just do this for yourself but for her well being too. For now just let yourself feel all of the emotions let yourself be sad. Just know it will pass. The rest will work itself out. I will not drink with you today.
