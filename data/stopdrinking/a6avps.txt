*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---...Saturday! Right day right date! Sorry everyone for the confusion! This week hosting these check-ins has been so rewarding for me and I can only hope to host again sometime in the future (I promise I'll sleep more to get the titles right  )..This weekend I have to make some tough choices and do a lot of introspective work to figure out what I truly want out of things in the future. Making the concious decision to stop drinking (and stop smoking ciggs and stop smoking bud and to quit caffeine) wasn't immediately easy to deal with or to go through with. Its never easy to make a choice like that. Quitting something is usually harder than starting something and requires a whole lot of determination and focus. ..I can now say even though the decisions were hard the outcomes have been beyond worth it. Im still struggling (except with ciggs and caffeine multi years free from those) but the struggle is worth it...The end of the year always brings up talk of resolutions and plans for the new year and changes being made and I have a whole bunch of  of all of those things coming but Im happy to be staying on certain paths Ive been traveling for a while now including the sober steps taken with you all...I hope at some point this week my random babbling has helped you in some way. I am so honored to have been here with you this week and will be glad to be here with you going forward. ..I cant wait for my Triple Digit Tango     coming soon and to share each sober day with you all in the new year to come. ..For now: more sleep! I hope to be checking in with some positive news in the next few weeks and I will not be drinking with you today...See you all soon:) .
----------immediate responses--------

Woop! First on a Saturday. No drinking down under today!...IWNDWYT
Sober in serenity in service today
666 - Devil Day for me. I will do the Goat Dance and I will do it sober.    
Just for today I will not drink with you all.  
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!..Thanks so much for hosting this week u/megveg
Spending this Saturday Sober! Much love   and of course I will not drink with you guys today 
I can't get the check-in tab to work so I'm doing it as a comment. Good work Megveg! I'm so happy to be not drinking with you tonight! 
Not drinking today.
IWNDWYT!!
Staying sober!
I will not drink with you today!!!  
I won't drink today!   
I will not drink today.
Serious question I'm sorry if this sounds stupid and I'm sure it's been asked a thousand times.....I know that cooking with wine leaves like 75% of it left in the food but does it really count as long as I don't drink the wine along with cooking?..Thinking of making some food that requires wine tomorrow.
I will not drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT!!
I turned down happy hour today and I'll reject wine o'clock tomorrow. I'm so over it. 
iwndwyt \\m/
Only just getting to bed from Friday night so a bit of a funny one - but IWNDWYT! 
No booze today!
Early morning fo me. Didn't sleep so well. Ah well at least I had sober sleep. Better a short sober rest than a drunk sleep with a hungover morning! I'm wishing you all a good day and IWNDWYT!
Company party yesterday. Just one person asked and didn't ask why. They either asume i do it for fitness related reasons or because they knew i was an alcoholic and it was about time...Was fun but I have a hard time in very loud rooms and it it exhausting following conversations so i left after about 3 hours...I will not drink today either. Have a good weekend everyone!..
IWNDWYT happy Saturday to everyone. I'm heading to yoga when I wake up on a relaxed Saturday morning and then baking cookies with my husband and a friend. This has been the most pleasant time of the 345 I've tried to quit mostly because I lost a dear friend in his mid-60s who drank less than me recently. Every day I think about how I was/am if I don't clean up my act on the same exact path as him. I'm trying to enjoy the good moments because when I step back and look at the entirety of a day there were a few triggers yes especially on Fridays for me... but 99% of the day was so damn good! I feel so much better body and mind. Take care of yourselves y'all. 
Iwndwyt
Here's to not losing half my weekend to a hangover no shame and no regret.
IWNDWYT...Peace 
Counting by the hundreds and soon I'll have 5.  Kinda proud of myself. I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
I will not drink with you today.

I will not drink with you today
No booze today      
Hey SD! I'm not drinking on this rainy Saturday in NY...Wishing you all a happy relaxing weekend :D...Thanks again for hosting u/megveg and happy 85! &lt;3.
Today I say No Thank You to alcohol. ..Have a great Saturday Beautiful People ..IWNDWYT
I didn't drink yesterday at the office Christmas party and I won't drink tonight when I meet a friend in the pub. This time of year is so boozy here in London. Glad to not be a part of it. IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today!
As always. IWNDWYT 
Morning from the UK!..Ponylad1 goes to university up north not far from where my hometown is. I live 200 miles from my hometown. I've come up to bring him back for Christmas as he has loads of equipment so I'm staying in a hotel in my hometown and bringing him back tomorrow...Good part is that I get a day to myself- I don't have to break the ice on the horse trough at 06:30am or walk the dog go to work or cook  ..But it's very evocative being in my hometown - a couple of years ago my Mum and Sister died within 6 months of each other and Dad had died previously - So I'm the only one left. I have some cousins etc but my immediate family has gone and the house etc. I feel a bit rootless not having a base and I miss my family...I might find a meeting tonight- I will not drink with you today  
I will not drink with you today :)
+1!
Good morning.  Not drinking today 
**KILO-DAY !**..I say this in all sincerity: Had it not been for SD and all its motley crew I'm 9.999/10 sure I'd have been dead of alcohol caused illness long before now. So to any well-wishers who may see fit as well as to the vast silent majority I say a heartfelt thank you to one and all. Thank you for being there so many times when I needed you. Thank you for cutting me some slack when by design or accident I revealed my rough edges. Thank you for not down-voting me and my old man ramblings and musings out of existence. Most of all though and what I'm trying to say is thank you for sharing your own sober journeys with me. Just knowing I'm not alone has had a *big* impact on my determination to end my addiction (just being able to come here at any time of the day or night has saved me on many the occasion)...Thank you. /B..
Good morning folks! Sorry for bit checking I  yesterday. I did not drink with you then. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today!
Checking in. IWNFDWYT.
IWNDWYT
Happy weekend troops hope it's a good one for you all whatever the weather. I will not drink today.
Sober at 0400 on a Saturday. *Nice*.
IWNDWYT 
Hi megveg! Thanks for hosting and for the mixed up date yesterday. I went hunting for the check in and it was only when I couldn't find it that the realisation dawned on me how very important that daily check in has becime to me on this sober journey. I don't think that I would have realised that if I wasn't forced (by the date thing) to stop and search - so from me thank you for that big realisation as now my check in is a much more meaningful piece in my journey.
Thank you for hosting this week megveg. I will not drink with you today. 
Have a great weekend everyone! I will not be drinking with you today 
IWNDWYT
Good morning all.  I will not drink with you today.
Greetings SD from England UK. Grey and windy weather here today. Feeling warm and snug on the inside though. Another hangover free morning. What a blessing. IWNDWYT. Let's do this sobernauts  .
Count me in :)
I went to a food market last night that was full of people boozing. I had a few pangs of thinking maybe I can drink too...but no I played the tape forward. I am going to a meal tonight and I will drive there and drink cranberry and soda all evening and leave early. I will not drink with you all today.
Checking in for Sunday early as up. Hangover free yippee .Was tempted to have one last night but managed not to. Thank you for that.  This community has great posts that keep me sane !!
Not drinking with SD today.
Morning. Awful weather here IWNDWYT.
I will not be drinking with all of you today! 
My skin looks like shit I've put on 4 kilos and I've just realised I have a double chin! All down to drinking every day eating shit food and refusing to work out. Realised how fucked I am and joining you guys again. I will not drink with you today.
Checking in on a sober Saturday! I feel pretty stoked this morning on my progress so far not being hungover feels especially nice. I can't believe I really haven't drank for this long. I am so grateful for the people here that helped me along the way. Thanks so much :)
Today I dealt with some very powerful triggers and instead of drinking I treated myself to some gourmet ice cream  ..IWNDWYT
I will not drink with y'all today 
No drinking here! 
Good morning all!..Mother in law is here. It's already not going well...But no matter what I Will Not Drink With You Today!
Thanks for the check ins this week u/megveg!..I'm not drinking today!
On day 14 here and looking forward to officially two weeks in about 12 hours. Previous best in Sept/oct was 13 days so every minute now is a new record. Thanks SD I couldn't have got this far without this group. Hope to be celebrating 3 weeks in 7 days!
Currently at my work party on orange juice. I will not drink with you fine people today. 
Woke up fresh as a daisy after 11 hours sober sleep.. iwndwyt!  
I will not drink with you folks today!

Day 35: This week has been one of the roughest weeks of my life. But I'm still not drinking. I want to be numb and far far away. Alcohol makes my head spin for a couple hours and then I'm back with my problems and a hangover. It's such a shitty escape. 
I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today!
Thanks meg for a thought-provoking week. Morning friends. "Many a good man has failed because he had his wishbone where his backbone should have been."...Unknown  Sobriety is freedom for me. Freedom is bringing courage. I am grateful today for the courage to make the next right choice. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Day 143.  I will not drink with you today.
Day 8 for me. I will not drink with you today...Had a busy week of work so looking forward to hanging out at home with the heating on and doing some music practice. I also did all my grocery shopping last night so I have lots of food :-)
Good morning everyone! First up a huge thank you to u/megveg for hosting the check-in this week we have all appreciated your taking the reins...It's a busy weekend for me working on my new website. I'm making big changes in my life and I'm hoping that this new website will help me stay focused from here on in:..1. Through a more focused approach to work: and.2. Through writing and reflection...I'm not far off a year. It has been hard at points   especially when out with friends who are drinking   but I have stuck to it...The daily check-in has helped me enormously. I am so so appreciative of everyone who has volunteered to host. Your work on this gives us all focus. I hosted early on and it's the most humbling experience...Anyhow here's my pledge for the day: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong fellow sobernauts!.. 
I will not drink today 
I won't drink today!
Sober Saturdays are the best -- IWNDWYT

First post on reddit ever. glad its to say hello and ive made it to a place where i belong
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT from the Valley of the Sun to the base of Mt Shasta.
Six months for the Rick here. Uncharted territory. I went to a party last night for a friend's birthday and it was the first "real" party I'd been to in ... well six months. I was the only sober person. It was weird and I'm not sure I liked it.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink you admirable sobernauts today!!!   Hard to believe I might have been 2 beers in by now (7:30am) or be planning a trip to grocery store before my wife wakes up. Sheesh!
I have a massively complicated fictional corporate tax return to prepare this weekend for my class on federal business taxation.  The surest way I can think of to screw it up would be to add alcohol to the mix so I definitely will NOT drink with all of you wonderful people today!  Have a good weekend all.
I will not drink today!
I seriously wndwyt
Hi Meg.  Thanks for posting.  triple digits are just around the corner - you can do it.  ..I certainly will NOT be drinking with you or anyone else today.  
I am making this pledge again because I have to.  You keep me strong SD thank you. IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today. I woke up sober and I feel great.
I will not drink today.
Good god I can't wait for December 25 when this nightmare work schedule ends. 6 day work weeks and 60+ hours spent busting my ass per week is getting old. No matter how badly I want a cold one or 4 after work I will not drink with you fine folks today. Peace.
I won't drink today. I want to break my 3/4 of a bottle of wine 5 times a week habit. Let today be a good start. 
Good morning!   Today I will be donating a trunk full of gifts for children in foster care in my community!     ..I'm thankful to be able to do this and it feels good to give. ..I will not drink today!  
Haven't checked in awhile but I've stayed on task. The task that says I owe it. To me to my kids and to the world to be one more sober person out there. I had gone to town the day before last and came home to my (disabled) father in law tipped over in his chair stuck on the floor. It took myself and my mother in law to help pull him back up (pretty big guy). I knew just by the sound of him that he had been drinking (he can only drink when my MIL isn't around because she doesn't condone it). He told her yesterday that incident scared him to the point that he says he's done with alcohol. He realized that if we hadn't walked in the door he could have been there for quite some time and him being a diabetic and disabled that could have gone badly. I'm crossing my fingers for him. 
Not drinking today. Have a great day everyone!
I will not drink with you today!
Last night I had the worst cravings I have had in a long time so that was really tough to work through. But I'm almost glad I went through it to remind myself that I can't be complacent in my sobriety but I need to be proactive. And I woke up today refreshed and sober! I will not drink with you all today. 
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
Day 17...IWNDWYT 
Thank you for hosting u/megveg! I always get more out of it than I give it! Today so much Sober Stuff to do! Thank you Jesus! I did have a little hissy fit yesterday while shopping. I was hungry and tired &amp; I should not have tried to check one more task off my list...but I did. SO I have maybe 15 items in my cart in a store I was not familiar with. In a line of 10 people in front of me who all look like they are buying supplies for a nuclear holocaust I saw that there were more than 15 cash register lines but only 4 were open. BUT there were self check out stations at both ends of the cash registers row. And they also had long lines of people waiting. Usually I don't mind too much doing that myself as it means I won't have to converse with anyone. But not yesterday. I was getting very Itchy Bitchy &amp; I said to myself  I don't have to do this right now. I need to be sane right now. Get the fuck out.  I got out of line pushed my cart into an empty cash register lane and walked out. I preserved my sanity AND my sobriety in one smooth move. Outside it was raining lightly and I just let it wash my face a bit and cool me off. Then I went to Izzy's and got a hot dog! I am going shopping again this morning right now early and hopefully an empty store with oatmeal on board and in my own neighborhood! When ya need cat litter...there really is no substitute! **IWNDWYT!!!**
I will not drink today.
Oh boy. I woke up 3 hours later than normal this morning and woke up in a panic when I saw the clock. Then I remembered I'm sick and not hung-over so I snuggled back down for another 30 minutes to top it off...I will not drink today!
I'm in. And now for coffee!
IWNDWYT! 
For today I will not drink. I'm feeling great and want to stay that way.
Day 5 today. I will not drink with you today!
My cat died yesterday. I had her for 18 years. She came into my life when I was a severly depressed child and I credit her with saving my life. I'm feeling immense guilt for not being home and with her when she died. I knew her time was coming and I didn't want her to have to go alone. But I think she knew I love her and she had a long and good life so I can take some comfort in that. ...I always used to think that when she died it would result in an immediate black out drunk for me but I barely thought about it. Only last night passing a bar I sort of imagined what if but not with any real seriousness. It would have made me feel worse so much worse and wouldn't have changed anything. So here I am. I will not drink with you today. Rest in peace my baby girl :(
Good afternoon guys. 2 months today since I last had a drink. Unbelievable. So grateful for the lovely supportive people here who have aided me in my sober journey so far and also the incredible people in my life. I think i will celebrate by having a na becks this evening. I will not drink with you today! Have a lovely day guys
Yesterday will be tough to top. At the store a young man with Down's syndrome wished me a Merry Christmas. Grinchy me was touched beyond belief. At home was refilling the bird feeder when a mess of bushtits (tiny lively guys)  appeared and gathered all around like a Disney movie. Literally birds in the hand. The topper was a bike ride in unseasonably warm weather...Not drinking so the potential is there for another good day!
I will not be drinking with you today  
Still here!  I will not drink with you all today !
Well guys I got through my first sober Friday off in ages here's to following suit today! Hoping it'll be easier since Its the first day since quitting I won't also be sleep deprived as well. IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
I'm at 48 days.  Damn how'd that happen?  Not bad.  Will keep it going and am not going to drink with you all this weekend.  Going to continue my trend of holing up and being a bit antisocial but chipping away at the huge list of chores and tasks I've been needing to do.  Not hungover this morning and just had a nice cup of coffee so I'm off to a good start.  Have a good weekend everyone. 
won't drink today
IWNDWYT!
Thanks for hosting this week u/megveg.  Giving up caffeine seems way way more terrifying to me than giving up alcohol! I suppose I have some self/analysis to do there because that sure sounds like an addiction...The Holliday Party was loud and long. Overall it was fun but I was certainly sensitive to how different some people were behaving from their  daytime  selves. One of my favorite people in the office did something really disappointing last night but at least from a vantage point of sobriety I can identify that it wasn't him but his addiction that made that choice. I feel pity rather than anger...New sunny lovely day and I'm delighted to start it with a clear head and heart!..I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!!!
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today no matter what.  Instead I will go to the gym. An AA meeting or two and  wake up sober tomorrow. 
Good morning! Can't wait for my gym session this morning after 2 super heavy meals yesterday and no exercise. Last night was holiday party for bf's work. It was at a fancy hotel as it is every year. I happily gave him my drink tickets and did the driving. I didn't have a great time but it didn't suck really either and the fact that I didn't drink didn't really bother me. And this was actually the 2nd year in a row of going to this event sober. I was in a sober streak for last year's too and last year it was harder not to drink. It's getting easier! Really truly it is. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
Day 3 I will not drink with you today...Got a christmas party to go to held by an AA group here so that should be fun on no sleep. Meeting right after to boot!

Smack dab in the middle of a 20-hour mini-getaway with my wife.  Just lounging around kid-free for a night while my parents watch them...Why take a break to check-in you might wonder?  This subreddit helped me save my marriage and get to this point!..Thanks fellow Sobernauts!  IWNDWYT!
Sobernauts! Lovely to check in with you all. My resolve is fading a bit so this where I need to be.IWNDWYT!
Happy and grateful to be here. Made it through holiday party at work. I feel confident I can make it through Christmas without feeling like I'm missing out. I will not drink today.

Good morning meg and SD. I will not drink with you today. I am going to do some relaxing however. 
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  Working hard today to avoid the additional traps and triggers that Evil Oppressor uses to make chains and shackles look seductive as the week ends.  Resist!  IWNDWYT

Spent my first Friday night sober in nearly a year. ..Felt nice waking up feeling refreshed instead of groggy. ..&amp;#x200B;..Here's my pledge to not drink today! 
Not drinking today!
Day 9 and going strong. .Had to watch a bunch of bar/server knowledge videos for training made me really want an IPA or Margarita. Luckily there's nothing in the house to drink and j convinced myself not to walk to the store. ..Legs are soar from work haven't walked this much in a couple years and I'm a double today. A beer is going to sound really good tonight but I will not do it. ..No more "just one"s and no more regrets. .IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT! It's going to be another sober weekend in he books :)..Amazing how much time is in the weekend when you're not hungover!
Checking in!  Grateful to be sober today!  Attended a great meeting this morning and then had a solid phone chat with a fellow sobernaut!  Now off to a child's birthday party!  This time last year I would've definitely been hungover at this party! IWNDWYT!!
This is going to be a long weekend. But I will start with today. Not drinking today.
I'm not drinking with you all today! It was so nice sleeping in and feeling actually rested this morning.

Good morning from Kansas City MO USA!  I won't drink with you today.
First post here.  ..Been lurking for a while.  ..I realised how self destructive and toxic and harmful I become to the people closest to me when I drink. ..No more. ..I'm on day 6.  I can already see and feel the beginnings of change. ..IWNDWYT

Day 76 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad...Thank you for hosting this week u/megveg!  I've enjoyed your posts and I wish you well in creating a fantastic life and future for yourself.  I've had a number of times where I've just sat still  ...not moving backwards or forwards but keeping my sobriety as my Number-1 priority seemed to open doors that would not have even presented themselves.  You're doing great and I'm happy you're a part of our SD family! 
Not today!

Checking in late but IWNDWYT!
Day 2 for me. Looking forward to a positive road ahead. IWNDWYT

I will not drink with you today.   
I will not drink today
Day 355.  Where has the time gone.  Christmas will be my one year mark.  I am well past the point of even thinking about drinking much less desire to have another alcoholic beverage... however I do miss the taste of beer...I have been able to walk into a liquor store a half dozen times over the past year and purchase NA Coors without even contemplating going over to the "real" stuff.  The only side effect that I realize I do not miss as well is the kidney flushing...I'm really fortunate at 63 years of age having drank moderately to occasionally severe since I was 17 to have been able to rid myself of the desire for that euphoria that comes with alcohol over this past year.  I know for some that the "desire" never really goes away but for me I'm very fortunate that it has...Still like the taste but not the "feeling" associated with the consumption of alcohol. ..Hope you all have a Merry Sober Christmas.  ..&amp;#x200B;
Not gonna drink today.
Every day has been better than the last the past couple of weeks. One day at a time and loving it.
Don't want it don't need it won't do it. ..Had my first real dinner and drinks with the girls night out last night - amazingly I had no desire to drink. Everyone was ordering fancy cocktails and then wine and all I could see was empty calories money down the drain memory gaps and a Saturday morning hangover. Was not tempted in the least. ..The fact that me not drinking was pointed out multiple times (including by the waitress) was very frustrating but whatever. I guess I have to get used to that. ..Thanks for being here everyone. IWNDWYT. 
Not drinking today.
I will not drink with you today
IWNDWYT.  Made it through two different Xmas parties one at a vineyard. Was briefly tempted as the sun was setting the wine was sparkling but I know it's not worth it. I was already having a good time why ruin it? 
Another day under my belt! Things get better every day and everyone here has a part in that! Thank you!
IWNDWYT
I won't drink today. 
Day 6 and I'm not drinking with you all today :)
Not drinking today.
I will not drink with you today.
I have my work Christmas party tonight with hard drinking people.  Annoyed and a bit angry at the same on going family dramas.  All I know is I will not be drinking tonight and I am going to drive us all there and home safe!  Plus I'll enjoy the food much more at dinner and maybe even get a desert!  
Hard day today but I will not drink!
Nope. Not a drop!
Not drinking today!
