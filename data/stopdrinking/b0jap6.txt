I've made to solid stabs at sobriety in the past few months. Basically two full months with a 10 day relapse in between and then coming back to casually drinking like it's something I can maintain. Sundays are my longest day of the week and I was already a little hungover from Saturday night. That was a first since I'd gotten back to the "casual drinking" phase. Between the hangover and the release of getting done with work Sunday evening I neglected to eat before having a few and I ended up blacking out and embarrassing myself. It could have been really bad and I'm lucky I have good friends. I know this is unsustainable. I have too many things from the past 15 years that could have gone better if alcohol wasn't so prevalent in my life. I have a girlfriend who has been more than patient over these last 5 years as I've tried to gain some control but I think it's time to consider it an all or nothing thing. I have too much on the horizon to look forward to and I want to make some impact on this world while I'm still around. I want to want to be around. I will probably not drink with you today. I've slept most of Monday and Tuesday drinking water and eating what I could keep down. Now it's nearly 3am and anxiety has me restless so I thought I should post. I've considered it for nearly a year. I wish I could proudly proclaim that I won't but for now a step feels like a start and I think I might be able to sleep with some encouragement to look forward to. This sub always has plenty of that. I promise I'll try to lurk less and post more and eventually I'll make paragraphs when I write something bulky out. ..TLDR: I still want to puke my soul out from my last slip-up but I'm gonna start looking to you guys for some support rather than just lurking.

Language is very important. It really helps us focus on our goals and focuses the mind. I know it's hard but I avoid phrases like I'll try use positive statements like I will I can etc. iwndwyt 
Make sure you keep the reasons you want to stop in mind (or even write them down and stick them on the fridge as a reminder). If you don't have the reasons in full focus you will eventually slip in a time of weakness. The reasons are what it's all about. Good luck!
