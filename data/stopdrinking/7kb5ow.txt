Everytime .I crack open that beer.It unleashes that fear.Fear of being a hypocrite.And not meeting expectations.I hold for myself and others.Letting my mother down.Letting myself down .Letting my friends down.Letting myself drown in the fake buzz.The fake feelings of security .Which quickly turn into insecurity.Why can't I just stop for good once and for all and stop the perpetual fall.I feel my belly swell with the alcohol.Swell with anxiety and wasted time .Showing up quickly on my waist line.Making it harder to walk this fine line.That's keeps getting finer and harder to walk .With each drink i take  I take two steps back .Back from my goal and achieving true self esteem .Losing the silver lining that is now drowned.Drowned in beer making it hard to see it clear .Can't see the silver in a cloud of brown beer
