Struggling with quitting to drink has actually helped me grow into a less judgmental and more understanding individual...But it has also given me the ability to see people who are still struggling (with what they may be struggling with) come to terms with the fact that a lot of times we create our own problems...When I stopped blaming everyone and everything for my shortcomings life changed drastically. It definitely made me a more honest person (which I'm learning that a lot of people don't like because you call them on their self-pity). ..Now I see friends struggling but they don't want any honesty. And I know they won't come to until they're ready. It just sucks having to watch from the outside knowing what they need to do but they won't and nothing you can do will change it...Almost a blessing and a curse but definitely more of a blessing!..Iwndwyt

We each have to figure it out ouselves. When they make up their minds like you did they will accept your help. IWNDWYT
My most important support is to be caring without compromising my healthy boundaries...I should share the joys of an unimpaired life with everyone with whom I come in contact.  I should use words only as a last resort.
