I've had a few dreams in which I relapsed but nothing shook me as much as last night's dream.  This time I had a dream I drank blacked out and posted pictures of me on Facebook with the captions of "so sad where is everyone goodbye".  When I came to in my dream my mom had found an empty vodka bottle and I was wondering why I had hundreds of texts and phone calls.  My girlfriend was worried sick...friends had said oh well and forget him...  I have to say I'm always happy when I remember it's only a dream and I'm still sober but this one really has stuck with me.

Wow that is scary stuff. I had a dream last week that I took a couple sips of beer only to wake up and realize it was just a dream. I remember how bummed I felt for those couple of seconds when I thought I broke my recent sobriety. Try and keep your head up and remember that this dream only prove how important your sobriety is to you.

Ugh... That sucks! I have only had one dream so far. I was at some social gathering and someone offered me a beer. I turned it down at first but then said screw it its only one no one will know. Dream me instantly felt regret! I was so happy when i woke up and realized it was all a dream!
