Second to Hannah's birth 2 months ago the happiest day I have had in recovery was yesterday and you guys gave me so much happiness I had excess liquid pouring out of my eyes. I shared many Mission Possible posts with my mother last night the happiness is apparently infectious as I watched tears roll down her face. ..There really are no words. When I see people struggling with the concept of a higher power or a power greater than ourselves I know this well as a practicing Buddhist. I tried to come up with a way to show my gratitude for the happiness you gave me yesterday my attempts were feeble. ..I posted Sunday "we are a fortunate people" thread. The benediction hymn on Sunday when I went to church with my dad described my gratitude. Like many music is a very powerful tool in my recovery....where ever that music comes from. If you want to hear the beautiful music that goes with these lyrics there are many renditions on YouTube. Even if Mission Possible fell flat on its face next week I will cherish yesterday. You guys exemplify a higher power much greater than my self that leads and guides me every day. Thank you...Because I have been given much.I too must give.Because of thy great bounty Lord.Each day I live.I shall divide gifts from thee.With every brother that see.Who has the need of help from me..Because I have been sheltered fed.By thy good care.I cannot see another's lack and I not share.My glowing fire my loaf of bread.my roof saved shelter overhead.That he to me be comforted..Because I have been blessed by.thy great love dear Lord.I'll share thy love again.According to thy word.I shall give love to those in need.I'll show that love by word and deed.Thus shall my thanks be thanks in deed..
