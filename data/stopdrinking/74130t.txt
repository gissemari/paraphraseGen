I hit 50 days for the first time in the 2 years since I have attempted to stop drinking. ..Besides being the longest I've been sober since I was a teenager this is also the first time I've quit while not secretly plotting the day I will be free to drink again. ..No AA just building good healthy habits and checking in here a couple times a day. Thanks SD and everyone who posts here in particular those who post here after relapsing. Every time I see one of those posts it reaffirms my commitment to sobriety and reminds me of the person I will become and the feelings I will feel if I screw things up again...For the first time in my adult life I am feeling happy and hopeful for my future. I'm not just living sober because my family wants me to but because I want to be in control of my own rapidly improving life...Thanks!

I don't think I've ever felt this way in my adult life either you capture the newness of it so clearly. Congrats on 50 days and I won't drink with you today!
