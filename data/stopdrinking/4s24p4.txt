Or is that an actual '6' in my star? Squinting at the screen as I take my first sip of coffeee I realize "Holy Crap! I've been sober 6 months!"  -- I posted this earlier this morning but it didn't show up for some reason. Probably because I was caffeine-deprived I did something wrong or I'm post this twice...sorry if the latter is so...Thanks SD for helping me get here. It most certainly wouldn't have happened without you. ALL of you; from the dinos sticking around and offering wisdom from their experience to the peers struggling along with me to the newbies sharing their stories and inspirations...In reality it's just another day in which I won't drink but I never thought I'd walk a path that had me sober this long or had me thinking 'never again.' It feels good and I'm newly inspired to just keep going and keep adding up those days one at a time...Let's do this fellow sobernauts. If I can get here anyone can. Here's to the next sober 6 months.
