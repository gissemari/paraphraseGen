Today as I was sitting outside reading this sub for inspiration and hope on my journey through recovery I heard a furious buzzing inside that I thought at first must be one of the cats playing. I had the patio door open to let the animals in and out as they wish and when I went in to investigate it turned out a GIANT dragonfly (like the biggest I've ever seen in my life) had gotten in and was trapped in the window. As I frantically texted my boyfriend begging him to come help me (I HATE flying bugs) I googled "giant dragon fly trapped in house" tried to shoo it to the door with a broom panicked called for the cat to help all the while thinking "I could really go for a glass of wine after this!" I silenced that voice pretty quickly. Then I saw that under the search results it gave me some other search options one of which was "Dragon Fly in House Meaning." Curious and hoping for something to distract me I clicked on it. According to the googles quoting some (probably questionable) random internet source "The dragonfly in almost every part of the world symbolizes change and change in the perspective of self realization; and the kind of change that has its source in mental and emotional maturity and the understanding of the deeper meaning of life."  ...Well given everything I've been going through the past couple of days giving up drinking and trying to learn more about myself and my habits struggling through this that struck me really hard. Really fricken hard. I'm not one to believe in this stuff and like I said it's just a random un-credible source on the internet but after that I went back into the kitchen and looked at the (really actually beautiful) dragonfly in a new way grateful for its sign grateful for my life and my unknown future. When it's buzzing sent a shiver back into me I understood that shiver not to be fear but excitement and/or anticipation. I started crying and went back outside to reflect read more about dragonflies and write this post. ...That said anyone have any practical tips to get a dragonfly out of the house?

Dragonflies are harmless. Leave it alone or let it out of the window. Is it trapped between the screen and glass? Trust me...It wants to get out of your house worse than you want it out. 
My fianc e is the same way. I understand. My whole point wasn't to sound bossy or condescending I swear. My point was dragonflies are harmless and also they are good bugs. They are predators and eat the other bad bugs like mosquitoes and flies. Either way hopefully you can get the squatter out of your house sometime soon!
