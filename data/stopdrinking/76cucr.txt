Homestretch towards my big goal of one year. Lots of feelings about it but grateful today and grateful for SD and many other things. ..Still - yesterday marked the one-year anniversary of when my final ever (very bad) relapse began. This anniversary combined with some very noxious circumstances in my life right now and threw me harder than I have been thrown since quitting last year. ..I was really almost blinded. Very triggered to the point that even finding a *logic* as to why not to drink was nigh impossible for about an hour. But it passed as these things do. And I feel very solid again today...I wrote about this once before but as a numbers guy the end of year 1 is pretty great. Because you get 330 (11 months) 350 ( just because it sounds solid) 360 (12 months on SD as per 30 day month measure) and finally 365 for 1 year. ..Nice to end the year with a series of bangs and not just one. ..Not drinking with you all today.

Nice work! I'm far behind you but at least headed in the right direction.
so great to see your post.  Huge well done.."it passed as these things do" is something I will try to remember..
Congratulations! That's awesome! I will not drink with you today. 
Hey Numbers Guy! YOU GOT THIS! You are all but there at the first year sober behind you! I was within 2 months &amp; a few days when I slipped on 7/3 &amp; drank for about 4 hours. I got right back to though! The cravings don't come anymore (I'm on medication for that exact thing) but when they did like you all I had to do was wait them out. I've now learned how to do that. The key is distraction!
Good for you making it through that tough moment.  You're in the home stretch and so close to your year - you got this!!
