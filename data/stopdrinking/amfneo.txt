I'm aware that while on this type of antidepressant drinking can cause acute liver toxicity. Hell no! So I've made damn sure to SD on cymbalta. ..Well because of some bad mood swings I'm off the junk and now the main reason for SD is nonexistent. I'm going to stay strong however. Deep down I know if I reeeeeally wanted a drink I could have chances it. I can drink anytime I want to! It's always a choice...Thanks for reading and pray for our brothers and sisters that are struggling in their battles. .Tiwndwy. ..

I took Lexapro for GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). After I stopped drinking I didn't need it anymore.  Alcohol seemed to be the cause of my depression and anxiety.
