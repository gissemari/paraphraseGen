Today is the beginning of day 9 for me. So far I have had a leepless nights other nights slept excessively often felt exhausted and fought urges/cravings often. That being said my head is clearer I have begun eating healthier slowly starting to exercise and have lost 6 pounds in a week. I can only imagine how many calories I used to consume in a day vodka and cranberry was my drink of choice. Not to mention drunk eating. Although I am early in recovery and struggle everyday I feel much better physically love not being hung over everyday and looking forward to continued improvement. Thanks all for youth support!

* your support not youth :-)
I'm right behind you on Day 6! Way to go and thank you for sharing early experiences. 
Congratulations and welcome! 
Well done thanks for sharing!
Keep it up man. I have been sleepy the past 2 days. But that's ok. Better than being short tempered and having a pounding head.
I'm glad you're here! Thanks for sharing
