It's been 5 months since I've stopped drinking. I feel great and and no longer feel the need to drink to have fun with my friends. Instead of feeling upset I can't drink like my friends I'm proud that I do what I want with my life. ..For all of you still fighting your own battles keep strong  and know that I believe in you.

Thanks for the inspiration. Yeah these stories about celebs passing after suffering from addiction really hit home now. Before I viewed them as  gossipy  I guess. Now that I admit I'm an alcoholic I truly grieve and mourn for these people because I know know how insidious the disease of addiction is. ..IWNDWYT
What happened to him? Austin Powers was my favorite movies as a teenager. Great memories. RIP Verne. IWNDWYT
Perfect for me today  thanks.  IWNDWYT 
5 months &amp; change here too. Keep on keeping on and I won't drink with you today.
Good post! Hope to be in your boat in a few months. 
This tragic news has inspired me to quit drinking. I just subscribed to this sub today and today is my first day sober. I'm scared but hopeful.
