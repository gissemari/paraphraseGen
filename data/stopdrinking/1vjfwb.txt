After my assault I stopped talking. I tilled the empty corners of my mind setting up the ground for relapse unwittingly and unknowingly. I was consumed with shame and self-doubt and with a lot of anger. I had many urges to drink and go off and fuck up in other ways and rather than combat them I let them live and string around my head like kudzu...I was powerless anyway my best mate sexually assaulting me even though I had the height/weight advantage. What would it have taken for me to throw them off? Not much but I was scared. I couldn't react. And if I can't fight off someone who is that much shorter/lighter than I what power did I have anyway? I was weak...So I shut up and hung myself on the cross of self-pity. Not being able to talk about it for the first couple weeks? Understandable. But refusing to reach out when I needed to and should have was unreasonable. Powerlessness by means of self-pity...In the Big Book powerlessness is not about self-pity; it's about acceptance - you can't change the facts but you can change your relationship TO them. When Dr Bob tried to justify his addictions by saying "but at least I'm not a pillhead; I'm just a drunk" it was the equivalent of when a footballer goes all primadonna and falls when the opponent wasn't anywhere near them - kinda like what Mandzukic and Gro kreutz did that one match - all drama all flair all self-pity...The difference with powerlessness and if it's so you can wear the self-pity crown or if you are in need to accept the facts is all in whether or not you are WILLING or not to do the work. ..I should probably bring this up at the next meetin' I go to. I love recovery even if things are hard right now.

Very nicely said. Powerlessness can be scary but accepting it can also be liberating.
I was in Provincetown Mass back in the early 90s and I saw a great t-shirt that had a stick figure laying totally prone with caption total surrender.  AA and a lot of spirituality based "paths" make a similar point:  there is victory in total surrender.  That in fact is the point of powerlessness to me; I may not have a belief in any sort of traditional deity but in recognizing my powerlessness I am accepting the singular fact that I am not God.  By selfishly clinging to the notion that I am the cause of all good or bad or that all things that happen can only have meaning as they effect me--I am not powerless.  Conversely by recognizing my relative insignificance to the world even to people places and things in my immediate sphere--I am freed from the burden and bondage of self.
