It's been a journey for me. ..665+298 = 963 days of sobriety over the past 2+ years. It wasn't perfect but it was me. I did that. But I couldn't have done it without you /r/stopdrinking. I often go back and read [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2whkpv/665_days_back_at_day_1/) the morning after I messed up at 665 (especially when I'm on the road) and the thing that has stuck out to me the most in all your supportive comments is a simple phrase: "...be kind to yourself"..It took me 100+ days to get over my really horrible negative thinking about my relapse. To not feel like a complete and total failure in my sobriety. To get back to that positive mental attitude but I'm back. Because I was kind to myself that this is a lifetime journey but I only need to do it one day at a time. It's for that reason that I sort of count my days at 665+300 because I learned so much during those first 665 days that helped me succeed in the 300 days that immediately followed. I'm not saying relapse is good (fuck no!) but just that I've learned to appreciate the days that came before and appreciate each new day that I wake up with no hangover and say to myself "I will not drink today." And that those days combined tell the story of my sobriety and let me know that I can do this. ..It's like looking at a pizza as a pizza (my sobriety) even though there's a slice missing (my relapse) instead of just focusing on the slice that's missing and saying you're missing a slice so that's not a pizza... or something like that. Looking at what I did instead of what I didn't do...So if anyone is struggling today please be kind to yourself. You can do this. It gets better. Don't worry about tomorrow just worry about right now - today. ../u/offtherocks probably said it best:..> The single most important thing you can do right now is **not drink**...Be vigilant but also please be kind to yourself. <3

I love the pizza analogy! I am so sad when people relapse and feel like they've lost *all those days*. They didn't. You didn't.  I didn't.  They were building blocks to a greater journey in my case. Thank you so much for sharing. 
Really powerful post.  Thank you for sharing!
AWESOME! These are the real numbers now because you aren't going to relapse this time. Happy 300!
Sweet!
Yeah the pizza analogy is brilliant. It's kind of making me hungry too but that's another story. What's really standout about this post is your accountability AND self-compassion. You're right we are human we falter. It's pretty admirable that you came back so strong and didn't succumb to the potential for shame. That's very cool. Congrats!
