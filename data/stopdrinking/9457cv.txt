Hello StopDrinking..I want to share two things that changed my perspective and made me go sober in the hope of some of you benefiting from it...One is the concept of:..*"HALT (Hungry; Angry; Lonely; Tired)"* ..*"SHIP (Strategies Habits; Impulses; Physiology)"* ..and *"WAR (Willpower; Analytical; Reason)"*..which I saw beautifully explained in a Video called "Addiction Relapse Prevention Strategies" from Mark Duin where Mark Duin also talks of what truly fullfilles human needs and how drugs and alcohol trick and destroy us...I watched the video everyday for at least one or two weeks...I was still drinking while listening or watching it and I m still watching it since I ve stopped. ..The other thing that motivated me to stop drinking is a quote from Hamilton Morris...He said:..***"Alcohol is a crazily flawed molecule.  It s terrible. No other drug that I know of causes a hangover of that type where there is a toxic metabolite that poisons you the following day."***..This might sound trivial to some but I truly thought about why I was doing this to me every day and it got clear to me why I was always feeling sick...I was not only suffering from direct effects of alcohol but I was also getting poisoned daily by Acetaldehyd the toxic metabolite formed by alcohol that floated through my body every day...So I got my willpower together and stopped...StopDrinking in reddit helps me since I m clean and is a great support in keeping a clear perspective in sobriety and before...And now I m sober for 25 days and keep on going and feel good because I see alcohol for what it is and understand how I got tricked into believing it benefits me in some way or another.

Absolutely. I think that shift in mindset has been important for me as well. Alcohol made things fun temporarily but it was a constant poison I was injecting into my body. At least where I am the culture of drinking really muddles my ability to see alcohol for what it is. ..Congrats on 25! See you at 26 iwndwyt
Thank you - I just watched the video. Really good stuff!
