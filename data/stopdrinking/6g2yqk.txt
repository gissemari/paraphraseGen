I haven't stopped actively drinking since I was 19 having one to two drinks every day at the end of the day.  I grew up watching my parents do this I thought it's what adults did.  My drinking didn't get out of hand until my late 20's after a traumatic incident but I think I was going to go this route regardless.  I've quit drinking for both my pregnancies but post-partum depression always has me spiraling and drinking more.  My son is 15 months old and I realized my drinking was out of hand when I started turning to a shot and a beer by 11am for whatever reason or doing  chores... or right now I'm home from work to rest and my first thought is - should I just have a drink?..Not what I want.  I'm trying to ignore the alcohol throughout the house.  So I came here...Hello all.  I've been trolling this subreddit for a while now.  You gave me the push I needed and I hope I can stay inspired by your stories by coming here. ..Thank you for listening.

Hello. My kids motivated me to get well. They deserved a sober Mom. I protected myself by not having any alcohol in my home and didn't go to bars or hang with anyone who abused alcohol. I could not stay sober without lots of help from a therapist rehab and AA. Having a support system gave me the tools I needed to build the sober happy life I have today. I'm glad you're here. 
Glad you are here.  Can you get rid of the alcohol in the house?  If your husband still drinks can you just put it in the garage in a box for awhile?  I'm glad you came.  I'm glad for your 15 month old too.  I won't drink with you today.
I have adult kids and I wish every day that I quit when they were little.  You can do this.  You're going to love being able someday to look back on your kids' lives and know that you witnessed them sober.
