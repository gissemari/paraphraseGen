It happens.  It happened to me. ..You have to keep at it if you want to change. 
The only thing you can do after a relapse is learn from it and to get back on the wagon. You made it 41 days. That's no small feat.
also relapsed after 30 days I'm with you....all we can do is keep trying.
Relapse is a part of so many people's stories. Remember you are not alone and that despite this you can still get and stay sober again. Eventually this will be a blip. Know that acceptance is key and use this experience as a reminder that being sober is a much more beautiful existence than being drunk.
