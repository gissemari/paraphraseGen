It's been a really rough few weeks (not drinking-related; life-related). But I'm coming out of it just in time to see a nine in my badge star! Even though I technically have a few more days till the nine months if you want to get calendar about it. I really feel a sense of elation at this number for some reason. I guess I just kind of needed a milestone. ..As far as not drinking it's still paying dividends. When something bad happens and I *feel* it - yeah it sucks but the pain actually diminishes and transforms instead of festering inside me indefinitely (which was the case when I drowned it in alcohol). My body is still healing and I look better than I did even a few months ago. My spirit is still healing. ..To anyone struggling I hope you keep at it. The benefits aren't instant but it's so nice to have an upward trend in life for once!
