Slow day around here so I thought I'd share an amusing story I found over in the weekly /r/fitness [victory thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/u75f0/fittit_it_is_sunday_tell_us_your_victory_this_week/c4sx0dn)...>I squatted my old body weight of 200lbs as my working set after starting only a few months ago at a struggling 100lbs. An old man also made me feel amazing after my girlfriend and I broke up by saying "Son whatever's got you down isn't worth your time. Look at yourself you can have whatever you want. All you need to do is grow some balls an go for it." I then helped him feed the ducks for about 30 minutes...That's right /r/stopdrinking.  Look at yourself.  You can have whatever you want.  Grow some balls and *go for it*...And don't forget to take time out to feed the ducks.

Thanks for posting this I needed to see this today. 
Why don't the ducks grow some balls?
You're damn straight I can have whatever I want. I keep trying to tell *everyone else* this. I don't know what part they're aren't getting.
Just don't feed the ducks your balls... that could end badly.
