Last night I talked to my best friend since childhood and told her everything.  She knew a little of my struggle already but not the extent of how bad it got.  I told her everything and she loves me anyway.  Support is everything to me right now.  My friends this community.  I need people!  Humans need connection.  I've been living a double life for so long and I've realized I can't fix this completely alone.  The last few years have been awful.  I couldn't tell anyone how I was feeling what I was going through what I was doing to myself...I was so ashamed...and while I am still ashamed and I've pushed people away and hurt them because of this addiction and knowing that breaks my heart...reaching out gives me hope.  I am loved anyway!  You know why?  Because I am greater than this disease.  I am more than this disease! This isn't who I really am.  I'm not completely lost.  She knows my heart my intentions my love for people and animals.  I've been hurting myself because someone hurt me a long time ago.  I've been alone so long.  Many friends but all these secrets too and that kept me alone.   I wish I'd reached out sooner.  I am so incredibly lucky to have my friend.
