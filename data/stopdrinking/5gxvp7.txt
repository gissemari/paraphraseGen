[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I have started new work as a language teacher. It requires psychology humor patience and language skills and I love it. I especially love having a clear head and a sharp mind when I am talking to the students. I never would have been on my game like this when I was drinking.. .**Struggle:** The students can give an immediate written evaluation of my work. It can be a struggle to receive criticism especially when I feel it is unfair and does not help me grow as a teacher. But learning to separate the good from the bad is an essential part of my journey of sobriety...**General:** My mother is British so we always have Christmas crackers around the dinner table on Christmas and I just bought a box of them. What holiday traditions does your family have that you are preparing for?..
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:**  I went to Las Vegas for work and stayed sober the whole time...**Struggle:**  I have to fly home tomorrow morning.  Different people have different copes.  Some read.  Some watch TV.  I curl up in a little ball and sob in mortal terror...**General:**  Ever since I've travelled for work and especially more since I've been sober I've tried to run 5k (3.1 miles) in as many states as I can.  Just checked off Nevada.  Getting to see the outdoors of many places as I can beats spending all my time in a bar which looks just like every other bar in the world.
Triumph: I posted for the first time to SD today and got my flair. ..Struggle: I thought I would wake up today with no hangover and that would cause me to jump out of bed early fully awake and alert. I woke up late for work and took the day off. I slept all day - best sleep I have gotten in AGES. I feel guilty about it though. ..General: My cat situation is becoming ridiculous. They are complete assholes to me....OP what kind of Christmas crackers did you buy? I assume "crackers" are what I call "cookies"? :) 
I love Christmas crackers!..Triumph - I admitted finally to myself the internets and my therapist  that I'm an alcoholic.  This was a big barrier for me. .Struggle - In the process of buying/selling my house.  So frustrating. .General - Just got my hair done as a sober treat looks great! 
I'm loving this sub more and more! So I'll participate -..Triumph: I'm sleeping better and better every night. First I cut back on my drinking for a week we'll call it a trial. I stretched a bottle of whiskey out for a week which would normally last me two days. I refused beer at a party I went to over the weekend. I haven't had a drink since Saturday and I've been sleeping better hitting the gym every evening and correcting my poor diet...Struggle: I work in project management and just closed out a job that took me two months. The contractor is contesting our terms of payment and it's gonna hit a fever pitch tomorrow. I've wanted a drink since I got off work but all I've had is a few cups of tea some fizzy water and a melatonin...General: Dealing with some serious seasonal depression anxiety about my career and future but also able to enjoy the holidays my friends and getting to do the things I love again that alcohol was keeping me from. My family is preparing to visit my sister for Christmas and I'm looking forward to giving them their gifts since I can actually afford it this year!
Wow teaching language sounds challenging.  Everyone learns so differently.  Good luck!  ...Triumph:  ..Feeling more energized this week than I have in months.  I think I'm coming out of a funk.  Life is still overwhelmingly busy but I feel more up to the task now.  ...Struggle:..My challenge has been trying to balance homeschooling my kid with working 2 part time jobs.  I really love both my jobs and it's hard to set limits for how many hours I'll work each week because they really depend on me.  Trying to figure out how to tell my bosses that I'll be gone for a few weeks on vacation and only available to work remotely a fraction of usual time.   ...General:...My husband is from Arizona and we always have tamales and posole on Christmas Eve.  We host an open house party and have folks come and visit and eat all throughout the day.  It's pretty fun.
**Triumph:** I went to my third AA meeting in a row tonight and it's one I thoroughly enjoyed. There was even a sober house party after where I made so many new friends. We sat around a fire and drank seltzer! I brought a 12 pack of La Croix Lime and people loved it! Also I completed my FASFA for college today...**Struggle:** I've applied to a few jobs this week and haven't heard back from anybody yet. I am itching to make money for Christmas and I'm a little bit worried about buying presents...**General:** Overall it's been a phenomenal week. I have met so many incredible people and learned so much from the meetings I'm going to. We talked about our interests and I'm so excited to replace drinking with my various hobbies that have been on the back burner.
Just another quick check-in-- I'm exhausted from all this extra energy I have all the time haha...Congrats to everyone else checking in. You guys are the best.

T - Being a decent caring involved human being. ..S - Work is a bloody disaster lost confidence in my management team.. .G - Happy to be wrapping up a very trying 2016 looking forward to 2017
Triumph:   Excited about hitting the big 300 on Sunday. It's my Mom's birthday - what a wonderful way to celebrate my 300 with her and my family not drinking!..Struggle:   Something weird happened yesterday. I went to my girl friend's restaurant with another friend to have lunch. As we walked into the restaurant and passed the bar I felt absolutely PIST. I got angry I could feel my BP rising and even though I don't think I actually wanted a drink I knew I had to get out of there ASAP. So I told my 2 friends (fully aware of my sobriety) that I had something else to do and left. They understood no problem at all. I drove (like a maniac) to a nearby mall and just walked around trying to get my head together. It took a little while but it worked and I was fine. So I guess my handy tool of "just walk away" worked successfully...General:   Decorating the house is a big thing in my family. Somehow I managed to climb ladders hold onto the roof string lights set up lawn ornaments and put up the tree. Only problem? Something's wrong with the damn inflatable Santa Claus and he either leans to one side or completely passes out. Looks like me from last year!
Triumph: I remembered to move the elf on the shelf last night!..Struggle: I was tired and irritable at work yesterday. ..General: I feel excited. 
What language are you teaching?
**Triumph:** It's day 2 for me.**Struggle:** It's day 2 for me.**General:** I've never been so glad to have people understand what this is like I read all the stories and it makes me cry and gives me hope in equal measure. It's also making me understand how deep I was in before I realised I had a problem.
I'll play ball. ..triumph: made it through last weekend with people drinking around me. cravings peaked for a few days but have now calmed back down to zero. not a sip for me. ..struggle: my dad just retired and I booked a trip for us to go to a concert he wants to see to celebrate in a couple months. we've always partied together. this is going to be a challenge and I can already feel it. ..general: something strange. I had some non-alcohol kombucha yesterday at lunch (first time I've had the stuff in ages and a new brand at that). felt just fine afterwards maybe a little bloated if anything. around 8pm I stood up and felt dizzy. not nauseous or drunk feeling just dizzy. like maybe vertigo but I kept wondering if it was related to that kombucha with all its live culture ingredient. dizziness lasted a couple hours and I went to bed. just odd. 
Today I choose not to drink.
Happy Wednesday everyone!..Triumph: Not only am i sober but the budget i set up a few weeks ago is finally falling into a good rhythm! Soon enough I will be in advance on all my bills AND saving money to boot! It's a good feeling. ..Struggle: HEADACHES! Ugh. I think I must be withdrawing from the sugar content of alcohol more than the alcohol itself as I have also stopped snacking so much. My body will thank me for it!..General: I have a rental inspection this weekend and my room is a mess. We can't succeed at everything I guess  
Triumph: Recognizing the funk I'm in and trying not to let it spiral out of control. I know the negative self talk in my head can lead to just saying fuck it. I know this can be temporary working on getting back to my happy self...Struggle: Nothing brings out those old self esteem issues like dress shopping for me. I think this was the catalyst for my current state of mind. I don't dress up often but I was excited to get some nice outfits for vacation. Seeing myself in things that were far from flattering dashed all that out. Poor me right but I can really beat myself up sometimes when I want to. ..General: I have a big fabric advent calendar that my mom made when I was young every day you move a little stuffed bear into a different room of the house as he searches for Christmas. I loved that thing and still put it up every year. 
Triumph:.I woke up at 5:45am feeling awake and rested and proceeded to make a big breakfast for myself while watching Louie on my laptop. I laughed ate and messaged back and forth with some hometown friends and now I'm about to clean the kitchen. I almost feel like crying but a good cry not a sad one...Struggle:.I am financially struggling and am afraid of losing my apartment. The shear dread that comes with the thought of being homeless and losing everything is hard to manage and is very stressful making it hard to say no to alcohol and just give up...General:.I have been enjoying riding the public bus lately. My walk to the bus stop is nice and i sometimes have a conversation with a stranger about something small while I wait there. I like looking out the window while riding and being jostled around in my chair as the massive vehicle stops and goes and hits giant pot holes or swerves to miss them. It's really good thinking time..
Triumph:  I made it in the century club on my other account 100k+ Karma.  (before the adjusted scores too!) .Struggle:  My shoulder is jacked up went and saw a doc about it yesterday she prescribed me some benzos but apparently she didn't call it into the pharmacy so it was another tough night of sleep. .General: Our holiday tradition is roast beef and yorkshire pudding.  I don't know why we do this but we have ever since I was a kid.  Yorkshire pudding is super weird but man does it taste good! 
Triumph: I haven't drank since Saturday. During research into my drunken indiscretion it has been found that I was not a willing or really conscience participant. Granted it wouldn't have happened if I had been sober it is still considered a sexual assault. ..Struggle: I don't want to press charges because I don't think it would make anything better hubby is having a lot of anger issues (agrees that stringing this out would not be beneficial since guys wife knows and is taking care of karma) hubby wants to be karma for him..General: hubby and I are on a good path he knows that what happened was not a planned or wanted "affair" so he still has trust in sober me. Knowing all this has made me more resolute in my path to be sober. Before I viewed future sobriety as a fate worse than death now I'm planning the future with out alcohol front and center (all my future plans used to seriously include what alcohol I would drink and when)
Triumph: feeling very secure in my turning down "tons of free booze" at the company party tonight. I won't be going at all and that's okay. ..Struggle: just fighting depression and anxiety. Without alcohol I'm faced with myself again. ..General: hi I'm new! Hoping SD can help me stay confident in all my decisions. 
**Triumph** : I have not had a drink in 16 days for the first time in over 20 years...**Struggle**: I am beginning to feel complacent.  ..**General**: Virtual reality with a Vive is super bad ass.
T:  I'm back on the wagon again after some AWOL.  I'm starting to reach out again which is good because I had locked myself into a hideyhole for a while again.  I'm taking care of business slowly getting back into my art and in general getting my shit together after another massive mess I made.  Again....S:  Still digesting that my ex-boyfriend/friend is a clinically certifiable narcissist and never for one moment cared about me or us.  The psychology is baffling and still painful after all this time and still sinking in because I can understand how it works now but I will never ever understand how a human being can actually be that way.  And because one massive blow in the relationship department is never enough my (former?) "best friend" is also still "punishing" me with THE SILENT TREATMENT since I told her her recent treatment of me has become unacceptable so my eyes are slowly beginning to open about that "relationship" as well.  23 years down the drain.  Wow....G:  I'm not asking much for Christmas...  just this:  https://1drv.ms/i/s!AvfaCaklFbSIggBar-KL7xLiLdsc
**Triumph:** I'm in double digits y'all! I feel better and better about my decision to get sober everyday. There have been a few cravings but using tools I've learned here I've been able to quickly get past them. ..**Struggle:** I put on so much weight in the last few years with my drinking. I need to lose about 40 pounds but I haven't been able to get in the groove of exercising yet. I am physically exhausted everyday since I quit drinking. I'm hoping I can turn the corner very soon. ..**General:** I contacted our event planner yesterday to confirm that we'd have club soda and cranberry juice at our company party on Friday and she said yes. She later emailed me that she's now created a nonalcoholic signature drink for the event. That small act of kindness brought tears to my eyes. There's something about getting support from unexpected places. 
Triumph: I did not drink yesterday and I got a late-night work call from a client (11 pm) and I was ACTUALLY able to take it bc I wasn't passed out or smashed!..Struggle: I have not been sleeping well.  First night had the sweats and second night I was very jumpy at every little sound.  I'm sure this is a combination of being sober at night detoxing and being home alone due to my husband being out of town (cue the paranoia OMG what was that?!). ..General: I had a 9 am call this morning and forgot my phone was set to silent (so no alarm was sounding).  My cat smacked me in the face until I rolled over and saw it was 9 on the dot.  How does she do that? ..(edit:: my formatting was all off no idea how to get things bold I don't know how you all are so good at this) 
**Triumph:** I've been sober for 38 hours I went to my first meeting (Refuge Recovery) and I admitted to my mother that I have a drinking problem and I intend to quit. She has been concerned about me for a long time so admitting to her that I know I have a problem and am working on it will hopefully go a long way toward keeping me accountable. ..**Struggle:** I've been in a piss-poor mood and I have a massive headache. I know this will pass though. Just trying to stay as busy as I can within the limits of the minimal amount of motivation that I have at the moment...**General:** I have hated my job for a long time but I've always just been too tapped out by the misery of my job by the end of a work day/week to look for another. Recently I realized I had enough money saved to quit without anything else lined up... so I did! I gave my two weeks notice on Monday and I'm very much looking forward to the mental health time I have planned between my last day of work and New Years and to whatever new opportunities might lie ahead. 
T:  I passed three hundred days without alcohol!  Thanks to everyone on this sub for helping me get there.  It's no exaggeration when I say that I couldn't have done it without all of you!..S:  Getting my life in order;  since quitting drinking I've found myself to be less productive  and less on top of things.   I think I was so concerned with keeping up with appearances to show to myself and others that alcohol wasn't a problem in my life...G:  Last minute xmas shopping has been getting harder with online shopping.  It seems like stores carry less inventory now than they did before. 
**Triumph:** I'm doing really well in this algebra class I'm in.   I am so close to getting an A.  Two more tests and the semester will be over.  Sobriety has helped immensely.  I'm excited and proud of myself to be back in college after all these years...**Struggle:** How to get out of an ugly sweater party? I don't want to go because I know it's a drinking party where shots will be thrown back left and right.  My SO doesn't want to go either.  We haven't committed to going so I'm trying to figure out how to say no...**General:** Holiday traditions.. hmm.  This is the first Christmas my husband and I will celebrate as a married couple.  I'm excited to see my dad and brothers on Christmas Day. They are all (mostly) sober too so it should be a nice afternoon.  We listen to Vince Guaraldi's Charlie Brown Christmas music and watch football.  I always like to put on The Pogues Fairytale of New York. 
**Triumph:**  Tree is decorated had a good honest conversation with the GF last night all drama-free.  Thank the good lord!  And I'm having no booze cravings at all despite the holiday approaching...**Struggle:**  I always feel rushed to get my Christmas shopping in.  It just comes up so fast!  And I'm still not implementing the healthy patterns I want in order to move forward in some areas of my life.  Not the GF's fault - gotta assert myself...**General:**  I'm Swedish so lots of family traditions growing up!  I used to make glogg the traditional alcohol drink but not even going to try for a NA version of it.  Just not the same. I usually make different pickled veggie dishes get the traditional potato sausage make Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce and the food list goes on.  Smorgasbord is real y'all!  This year I'm going to keep it simple and just have a smattering of traditional foods with Mama sending in the pepparkakor cookies.  No family around so the evening of singing songs wearing paper crowns and playing games isn't going to happen.  It's both a relief and sad.  But I love my tree and we're going to drive around and look at the best of the Christmas lights in my area.
..Triumph: I've finished about 75% of my holiday shopping and it's only been two weeks but I've broke the 185 lb mark for the first time since I can remember.  I had been active usually 3-4 days a week before when I would black out and got extremely hungover Friday-Monday but I could never get below 185 lbs.  Also today a co-worker said I look slimmer...Struggle: My boss and more senior co-workers are out the rest of the week and every day there are people looking to go to a bar at lunch.  Also I have a large get together with old colleagues from college this weekend.  I've always been the drunk and I'm a little scared but still want to go...General: I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the bloat and updated to the latest Nougat operating system.   Playing with the new features will keep me busy and possibly distracted from getting work done...
Teaching language sounds great! ..Triumph: I actually got my teenagers to pose for a Christmas card picture. And I like the way I look. I'm not deleting the picture because of my bloated red face. I have a family photo y'all!..Struggle: My weight loss has plateaued (after like all of 2 pounds off). My sleep improvement and skin improvement have plateaued. I miss being able to wake up early enough to get coffee or look at my tablet before work. I'm just bleah on the plateau. ..General: Christmas stockings. My Mom always filled these when we were kids and my husband is like super into this. Every year he insists we buy all these little things for stockings on top of the big things and every year it stresses me out. But I can't admit it stresses me out because tradition Scrooge etc. But I'm so busy dealing with family stuff and presents under the tree and shipping things and the menu and can I also admit that I don't like having to cook and buy for a freaking office party? Well I will try to have a better attitude. I am lucky to have these obligations.
**Triumph**: I made split pea and ham soup in my slow cooker. My house smells like ham...**Struggle**: My achilles keeps playing up so I run then it hurts then I take time off think its fixed then it isn't and I have to take more time off. I guess I have to go to the physio. ..**General**: I am doing xmas for the first time at my apartment as in cooking xmas dinner and everything so I get to create new traditions. AND the parents and SO's family are coming. I am terrified and excited!
Triumph: I've posted here before that I'm transitioning between jobs and working both part time until the end of the year. I was getting super burnt out at my first job (retail sales) and dreaded going to work 4 days a week. It was giving me a lot of anxiety. Yesterday I received an email from a customer thanking me for helping him! It made my day and gave me the boost I needed. ..Struggle: it's going to be difficult for the rest of the month because my store will be open an hour later for the holidays and I already wasn't getting enough sleep as it was. But I'll have a day off on Christmas! ..General: lots going on and it's tempting to want to drink to escape responsibility but I CAN'T and I WON'T and most importantly I don't WANT to. 
Triumph:  I have not drank since Saturday!..Struggle:  I have not been going to the gym in the AM before work..General:  I like my life and where I live.
Triumph: I'm trying new things in my kitchen which has always scared me to the point of stopping me...Struggle: there are some many things happening right now that are out of my control especially with my family.  It gets me into a place where I'm waiting for the good things in life to go bad...General: I met a man in the grocery today at 8am buying 12 beers.  He was shaking.  I started out my day grateful to be sober and that is always a good day.
Triumph:  I hosted a bunch of girlfriends for a clothing swap at my house last night where we all get together and exchange our unwanted clothes and accessories.  Last clothes swap I drank most of a box of wine and embarrassed myself.  Last night I just ate way too many cookies!  I had a great time hanging out.with my friends and my house isn't trashed this morning.  Plus I got some super cute new clothes in a smaller size!..Struggle:  The aforementioned cookies.  I'm on a weight loss journey and counting calories so too many cookies and chocolates make me feel gross and sad.  But that might be my impending period as well...General:  Other than cookie-and-pms-induced grossness I'm feeling really great lately.  I've gotten lots of compliments on my weight loss I got a rockin new hair cut and this is my busy time at work so I'm making tons of money.  Sober life is good!
Triumph: I am much more clear headed. I've been sleeping. I've even started to see the tiny spark of creativity coming back. I haven't been interested in anything the past few years so this is huge for me. I went to my first big drinking event this past weekend. I'm in Indy and big 10 was in town. Not a sports fan but they had the St. Elmo's shrimp cocktail eating competition at fan fest. I went with a friend who knows my situation and I took exactly 0 dollars so I wouldn't be tempted to buy anything. I could smell the beer all around me (and got some spilled on me) but it didn't bring up any cravings. In fact seeing people drunk that early made me wonder if any of them would remember seeing the games that evening. Also solid poops FTW. ..Struggle: I am sleeping. TOO much. I can't seem to get on a normal schedule. Even when I go to bed early I still sleep forever. Also still jobless and having to rely on and ask for help is really hard for me. I feel terrible but I'm glad i have people in my life that care and want to help me. ..General: after watching the eating contest and watching some crazy videos on YouTube of people eating like 15 pounds of mashed potatoes I was left with the burning question of what the bathroom situation was like the next day... Didn't really find my answer for competitive eaters but after some amount of jumping around Google I learned that the longest poo on record from a human being was 26 feet. WTF. Now you know lol. 
**Triumph:** Things are going well...**Struggle:** I easily fall back into patterns of procrastination and avoidance. At least I recognize what I am doing but it's still very frustrating...**General:** My mom is coming to visit over Christmas. it's the first time in maybe 13 years we'll be together for the holiday--she hates to travel in the winter and it's a busy time at work for my wife and I. I'm looking forward to it even if I have to explain that "yes Mom I'm still not drinking. Yes Mom I still go to those meetings."
Triumph: 10 days! ..Struggle: Not getting overwhelmed by my feelings. Sometimes they really are irrational unfounded. Sometimes appropriate. ..General: Trying to practice action above worrying and over-analyzing everything. Like sometimes I get jealous or worried that my partner is drifting. This is a time waster and energy sucker. I realize I need to spend less time thinking and worrying about that/him and more time in action toward my goals. .
**Triumph:** I passed the exam I'd been worried about scoring poorly on. This means that I'm on my way to tripling my income within the next month or two. Another friend told me that I was her inspiration to get sober and that felt great because I love her and want the best for her. ..**Struggle:** Found out my parents are basically poor and they've been lying about it and now they're out spending hundreds of dollars on Christmas presents none of us need. We are all grown and there are no grandkids. I can barely take care of myself I can't afford to take them on. ..**General:** I feel really good. If you take my sketchy diet out of the equation I've never been healthier. Not that it matters to me but people notice and that makes me feel great about my decision to stop drinking. 
**Triumph:** I seem to have found the recipe for keeping my weight down to where it should be and have noticed that now I have a decent amount of sober time under my belt my impulse to eat until I pop has subsided a lot...**Struggle:** I'm currently working towards a leadership &amp; management qualification and the deadline for my first assignment is Monday. It's time for procrastination to leave me!.....**General:** Every Christmas morning me and a few friends go around our village playing carols. We get invited into houses for food and drink. This will be the first year I won't be drinking malt whisky at 9 in the morning (it was traditionally the only day of the year I drank whisky)... 
**Triumph**: Stayed sober tonight.  Was over at a good friends watching his cat with just myself some Netflix and... his liquor cabinet.  I know it sounds like a small triumph but it's still a triumph..**Struggle**: Went to an AA meeting tonight that was kinda weird.  I mean this is going to happen from time to time.  But there is times if I hit the wrong meeting I feel like "Oh shit... how am I ever going to do this.".**General**: Work is good.  I think I may be getting a promotion.  People like me more when I'm not drunk so that's good.
