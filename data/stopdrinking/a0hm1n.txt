Even nearly 17 months sober I still feel like I straddle the worlds -- fully sober and yet always an outsider looking in on what I imagine my recovered sober life to look and feel like. I feel like I should be taking off like a rocket ship into the future unencumbered by the chains of alcoholism and addiction -- I have to make up for the last 18 wasted years of drug and alcohol use and I want it *now*. . .I often struggle to forgive myself for not being somewhere else in my 34-year old life. I should be farther along! Faster! More! Give me all the promises of sobriety now! Addicted to progress like I was addicted to alcohol. I forget that two years ago I was living in my car sleeping in 15F degree weather with no heat peeing in the night's empty wine bottles. Not showering for two weeks at a time. Unemployed. Chasing fanciful and ill-conceived plans doomed to fail. ..And as I sit typing this in a warm home with a job I enjoy I realize I am hard on my sober self. Getting to this point from those months living in the car didn't happen overnight. I don't know why I thought sobriety was going to be hard-and-fast full of fun surprises rapid changes and heave-ho let's go on-to-the-next-adventure. That is to say I don't know why I thought sober living was going to have the same pace as drunken "living". The oblivion of drunkenness is a deceptive time machine. ..Instead my recovery process almost gets *slower* every day in that the the rich detail of what Life really **is**...and what it **is not**...gets laid bare more and more. The power of choices and how those choices roll forward into the future is an awe-inspiring humbling and sometimes terrifying realization for me an addict. It is a realization which daily causes me to plan my steps carefully and honor steps which I have already taken. Nothing is taken for granted and nothing is thrown away. ..I am here today because I made choices to be sober many choices every day and stacked them brick by brick into a new life. The house that Sobriety built is not a pop-up carnival tent; it is a cathedral built with patience and attention to every detail. Sobriety is beautifully intricate and fine-tuned; it is the song of my life and it has a tempo to follow.  ..Take your time my friends. Honor the tempo of your own sobriety. .... ..

That was beautiful!
Great post!  
Beautiful end to the weekend. Thank you. 
That was wonderful and just what I needed! Thank you  
Bravo!  Encore!
I loved reading this! I think we all get frustrated with the lack of instant benefits and there just seems to be so much more time to wait through when sober. But when I think about myself building something brick by brick day by day that's incredibly comforting. Thank you.
Thanks friend! I too want it all and want it all NOW! Grateful today to be learning patience. It allows me to live each day instead of just getting through. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! Peace
Beautifully written and so powerful. This really rings true fit me thank you for sharing this!
Needed this today thanks!
Great reminder. Thank you. 
That this is happening that we are able to build create and withstand the elements that we can get our forward momentum going forward and our sober wits working again this *is* the miracle the unicorn the sunshine and the rainbow.  The miracle is happening inside me.  It's a thing of beauty.  This post is lovely thank you.  
Beautiful. Thank you that message is so powerful.
Needed that. Beautifully written. Thank you.
&gt; The oblivion of drunkenness is a deceptive time machine...I called this the time-warp or taking the warp-whistle. Gotta beat the levels all the way through to rap the game. 
I needed this today. Thank you.
Sometimes I think addiction into recovery is a blessing. We are forced to peel away the ugliness and see with humility how we will choose to move forward. What brick will we choose and where will it fit in? Patience and persistence and living in the moment is a requirement. Along with self awareness that many people never examine...Beautifully written friend.
Congratulations.  ..Thank you. Very moving post. 
Thank you for the share very good advice...I find myself being much more acutely aware of the power of my choices now that I'm actually thinking them through. It's only day 8 for me so it's infinitely better than a week ago but I can imagine that as the days weeks go by the marginal increase will be less...But hey I'll take it over who I was :)
Beautiful and very sincere eye-opening post. Thank you!
This is beautiful and profound. Thanks for the reminder to have patience with myself I really needed that.
Great share thanks for that 
Lovely
I just read a book that was talking about where we find joy it's not in the grand things. The big stuff like getting a better house car job etc...Life is in the small ordinary moments. The tiny things. Drinking coffee in the morning chatting with a friend sitting inside while it's raining outside under a blanket...Sobriety is life. Real life. Its not a ticket to achieving huge lofty unreachable goals. It is about claiming back those tiny moment of real life. ..And I would rather have all the small moment than any of the big achievements. Sobriety is teaching me that life is in the everyday and that is ok...IWNDWYT. 
Thanks for posting. I can really relate- I wish I was further along too and I'm really hard on myself.
Excellent post. Saved for future reference  
Thank you I needed to read this. Tearing up a little but in a good way. Thank you so much. 
Thank you. Just what I needed to read. 
Delaying gratification was one of the key reasons I decided to get sober. I realised that chasing instant gratification was only leading to misery...Thank you for posting it's a timely reminder for me...I will not drink with you today.
This is my favorite post of the day! Thank you for sharing. I will not drink with you today. 
Well said and congratulations on 17 months. 
I love your perspective. Thank you for sharing it with me. Time is something about which I keep having to remind myself. That its passage takes a while. And with it come some good well-earned things. Mostly truth. I feel like the one thing time undeniably delivers is truth.  ..Can I just add.....&gt; Chasing fanciful and ill-conceived plans doomed to fail. ..I really hope you don't discount this part. Everyone has dreams. Most people don't chase them. You did and I think that's highly commendable. Whatever it was it may not have worked as you set out but it is a part of your story and I have to think your life is richer for having taken a chance. ..&amp;#x200B;
Thank you for the post. Just what I needed to read. A daily struggle of impatience.
