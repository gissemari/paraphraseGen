After getting sober 7 weeks ago today my biggest struggle was just getting through a day without drinking or eventually just not thinking about drinking (daily drinker of many beers for over a decade). ..Past few weeks instead of "How am I going to get through this day without a drink?" now it's just "How am I going to get through this day?"...I drank mostly to cover the shit abusive marriage I am in. Wife is borderline narcissistic drunk. Not many options to get out of it as finances are all tangled up we work together (i.e. no separate incomes) we have massive debt and 2 young kids. ..I feel stuck in this hell and drinking seems the only escape. But I know it was my drunk decisions that kept making things worse over the years and I know that to get out I need to make sober smart decisions...I know if I can just hang in there stay sober stay smart stay prepared that some opportunity will come where I can leave. It's like Castaway where all the main character needed was some opportunity to wash ashore for him to sail away...Anyway the full weight of your life's problems come to bear when you sober up. I'm not giving in and I'm not going to relapse. I will not drink today.

Thank you for saying this. I'm deep in my shit right now but at least I'll cry at night instead of cry after i get drunk. This is a gift. Hope things get better for you and I'm proud of you 
I'm in the marriage boat also.  I used to drink "at her" and then blackout verbal chaos assaults would happen once the emotional levee broke...We're giving it one last shot....turns out being sober makes expressing needs frustrations and hurts much more "heard" and constructive...Far far.....FAR from being in marital bliss anytime soon but making progress.  Sobriety is the only thing that's changed since our last attempt to patch this together and so far so good with a much different and more meaningful feel to it...Sobriety and owning your shit and focusing on being the best version of yourself makes marriage easier.....who knew?
