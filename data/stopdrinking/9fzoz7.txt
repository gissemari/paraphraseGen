One night i was drunk but wanted to open the windows. My inspector missed a broken window and as I opened windows it slammed down on my hand. Broke my acrylic nail nail underneath and nail plate under and exposed my bone. I've always been someone to get my nails done so I'm devastated. The specialist had to take my nail off and stitch back my nail plate over my exposed bone. Now it may not grow back and I'm woke.

I know nothing about nails except my big toe is trying to grow its nail back. Air Canada lost my ski boots and I had to rent some. It sure looks funky. ..I remember your username. You and I traded posts when I first subscribed. You were going to a baby shower in Ohio. I see you finally moved back. ..I hope everything else is hoing well now that you are close to your family. ..IWNDWYT
