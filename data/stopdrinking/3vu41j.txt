I just wanted to reach out bc right around this short period of sobriety last time I decided to drink again for no good reason. I definitely feel calmer this time around maybe because I know how quickly a few beers would lead to a week-long binge that would end with me in bed sick and full of anxiety messaging the admins to reset my badge. I don't want to be back in that place. So far exercise has offered something to focus on and expend my energy in a healthy way. I feel like a different person and wonder why I ever drank something for so long that made me feel the opposite of how I do now..For anyone who is contemplating getting sober or struggling on day two or three or at whatever point of sobriety I just want to impart that every day I am sober feels like a gift one that I turned my back on for a long time and I don't want to waste another day of my life that way. .Ultimately I don't know what the future holds but I can control the present and tonight I will get into bed sober and tomorrow me will be enormously grateful.

&gt; tonight I will get into bed sober and tomorrow me will be enormously grateful..Hear hear!
There are quite a few men and women I know in sobriety who had a hard time getting sober and staying sober--and then they did.  Sadly far more just disappeared.  I couldn't personally had to stop and stay stopped.  That's when life got good.
With every such message I feel the weight lifted again from my shoulders as if it were yesterday. Thanks for sharing makes me smile. Thank you.
Such a great inspiring post.  Going to bed sober and waking up sober.  That is a gift!  Very happy for you.
