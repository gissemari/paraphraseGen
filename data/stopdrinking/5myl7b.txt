This is the longest I have gone without a drink since August. I stopped just short of 90 days for some bad mood or some other stupid excuse. ..I thought having gone so long without and feeling good about it- well of course I could have a beer or two. So wrong. I've struggled to get a week or even two together since then- but feel stronger now. I have to remember I can't control my drinking there's no such thing as just one for me anymore. ..

Congrats - I'm right behind you!  I did something similar last year after about 110 days decided I'd be able to moderate.  It worked for a couple of months and then started creeping back to my old normal.  After waking up with a hangover the day after boxing day I decided to start over.
19 days is great! Congrats.
