Another relapse. This one found me being carried down the stairs of a bar/music venue by my brother who now knows how bad of a drunk I am. He was in town to have fun and see live music. I got trashed and we had to go home early cause I couldn't walk. ..Right now the shame I'm feeling is keeping me sober. I know the shame will fade I'll feel happier in a few weeks. I will want to go out again relapse again once I've forgotten how bad I feel today. ..How do you stay sober after you're done feeling like garbage once the fresh sting of shame has faded?..TY for reading

Nothing changes if nothing changes. What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?
Never be ashamed.   We have a mental illness alcoholism that drives us to do this shit...Only regret should be not getting help.  
Write down how you feel so remind yourself when you have the desire to drink again.
I needed all the help I could get. Meetings therapy and working the steps with a sponsor. What are you willing to do differently this time?
We can only move forward from here. I will not drink with you today.
Shame is something I struggle with as well. No advice but you're not alone. I won't drink with you today.
I think sober has to become the new normal. The longer I'm sober the better chance I have of staying that way but it's one day at a time for sure!
The sting of shame definitely fades but I keep those memories to play it forward when I am tempted to drink. That seems to work pretty well for me. Good luck!!
