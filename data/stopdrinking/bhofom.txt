I was having a conversation with my girlfriend last night as we're trying to figure out our relationship. I mentioned that I was a different person when I met her someone who drank all the time felt lost and that while I generally feel like the same person now as then something deep has changed in me where I don't want the drink won't put up with as much bullshit and things like that. ..She kept saying how that when she drinks she doesn't feel like a different person and doesn't understand why I would be different. It's difficult to impossible to make someone understand how daily drinking or frequent binges affect your body and mind to the point where when you stop things are different.  She also then went on to say that I don't open up to my friends about my drinking and that no one had any idea. ..Once again most people don't understand and many of my friends have alcohol abuse symptoms themselves and think in absolutes. Absolutes being fine or at rock bottom. Since I wasn't living on the streets in detox/hospital or jobless from alcohol I didn't have a problem. I tried to explain that even if I told my friends about my struggles with alcohol that it would be difficult for them to understand because it's my struggle. Everyone on this sub struggles with alcohol but our journeys are vastly different and our requirements for support are different. Telling my friends no to a drink is far easier than trying to explain all the reasons behind the no...TL;DR: People have a difficult time listening to and understanding what you're going through with regards to alcohol because it's so unique to each person.

I find life much more clear when I abandoned being responsible for what anyone does or does not understand...I used to spend and waste a lot of energy on that...The dark secret is *People understand what they* **want** * to understand*...What I found more useful is *Saying what I want*...I don't need anyone to understand my decisions or choices.  I want them to *Respect* them.
Sorry man. I let go of the idea of others understanding. There are places for that-aasdsmart...
