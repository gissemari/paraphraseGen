I've been struggling with issues that I used to drink to maybe exacerbate are now still here I just don't drink. I have a really hard time with anxiety (I see a professional) and so things like going out on the weekends to do fun things not just errands are hard to do - I used to drink a lot the day before and then I was too hungover to do them. Now I feel fine have the time a clear head and money but the sense of dread is still there (until I arrive at the place and then it usually wears off). This is sort of a long post but it is getting easier. Wanted to share that in case anyone else has similar things. IWNDWYT. and per another popular post a few days ago my old lady skincare cream arrives today. &lt;3
