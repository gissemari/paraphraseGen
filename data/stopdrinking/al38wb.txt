I've been to rehab twice and have struggled with hard drugs but now it's only alcohol that is giving me problems. I cant seem to get past 3 days anymore. I'm going to school and have just gotten promoted at work. I cant help but feel like the only thing in between the person who I want to be is alcohol. Need some support but I wndwyt

Ready to loose that promotion over alcohol? 
I understand completely.  I had to go to rehab to get over a huge zanax addiction.  I thought alcohol couldn't be nearly as bad. Wrong!!  It's worse cause I can drive 1/2 mile up the street and get as much alcohol as I can carry...Took me having to sneak drink vodka in coffee cup (to hide it from my husband) to even be able to get out of bed.  Awful stuff...IWNDWYT !!!
