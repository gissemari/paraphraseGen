Not sure why I drank these past 2 days. I was sober for 8 months then this past month has been a struggle. Wanted to reach out to my reddit buddies for some encouragement and support. I'm hurting today with this detox. I am staying sober with you all today!.

Starting again is what counts. Detox is not fun but you have done it before so you can do it again. I read it does get harder each time we relapse but I do not know from experience since this is my first time quitting. Good for you on day one again! You got back on the sober road quick and that is good too! You got this! IWNDWYT
Hello friend I'm sad to see you are still  struggling.  From past posts and conversations we've had I know why you drank.  You're an alcoholic.  Drinking is what alcoholics do.  It's our natural reaction to the world.  To good times. To bad times. To any times.  ..The real problem is that just not drinking doesn't actually fix the problem in my experience.  It's my thinking that is broken and unfortunately I can't fix my thinking with my thinking.  I need help and I need it from other folks that have the same problems as me.  Because they get it they understand and they've made it through.  So they can show me how they did it.  Like I said before it's why I hang out with old men with decades of sobriety - they have what I want. ..I love this sub - it's a great tool for my sobriety - but it's unfortunately full of a lot of nice people.  I know a guy that says  be careful of the nice guys they're the ones that will kill you.   What he means by that is that it's the people saying  don't worry about it   you're doing great  or  aww I'm so sorry that's happening  that are enabling those old thought patterns.  Don't listen to them.  You should worry about it.  Alcoholism is progressive and deadly.  You're not doing ok you're playing with Fire.  And I don't like to hear that you're suffering but I'm not sorry this is happening because it doesn't have to be happening.  You're an alcoholic and you're not treating it.  This is the result.  In my experience sobriety should be taken seriously and treated like a full time job.  It is THE most important thing in my life.  Without it I eventually lose everything else. ..That same guy also tells me don't listen to those who say  just keep doing what you've been doing  or  pick yourself up and get back to what was working you've done this before.    guess what?  You're way isn't working.  Your way wasn't working before either.  To get and STAY sober i really had to make radical changes in my way of life and my way of thinking about the world.  ..I've stayed sober for awhile now and I still have to keep making those changes.  The work never stops. I'm still not healthy.  I drank alcoholically for 20 years and I'm not better just because I haven't drank for the last year and a half.  I'm actually only starting to really understand how sick I am. ..You may have had 8 months (sort of minus that glass of wine that one night right? But all the nice folks said it didn't matter...) and I may have not drank for the last 18 months but all either of us have is today.  I'm just as close to a drink as you.  I have to treat my problem every single damn day.  ..Having watched your sobriety story from the sidelines I can tell you there are a two major things I'm doing that have kept me sober this time (I'm a chronic relapser) that you don't seem to be doing:..1. Working with other alcoholics in real life.   Not just the internet.  I had problems with AA for awhile. It turned out that I actually had problems with judgment. I've found some of the best most supportive folks I've ever met.  None of the ones I associate with force a belief system on me and when stuff goes wrong (and it does) they are right there to come chat or get coffee or go out to lunch or hold me when I cry.  I need the fellowship of other alcoholics because like you are proving I can't do it on my own or just with some app.  I need the human factor. ..2.  Working a PROGRAM.  My mind has been the issue all along and despite having a &gt;140 IQ graduating at the top of my high school grad school and law school classes I'm just not smart enough to outsmart alcoholism.  I can't fight the disease (alone) with the thing that is diseased.  In fact my smarts my resilience my drive - these things have all proven to be a liability for my sobriety.  Here are the traits I've found to be useful in this journey: being honest with myself and others listening to other people's suggestions and taking them NOT listening to my mind being open minded surrendering to the fact that I'm not enough alone and most of all being willing to do what I'm told.   I needed discipline.  It doesn't have to be AA but if you're a real alcoholic like me the chance of staying sober without some sort of program that you're actively involved in is pretty slim.  Alcohol is cunning baffling and powerful.  It's just waiting for your guard to drop.  ..So I don't have the  you'll be ok  message for you because unless you do the work and completely devote yourself to changing you won't be ok.  It doesn't matter that you got some time before.  I had 6+ years at one point started a slow relapse and lost 5 years of my life to it nearly dead and having lost almost everything before I was able to break the walls down that I'd built against AA and stop again.  All that prior  time  and knowledge I had built up was completely useless.  I could not stop.  I tried everything I could and nothing worked until I was willing to accept real help from real-I can touch-people who suffered from alcoholism like me and found a way out. ..I pray that it doesn't have to happen for you like it did for me.  Literally I'm praying that right now.  I'm watching your sober story for two reasons: (a) I'm rooting for you and I want to see you get better and maintain it; and (b) you provide a reminder of how recovery goes when I don't work a program.  You show me me just a little over a year and a half ago. ..I absolutely mean it when I say I love you and I'm rooting for you.  And that's why I can't give you a nice guy response.
