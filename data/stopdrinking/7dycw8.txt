I ran 13.1 miles this morning and finished in 2:30 I would not have been able to do this while drinking every other day like I was a few months ago. I've had some relapses but for the past two months I've had way more sober days than not. This allowed me to train without hangovers and finish in what for me is a great time. I'm proud of myself and this gives me motivation to stay sober and healthy!  Iwndwyt
