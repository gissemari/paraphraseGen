Well here I am at three months and I can honestly say this is the longest continual sober spell I've had since I began drinking back in high school (I'm 29 now). I actually came very close to drinking on the weekend (on day 89) and it surprised me that I can still have suck strong desires and that I can still struggle to keep my head rational. I didn't drink though and here I am with triple figures in my sights...My story isn't on of rock bottom or anything really - I realised one night that drinking was making me tired and lethargic and that I was probably drinking more than I would have liked. So I quit...It wasn't easy but it was simple - just don't drink. Sure the desires come and go at times (like on the weekend) but they are always passing moments within a long journey of sobriety. I've learnt to be gentle on myself and let them come and go. I tell myself that "worst case I drink and start again tomorrow" and surprisingly I'm yet to pick up that first drink...SD has been a huge help and every time I feel like I'm ready to have a few beers again a thread pops up to remind me why I made this choice and why I have been working so hard to stay sober. ..It's a personal struggle that no one understands but me (not even my wife). It sure is good however to have some company along the journey from everyone here. What an amazing community and an amazing group of individuals!.
