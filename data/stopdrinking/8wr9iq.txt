Stay strong. Remember that feeling.
Goodnight mate. Enjoy a better day tomorrow. 
If it's any consolation you posting this message has helped me not relapse.

Be proud of yourself You didn't use that relapse as an excuse to keep drinking you used it as a lesson and you learned from it...Then you got straight back on the horse that shows dedication and courage...IWNDWYT :)
