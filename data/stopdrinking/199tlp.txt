I'm 24 years old I got a DUI saturday night. I blew .15 at the station. I struggle with depression pretty bad and I have been using alcohol to make myself feel better temporarily because it does. ..I feel like an absolute scumbag for driving drunk and I don't know how to handle this. I'm graduating college from a low tier commuter school in may with a B.S. in finance and I feel like potential employers are going to overlook me because of this. ..I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years about 6 months ago. It was an unhealthy relationship i neglected my friends and spent all of my time with her. Now I have no friends. I am literally all alone I have no-one to talk to I am broke and now I have no career to look forward to. That was the only thing keeping me going...I can't shake the feeling that killing myself is my best option right now. I'm already so depressed and this is going to greatly exacerbate that. I need some sort of hope of being successful making friends or getting a girlfriend again. I am so sad I really can't see a reason to go on. I'm going to lose my license and thus my job i work 23 miles from my home. ..Is there any hope for me to have a successful career in something that isn't entry level work? What should i do? I have this pit in my stomach it's a very strange feeling. It's not like my normal depression it's a feelilng of total hopelessness. I am totally fucked there's no way around it. I keep crying during the day at work and at home it's embarassing. Please help me.

You're life is far from over - there aren't many companies that are going to exclude you simply because of a dui.
I understand that the floor may seem is falling from beneath you but my DUI 5 months ago has been the worst and best thing that has happened in my life. It will really help you analyze where you place importance in this moment right now and in the future...I was flat out depressed for two months. I had that same deep sinking feeling in my gut just as you did. A lot of guilt shame embarrassment. I've never been in trouble with the law nor have had any tickets etc. ..I am dusting myself off and working on getting into grad school and am just as afraid as you are. If your employer has an issue then just try elsewhere for jobs. It isn't a dead end...If you have the urge to post something here to help you ease out of your depression do it. We've all been there - we are here to help and listen. Best of luck and don't give up! ..
I have **two** DUI/DWI convictions and it never kept me from getting a job. Obviously it is the kind of thing that you keep to yourself and don't go bragging about or volunteering information about...The only time it really affected me was once when I was getting hired for a job working as a sysadmin for a local school district and I had to have a full background check run by the state police. They found the convictions but the only affect that it had on me was that they put a note in my employment record saying that I was not to be allowed to ever transport children (drive a school bus or whatever) as part of my job with the school district. Since I was getting hired as a sysadmin and not a bus driver it wasnt an issue...Honestly it is a DUI charge not murder or rape or child molestation. Your life is not over and you are not totally fucked.
You need to start by talking to somebody.  Reddit is something - but you need to get a human being or two in your life that can help you with this.  Google low-fee or sliding-scale therapy in your area.  Or if you think it's time - try an AA meeting...You'll be fine in the long run - provided that you start working on these problems.  Getting arrested for DUI wasn't my bottom -- but it started the slide that led there.  I was working as a criminal defense lawyer at the time -- appearing in front of the court at 9:00 a.m. in my own case and then back in front of the same judge at 1:00 p.m. for a client's case.  It was incredibly humiliating and I thought it was the end of my career...It's hard to believe now -- but that was 2004 and seems like a lifetime ago.  I have a much better job (and life) today than the day that I got arrested - and its not like I'm alone. I have a couple of colleagues that have been through the same thing...You show people that you're a winner and they honestly won't give a shit about your background.  For now though take care of yourself and get some help.

The only time a company even cared about my DUI was when I applied for a pizza delivery driver position -- they said it would increase their insurance rates or something like that.  Aside from that nobody gives a shit.  For my current job I had to pass a background check and I have God-like access to PHI and am required to follow HIPAA regulations -- nobody said anything about my DUI...Here's the thing -- for most purposes a DUI is considered a traffic offense.  Sure it's a BIG fucking traffic offense but a traffic offense nonetheless.  So at least to potential employers it's essentially the same as having a ton of speeding tickets on your record.  It's only going to matter for certain positions in certain companies.  Even then after the 3 years that insurance companies look at your record it won't matter at all...Also most places allow you to get (or at least apply for) a conditional driving permit for the duration of your license suspension.  Mine was "Essential driving only" which basically meant I was legally allowed to drive to and from work and in emergency situations...Now killing yourself is not the best option.  I know how that feels -- that's how I felt when I sobered up.  And I've felt that way a number of times throughout the years since then.  I had a 7-year relationship end 6 months ago and had a hint of those feelings then.  Every time in my life that I've felt suicidal I've come to a point after where I was grateful that I didn't.  I'm very grateful for my life today; I'm financially secure I'm a good father I have great friends I'm reasonably contented and I'm comfortable in my own skin.  I have a damn good life today and I enjoy it.  Not many people are able to say that in the middle of a divorce; that's what sobriety has given me...I would highly recommend going to a meeting.  You'll meet some good people and may just end up staying sober &amp; having a better life in the process.
&gt; I have been using alcohol to make myself feel better temporarily because it does...ok im going to start there. it does not.. you may think it does but dont forget for one second that alcohol is the reason you have a dui in the first place !!..tough love over.....like you i struggle with depression all the time and loneliness. ive never been able to shake it and still cant now. this is all happening when im 42 not 24 (odd that our ages should be the same read backwards) there is plenty of time to sort things out trust me there is plenty. these feelings you are having are due to you new 'friend' who is not a friend .. alcohol .. its a nasty tricky little twat that tries every trick in the book to make you think its your friend but its not.....get some help AA is good if you are an athiest like me it works too. **DUI is not the end of your life its the start !!!**
After you finish all of your classes pay your fines go through the MADD talks do Sheriffs Work Project and all that good stuff - tell your lawyer that you'd like to have this expunged from your record. ..You can only get your FIRST DUI expunged. If this is a second or third you're SOL. Second DUI most likely will land you in jail for 4 days. ..Also HIRE A LAWYER! You're about to get A LOT of mail. Get ready to spend at least $1000 on one. Anything less and I'd be a bit iffy about them. I went with one that cost me $1500 the first time got dropped to wet reckless. Second time I went with another guy. $700. He told me that my volunteer work in Search and Rescue for the Sheriffs department counted as Sheriffs Work Project. I believed him. One day butt-crack of dawn I get a pounding on my door and I am arrested on the spot for not completing it. I few folks that I know got one as well and I always refer to the first lawyer - and they've always had positive outcomes. ..Source: ../ Not my first rodeo.
A LOT of people have had DUIs. Many of them go on to various professional careers. ..One of the characteristics of depressed thinking is making a catastrophe out of things. Yes the DUI is going to hurt you some. But it is not the final sealing of your fate that you seem to be taking it as. ..Another thing that many depressed people have is thoughts such as "I can't shake the feeling that killing myself is my best option right now". If these thoughts are obsessive or if you are forming plans of action PLEASE PLEASE call a suicide hotline or go to the ER right now. You're in some trouble with alcohol it can be fixed this is not the end of the world. 
I'm definitely going to lose my license right?
24 here too 2 dui's one at 18 and one at 21.  Still got a decent job.
The answer is no. I got one when I was 27 and I was able to get into a good graduate school and great profession afterwards. Yes you made a mistake but don't make it out to anything more than that. Prove it to yourself by becoming a success.
Call the public defender's office before you go in front of the judge.  They will be able to tell you if it's expungeable if you'll lose your license etc.  it's different in each state...You will survive this.  DUI's cross every profession every race every socioeconomic stratus.  It shouldn't hurt your chances in your career as long as you do the right thing with it: use it as a wake-up call and get help...As far as the depression it will get better.  I promise.
I own a company and hire and fire people. From my perspective it completely depends on what you do now. We do a background check on everyone we hire. If something comes up within the last 10 years we know it. That doesn't disqualify you. I will ask you about it though. And I will listen to what you say about what happened and what has changed since then. People make mistakes and we learn from them. Some of us have been lucky enough not to get caught. Or unlucky if that's what's needed to spur change...What would absolutely cause me not to hire you is if you try to conceal your past or lie about it. In that case we're done you're out because I want people who accept responsibility and not try to escape it...I've hired people with much more serious legal history than a DUI because 1) time had passed and they hadn't had further problems; and 2) they'd learned something and changed some aspect of their lives. ..I would seriously advise you not to get another DUI however. That's establishing a pattern that an employer can't overlook despite what others here say. Makes it tougher. Good luck accept responsibility and move forward. 
I have a permanent DUI on my record and later I got a fantastic job at a top IT company. Grandma used to say "this too shall pass" but that's not true if you give up and end it all..I would recommend talking to a professional in the medical field or calling a suicide hotline immediately if/when the feeling comes back over you..Continuing to drink only makes it all worse..I have been to the brink of losing my family job and health all at the same time. With alcohol in my system suicide seemed logical. When I sobered up I realized it was the alcohol talking and I was glad I got away from it. Don't let the alcohol win..Hang in there! Don't give up!
It's gonna be OK. I know it sounds strange coming from a lot of strangers what amounts to a bulletin board and we're just ASCII on your screen but it does get better and it's never as bad as it seems.. .I never got a DWI but I know of a lot of people who did. I hung around a lot of drunkards those who were hardcore and continued to make mistakes and a couple mind you a couple where the DWI was a wake-up call and they changed their lives.. .It's definitely not the end of the world. One guy I know who got a DWI runs a major company now. You never would've thought. Even with the background checks for security clearances it's never an issue for him.. .I subcontract out work to help every once and a while as a hired gun and he's one of the most successful people I know. He didn't have mommy or daddy's help he just bit his lip and took what was coming to him and moved on.. .You made a mistake. You can learn from it and your life is far from over.
