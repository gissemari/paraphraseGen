I posted about how i relapsed and i cannot be more grateful for all of your kind words and encouragement.  I think this bender solidified the fact that I know I'm alcoholic and booze and I will never mix.  Thinking back on it the moment from that first sip to just yesterday was literally unstoppable.  I knew I had to but i just couldn't.  I had to get drunk to the point of falling over... a lot.. for several days.  It's literally scary how different of a person I become the second booze touches my lips.  I guess I found out it's true what they say about alcohol taking over from the very first sip.  Now I just need to figure out how how to explain my absence to all my friends since i was drinking alone and they know I'm sober.  Oh and nursing my withdrawal self back to health luckily i still have some benzos left over from the last time I did this 218 days ago :( I'm going to miss that number.

Imagine throwing away 5475 days of sobriety to spend 7 years out of my mind--I did that.  By some miracle I found my way back you can do this!  You can get your 218 days back one day at a time.
Welcome back...With your friends would you be willing to share the truth with them?
I'm rooting for you to get it all back one day at a time.
