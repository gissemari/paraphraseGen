Hi everyone. I've been a lurker here for a while. First I just want to say how amazingly positive and supportive the comments in this subreddit are. You guys give me warm fuzzies even when I'm not the one being replied to. ..I've been sober since April 29 2015. Nearly 600 days and I feel amazing. I want to share a trick that has worked well for me for those of you that are struggling. ..Here it is: don't have to think of it as forever. ..When I was considering quitting I HATED the idea of never drinking again. After all think of the all the parties and good times that I would miss out on! As I wrestled with the idea I realized that any promise I made to myself to "never drink again" would be met with failure -- the idea was simply too depressing...Here was my breakthrough. Rather than commit to forever I decided simply to commit to one full year sober: 365 days. After that I could return to drinking moderately or full on belligerance. My obligation to myself would fully expire on April 29 2016. ..So I put down the bottle. And it was WAY easier than all of the times I'd tried to quit with forever in mind because I felt in a way that the bottle was still there for me. I just had to wait for it. At the same time I was excited to see what sort of effects a year of sobriety would have on my body my career and my relationships. ..One year later I had lost 30lbs got an amazing girlfriend and changed careers from a "meh" money-maker to something that is incredibly exciting (paramedic). I've also saved about $8000 from not drinking alone. ..I had ZERO desire to pick up that drink I promised myself one year ago...So what did I do? I committed to a second year :) ..Good luck out there everyone. I will not drink with you today.
