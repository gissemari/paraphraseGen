I'm pretty proud of myself. I don't think I've abstained for anything this long...It's far from easy at this point though. I was at a work party tonight and had bad anxiety and couldn't talk to anyone. One of which was a cute girl. Of course I had the little voice telling me that just a couple drinks would make this all better and I would seem cool and fun to everyone and socialize and what not (be the guy I "want" to be). Of course those are lies. If I started drinking pretty soon everyone would be trying to solve the mystery of all the missing alcohol (that I didn't contribute to) or possibly asking why I keep walking to my car every few minutes. ..Afterward I talked with a friend in Connecticut who is in rehab and it was good to talk to him so we could inspire each other a little bit. So that was good. ..Anyway I love all you sober and struggling assholes! Reading your accomplishments on here is really great. Thanks for helping me get to half a year!

Grats that's a huge milestone. I find social situations a lot easier without booze as it turns out. I think having been through the last couple of years in a given social situation I figure: *How bad could it be?* I mean even if I fuck up so what? I've done worse. ..I also think that without booze I may be slightly more empathetic translating into truly more interested in others which leads to better more natural conversations. 
HALF A YEAR WOOT! This is awesome! ..For me at least the social situations *did* get a little easier though it took awhile. A+ to you for recognizing the difficulty and being patient. The cute girls will still be there when you're ready!
You should be very proud! Good job.

You are the same person now as you were under alcohol's influence.  That's how you learn to believe it.
Six months! That's awesome!!.
Woo Hoo!!!
