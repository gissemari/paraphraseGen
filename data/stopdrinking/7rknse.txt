Made it to 500 days. Feels blissfully average and boring. Not high not low just right in the middle right where it needs to be. I spent so many years trying to make the ups farther up or bringing the ups down with self sabotage. Then when I got down I would drink to either feel better or to not feel at all. 500 days sober feels awesome because I am right in the middle where I should be. Thanks for all the help SD peeps. You are all amazing in your struggles your successes and every time you reach out to another in need. Keep it up.
