I noticed today when I took a pic and accidentally flipped the camera around that my skin was glowing.  I felt both my hands and they were like smooth and velvety.  I took a shower and dam man my hair is silky smooth!..Every day new benefits arise everyday is better everyday is still a bit of a struggle but it's much better then being a drunk with dry skin.

YES! My before and after pictures disgusted me! How did I not notice I looked like a bloated dead whale?!
I'm feeling better about my skin now also. It was looking rough the first week or so. And to think I was chalking it up to aging! I look 5 years younger!
Yea to smooth and velvety hydrated skin.  My skin has already plumped out. I won't drink with you today.  I love this: "It's much better then being a drunk with dry skin."  Go Girl!
Dewy skin is the new cocktail. 
My hair has gotten thick and curly since I quit. Glad you're enjoying the benefits!
That beautiful skin will certainly be dewy and glowing today here in soaking wet NY right?! Jesus H...I just got a flat tire at 4:30AM and the streets are flooded here already. Stay safe and dry Patty!! 
/u/PattyIce32 your posts make me smile.  Heard Roar on the radio in a convenience store last week and teared up a little myself.  Here's to better skin and a better life
