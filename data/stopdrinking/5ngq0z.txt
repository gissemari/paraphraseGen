**Theme:** The past..**Quote:**   Half my life is an act of revision.  .  John Irving..**What it means to me:**  A couple of really cool conversations around here recently have been about living with things a person has done that they regret especially things done drinking.  That was a really tough concept for me.  I have a lot I'm certainly not proud of and honestly when I think about it still I wince.  I struggle to get beyond those memories.  But I really like the sentiment of this quote tongue-in-cheek as it is.  That we are meant to make mistakes in order to get better at things.  I like that though I felt I made those mistakes because I was drinking the atonement for them has just made me a better person overall.

Love John Irving.  Thanks for sharing this!  A "perfect" life would be pretty bland though I certainly wouldn't mind scrubbing away a couple of the most blatant horrors of the past.  ..But when looking backward one tends to crash into shit in front so I've been trying to avoid the rearview mirror trap and keep a firm hand on the wheel.
