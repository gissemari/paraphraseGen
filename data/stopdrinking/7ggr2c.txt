Last time I quit drinking alcohol I implemented nonalcoholic beer and wine into my diet. This was a huge mistake as it perpetuated a romantic outlook on liquor type beverages (eg needing red wine with steak dinner etc). Soon after I started drinking again...This time I told myself that I would not drink non alcohol beverages that are meant to mimic alcoholic ones. ..A couple of days ago my husband decided to purchase non alcoholic beer for himself so that he could still drink beer while supporting my decision to be sober. (Really sweet of him  ) ..But last night I decided to grab one of these non alcoholic beers for myself and I'm feeling a lot of guilt because of it... I don't want to slip into old patterns and land up drinking again  ..Now that I see a warning sign of a upcoming relapse how should I plan ahead to combat it?

Are you in a program (AA SMART)?  If you are getting honest about it with a group of your peers could help.  Has for me in the past..Is your husband willing to not drink NA beer in the house?..Make a list of reasons why you quit and play the tape.  Don't beat yourself up about this you're breaking years of habits which is extremely difficult!
I found it useful for me to get active in a self help recovery program (as mentioned by others AA SMART CELEBRATE and many others are options depending on the area).  I was able to get plugged into a support system and have other women (I'm female) to stay accountable to.  When tempted by symptoms of "the relapse before the relapse" sharing the insanity of my cravings and thoughts with another woman in recovery helped immensely.  ..This subreddit is also a big help for me.  I come on here read about the triumphs and struggles of others and it puts my recovery foremost in my decision making.  Anything I put before my sobriety/recovery I'll lose (as it is said). ..Good for you recognizing the signs and coming clean about it.
