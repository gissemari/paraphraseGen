Got pretty blasted last night definitely dissapointed in myself. Had a good 30 days or so under my belt. Anyone have any suggestions for constructive activities whilst hungover?

The guilt and depression go away you just have to accept yourself . 
Probably the most constructive thing I did while hungover was write down how I felt so I could go back and read it later. Other than that unfortunately I couldn't do much when I was hungover. I think it's great that you're back here--what's done is done that's what I keep telling myself when I get bogged down by regrets. We've only got today right? I will not drink with you today.
Constructive activities? Remember how shitty you're feeling right now. ..Get back up and try again! I won't drink with you today. 
You can start again.  I like folks suggestions to write down the feeling of disappointment physical woes and other negative associations with alcohol.  I also liked making a list of beneficial aspects of avoiding alcohol.  ..I will not drink with you today.
Read SD and make your plan for not falling into the same trap?
It's one day. It doesn't erase the good work you've done. Forget about it and start a new streak. I won't drink with you today.
