I have been trying to do this for 5 years now.  In the past I would relapse and then it would take me years to try again. Over the last 4 months I come back almost immediately but then I fuck it all up almost immediately. ..So frustrating and soul sucking. ..But here we go again day one.

Just get through today and you can deal with tomorrow when it comes.

I've never even made a week over the last twenty years. This time I'm determined. I will not drink with you today. You can do this. 
This video might be helpful for you. I have been binge watching these for the last two days and this guy's tips seem to be really spot on about it...https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb0aMo_dU_Y..
I fuck up too.  but I try to look at it that I've had 40 out of the last 50 days sober.  My goal is to have 50 out of 50 starting today.
