I've had two evenings where I was in a situation where I previously always drank... man that was hard I was strongly doubting my decision to quit and was very close to relapsing... I felt very miserable. But boy do I feel good in the mornings. It's the mornings especially that make me realise why I'm doing this. Also regularly lurking here helps me a lot :) Thanks everyone!

right on great job way to lurk!  :D  Not drinking with you today and thanks for posting.
Congrats on 10 days! Mornings after not drinking really are great. It helps me when I really wanted to drink the night before to sit and reflect on how I would be feeling the next morning had I drank. It helps re-enforce in me that not drinking was absolutely the right decision. Keep it up and thanks for being here!
