hey ... i've been struggling with completely random feelings of intense rage the last few days i've been trying to tell myself that it's the last death throes of my addiction but i'm worried that it could just be me being a dry drunk ....i've not been gasping for a drink which is a first but more so just filled with this intense anger and frustration .....unfortunately i live in a place where there is no alcoholics anonymous in my language ... so i'm dealing with this on my own and with the invaluable help of you guys ( seriously SD has kind of saved my sanity a few times ) ....people who are far into your sober journey - this anger around the 22 day mark - is it normal and does it subside ? ..
