I'm still struggling and I do get cravings.  They were a lot worse this past weekend and I know that another weekend starts tomorrow.  I'd LOVE to relax at the house and drink but I know it'd get the best of me.  I'd really be craving and wanting to sneak it wherever I could.   I don't want to go there anymore.  I know I'll be craving again and I hate that.

Cravings happen but they do go away too. Drinking only brings them straight back to the fore. Thought of any plans to make the weekend easier?
Cravings are serious and I really can relate to this. It really is amazing how quickly those cravings can sink in their hooks. Some things that help me get past them are:..* Call someone and just chat. This will take your mind of of it and help bring you back down to reality..* Exercise. Sometimes a good workout makes drinking sound terrible..* Reminders to yourself about how proud you are of your effort. It's not silly to do stuff like that for yourself...I hope some of these help I use them a lot to settle me down when I want a drink. I also found that after 3 months or so thoughts of wanting to drink moved from the foreground of my thoughts to the background. They're still there but they're easier to ignore. Congratulations again on the wonderful decision you've made for yourself you can do it!
