I posted here a month ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8e17wu/finally_hit_rock_bottom_and_possibly_have_ruined/) and everyone's support REALLY helped me through a rough patch. Though I have relapsed a couple times since (and have detoxed myself twice) your posts and stories have helped me remember that I do not want to go back to being that person ever again; THANK YOU ALL!!!..I got a call back from a recruiter on Friday that a company less than ten miles from my house want to offer me a compliance position (temp to hire)so I decided to celebrate... by slamming an entire frozen pizza yesterday afternoon! I had a different interview on Friday which was a 4 month contract position that I didn't really want and I didn't really want. That on top of that I got cellulitis in my foot; I was in a pretty dark place. I guess my advice would be if you ever get there that you never know when something good may be just around the corner. To be honest I actually like myself better this way and I do not want to go through withdrawals again (especially considering that if I do I may die).  ..TLDR: You all rock and IWNDWYT!
