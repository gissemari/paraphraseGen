I relapsed a few weeks ago after going around 6 months sober...I'm diagnosed Bipolar II and entered into a mixed state about four months ago. The mixed state was mild I'll say but eventually turned into a severe depression. I was forced to leave my job after about two months of it starting. I've had a suicide intervention since then and one of my best friends try to get the police to come commit me...I managed to not drink for a while but eventually succumbed and for a while I did drink somewhat responsibly [sic]. Responsible for me is just not blacking out and ruining relationships I have with people. That of course didn't end up working out. I started drinking more heavily again (around half a handle of rum + beers at a bar per night)...I lost the feeling in two of my fingers a few days ago and today lost feeling in one of my big toes. Over the course of the day my toe seems to have recovered and my fingers are slowly getting there. It's pretty terrifying. Right now I'm dealing with withdrawal symptoms mainly shakes and sweats...I guess my point would be that a person may think they can return to drinking safely but at least in my case I couldn't. I have some amazing people in my life that have been tolerant of my drinking problem and have been very sympathetic to my mental illness. I'm recommitting myself to sobriety for my own sake and for the sake of those around me...Thanks for listening this is such a great community.

Sounds like you have been going through very difficult time. I hope you'll feel better soon. And congratulations on recommitting yourself!
Hang in there my friend.  I survived a bipolar diagnosis and got sober.  It can be done.
