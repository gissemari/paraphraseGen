Twelve days down and the past few days I've been either so depressed or incredibly irritated.  I struggle with anxiety and depression anyway and I hope to start seeing a therapist after the holidays but I'm used to self-medicating with drink to make these bad feelings go away for a while.....With the alcohol I felt like a lifeless shell.  Without it I feel kind of similar.  I know I go through cycles...and seeing someone will help.....The first week was that "pink cloud" people talk about I had so much energy and was getting clearer-headed and I was like "Wow this is awesome!"  Now I just feel so...bleh.  This is just normal depression-ridden me anyway but I'm not used to dealing with myself without my "medicine".....Just needed to get out what I'm going through...I won't drink with you all and I hope everyone has a really lovely holiday...stay strong everyone.

It does get better.  Honestly I was really down for the first couple of months.  I had some fun times but the depression and anxiety were pretty high and I was really irritable too.  I had to make myself do stuff.  It has gotten better and I think I'm leveling off a bit.  ..Have hope!  You'll get there.  It sucks in the meantime but it's worth it.  
The first few weeks were pretty tough for me too. It has gotten a lot better.
