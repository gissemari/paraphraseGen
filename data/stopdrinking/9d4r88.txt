Am a few months into my alcohol free life and boy is it an eye opener to see the signs of alcohols devastation on others. I used to be leading the Monday morning work room chat about my weekend drinking you know the sort of comments "I was so wasted I don't remember getting home hahaha" that sort of stuff. Now when I hear this chat it scares me. I also see my colleagues trying to hide their hangovers but it is plain to see they are struggling physically and emotionally. Thanks to this sub I am able to see this in a new light and take delight in my sober life ps I am not looking down at folks who drink I have no right it took me to 51 to get the good sense to remove this poison from my life Iwndwyt.
