4 months sober. Down the drain. I was gaining so much momentum until my biggest trigger happened. I feel so lost right now. What's wrong with me? I didn't think I'd be so weak after 4 months. I'm much stronger than this.

I'm sorry you're struggling. Have you been drinking today?
So you fell down. That's OK. Get back up. You are not weak--you made it 4 months! You just had a weak moment. Let it pass and continue moving forward. 
Dont beat yourself up. Start again today
relapsing sucks but now it's time to make necessary adjustments to your approach to sobriety to prolong your success ..nothing wrong with feeling guilty or disappointed - be sure to reverse the negative feelings as a way to motivate yourself to feeling better 
Hey now that 4 months isn't down the drain!! You had 4 months which is amazing. Try to identify what you learned and apply it to a modified methodology and approach. I've relapsed many many times unfortunately but each time I did I do my best to make it a learning experience and not just another time I'm hanging my head in shame. To get 4 months something was working; just not everything. ..Maybe work on utilizing your phone list if you have one. Know what to do when you feel triggered. It can be hard to implement these plans but habits change slowly and with effort. Especially don't let yourself get too wrapped up in beating yourself up. I've said this before and I'll say it again - you call it a relapse for a reason. You want change and you'll get there! This is when one day at a time becomes key. All we have is today no matter who you are or how many days months or years sober you are. Don't drink today. When tomorrow comes you can focus on it; but for now today is what counts  
Don't beat yourself up failure is only feedback . See where you went wrong and correct it. I had several years and relapsed
