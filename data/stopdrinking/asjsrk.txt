https://i.imgur.com/kaU1n1j.jpg..Made me realize what it's all worth that the buzz you get when you crack open that 4th beer is not going to be worth the 4 more pounds you'll gain by next week...Coming from a relatively young guy sobriety is something I'll have to struggle with much longer than most of you. I'm not 50 years old coming to terms with how much my body can handle. I'm 20 years old and already had enough...The past 2 years were nothing but beer and vodka until something clicked. I ballooned up to 185 and hadn't run a mile since I graduated high school...Getting away from the atmosphere of parties and clubs was probably the most important factor for me. ..I'm at 145 pounds my lowest weight since I lifted and ran track in junior year. Will probably be heading back into the gym sometime soon to help correct my relationship with hard work and self discipline. ..For now though I'm going to enjoy having 100 days. We are all capable and this is where we take the first step. IWNDWYT.

Awesome work. That takes dedication and at times embracing the suck. Way to work through. Really pleased for you. 
Great Job!  If only I'd had my hundred days 26 years ago!  IWNDWYT 
Congratulations on 100 and all the fitness accomplishments!
Congrats. I wish I got the message at 20; I was alcoholic by then. Took me to 69 to quit. I found in my 20s &amp; 30s it was the only way I could meet/pick up girls so I went with it. .Best wishes to you. It is a struggle..
Looking great op :)
