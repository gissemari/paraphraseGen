Relapses suck. I relapsed from a 55-day sobriety streak about 15 days ago. Since then I have relapsed quite a few more times. I forgot how hard it is the first couple of days. Yesterday I caught myself during what I call the "bargaining stage." It's the part of your decision to relapse where you tell yourself "just to put on your shoes...you don't have to go to the liquor store." or "just go to the store...you don't have to buy anything" and then all of the sudden you are in the liquor store and the same voice goes "well you better buy something...don't want to look like you are stealing" and before you know it you are on your way home with a bottle of whiskey. ...Luckily I caught myself doing this yesterday during the "just put on your shoes" phase. I redirected my thoughts and said "just get on your computer" then "just read a few Reddit posts" then "just go to /r/stopdrinking and read a few posts."...I read one post in particular from /u/jaygardens about going to a bar with coworkers and experiencing the bar scene sober and how good it felt on the way home. I started to tear up...I am tearing up now. It brought me back to day 55. It brought me back to my friends and family telling me that they were proud of me. It brought me back to being proud of myself. Over those 55 days I had started to become a new person. I was getting work done. I had gained 10 lbs of muscle. I had confidence. Then I drank and now I am eerily close to where I started. I stopped going to the gym. I am battling with crippling anxiety again. I am sleeping like garbage. All because I chose to buy a little 200 ml bottle of whiskey. "I'm just going to have one drink." Now look where I am....I have been to AA once about 6 months ago before I got really serious about my sobriety. I hated it. The meeting I went to was a "beginners meeting" that didn't focus on beginners. I was told NOT to share and that really rubbed me the wrong way because every part of my being was ready to share and break down asking for help. Only one guy talked to me but it was just to give me some pamphlets of information....I recently watched "My Name is Bill W." (link under  videos' in the sidebar) and it really resonated with me. I finally realized how AA might work for me. This whole time I have been relying on either my own willpower or support from people who aren't alcoholics. I have finally realized that they don't understand. To them I am only whining. To them I am just craved for attention. To them I don't have a drinking problem but a willpower problem. I need to be around people who understand; People who have gone through what I have or worse. I've been reading other posts about "finding the right meeting" and have decided to give it another shot. I have picked out two meeting during the next week that I will attend. One is for "Young people in recovery" and the other is Friday night at midnight (figured it might draw a younger crowed). ...Yesterday was tough but making it though yesterday has made me stronger. I will not drink today....TL;DR: Relapses suck and some rambling that might help you. ..

Welcome back &amp; thank you for sharing; it's hard to do in the first place doubly hard when you have relapsed and are trying to stick it out once again (from my own experience at least). But you have done it before and you will do it again. Here's to today and I am with you today although I am gasping for a pint (or 3) I absolutely will not drink.
