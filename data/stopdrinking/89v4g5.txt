Hey fellow non-drinkers. I'm grateful you all are here sharing your stories. I read way more than I post lately. It helps me get through each day to share in your thoughts struggles wins and everything in between...Mods if this is an unacceptable post please just remove it. I know it's not really centered around the desire to not drink. I just figured there are probably a lot of people here who could relate...I have only just today accepted that I cannot in fact move out of a halfway house and into an apartment. I had been seriously toying with that idea for a number of obvious reasons but after talking it over with some friends in sobriety as well as my sponsor I see now that it's a bad idea. I'm not even a month in! It's crazy of me to think I'm ready to do this on my own. I moved into a halfway house for a reason. I've accepted that I'm going to stay in one for at least a few more months. The big question now is which one...My struggle lately is centered on whether I should stay in the house I'm currently at (we'll call it Jane's) or if I should move into this other one that I've had my eye on (we'll call that one Cindy's)...So Jane's where I'm at now it's okay. I've been there a month and I haven't really connected with any of the girls there yet. I feel like the only time anyone wants anything to do with me it's just because they want to use me for a ride. And that sucks. But I guess I haven't really made much of an effort to get to know anyone either. And my work schedule makes it hard to make friends; I work 3-midnight. The other thing I don't like about Jane's is it's kind of dirty. You can't open the microwave or turn on the kitchen sink without bugs crawling out. ..Things I do like about this place though is it's really laid back. It's a lot more lenient than Cindy's would be. I don't **have** to go to a meeting every day. It's not the end of the world if I forget a chore. I can already get an overnight pass. I won't get my phone taken away if I mess up. Plus Jane has some storage space that she would let me utilize which would be helpful for my situation...Cindy's on the other hand is more strict. You **do** have to go to a meeting every day. If you don't do your chores you get more chores. You may get your phone taken away. There's a lot more structure and accountability. You have to sign a 6 month contract you can't just leave on a week to week basis. Sometimes I view these things as negatives but in a way I think they may be positives too. ..I'm already friends with most of the girls that live there. Because you have to go to meetings they go to the same meetings that I've been going to. So I already have that social network. Plus it's a cleaner house from what I hear. Probably because they're strict about doing chores. And it's $100 a month cheaper. ..I dunno guys.. I'm torn but not *that* torn. What would you do? Thank you for your time.

I don't like bugs. Never did.  Cindy's is my choice.  
A dirty house would remind me of what was happening with my house during my downward spiral. I would go with Cindy's. Congratulations on 26 days!
Cindy's for sure 
Cindy's has my vote; cheaper no bugs friends and structure. All wins! It sounds like you think so too ...
Cindy's!! 
No bugs seals the deal for me!  Lol.  If you plan on behaving and getting the most out of this experience why not take cheaper rent!    I'm happy for you it sounds like a good opportunity.  IWNDWYT 
I'd pick Cindy's. 
The structure might be really helpful at the new place.  The mandatory meetings might sometimes be a drag but I've never met a person who regretted going to too many meetings!
The cleaner stricter house. Also have you looked into oxford houses? They can be a great next step if you have them in your area..
I'd move.  Save the hundred bucks and get away from the roaches.  That's all that would matter to me.  IWNDWYT
No bugs.  I am sure you will do your chores and not mind going to meetings.
