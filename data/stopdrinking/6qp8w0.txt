It is unlikely that this got you buzzed. The fumes may have reminded you of drinking and perhaps made you a bit light headed but isopropyl alcohol is not the same type that is in booze we drink. If you were to drink this even in small amounts blindness and death are likely consequences.
Isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol are two different things. Isopropyl alcohol can kill you and does not get you drunk it just literally kills you. It's an industrial solvent/disinfectant. Ethyl alcohol is also a solvent and disinfectant but is drinkable. You most likely felt a light placebo effect and maybe got some skin irritation. I certainly wouldn't consider accidentally sitting on a chair wet with rubbing alcohol as a relapse by any means. 
Oh good grief. That's not a relapse.
