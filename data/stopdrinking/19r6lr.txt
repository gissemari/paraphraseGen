This is my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/16uwl6/i_have_ruined_my_life_i_am_lonely_miserable_and/). I wanted to say hello and let you guys know what has been going on since I originally posted. I regret not being more active in this subreddit since then but I have been very busy trying to put my life back together and trying to be okay with who I am and the situation I find myself in...As some of you may recall from my original post I am currently on probation for a second DUI which I received in 2010. Then in October of 2012 I ended up receiving another DUI charge for sitting in my car after I had been drinking. I was not driving as I previously mentioned but my keys were in the ignition so I could listen to the radio while I smoked a cigarette. In hindsight I regret this decision immensely but all I can do now is move forward...Since I last posted I have made some changes in my life. I am already enrolled in a Level II therapy class from my 2010 DUI but after I got arrested in October 2012 I proactively enrolled myself in a relapse prevention class as well. I have since discovered that the underlying reason for my drinking is severe depression that has gone unchecked and untreated for far too long. With the help of my probation officer I have also become a client at a local center that helps people with low income receive mental health care. Thanks to my probation officer I now have a therapist I meet with weekly am back on anti-depressants and am also enrolled in a dual-diagnosis class all at no cost to me. I have been on this alcohol monitoring unit for 132 days and am very proud of myself for going 132 days without drinking...**<side note>** I had court a couple weeks ago in the county I am already on probation in for my probation revocation. This was not sentencing but a day to schedule sentencing and I got to meet my public defender for the first time. To put it nicely he was the biggest fucking asshole I have ever met in my life. From the moment he opened his mouth he did nothing but yell at me tell me how worthless my life is and tell me what the other county is going to do to me. He never gave me a chance to tell him any of the good things I have been doing to make this right but instead spent the whole time threatening me with five years in fucking prison. When I tried to tell him about the ways I have been helping myself he interrupted me and said "You can polish a turd but at the end of the day it is still a turd" basically implying that I can try to make my life better but at the end of the day it is still a literal piece of shit. He then proceeded to tell me "I do not see myself as a lawyer. I am the garbage man that cleans up the shit that is people's lives" again equating me my life (and the lives of all his other clients) to nothing more than a piece of literal shit. All of this from the guy who is supposed to DEFEND me. I was absolutely devastated when I left court that day. I do not remember the last time anybody hurt my feelings that badly but he absolutely crushed me. I cried for like four hours after that...This was about two weeks ago. I have been working on getting a new public defender since then but that whole office has been giving me the runaround of a lifetime. So that is still a process but hopefully when I show up for court in April I will have somebody who not only does not see me as some sort of monster but who will actually listen to me and not be a total assface. All I am going to court for in that county is to have my probation revoked and then reinstated. I should not be in any more trouble than that but the last thing I need is some jackwipe fucking me over for no other reason than because he thinks I am a piece of shit. What a dicknose. **</side note>**..All of this has been leading up to tomorrow. I go to sentencing for what happened in October in about 12 hours. My public defender in this county is very nice and actually listens when I have something to tell her so I feel okay about her helping me. She told me that I will probably be sentenced to anywhere between 30 days and 6 months in jail. A big window so I have been preparing to get 6 months just so there are no surprises. My parents my brother a good friend my alcohol class teacher and myself all wrote letters to the judge in an effort to let her know what kind of person I really am and that not only have I identified why my drinking is still a problem but that I have been working very hard to get the help I need and resolve my issues. Between the three classes I am now in the therapy sessions medication AA and having the TAD on for 132 days with no issue and no drinking I am really hoping that the judge will see (and care) how hard I have been working and not sentence me to jail. Honestly I am hoping that she will let me keep the TAD unit on in lieu of jail. This thing is expensive as hell for me ($70.00 per week) but I would rather have to deal with this and be out in the world able to go to therapy and my classes and keep working on improving my situation and resolving my issues than have to sit in jail for God knows how long and do nothing but sleep and read shitty romance novels. I doubt the miracle I am hoping for will happen but I am still hoping for it...When I go to sentencing in 12 hours I have been told that they will take you to jail right there if you get sentenced to it. So I am basically spending these last 12 hours as if they are the last hours of freedom I will have for a while. To be honest I do not feel like I deserve need or belong in jail. I know what I did was wrong and I understand the seriousness of my situation but what I have been doing these past months has already helped me emotionally a lot more than jail ever will. But I also know that this is not about what I want. Whatever happens I know I will be able to go into jail with a positive attitude. That is all I can do. Stay positive do my time and hopefully learn something. That is my silver lining. If I come out of this experience having learned even one new helpful thing than it was not a total waste. I may not feel like I belong there but I did something wrong and I will take responsibility for my actions...The fact of the matter remains though. I am going to jail in 12 hours. For how long I do not know. But I will most likely be in jail this time tomorrow night. I do not know if any of you have ever been through anything like this and ended having to do jail time but I could really use some sort of good thoughts to help me get through this. Anything you can tell me that you find helps you through difficult situations would be greatly appreciated. I have accepted this is my reality for the time being and I am becoming more okay with that but that does not mean that I am not still terrified inside. I could use any wisdom you guys have to share especially if it is something I can think of when I am having a hard time in jail. ..If a miracle happens and I do not have to go to jail I will let you guys know (and probably tell you all how much I love you like 17000 times). Otherwise I will let you know when I have my freedom back. It may be a few or many months but I will be back. Thank you to anybody who actually read this whole thing (I talk way too much in this subreddit). It means the absolute world to me if even one person cares and I love you for it. And thank every one of you for being here and making this subreddit what it is. I am beyond grateful to have found this place and I love every one of you. I will be around for a while tonight but after that I suppose I will see you when I am basking in the glow of freedom again ;)...***TL;DR: I am going to jail in the morning. I could use some wisdom and comfort! Also I love you!***......

You are in my thoughts and prayers. You're showing immense courage.
I have been doing weekends in jail. I got sentenced with 30 days for my second DUI and am now paying for it. Keep to yourself as much as you can and get through it. I can't imagine going through something like that with the public defender; I got legal aid and both my lawyer and even the judge were nothing but kind to me and took into consideration the treatment program I went through the years of counseling that I've been doing and years of AA...But you WILL get through this. Just keep doing the next right thing and things will get better. This is a spot of shitty luck but imagine how much worse it could be if you were drinking? People like you and me can't expect everything to get better right away but just have to have faith that we're making the right decisions now. Stay strong and post when you can. Most jails have in-house AA meetings so stay involved :)
No matter what happens. It will be ok.  :)  you have chosen to embrace love and not fear that is why and how it will be ok no matter what happens. 
My thoughts are with you tomorrow and I hope you get the best outcome for you. No matter what happens I think you're doing the right things and hope things turn around for you soon. 
yo yo bag o butts I love you!!
You are clearly a very smart and articulate lady. I believe you have the courage and self-belief to handle jail time if it unfortunately occurs. You demonstrate a very positive and thoughtful attitude. You are making many positive changes in your life and I believe life will only get better for you (even if you go to jail for a while)...I can't believe what a complete bastard that lawyer was to you!!! Please try not to take it personally as he clearly has no humanity and relishes his speech about being the garbage man and inflicts his speech on all people misfortunate enough to have to listen to him because they need his help.
It sounds like you are someone who does have a problem with alcohol but also had some shitty luck to boot. I mean the way your last DUI went down was just wrong. You didn't deserve that. ..But then again we all have crappy luck sometimes. Part of sobriety is learning to deal with it without the crutch. ..You can survive this. Hell just move to an area where you can bike places. I know lots of people who rely primarily ok a bike as their means of getting around. It's not a "loser" lifestyle it's actually pretty cool. You may have to make some adjustments to your lifestyle but you'll get through this. Also spending some time in jail for DUI is not that uncommon. I come from a relatively normal family and at least 2 of my cousins have seen the inside of a cell as the result of a DUI.
Thanks for sharing your story. Good luck in the morning and whatever happens I admire your strength and character.
FYI - Prior to imposing sentence you will have an opportunity to address the judge directly. Sometimes this is more effective than anything a PD will say. ..You sound like you have made incredible progress and you say it with a sense of humility and contrition. Explain what you've done with your life. Explain the last "care and control" offence (i.e. you accept responsibility know it was wrong but you did not intend to drive but understand why it is not permitted). Explain how alcohol has affected your life and explain in what ways your life has gotten better since you stopped. Tell her about your work like your plans for the future and how cognizant you are of your previous mistakes. Spend some time thinking about what you're going to say and again remain humble and contrite. It's harder for a judge to sentence a stranger and the more she knows about you the less of a stranger you become. ..Edit: I don't know about your state but you may be looking at a mandatory minimum sentence. If that's the case her hands may be tied but with your story she may be inclined to give you the minimum. Note: Do not ask her for the minimum or any particular sentence - leave that to your PD. When the defendant asks  for a particular sentence it makes them appear too savvy. Just put your story before her and hope for the best! ..Good luck!
I hate how people with addictions are treated like criminals in the USA. You have legitimate problems with depression and perhaps other mental illnesses that should be treated in a hospital environment and not in a jail. I seriously hope for the best for you. Try to keep sane. Meditate any way you can. If you have access to books on it read them. If not read books that have deep meanings in them like Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. I am not preaching any religion just trying to keep you focused...I suffer from depression and a lot of other illnesses. My friends call me Mr. ABC because I have so many diagnosis labels in my charts. I stopped some 30 odd days ago after a lifetime of drinking. Have only 1 DUI but then again I moved to a country where I have not driven a car in 12 years...Keep strong and know that even though you are going to jail this does not make you a bad person or tarnish your reputation. If I ever had the chance to meet you I would look you in the eye with the same respect I would give any person regardless of their situation. ..Like stated below in the comments. If you still cannot stop drinking move closer to where you drink or find places to walk to but to bike to or cab to. AA is a way to go Allen Carr is a way to go faith is a way to go and of course you have us at Reddit...Be strong and we are always here for you..
Let us know the address of the jail and maybe you can receive some cards and letters.

Reading this inspires me - You're so freaking strong!  .You're a life warrior!..I hope things go awesome but regardless you got this.
God bless
A close friend just went through a similar situation.  He lost his DL for a year and had to spend 48 hours in jail then three weeks on house arrest.  He actually says all of this is the best possible thing that could have happened to him because if it hadn't he'd still come back to the **I can control this** thing.  I've seen some other folks mention a bike and I agree.  He's been biking everywhere so now he feels like a million bucks and looks really great on top of doing what he needs to be doing.  Everything happens for a reason (imho) and this too will pass.  None of this is permanent.
That lawyer sounds like an asshat.  He has no business representing people if he feels that way...DC had a good idea.  I am sure a bunch of us would write to you if you had an address for the jail.  PM me if you want someone to write TO-- I'll give you my address.
&gt;Then in October of 2012 I ended up receiving another DUI charge for sitting in my car after I had been drinking. I was not driving as I previously mentioned but my keys were in the ignition so I could listen to the radio while I smoked a cigarette. In hindsight I regret this decision immensely but all I can do now is move forward....I had a similar experience.  I was really low one day.  I bought some vodka and something to mix it with pulled over at a parking lot put some head phones on and listened to a book on tape while I drank.  I wasn't going to drive anywhere I had every intention of falling asleep for a few or more hours in my car.  But . . . . because it was so bloody hot I left my car running to leave the air conditioning on. The cops showed up.  They believed me that I wasn't planning on driving but they said since my car was on they had no choice.  Thankfully they didn't charge me if I was able to call someone to come pick me up which I did.  One of the worst moments of my life.   
I just wanted to say I'm proud of you even though I don't know you and I am wishing for the best for you. You sound like a very strong and smart lady. You can make it through this. You have done so much work on yourself and for yourself. Internet hugs! Best of luck and lots of love.
My thoughts are with you.
