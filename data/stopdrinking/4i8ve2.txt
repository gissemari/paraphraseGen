Today I'm 7 months sober. Counting days became counting weeks and now I count months. I love counting stuff. At the moment sobriety is easy for me. I despise alcohol with vigor. I wasted 15 good years with it. I rarely get cravings and see them as the helpless spasms of my brain doing what it used to do for so many years. They go away within minutes and they make me smile when they happen. The fact that sobriety is so easy for me doesn't make me complacent like it did the last time (followed by a daily binge-drinking relapse of one year). I check in here everyday and read stories that are all too familiar with me. I make myself remember why I should be very grateful and why I never should drink again. The posts here help me to stay alert and vigilant..Thank you fellow (former) drunks! Keep posting here not only to help yourself but also to help others...Btw don't hesitate to ask me for help I'll be happy to help or support where I can.

Same cravings are gone and alcohol for me is nothing else than a large amount of liquid calories that make me feel bloated and crappy. Sure I get the feeling of wanting to open the old cold one every now and then - especially now when summer is coming - but I convince myself that this is the alkie brain talking and I can't drink like normal people. Takes almost no effort at all to subdue these cravings nowadays and I feel good afterwards...I love seeing posts like this that strongly resonate with me. I recognized myself in every sentence. Thanks!
