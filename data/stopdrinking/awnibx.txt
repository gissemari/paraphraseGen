All I feel like I need right now is a fifth. The last week and a half I can push these thoughts out but tonight... well I'm not so sure.

The first days are the hardest. If you can make it through today you'll wake up tomorrow feeling proud of yourself; if you don't you'll wake up in regret have to start again and the cycle repeats...You can and will make it through tonight without a drink.
Feelings aren't facts don't listen to the Booze Goblin!..Are you HALT - Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?..All of these conditions can make cravings worse and are often the first thing to address......Can you use any tools like [DEADS](https://www.smartrecovery.org/5-ways-to-deal-with-urges-and-cravings/) - Delay/Escape/Accept/Dispute?..Every craving will always pass every single time if you can just wait it out without acting on it... Hang in there!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;..
Keep busy. A walk reading exercise  recovery blogs apps books etc..Keep your mind occupied. .Hang in there.  You can do this!!  IWNDWYT 
Thank you all. IWNDWYT 
Don't listen to the booze goblin as the first comment says.
