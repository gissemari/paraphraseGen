It's been a little over a month since I decided to regain control over myself when it comes to drinking. Note that I haven't said I've gotten sober. I wanna be very clear and honest about that here. ..I used to drink myself to pieces every single night for about 2 years but I decided I had to change my ways. I went sober for the first week and a half and right now I drink about twice a week (most of the time socially). I know it's not ideal and that I'm taking risks here but I'm just happy I've regained some control...The honeymoon phase is definitely over though and I feel myself struggling to maintain control more than I used to at first. My depression is acting up again too something else I thought I had a firm grip on. ..I started typing this as a way to let the cravings pass but I starting to think I'm not really craving anything. I just need to feel something even if it's a drunken sadness.

I used to drink myself to pieces.  Exactly.   Now I have peace.  IWNDWYT you can join me if you like I've got all day.
