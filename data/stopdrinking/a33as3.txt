Hi all Moving from lurking status to official - this sub is so fantastic...Any suggestions on how to find a PCP who has experience with treating alcoholics? I've been calling local practices but the front desk folks can't tell me much about subspecialties of any of their providers. I recently opened up to my primary care doc psychiatrist and another counselor about struggles with alcohol and my PCP was not only judgmental (fine whatever) but also gave incorrect advice on medications and prescribed me librium even though I asked not to be given any addictive substances and wasn't displaying any acute signs of withdrawal. I'd like to find someone who knows what they're doing and won't prescribe controlled substances to an addict unless under medical supervision...My psych and counselor advised me to find a new PCP but didn't have any recs. ..Thank you!

Hmm maybe try calling some local inpatient/outpatient rehabs and see if they can point you in the right direction. Not sure if that would work but each center probably has a doctor or two who they deal with.
