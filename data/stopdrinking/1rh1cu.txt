Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love to cook the whole meal while drinking copious amounts of wine.  I have been struggling for years and have countless badge resets.  I wanted more than anything to go buy some port and wine and just let another holiday week go by making continued excuses to drink.  I ate instead and decided to post here to make it real and take away an excuse to falter yet one more time.  Ty all for being here...Edit:  thx for all the support.  I can't sleep at all but I have made it through the toughest part of tonight so far!

Apparently you wanted to stay sober more than anything. Congratulations! Stay strong. You'll make it through this and be happier for it.
Good job! You'll enjoy making new traditions and bonus without the booze you'll be able to remember all of it!..Stay strong and stay on this sub when you need it. And when in doubt fast forward the tape. That's usually enough to lock it in my brain that I don't need to drink. 
Ever since I realized I had a problem with alcohol I've never drank and been happy about it later. Hang in there and just know that alcohol will only make it worse!
