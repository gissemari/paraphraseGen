So today marks the end of week three for me. Sunday three weeks ago I decided I needed to stop drinking. And I made it through one day before I was back to the bottle. Week two I made it through two days before I broke again. This week started out with two days last Sunday and Monday where I was sober. Then Tuesday and Wednesday I went through a bottle of rum. And finally  after Thursday Friday and Saturday I've made it through 3 days sober. I can't believe I've pulled it off...It's the first week in a long time where I've spent more of the week sober than not (5 days in total sober 2 days not). The sober days weren't consecutive but it's still a major victory for me...I'm feeling excited for the first time in my journey to sobriety. For the first time I'm really feeling like I can do this! Does anyone have any advice for the coming days/weeks? It's been about 2 and a half years since I've been sober for a week straight can anyone offer guidance on the challenges I might face past the initial days? I'm feeling unstoppable this morning but I know that is likely to change come evening (which is when I usually drink). ..Thank you all for being with me these last 3 weeks and for listening to my struggles.

Welcome to sobriety! ..The first week(s): cravings are as bad as they tend to be but the good news is they recede; sleep can be erratic but that recedes; sometimes there's an overwhelming good feeling (the "pink cloud") but that too can recede--but one often finds a milder more permanent version of it to come...One of my sobriety catchphrases is: winners make plans. Have something in mind for this evening during the time you'd ordinarily drink. Go for a walk cook a fancier dinner post here read sobriety lit anything really!..Just don't drink today do it with us. You've got a lot of internet strangers (like me!) in your corner with you this evening/today...IWNDWYT
I got sober myself one day at a time.  I got through 24 hours then another then another.  I just pushed through no matter what the cravings told me to do.  Hung out on SD constantly reading.  Had multiple distractions available along with chocolate and tons of water and ichiban.  (For the salt.  Helps retain water because I was dehydrated AF).  It got easier after a couple weeks.  Then the day came I realized I was OUT of the cycle.  Done.  That was awesome.  But yeah to start it was one day at a time helped make it easier to cope with only getting through one day.  All my best to you!  IWNDWYT
