Just Checking in for 2 months! I'm so grateful for my two months of sobriety and here is to another 24h for myself and to all of you! I once thought I could never get here as I was constantly relapsing after one week two weeks....This group is amazing and very helpful though I don't post often. Also I would not be here if it wasn't for joining my local AA meetings. I could not be more happy with the direction my life is taking. Thank you all for my sobriety today. .
