311 days. It's a bit wild to me seeing that number in my badge. I still struggle and I still have my temptations but it doesn't feel like such an insurmountable challenge now. It's just become who I am. I don't drink. It's not really a big announcement to folks any more. I don't have to explain to anyone why I quit. They know enough to know I'm sticking with this. It's a nice feeling..IWNDWYT

Good to know that acceptance by others will eventually come my way.
