Well...here I am again. I am not doing well at all. I haven't slept now in over 24 hours except for cat naps totalling about two to three hours or so. I feel shredded...I feel sick...I am shaking (but not as bad as I thought I would be)...I want to scream and cry...I am not happy...The ONLY good thing about today is that today is our 4th child's (Desiree the second youngest) 8th birthday. We didn't do anything for it (because I am broke after all those uniforms we had to put on layaway for the kids) but we DID have a nice supper together and as soon as hubby gets back from an appointment with our 11 year old we will have cake and sing Happy Birthday. We got her a cake made up like Monster High and it is really cute. I could post a pic if anyone wants to see it....I can't seem to find happy though. I am still struggling with a DEEP depression despite taking my meds. I just started taking them again so I KNOW they will take a while to start working. I have been playing a LOT of Facebook games and I have been hanging out (and tickling mercilessly) our kids but I am just not happy...:( This is not how it was supposed to be...is it?..I hate to be the downer of the group but for me.....Sobriety sucks eggs...at least for now :'(..I need to try to sleep but I can't seem to stay asleep. I nod off but only for a few minutes before I snap back awake. ..OK. I have rambled enough. I am sure you are all sick of my whining...TY for reading. 7 days down...yay...~LG

It's gonna take time for everything to start feeling better. Give it plenty of time. If you feel even the slightest bit better today than you did yesterday then use that to give you hope. I detoxed off of alcohol and opiates a few years ago and I didn't feel good enough to even go out for months. After the physical symptoms went away the mental ones started. The depression and anxiety was so bad I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. But... all of a sudden after what seemed like forever  I started to feel better. I felt good enough to go for a walk and pretty soon I was starting to socialize again and not just hiding out in my room. Just remember you didn't get in this shape in a few days. It will be slow but definitely worth it. Good luck.
Seven days isn't a very long time. Hang in there and see what happens things will get better. My sleep is off too. I'm reading a good book which helps.
