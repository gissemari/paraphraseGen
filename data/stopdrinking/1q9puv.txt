I'm on 3 days..feel pretty good. I am fatigued and have body aches and a groggy head feeling but I really feel this is it. I have had many day ones. My longest sobriety being 14 days in the past ten years or so. I'm tired of feeling shitty and I can't wait to have my old brian back..I know it might take awhile..My last bender I fell badly..don't remember at all but I have a giant bruise on my bicep and thigh..I just am so lucky I didn't do any serious damage..that thought alone scares the hell out of me..what if I fall down my 3 storie stairs?? Whenever I go back to drinking I go on at least a three day bender and ALWAYS black out..It's been going on way too long. I totally feel like my personality has changed..I'm just waiting for the old me to come back..with sobriety. Can anyone relate? ALso my boyfriend has stopped with me this time too which makes it easier. I know not to be dpendent on him for my sobriety and I won't relapse just because he does..but it just helps is all.

I once gave myself a black eye while drinking. I almost wish I could say it was from a fight bc at least that would be a good story.  But I actually was so drunk I had lost all depth perception.  I had used the bathroom and was flushing the toilet when I noticed a piece of lint or trash on the ground near my toilet.  I bent down to pico it up bit was so drunk I missed by a wide margin and whacked my eye socket in the toilet tank.  Because I'm an idiot.  My husband cracked a rib during drunken late night fourwheeling.  We are lucky we didn't hurt ourselves worse than we did.  Yikes.  So grateful for sobriety.  Hang in there friend; it gets easier.
While you're waiting for the bruises to heal think about hooking up with a support group such as AA or SMART Recovery. You are in a high risk situation with an alcoholic boyfriend. I say that because it is extremely rare that two people actually get sober and into recovery at the same time. While it may seem helpful that your boyfriend has stopped drinking too it is not recommended that you rely on one another as sole support. You need input from others to get a realistic perspective. ..In AA you get advice and support from experts as well as sober living tools role models guidance friends fun and hope. It saved my life!
