Hey everyone I checked in a while back went a few days broke down and drank went a few more days and it would happen again and I found this relapse had been disappointing me more and more but looking back now even though last Friday and Saturday I had a few drinks with friends and It wasn't an out of control black out experience my cravings to drink are gone I can be at work all day and not think about grabbing a case on the way home I can sit at home with beer in my fridge and not have the uncontrollable urge to get up and drink it. While my choice to have a few beers on occasion May not receive the popular vote you all here have helped me to over come alcohol controlling me and making it so I control it. So r/stopdrinking thank you for all your helpful advice and encouragement.
