Title says it all. Just over five weeks sober and I cannot get rid of these symptoms. Primarily cramps and aches in the back of my calves and thighs and weird tingling sensations in the feet that can go from cold to hot at times. Been to multiple Doctors and no official diagnosis so I'm not looking for medical advice just curious if others experienced similar symptoms weeks into sobriety. I've been taking vitamins eating well and exercising which I had hoped would help. ..Other than this I feel pretty good considering I was drinking every day for about 12 years. Anyone else struggle with this while back on the wagon?

I'm not a doctor: have you had a full blood workup to see if you are deficient in anything? Lack of magnesium can often cause muscle cramps and I was pretty low on it... Also B-vitamins and E are really important.....I had all sorts of weird aches and pains in early recovery as I no longer had alcohol on board to mask everything... They all went away though eventually.....The tingling in the feet is a bit weird... Could it be a touch of Alcoholic Neuropathy maybe a bit of liver damage? Have a read-up on the symptoms.....Were you completely honest with the docs about your drinking history?..Hope you can get to the bottom of it and feel better soon - keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Were you honest with your doctor about how much you were drinking?
