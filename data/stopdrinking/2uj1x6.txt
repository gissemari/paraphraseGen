Could use this sub's advice and support right now. I've developed this pattern of drinking alone and way too much. I drink alone lately because for the past 2ish years my anxiety/depression has developed into full blown agoraphobia. I used to go out a normal amount with my friends with drinking activities and nothing "bad" happened. I didn't see drinking as a problem then. I now rarely rarely socialize at all. ..Its not a daily thing the drinking. Hard to put a number on it but I just know when I do drink now alone at home it turns into a binge. I don't know why. I assume its because of my lifelong anxiety/depression that 2 beers feels better than everyday life...more must feel even better! And even more makes you forget and be numb to all the pain!..I do dumb things. Buy crap online I don't need. Starting to make "quick trips" in my car (stupid!!!). Send cringe worthy texts I see the next day probably due to my loneliness. I've now started to be late to work due to just simply not hearing my alarm. I cannot miss work again. I have a great job and if I jeopardize it because of something so stupid like this...I couldn't live with myself...This HAS to stop. I have nothing to gain everything to lose. I have a great job great car great apartment. I have my freedom my life doesn't have many "struggles" so to speak. I risk it all every time I drink...Now I sit here the day after. The day after is awful. I'm pretty useless because I don't sleep well. My anxiety/depression is worse. I just ruminate over and over all the dumb things I did the night before and just feel terrible/guilty/worthless. ..How do I start to help myself?

The day after IS awful but this can be your **last** day after if you chose. In answer to your question: you've already started just by reaching out and admitting you have a problem.  That's the first step towards sobriety and you've already taken it. ..The next steps? I can tell you what I did and you can read around here what others did but what most of us have in common is the need for support whether that support be here or an AA meeting or a SMART Recovery meeting (for starters). We are here for each other when one of us is having a rough time of it as well as to be here to celebrate an achievement. It's a symbiotic relationship that really works. ..That anxiety/depression you speak of? Mine pretty much vanished for the most part when I quit drinking. I have certain situations that my anxiety is piqued but I don't stress out over. Instead I just note it try to ease it with breathing and go on with life. It is what it is. Accepting myself is easier than fighting with myself or running away from myself...Do you think you're ready to quit now? If so we would be happy to help you along the way my friend. :-)
