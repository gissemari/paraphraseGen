About a year and a half ago I quit my job to start my own business selling the jewelry I make online.  It has been a struggle for my husband and I to stay afloat financially on one income but we've been surviving.  Until a month ago when the apartment complex we live in told us we had 60 days to move out so that they can renovate our apartment.  Apparently it's legal for them to do this.  All of our savings is tied up in the business so I had to borrow money from my mom for us to move.  Then yesterday I found out that when we moved in here they tricked us into thinking we were paying the first and last month's rent when really what they told us was the last month's rent was a "non-refundable fee." So now we have another thousand dollar expense.  ..On top of that nobody is buying anything.  I ran a huge sale but only sold one ring.  My income had been at least $600 a month for the last year up until March - I've only made $80 since March 1st.  I'm not sure how we're going to make it through the next month.  I started looking for jobs but I wasted so much of my adult life working shitty jobs when I was drinking that I know I'm not qualified for anything.  I also know that I can't run this business and work at the same time.  There's barely enough time in a day as it is.   ..So for now I'm fairly certain that I have to give up on my dream.  And it really really sucks.  I feel like a big fat failure.  I feel like I've let my husband down.  Honestly getting drunk and forgetting about it for a few hours sounds great right now but that would just be another failure on my part.  I don't think I can handle that today.  So IWNDWYT.
