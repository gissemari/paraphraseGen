I then went to an AA meeting. Thought you all might get a kick out of it though..
----------immediate responses--------

Well how do you feel?
The lows alcohol will take us to...Welcome back! Keep going to the meetings!!
What was the thought process behind the relapse?
Glad you're back but are you taking it seriously?..Relapse starts before picking up the drink. Identifying those early warning signs gives the ability to intervene beforehand. I will add "behaviors" to VElaine's question. You can't drink alcohol if you protect yourself by not having access.  ..You never lose what you learned during 139 days of sobriety. Just continue building on this foundation. Don't drink today!
