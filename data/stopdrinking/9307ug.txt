Hey guys! I'm still sober and I'm so glad. ..I know some of my other posts alluded to how sick I have been due to my alcohol consumption and I just wanted to see if anyone else had ever experienced something similar?..I'm not asking for medical advice -- just wanted to put that out there. I can see the hospital from my living room and I've been 4x and 3 months and seen 6 different doctors in an outpatient setting.  ..The problem is I'm feeling just bad enough that a trip to the hospital seems in my near future and I'm holding off as long as possible. ..I started feeling general malaise around a year ago. Reflux was at its peak and hangovers seemed to be getting worse and worse. Certain foods became completely undigestable especially salad. ..The actual stomach pain/vomiting started probably around 6 months ago. It'd usually be tied into long bouts of drinking but I'd kind of notice it even when I wasn't drinking. Throwing up after meals had become almost commonplace. ..I saw a doctor around 3 months ago who put me on Prilosec. About a month ago things really started to get bad. Dizziness nausea fatigue constant abdominal pain mild fever. I was seen by GI and they scheduled and Endoscopy/colonoscopy for August 1. ..I've been to the ER twice since then and the first was a full work up -- CT with contrast Xray blood cultures etc. They diagnosed me with constipation (wasn't Constipated) and I left. ..A little over a week ago I'm finishing up a bender and I'm struggling to keep anything down even water. The stomach pain is horrific and I'm not sure but I think I saw blood clots. ER doesn't do shit gives me a pill for IBS a GI cocktail and some Zofran and says don't come back until your scope because we can't see inside your stomach and we can't help you. They use blood work and rule out anything acute that will kill me. I do understand their frustration because it's like why don't you just wait until the scope? ..But today is the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. I've been walking around doubled over crying my fucking eyes out and I never cry. The weird thing is there is no nausea or reflux. My esophagus is calm. It's right at the xyphoid process and it feels like I got shot in the stomach. It's hard to breathe at times and the pain is just so intense. ..I waited it out and after and hour it dulled from "immediate death" to "well now it doesn't feel bad enough to go to the ER" so that irritates me. I wish I had ran over there just so they could see my misery. They said something last time like I didn't look like I was in enough pain. ..I have had Prilosec Zofran tums percocet Marijuana a vitamin and a probiotic. Nothing is making this horrible pain go away. It's been 9 hours but I feel like if I go and I'm not in that "OMG I'M DYING" state they will just think I'm drug seeking--which clearly I have my own drugs. ..I don't know what I'm asking here. I'm just so lost and empty and trying to stay sober and I feel like I'm being punished severely. It's so awful. Any advice or encouragement would be so amazing right now. ..IWNDWYT
