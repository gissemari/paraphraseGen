Hi Reddit..&amp;#x200B;..I'd just like to start this post out by saying that I love my dad. He's one of the most caring people I know. He only has one major flaw...&amp;#x200B;..His drink...&amp;#x200B;..He will happily drink a bottle of wine every night during the week after work he will always crack open a cider. It gets to the point where he gets so annoying I can't cope I flip out at him then he gets annoyed at me and flips at me. My mother gets it in the neck because I get annoyed with his drinking. He's said that he will sort it out for years now but never has done. He's down a spiral and struggling to climb back up. He's by no means a small man either and I think his drink has seriously contributed to his weight. It's embarrassing for my friends to comment that he's "always drunk". I don't want him to drink himself to death I want him to watch me grow up get married have kids. I want him not to just sleep through Saturday evenings and leave my mom sat on the couch bored while his ass snores away...&amp;#x200B;..I just really need some pointers how can I tell him how much it affects our family how can I make sure he can sort his drink out. He's been tempted to try hypnotherapy I had it before and it really helped me with another issue - Only issue is he hasn't got around to booking an appointment he just says he wants to do it and nothing happens...&amp;#x200B;..Any advice at all would be entirely grateful even if its just coping tips for myself so I don't get annoyed at drunk him...&amp;#x200B;..Thank you for reading it means a lot.

May I ask your age?
The only way I can find not to get annoyed by someone else's behaviour is to admit that I'm powerless over it.  However I can set limits for myself and hold to them.   Alanon is a foundation for people with relatives and loved ones suffering from alcoholism.  It is worth googling them.
Hi. Unfortunately we aren't really the best sub to offer you support. You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group of people who love an alcoholic but do not want the other person's drinking to negatively affect their lives. If 12-step isn't your bag you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues where they focus on the [CRAFT]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_reinforcement_approach_and_family_training) method.  Other organizations may that may be able to help include  [SMART Recovery Family &amp; Friends](https://www.smartrecovery.org/family/) and [HARM LESS](http://hams.cc/harm-less/).
