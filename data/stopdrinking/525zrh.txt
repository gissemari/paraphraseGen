Damn. This is gonna be hard. Some of you may know many won't  but look at my post history if you need a recap...Going to keep this short and sweet hopefully. I went to an inpatient facility in PA in April and stayed there for 21 days due to insurance. I then went to a recovery program in FL. Why wouldn't I? Florida in early summer fuck yes. ..I spent a month in PHP. I was doing great. I left that situation to live with a friend in Miami that had offered me a bed and a job and he knew my situation. ..I did well I was working hard and prioritizing meetings and the gym. Friend had to leave for a week for business I relapsed. Quickly got back on the program. ..30 days later I relapsed again for about a week I drank and drank and drank...Again I went back to AA. I found that comfort and solace that was so familiar. I felt that I was home and would not wander again...I was wrong. I traveled home to Virginia drank at the airport and drank when I got home. I've had at least one drink almost everyday since I've been home. That was July 27th. ..I keep having this mental dialogue it's repetitive.  It goes "I want to go home". But I am "home". "Home" to me has to change comfort drives me to complacency. ..I'm ready to get back into recovery. I thought I was above it. I tried moderation. I failed. Like the BB says we get worse over time never better...I've been beating myself up but I know I can do it I've done it before. ..So it goes...Love y'all.

I don't have much to offer by way of advice except i had 12 years spent the last 8 in varying degrees of dysfunctional drinking and here I am at a week sober. Care to join me in not drinking today? :)
I'm glad you're back and ready to start again. Thanks for sharing I'll not drink with you today if you're willing.
