I find comfort in struggling right now at day 20 because I know when I come out of this I will be truly happy and this actually feels sustainable.

I was sort of the same--clouds are amazing but they are like vacations houses; they're not yours. I trudged through my first months honestly but I feel like I learned some patience some equanimity a snatch of the long view. Possibly some humility if we're being generous. ;-) ..I built my home-home. Then when it started getting really solid--well that's how it felt. Solid. Resilient. Good in a storm.
I get ya! My first time quitting I made 69 days floating along on a pink cloud. It's tougher this time but also better because I'm getting real world help too. My first time I only used this sub and while it is amazing I needed more. In fact it was this sub and many many people recommending it that got me to my first meeting.  It feels "for good" this time and that's better than a cloud! Well done on your 20 days! IWNDWYT 
I absolutely hated everything for the first 3-4 months of sobriety. I had zero pink cloud and I was pissed about it. I just kept putting one foot in front of the other and eventually the fog started to clear. Then one day I didn't feel so angry anymore. It kept getting better from there. ..But those first few months were the worst. If I ever feel the urge to drink I just need to remember how empty alone and scared I felt during that time. I never want to go through that hell again. Remember the struggle. I won't drink with you today.
