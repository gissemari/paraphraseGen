I recently relapsed but I'm at a week sober now. I had almost a year sober but recently I found out I may have done damage to myself when I was drinking heavily. So for some reason rather than get tests run I decided to drink. You guys keep me going and I will get my labs run to see if anything is wrong. Sorry if this is scattered I'm still kind of withdrawaling

You will be fine. STOPPING is the key!
Glad your back !!
