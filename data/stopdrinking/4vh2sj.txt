Hey everyone. I've finally hit rock bottom and while I feel depressed about the choices I've made that got me here I look forward to finally making sobriety work full time...Last week I spent all week on a bad binge/relapse. During this time I broke up with my girlfriend. I was so drunk when I did it I don't even know why I lost it and made this choice. She was my best friend and my only friend. Alcohol has made me isolate myself and become this hateful person. I'm not going to be that person anymore...There are a lot of things people would give their life for. I don't believe in much and my now ex was probably the only thing I would ever risk my own personal safety to protect. She is gone for good and I have no chance of getting her back. I'm going to my first AA meeting maybe tonight if I have time after I get home. If not tonight I start tomorrow at 7 with AA...I'm not going to be happy today. I accept the choices I've made and have to live with them from now on. I just want to tell you that not matter what happens today I WILL NOT DRINK! Thanks for listening whoever you are and please don't drink with me today. Our lives are too important.

If it were me and I'd just lost who I think is my only friend as a result of drinking binged for a week  and I felt I'd hit my bottom I'd make that AA meeting today not tomorrow my priority.
It's up to you if this is your final rock bottom it can also be one of many if you keep drinking. ..You are making the right decision by going to AA there are people there that have been where you are and have been able to stop drinking and make their lives better. Also keep checking in here you can find some really great advice and support.
Only way to go is up. Get thee to a meeting and you'll feel so much better.
