So this morning at our weekly sit down I noticed my mentor kept asking me leading questions about relapsing. He danced around the subject until he finally came out and asked "So have you relapsed?"..Frankly I was shocked. Of course I haven't relapsed. Why would you ask such a question? I was a little offended so I just said "No. I'm good."..He then went on to explain that in the space of a week or so I've had my house broken into sent him a random text at 3:30 am (it was a pocket dial) missed a meeting and am now having trouble paying my rent..."Well when you say it like that..."..I'm happy to report that I haven't relapsed. Haven't even thought about relapsing. Life is just working on its curveballs right now.

Yeah when you put it that way it doesn't sound good. But part of being a sponsor as well as a sponsee is accepting that bad things happen both in and out of sobriety. ..Sounds like he's just looking out for you as a sponsor should. I'm glad you're handling the curveballs with a clear head! I won't drink with you today! 
Woo Hoo!  Great NDVs !!
Shit happens. You're better able to deal with it when you aren't drinking but it still happens.
