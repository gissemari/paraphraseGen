Yet again another friend that I used with died way before their time was up...This person was far from a perfect individual. He was an asshole most of the time to most people. At least he came by it honestly. I understood his pain and I still do...I don't yet know how he died but it doesn't really matter. It was most likely directly connected to his use...The first thought I had was of my own use. I wanted to use. The true insanity of this disease reared its ugly head right away. Here today I have it in me to manifest a relapse because someone I knew died from this fucking disease. It's sickening and exhausting. But I will not drink today because THAT is the best way I can honor him and remember the good and bad we had together...So a little poem from a song...RIP BIGGIE...If I let you you would make me destroy myself..In order to survive you I must first survive myself..But I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you..There's no choice but to confront you to engage you to erase you..I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain..I will use my mistakes against you...there's no other choice..Shameless now nameless now nothing now no one now..But my soul must be iron cuz my fear is naked..Naked and fearless..And my fear is naked...

I'm sorry for your loss...&gt;The first thought I had was of my own use. I wanted to use. The true insanity of this disease reared its ugly head right away..My worst rock bottom moment was after the death of a friend from drinking. So unreal that I knew that he died directly from drinking and I went out to drink "for him". ..I will not drink with you today and I can't drink with my dead buddy anymore.
