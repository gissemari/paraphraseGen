Spotify has over 24 million active users and zero recovery playlist. Let's create the playlist that people searching for inspiration/recovery find use and grow from. ..The goal of this playlist is to promote recovery and reflection of addiction. So any songs that deal with either the negatives of addiction or/and the positives of recovery are welcome. ....**EDIT**.I've made the playlist collaborative. Anyone can add to it. please please keep it recovery based. ..Thanks! .....[Recovery (HTTP Link)](http://open.spotify.com/user/128749924/playlist/0HaBz0okGaLPQMT9rKgyWw)..**EDIT 2** This is going great! not so many upvotes but we've got 70 recovery songs. I can't stop listening! I wish I could put this playlist on every struggling addicts MP3 player out there.

BTMI - I don't love you anymore ..Incubus - drive ..
You should make it able for us to add to it!
Is anyone interested in creating a list of music (with youtube links) for the wiki?  Organized however you think makes the most sense...Same question goes for movies &amp; documentaries. (As a single category.)
Oh oh oh!..* Nine Inch Nails - The Hand That Feeds.* Modest Mouse - The Good Times Are Killing Me.* Hole - How Dirty Girls Get Clean.* Hole - Never Go Hungry.* Amanda Palmer - The Point Of It All.* Amanda Palmer - In My Mind.* Fiona Apple - Extraordinary Machine (I think it's actually about recovering from her eating disorder but it usually features on my recovery playlists so I'll throw it innn).* Falling In Reverse - I'm Not A Vampire.* The Who - However Much I Booze.* Marina and the Diamonds - I Am Not A Robot.* Queen - We Are The Champions
Wow some great songs on the playlist I'd forgotten all about. Thanks for doing this!
"Straight Edge" by Minor Threat.
Keith Urban - a guy who knows a little about the topic - has several songs...* You're Not Alone Tonight.* You're Not My God.* Nobody Drinks Alone..He also has one that was never released but is on the You Tube.  in addition to being (at least partially) about this topic it is also a pretty amazing song.  You may recognize one or both of the other country artists in the video. (apologies for the video quality)..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIDiCoRkDeI
"Ball and Chain" by Social Distortion.
Otherside by Macklemore - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvDQy53eldY
Cranford Nix - "Fadin' fast" ..... RIP.Eminem - "Not Afraid"

Great idea!
im not afraid by marshal mathers 
The Frey - How to Save a Life
Against Me! - Thrash Unreal..This song has really helped me stay sober by reminding me what my life could be like if I continued drinking.
Recovery  -  frank turner. 
I tried to add these two to the playlist but it didn't work for some reason...The Devil Makes Three - Graveyard..The Devil Makes Three - Old Number Seven..This is a brilliant idea as well. When I found these two songs I really empathized with them and they help remind me what my life was like when I was drinking. Actually that whole first album by this band has been amazing for me in recovery but not as much as those two. I'm glad I get to share them with everyone else here too and I hope they help.
Great idea. Added *Got to give it up* by Thin Lizzy and *A Great Drinker* by The Wonder Stuff.
[Flogging Molly - Float](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-PmyAfQ5xY)
Elliott Smith - Between the Bars
A lot of these songs I've heard but never actually *listened* to. I'm glad others have and shared them!
"Nights Become Days" by Frank Turner."John Doe" by B.o.B
Learning to Fly- Pink Floyd. Can't believe nobody's brought it up yet~.
Copypasta:..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMYRlgazDZQ&amp;feature=kp.Robert Francis - Heroin Lovers..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8dK0iEzi1M.Stevie Wonder - Too High..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFwhCLYO_-M.Ray Charles - Lets Go Get Stoned..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WHAnkJFOMs.Fugazi - Shut the Door..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgsctaBQHq4&amp;feature=kp.Elliot Smith - Christian Brothers [Alcohol].http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=214rKBQyL5Y&amp;feature=kp.Elliot Smith - Single File [Methadone Clinic]...Here come some personal songs...http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/The+Chaperone/6IC97P?src=5.Capillary Action - The Chaperone..This is the band I played in for a few years. It's written by my friend about the moment in the party when he's still sober carrying around a gallon of water while everyone starts getting really drunk...https://soundcloud.com/caught-in-motion/caught-in-motion-his-history.Caught in Motion - His History..I quit this band when I signed myself into rehab. Two months after that my friend wrote this song about me getting sober. It still nearly makes me cry when I hear it. I think it's a pretty decent song..
Stevie Ray Vaughan went through recovery and made an album called "In Step".  The songs "Tightrope" and "Crossfire" should be welcome in any addict's reovery playlist.  Also "Life by the Drop" might bring a Ray of hope to folks...Good luck to all.
"Bring Out Your Dead" by Strung Out
