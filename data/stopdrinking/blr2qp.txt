I'm so ready to live my life differently. I'm sick of struggling to remember my nights before and feeling too shitty to be the mom my son deserves wife my husband needs and not feeling like myself. I am literally beaten up by drunk me. A recovering broken big toe a fresh burn from cooking for my family on one arm and another from when I broke a glass accidentally then apparently struggled to clean it up. Not to mention the tons of little cuts bruises and swollen face..oh and the BOTCHED AS FUCK haircut. That's right. I decided to trim my bangs after a few shots...grabbed the scissors instead of my thinning shears accidentally..you get the idea. .I began drinking in my teens to handle my crippling social anxiety and depression and I've carried it as a crutch since. .I have a birthday coming up (27) then my son's (3 yr) shortly after. .This year all I want is to be healthy and happy. .Just for today I will not drink with everyone here. So grateful for this community &lt;3

A wise decision and one you will never regret!! IWNDWYT
If you want it you will have it.  Sobriety is something that needs to be valued over anything in thw begining.  The only way I stayed sober for the first month is to stay away from anything that would make me want to drink.  .I have relapsed 3 time in the last couple years and it always starts with reasoning with yourself that one time will be okay.  .Thw bigest improvements i have seen in myself are my emotionally stability more toned and I tend not to waste alot of time.  .I drank because of my anxiety.  It manifests its self in energy so i stay busy.  Little tricks like these will keep ypu sober in the hardest of times..Good luck and IWNDWYT
