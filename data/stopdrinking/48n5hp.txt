I've been thinking about how I wish I would have quit drinking much earlier in my life. I feel like those years I spent wasted were just that -- wasted. I've relapsed many times and have had relatively long (for me) bouts of abstaining from alcohol but am hoping this time sticks. To anyone considering quitting drinking tomorrow or another day please reconsider. Time is so precious...Thanks for reading. One moment at a time. :)

Time is the most precious commodity we have. So I'm trying to enjoy my every minute by being sober.
Thanks for the post.  I ponder about this also but try not to dwell on it too long.  Forward we go......sober!
Glad you're here!  There's a saying:  "you can look back; just don't stare."..All that went before was necessary to prepare you for now.  Without your past experiences you wouldn't have the commitment and understanding of the importance of what you're doing NOW...As it goes:  "I will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it."    ..Your experience prepares you to help others.  
Indeed I might cry if I thought about the last 4 or so years too much! :)
