Good morning /sd! Do you know what day it is!?!..Once again /u/JimBeamsHusband has invited me to help out with What's Up Wednesdays so here I am with the happy reminder that the week is halfway over. Let's share our our triumphs and our struggles!..**Triumph**: I was in a social situation last night that is usually alcohol-free. It was in a new location and someone brought a whole bunch of wine to "celebrate." It didn't really knock me off center like it could have and I was happy to drink my water and eat handfuls of Oreos while others got drunk. ..**Struggle**: Part of me wants to make something up frivolous here so I won't have to admit I'm anxious about the upcoming holidays. But yeah I am. Mine involves travel family stuff cancer stuff and time alone in a hotel room which is a notoriously dangerous thing for me. But I'll be here posting and asking for help. So there's that!..**General Chat**: Is anyone listening to the new podcast "Serial?" I'm enjoying it a lot but it feels a bit unseemly to be so caught up in the storytelling of a true crime that left at least one victim and some broken families in its wake. 
----------immediate responses--------

Awesome cake!  Good for you on your triumph - being knocked off center and getting right back.  I'm with you on the holidays.  My dad is sick with cancer now and it's going to be very difficult to stay upbeat....Here is my Wed:..**Triumph**: I'm back into writing a novel and I've written 70+ pages in the last few months.  I write every day in the morning and I find it very enjoyable...**Struggle**Yesterday I had an extremely stressful day including an actual fire emergency in my high rise building which brought back lots of memories when I lived in New York during 9/11.  It was the first day I felt very weak and around noon was having urges to drink.  I did some deep breathing focused on my sobriety and how I don't want to relapse and the feeling passed...**General Chat** Cake I've heard that Serial is good - someone recommended it.  I really want to check it out.  I also enjoy the Nightvale podcast.  This isn't a podcast but there seems to be a buzz on the Internet about "Too Many Cooks"  I found it pretty funny so if you have a few minutes it's something to google and make you laugh.

**Triumph:** Last night at dinner my family decided to open a bottle of wine (unusual for a Tuesday but we've been moving furniture to redecorate so I think they "needed" it) and despite my saying no thank you they filled my glass up to the top. I didn't touch it the whole meal and instead had a separate glass of water. After the meal it just got poured back into the bottle. But I didn't take a sip...**Struggle:** I'm finding it hard as I usually drink when I'm bored in the evenings. The past couple of nights I've gone to bed at 9pm to distract myself. An upside is I'm getting loads of sleep now but it's still a bit irritating. I hope once I hit a week or two it'll be easily to resist...**General chat:** sorry I don't do podcasts :( I've been watching American horror story recently for the first time though it's pretty cool!
Triumph: Today marks 30 days for me. Almost slipped up on Halloween night but my support system was there for me and helped me realize attending a zombie party at a bar wasn't the best idea. That person is my Mom. Shout-out to all the great and wonderful Mothers out there. Also I landed a new job on Monday so I am extremely excited to go back to work after a four month hiatus. Being 32 years old and jobless was a terrible feeling...Struggle: Like u/cake_or_radish I too am nervous about the holiday season. Every Time I think of the potential but certain hassles of this time of the year I start to feel very overwhelmed. This year I'm going to try something different and just go at my own pace because when I don't rush &amp; slow down generally speaking I tend to make less bad decisions. If others are not satisfied then that's just too bad. ..General Chat: Getting my drivers license back this week something I haven't had in 5 years. This has nothing to do with alcohol I just let it expire after selling my Jeep in 2009 and simply obtained an non-driver ID card / rode my bike. Nonetheless very excited about this one...Wish you all the best! 
**Triumph** I made it through a weekend of fancy events open bars and VIP statuses without drinking. Instead I stuck to fun NA beverages and was nice and on point to kick everybody's ass at bowling on the sweet vintage lanes in the Roosevelt Hotel! Also two weeks!! Woot!..**Struggle** The relapse I had two weeks ago was fast short shocking and turned my world on its head. After months of growth stability and positivity I am currently on a constant emotional roller coaster and my nerves are shot. This is the most fear doubt and uncertainty I've ever contended with and I am just trying to keep my head above water through daily doses of AA and meditation. It's fucking rough. ..**General Chat** With regards to Serial-- I met Ira Glass last weekend! I haven't started the show yet but my SO is way into it. Another one Ira suggested was "The Moth." Also I THINK we are getting a new kitten. I anticipate this being a good way to help refocus all my frenetic energy and bring a little joy back into my step. :)..Stay gold y'all. .
**Triumph**: I've made it 157 days with nary a desire to drink. My daughter had some medical issues last Friday and instead of sitting at happy hour getting loaded to start the weekend I was able to actually be a parent!..**Struggle**: My wife's father died recently so we're heading into the holidays on a bit of a melancholic note. She's an "orphan" now so to speak and is having a hard time thinking of Thanksgiving and Christmas without a parent to celebrate. My struggle will be to be there for here while at the same time keeping my sobriety at the forefront...**General chat**: It's freakin' cold! Minnesota has been socked with what could be a long cold snap - lows below zero by Friday!
Happy Wednesday!..**Triumph:** Made it to a month (plus two days)! For so long I considered taking a month-long break from drinking to reevaluate/dry out and just the idea of it seemed impossible. As it turns out one day follows the next pretty reliably and after the first few days I have really not had a difficult time...**Struggle:** I'm having trouble being still and doing nothing. Seems like a dumb problem to have but basically every waking moment I feel like I should be doing something probably trying to make up for lost time since I spent so long doing nothing except getting drunk. Still it would be nice to just put my butt down on the couch and feel like that's an ok place to be...**General chat:** OMG YES *Serial* is fantastic but I also have qualms about how much I (and judging by my Facebook feed many others) enjoy it.
**Triumph**: Double figures today! Mostly I've coasted along quite easily so far since my last hangover was so bad I actually thought I was going to die. The #stopdrinking IRC chat has helped me a lot too...**Struggle**: I am really struggling with diet sleep hygiene &amp; exercise. I'm consuming too much sugary stuff and junk food. My bank balance is a serious worry because I keep wasting money on stuff I don't need. I really need a kick in the ass and I don't know how to give it to myself :(..**General Chat**: I decided to participate in the SD book club and am reading Galapagos it's really good so far. Hoping to join in with the meetings but weekends are difficult for me as I have two very young children that require all my attention when they are awake.
I love the serial podcast! I'm all caught up and can't wait for tomorrow's episode! I listen to it at work. I'm pretty obsessed too. 
Triumph:  Signed up for school and looking good to have at least 1 class for spring 2015 semester...Struggle:  Oddly enough simply walking past the 40s in the store made me want one.  I am enough time out that it's not a dominating thought but it is still troublesome when it is put right in front of me...A buddy of mine was with me (quit also) and I said 'sigh a 40 would be so awesome right now...'  ..and he said 'would it though?'
**Triumph**: Let's see if I can explain this well.  I played a tennis match over the weekend (shocker) and after the match one of the opponents asked me if I played in college.  I said "no" and that I took 25 years off.  She asked why.  I told her that I was screwing around and drinking during that time.  She said "Oh this is the best part: drinking and tennis go great together!"  Without missing a beat I said "Not for me they don't."..She looked embarrassed and apologized (I guess realizing internally that she was talking to an alcoholic).  I said not to worry about it and that I'm fine...Now before anyone gets all upset and thinks that she meant drinking WHILE playing she surely meant that a lot of times people will hang out after matches and have some beer or wine.  I've been a part of these after-match parties and they're usually pretty tame.  Only half (if that) partake in alcohol...But I was just proud at how quickly (paraphrasing) "I don't drink" came out of my mouth...**Struggle**: A family member is going in for a relatively minor surgery tomorrow.  The recovery time is potentially a few weeks so she's going to require more attention from me to take care of things she normally does...**General Chat**: &lt;insert comment about weather here /&gt;...Oh and so nobody is surprised by this cake_or_radish is going to be the main "What's Up Wednesday" poster now.  She should no longer feel the need to say each week that I'm inviting her.
**Triumph**: I will have 90 days soon!..**Struggle**: I'm having a really hard time focusing at work and there's a lot I need to get done...**General Chat**: I find Serial fascinating -- last week's episode seemed to move from speculation to action in a way that eased my concerns about exploitation.
Triumph: I made it through Sunday dinner. A complicated in law obligation that involves gallons of wine and unhealthy food. Managed to make it through my first without wine and just cake...Struggle: at one week I'm still finding afternoons (when I would start) really restless and anxious. Need to find a better routine. ..General chat: looking for a home meeting and to make a service commitment. Struggling with my natural feeling of otherness. Trying to let me feeling of awkwardness from keeping me away from meetings as meetings make all the difference.
Triumph: 35 days! I made it past the time when I usually relapse. I'm still going strong and that's a good thing...Struggle: My roommate had his car towed last week and last night his moms car was stolen. It's been a very stressful few days at the house...General Chat: We're landing on a freaking comet! How cool is that?!?!?
Triumph:  Sat alone with my thoughts last night.  I don't know if anyone else feels this way but holy hell did I never used to be able to do that without having a full on anxiety attack...Struggle:  I sprained my ankle over the weekend and have been prescribed Tylenol with codeine.  They offered me perks and Vicodin but there is no way in hell I will not abuse those so I passed and instead opted for the least potent option they offered.  I'm still in a great deal of pain but only taking the minimum recommended dosage but I don't feel 100% sober still while I'm taking them... I don't know if it's just psychological guilt complex talking or what but if anyone has any insight as to how to manage this without risking relapse I'd be very grateful.  Or just reassurance that I'm not slipping by following my doctor's orders.  Or if I am putting myself at risk some alternatives.  My job is physically demanding and I just want to be able to perform adequately and without extreme pain but I have no desire to risk my sobriety...General chat:  Those smiling lunatics who said my life would get better at the meeting I went to a few months ago were right.  Jerks.  I'm happier than I've been in years.  :)
**Triumph:** Managing to eat healthier lately. Been able to manage my cravings for sugar instead opted for a healthier alternative!..**Struggle:** Been having mood swings for no apparent reason. Don't know if it's stress related or what. Also like many of you I'm starting to get nervous about the upcoming holidays. That's when I relapsed last year...**General Chat:** I want to start meditating and developing my spirituality in new ways. Anyone got any tips/tricks/links to useful websites? :)
**Triumph**:  I survived my first sober trip out of town. Last weekend I flew back to the East Coast for my boyfriend's high school reunion. To be honest I was bored out of my mind but it felt good not to be a drunk mess at an event that was important to him. ..**Struggle**:  Lately I've been getting frustrated with myself for behaviors I thought I had left behind. I've been anxious and struggling with procrastination avoidance overeating junk food - all things I associated with my lifestyle while drinking. I shouldn't have expected all my self-destructive tendencies to magically disappear but I hate this feeling of falling back on unhealthy habits. I've thought about trying therapy for a while so maybe this is a good time to go for it...**General**: Damn at that reunion people were drinking like it was the end of the world. At least it was held at a historical society so I got to learn some stuff. Did you know all the world's Fluff is produced in Lynn Massachusetts? Happy Wednesday to all you Fluffernutters out there!
Triumph: Not drinking is going fairly easy over 50 days!  I'm a keep-drinking-once-I-start alcoholic then a drink-everyday alcoholic...Struggle:  My social skills are lacking meeting friends is much easier when I don't know/care what I'm saying...General Chat:  Got a new motorcycle haven't had one for months and it has felt like years.  Can't wait to take it for a long ride Saturday morning while all my friends are sleeping.
**Triumph:** I work in IT and fixed a problem I've been working on for months!..**Struggle:** I used to get pretty depressed in the winter so I'm trying to get back into some old hobbies and plan some fun winter activities to keep my spirits up...**General Chat:** It's a sad day here today the snow tires are going. on the car :-(
Triumph: my SO shared a bottle of wine with her friend offered me some but I passed. It smelled bad. Yay me?..Struggle: I am worried about the upcoming weekend and I also noticed some growing anxiety. I think I need to start exercising or something.....General Chat: Got hooked on Suits. As if I needed any more addictive time wasters sigh!
**Triumph:**  Cake big chocolate and delicious.  I used to have this internal struggle with eating cake oh the calories how fat I would get.  Turns out I was drinking cake every night right into a blackout.  So getting sober has allowed me to embrace the simple things like CAKE...**Struggle:**  Cake.  I have ate so much of it.  Swapping one vice for a new one seems a bit counterproductive...**General Chat:** Anybody have a good recipe for diet cake?    ...(and then she's kicked out of SD because her cake-a-holic tendencies are negatively impacting others sigh)
Triumph: Got a better job..Struggle: Mood swings..General chat: I really love my girlfriend. She's great.
Triumph: I am *this close* to finishing my step 4 and have my step 5 appointment next Tuesday. ..Struggle: The holidays are approaching and I already got my first invite from former drinking buddies. Uggh. I've been talking to my sponsor and other sober peeps about it though and we collectively decided that I have no business spending a holiday with a bunch of people I used to drink with. So I'm going to an alca-thon instead. I'm grateful for the support and to be sober AND sad that I don't get to go be with my old friends. ..General Chat: I haven't listened to Serial but that's a good reminder that I should find some cool podcasts to listen to while at work. Thanks!
Triumph: Today marks 60 days not drinking for me! I almost seems like 2nd nature to me now and I am continually amazed at how the benefits of not drinking far out-weigh the latter! Not drinking today and for the foreseeable future as well! Thanks SD your support is invaluable!..Struggle: My SO is continually disappointing with binge drinking. I was up north closing up the cabin for the season with my brother the SO came up to join us... we were in the yard chopping wood when he pulled in and I noticed pine bows stuck under the front bumper this is a brand new car BTW. Said nothing. Two days later I figured out what had happened. There was a brush pile along side of the road where he works (bartender) and apparently he drove home "in a blackout" went off the road and hit the brush pile damaging the bumper and cracking the headlight. So I took him aside and showed him my discovery and admonished him over the fact. I was shocked at the fact he had no recollection (not really) and said he is lucky there wasn't a chunk of a flannel shirt stuck under the car! Needless to say this hit him square in the face and there was no getting around it. Baby steps in trying to make a drunk sober up...going to Al-anon meetings and SMART helps. I've thought of calling the local police and tipping them off...three days in jail may open his eyes?..General Chat: I have had some medical struggles of late. Bad shoulder and getting cortizone shots and PT. Also got a prescription filled that the pharmacy filled with the incorrect med. That fucked me all up! So its been like too many visits to Dr.s and Urgent care... its all sorted out now but still feeling "not out of the woods" and a bit pissed at life at the moment. It will get better... I got the PMA..."Positive Mental Attitude"..Thanks SD... a good Rant is not hard to find! {HUGZ}
Triumph: This is my 4th night coming up!...Struggle: I'm going out with workmates tomorrow. One will surely ask why I'm not drinking. I'm unsure what to say as of yet....General Chat: My ear infection is going away.
**Triumph**: Have not drank this week even though I am having some difficult emotions. Won't drink today...**Struggle**: Nervous about coping with loneliness - I am one of those people who is almost never single. The last time I was single was for ~2 months and it was basically one long blacked-out bender. I feel very ill-prepared! Plus the holidays are looming my job may be ending soon...I'm scared.
Triumph: I'm on the shitty week in my job rotation and I'm still not going to drink. ..Struggle: I'm not tempted much lately but when I am it's almost all-consuming. I haven't had intrusive thoughts like this in ages and it's incredibly similar to how my brain used to shove the idea of self-injuring at me. I'm not enjoying struggling but there was a moment of clarity in it: for me drinking is an inappropriate coping mechanism. Self-harming was also an inappropriate coping mechanism. Being able to recognize that link gives me something concrete to work on with my therapist. I guess that's a struggle and triumph all in one. ..General chat: I purchased my first pair of fleece-lined leggings and oh my god it's like wearing a blanket. So so good. I'm really enjoying having more money now that I'm sober. 
**Triumph?** Saw a psychologist today. I liked her and it was helpful. Its interesting to work with someone so good at exposing and working through my cognitive distortions. Also learned "square breathing" which I'll add to the toolbox...**Struggle:** Saw a psychologist today. Apparently some of my answers concerned my depression nurse and she wanted me in today. My head is still an ugly place...**Weather chat:** Why does everybody wait until the first real snow storm to get snow tires put on? It makes my wait at the tire shop sooooo much longer.
