It hapens to me after a relapse. The week after somedays I have really scary nightmares. It's 3 am here and I just have one of those that you can't wake up and when you do you're still in the dream. I woke up when i realize that in the dream I had different kind of glasses that I always use...What really creeps me out is that a woman came into my room and started to confort me but now that I can't remember her face and I thought It was my mom...Well I just wanted to vent. I will not drink with you today.

Perfectly normal your brain is over-stimulated. I drink extra strong camomile tea about an hour before bed it settles me.
Ugh. Just woke up from a drinking/using dream. Glad it isn't reality. 
Yes I had those realllly bad on sober night 2 after a week long relapse/binge phase. Scary shit! It's one reason why I don't want to go back to drinking. Mine were terrifying and vivid and I can still remember all of the details. 
Drinking dreams and nightmares are so common at first they are mentioned in the FAQs.  I won't drink with you today.  Sleep improves markedly after a week.
