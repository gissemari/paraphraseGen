I'm probably an alcoholic. It doesn't run in my family and no one has ever mentioned to me that I drink too much. And this is because I'm extremely high functioning and secretive...Once I start drinking (and it's always wine) I don't want to stop until I've had almost the whole bottle- sometimes the whole bottle. I usually start drinking around 3pm and finish the bottle at 7pm.  At this point I'm drunk and a little bell goes off in my head right after I've had one sip too much (as in this will lead me to a hang over) and I stop drinking wine for the evening switch to water (and the occasional Xanax or half of one because I'm usually pretty anxious by this point and the fun buzz and relief of that first drink has long since worn off and replaced by a foggy confusion and struggle to recollect the entirety of my day.)..I drink alone and at homebut I don't live alone so I hide the empty bottles and wine in a mug so as not to arise suspiscion. Sometimes I drink in the pantry to avoid being seen drinking by company. I avoid kissing anyone hello in case they smell it on my breath...I'm a careful and calulating alcoholic. I never get behind the wheel. But I have this new awful habit that's contributing to my alcohol-induced anxiety. And that is firing off strongly worded and biting emails. I've done this twice in a month and feel like a complete douche. Now these were both incidences where I felt I was wronged (even sober) but the words I choose and how I address the problem when I'm drunk is not how I would do this sober.  I'm not talking about profanity or verbal abuse but my choice in words was still beyond how I wish to present myself during adversity and disagreement...I have a recent prescription for Xanax its legit and I don't abuse that.  Rather I hoard them for when I truly need them which H's been more often lately. And it's largely related to alcoholic consumption. This led to my decision to quit. And when I tried to quit I couldn't go more than 1 day without craving a glass of Prosecco so badly I went it of my way to 2 stores to find the brand I like.  I am the type of alcoholic who can't have a bottle of Prosecco in the house for more Than a few hours without guzzling it down but the wine closet will be full of Cabernet (which I don't care for) and the bar stocked with spirits and I won't touch any of it.  If I can't have exactly what I want I won't drink. This is how I have managed to tell myself that I don't have a problem all this time. And truthfully it still makes me question it.  ..But here are the facts:.I drink every day..I drink more than I intend every day..I spend money I don't have on alcohol..I feel horrible after I drink (insomnia/anxiety).I make poor choices when I drink and regret them the next day...I'm not telling myself "okay I'm going to quit drinking forever" nor am I saying "I'm not going to drink for 30 days". I'm just saying "I'm not going to drink today and I'm going to sleep well tonight".  That's all for now.

Welcome! Instead of even telling myself "I'm not drinking today" or "I'm not drinking for 24 hours" I like to tell myself "I will still be sober when I go to bed tonight." ..For me it's a more tangible and concrete goal and gives me a job to do - just stay sober until bedtime!..Keep checking in we're all rooting for you!
Hi there and welcome!  I can truly relate to your story....from drinking only a particular wine to being so secretive about it.  I also was drinking almost a bottle of wine a day (I'm really hoping that stays in the past tense!).  I will often try to reassure myself that maybe I don't have a problem/that I'm not an alcoholic because I'm not "that bad". But then I remind myself that it's a progressive disease.  I'm not that bad YET.  The signs are there that the wine has control.  Why else do I struggle with intense guilt at 3 am on a daily basis mad at myself worry I'm killing myself and make an oath not to drink the next day only to go and do it all over again?  Because I have a problem.  This will be my 5th day without drinking.  Let's be strong together and commit to not drink today.
