Does anyone have any experience with outpatient groups or online counseling? I feel that I have tried a lot but haven't found a good fit yet. I keep relapsing. I have gone for as much as a year without drinking; then slip back.

It was important for me to have lots of support because I couldn't stay sober on my own. I didn't know how. Besides rehab I went to outpatient treatment which I highly recommend. AA was also instrumental in giving me tools to build a sober happy life. 
I've been using Talkspace (online counselling) for 14 months or so.  What do you want to know?
