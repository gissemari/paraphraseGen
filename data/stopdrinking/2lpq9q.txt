So I had a rough start to the week relapsed last weekend and spent the beginning of the week in withdrawal. ..Wednesday came around with a phone call from student loans (which has now been sent to collections) a couple hours before my weekly group that I've been frequenting since February minus a couple breaks. So i'm at my meeting and it's my turn to check-in. I break down. I cry I weep! I tell them about the phone call and my other financial difficulties (I have 4 accounts in collections 2 of them are student loans. One provincial one federal) and how I don't know what to do. I know how i've gotten myself to this point it's because of my addiction which I admit to myself has been going on in one way or another since summer 2012. I cry about the legal issues my dad is dealing with and subsequent fees from my dui oct. 3rd. The insurance company STILL hasn't made a decision. ugh. And i cry about how lonely I am. I live on a mountain....there are multiple switchbacks to get to my house. When I was done I was flooded with support and advice. How to approach my dad and tell him about my financial situation mostly...Anyway I decided to tell him on Thursday to give myself time to figure out how to tell him. I used a skill called DEAR MAN. It's very effective. He heard me out understood almost seemed unsurprised...which I guesss makes sense because they've been calling the house for years!..So I saw a debt advisor (trustee) on Friday. He basically told me my debt isn't big enough to do anything other than deal with the collections one by one. But he suggested I call credit counseling services canada which I did and I have an appointment Wednesday at 2:30 right after my counseling apt! Huzzah! They are also very sympathetic about my addiction and how it has affected my financial situation. Although I am pounding the pavement looking for a job I was told by both people I spoke to that I should first and foremost take care of myself. :) so nice...Also I decided I'm done with being cooped up (it's been months) and feeling sorry for myself. Done with relying on others to either visit me or take me somewhere. I bought a bus pass on Thursday. And I used it yesterday :) I also walked home from the bus to my house! It's only a 3.2 km walk (2 miles!) but the uphill part was the hardest. I'll have to get used to it though as I intend on doing it whenever I want to go anywhere. Being independent and self-sufficient will be good for my recovery. I had that epiphany on Wednesday night..So far I'm doing excellent! I went out and applied for jobs today and yesterday I sat in a starbucks had some tea and finished my book (then started my next one) It feels great to be in charge of my own life and taking ownership of my own happiness. ..This time is different from every other time I've attempted recovery by a looong shot. This time I'm confident. It's my friends birthday on Friday and she's going to the Keg for cheap appies. I told her I'm going but no drinking for me and my friends are all aware of my recovery and are incredibly supportive. I'm going to have a great time! Also I have plans on Thursday to see Interstellar (scifi geek reppin' hard) and my usual group on Wednesday and my 2 appointments. In between all those will be meetings. I have a planner and I've put meetings in my area every day. ..Hurrah for big changes!..Also when i went to get my bus pass the girl said they were out of youth passes and only had adult. To which I replied that's good because i'm 26. Hurrah for looking younger than you are!!..Hope you're all having a splendiforous Saturday and are joining me in not drinking :)..ps sorry I've been unposty lately. I had some things to sort out :)

&gt;I was told by both people I spoke to that I should first and foremost take care of myself...This  is the most important advice you have gotten so far in my limited knowledge of your journey so far.  ..But as I read on my heart sank ;(.  ..You are going to party on Friday and I was thinking you were going to take this seriously.  Good luck at the party.  I really hope you can get through it. 
You have a lot of things to juggle right now and my heart goes out to you. Debt is something that can stress me out to no end and I have tons of friends with ridiculous amounts of student loans so you're not alone here. /r/personalfinance is a very helpful subreddit if you want some solid advice on that sort of thing. :) Thank you for sharing.
