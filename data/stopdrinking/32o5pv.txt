Woot Woot Wednesday! [Happy Hump Day](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/250x250/61228659.jpg) folks! (For those of you outside our country [this is for you](http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/125483-Happy-Hump-Day.jpg)!)..Let's hump it out. Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other...Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: Everything is awesome. I repeat everything is awesome. I've had more triumphs in the past week than I had in months of drinking-time. Family work relationships friendships health fitness: everything is coming up /u/cake_or_radish. This is a great time for me. I actually woke up 30 minutes early this morning and thought to myself "I'll just lie here and think about how great my life is until it's time to wake up." WHAT'S UP WITH THAT!?! THANK YOU SOBRIETY!..**Struggle**: There's a part of me that is really hesitant to acknowledge all of the above. I mean things aren't always going to be so great. That's a given. I'm struggling with enjoying this time and not constantly reminding myself that it may be fleeting. And I worry about how I'll react if things start to go south (...*when* they start to go south (See what I did there?)). Life is full of ups and downs and part of the sober journey for me is recognizing that and developing the tools to deal with it. All said it's a pretty sweet problem to have. ..**General Chat**: On this hallowed tax day in the good old U.S. of A. it's a good time to remember how much we used to spend on alcohol. A quick back of the napkin tells me I used to spend upwards of $3000 a year on alcohol and I know that's lower than most since I always drank by myself at home. Have you guys done the calculations? What all are you doing with some of those excess funds?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

Back from my 10000 mile fruits of recovery road trip / escape from winter - to a great life wonderful home and resumption of my AA meeting in prison tonight.   Am really looking forward to it...Triumph: minor issues at home ( plumbing mostly) went away with a phone call and someone who knew what he was doing.  I could have made it more than it had to be but didn't...Struggle - if you can call it that - balancing yard work / deer proofing the garden with my artistic endeavors ...

Triumph: on my way home from the hot sweaty food truck in which I work my neighbours waved me over to join them for a glass of white wine on their patio in the evening sun. I stopped for a gossip and said no ta to the vino (had to say it 3 times!) then went home without the tiniest bit of regret that I'd turned down a wine. A Small but empowering triumph...Struggle: Just casually re-starting a new career/education after abut 15 years of nothing but cooking for a living. Slight brain melter. But I wouldn't be able to do it if I was drinking...
**Triumph:** I Picked up two years sober recently and my desire to remain sober is stronger then day 1 sitting in a jail cell    .**Struggles:** My understanding of women more specifically my gf. Half joking but half serious most conflict I have lately boil down to misunderstandings.    ..**General Chat:** Game of Thrones is back and right in time to replace the Walking Dead in my life. Somebody still likes me up there.
**Triumph:** The weather has been really nice and I finally got my road bike all tuned up and ready to go!..**Struggle:** I've been sleeping crappy lately one of my dogs is getting old and can't make it through the night without having to go out. My other dog has decided he likes to go out too but he likes to wait an hour or so after the first dog went out.... aarg...**General Chat:** I put some money aside for vacations that I normally would have spent on booze. This year we're going to Patagonia!

Once again my **triumphs** are wrapped up in getting through **[my struggles](http://redd.it/32oorh)**. I'm still here still sober and hopefully a little stronger for it...**General Chat:** If you haven't seen it the [Muppets jumped on the hump-day bandwagon](https://youtu.be/whFc4xtSD3w). My first 6 months of alcohol savings all went to my dentist. The rest is going to Mexico next month. Reefs! Whale Sharks! Poc chuc!
Cakes: You're amazing!  Congrats on your triumphs!  I'm sure you'll be ready for your southern-facing issues when they come up... you're approaching sobriety the right way ^TM ...**Triumph**: Threw a surprise birthday party for my wife this weekend.  It was a hit... she was surprised... everyone had a blast.  During the party I found myself going up to the bar to get some drinks for her and a couple friends.  As I'm walking back with 3 drinks in my hand I thought... this isn't weird at all.  I didn't feel any desire to drink them nor did I feel like it was something I shouldn't be doing...**Struggle**: I've got nothing.  Life is awesome...**General Chat**: $3000/year?  Wow.  Very conservatively I put my amount of savings at around $10000/year.  I was drinking a lot of the good stuff over the last few years.  But I traded all of that in for giving a lot of money to the United States Tennis Association and a couple of tennis clubs which now include me as a member.
Triumph: I filed my taxes on time for the first time in years (part of this whole "responsible adult" thing I'm trying). It feels really good to do stuff like that in a timely way I feel better about myself/less chaotic when I achieve goals like that.  ..Struggle: feeling sort of a loss of identity this week so I feel a little lost within myself.  These last few years seem to be nothing BUT change/loss/growth so I'm trying to roll with it and welcome the ambiguity.  Realizing how much drinking covered up a real lack of happiness so trying to find new simple pleasures like reading gardening. Even cleaning. All things that will truly add to my quality of life. ..General chat: Money saved not drinking? Probably around $3000 a year. Definitely noticing it in my bank account. Since I didn't get a scholarship for school I decided this is my 'sober scholarship' so I'll use the money to FINALLY finish college. It's easier to stay on track knowing that I have a clear goal for the cash saved. :) 
**Triumph**: I started a half marathon training program this week. I'm not used to following such a structured training schedule and it's a challenge but I've been sticking to it so far. And not even the running part just the *doing it* part. But I've got my eyes on the end goal. Also I quit smoking at the beginning of this year and to date I am still cigarette free (though I'm using a vape but that's part of my plan so in my book not a "failure."). I would be doing neither of these things if I was still drinking. (In fact I previously quit smoking and started again when I started drinking again. Stupid.)..**Struggle**: Finances - taxes aren't my problem (I did those the day I got my W-2) but simply saving money. I'm not very good with money and I tend to spend when I shouldn't. Fiance and I are trying to buy a house next year and I am letting both of us down by not saving money. ..I am also fighting a battle with Nocturnal Sleep Related Eating Disorder. It's frustrating as hell and I'm seeing a few doctors but I'm starting to get weary. It's hard to keep up and it's annoying af because I don't feel I even have control over what I do in my sleep. I am thankful for my sobriety in these experiences. I was somehow even WORSE with money when I was a drunk. With the NS-RED I feel like I have a better understanding of how to view and approach this problem as something I have to deal with whether I like it or not. And in lieu of beating myself up about it to take action...**General Chat**: Work has been hectic for a few months. One of our paralegals went on a leave of absence and instead of replacing her we redistributed the work. It isn't overwhelming necessarily but it's just more than I'm used to. Two of my cases are gearing up for trial within a month of each other and it's just been headache after headache- it seems like everything that comes my way is "number one priority" and it's challenging at times to determine what is *really* the "do first" task. Doing this hungover (and I did for years) would be hell. ..Other than that life is awesome. Wedding planning (6 months!) is going smoothly things with fiance are lovely things with my friends are good. Also it's finally Spring and that makes me happy...edit: oh god so many words. I'm sorry. I never did learn to be concise.
**Triumph**: I'm finally *doing* things that I would tell myself I *should* be doing. I'm exercising watching less Netflix reading more going to meetings enrolling in classes that will help further my career making plans for the future... I'm turning into someone I respect...**Struggle**: I realize now that I've isolated myself. I have very few close friends anymore and I keep most of my personal life to myself. I hate sharing. That's not who I want to be and that's not who I really am. I love people. I'm just afraid of being hurt or pushed aside. So opening up at meetings has been helpful and I hope to work on establishing real friendships in the future...**General Chat**: I used to pound coconut water at work to cure the daily mild hangovers and I'm drinking it today and honestly... it tastes like crap. Now that I'm already hydrated this stuff is nasty!
Just checking in.  Not much to say other than sober life is pretty fucking good.  Carry on!
Hi everyone have an awesome Wednesday! One more day sober!..Triumph: I'm on day 13 and have made meetings at least once a day. I go to an early morning meeting that is hard to get up for but as soon as I get out of bed my body takes over and gets my ass there without fail. I haven't been this committed to anything ever...Struggle: Today is 13 years since my dad's death. I have always reserved it as a "feelings" day and spend the day fully angry and sad without drinking then finish off with a blackout. Today I am not drinking and instead of being as pissed and miserable as I want I'm trying to be more aware of resentments I have and stay in equilibrium because I know there won't be a blackout later to cool off with. I don't want to throw out the whole day anymore because today is all I have :)..General chat: I did my taxes this weekend (I only owe $600 yay! I did not pay in at all last year) and sorted out my drinking receipts from the my personal and business receipts. I resisted tallying them up because it didn't feel constructive at the time but I did take a picture of the pile to remember in case I forget what my bottom looks like.
**Triumph:** lots of triumphs lately. My world is drastically changing right now and all for the better. I guess my biggest is telling new colleagues that I don't drink and dealing with all of the alcohol at work. Come 4:00pm someone around me is drinking. Whether it be the girl beside me opening a cheap 1.5L bottle of wine that I used to live off of or the guy opening a growler and pouring some for everyone to taste. Doesn't matter if it's Monday or Friday. There's drinking all around me at work now. Also throw in all the talk about drinking and all the invites to go out. I've managed to avoid it all and I don't even find myself wishing I could partake. ..**Struggle:**I guess my triumph is also my struggle. Avoiding the drinking topic is hard. I find myself talking with them about how great alcohol is. Talking about my favourite drinks. Cheering on the girl drinking wine from the bottle etc. Not sure how healthy this is. I've also been busy and not actively participating in recovery. Haven't seen my addiction counsellor in like 1.5 months. Stuff like that. ..**General:** Playoff season! 
**Triumph**:  I ran my first 20 mile trail race on Sunday fell and bloodied my knees but had a fantastic time overall.  Practicing getting my head out of the way and letting my body do its thing seems to be good for life in general.  I had some serious SD oomph support which had me grinning periodically during race.  Love you guys!..**Struggle**: I'm spinning a lot of stories in my head as I get ready to go to a weekend intensive therapy workshop.  I've never done group anything before so my challenge is to just be myself.  I'm scared.  I'm so used to hiding...**General Chat**:  I'm going to file my taxes today.  This is my record for procrastination which I guess I could celebrate since I will in theory meet the IRS deadline.../u/cake_or_radish I am happy for your awesome everything!  I love your WUW posts and your contributions to SD in general.  Thanks for getting us together.  :)..EDIT:  forgot to add an important detail to my triumph -- having SD support!
3 days with no drinks... ran 5 miles today. Getting ready to use some strategies for this weekend.
