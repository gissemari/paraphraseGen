I'm not going to lie to you guys after being  strong  for a week I've relapsed. I don't know what to do. I've dealt with substance abuse ever since I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. I can't do it any more. I can't. I am ruining relationships and destroying everything I hold dear. Please help reddit. ..Kik: Buffalo_Jake

All I could do is sit in AA meetings until my head got clear. ..Good luck. IWNDWYT
