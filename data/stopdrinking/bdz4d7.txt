I felt it coming like a freight train about 3 weeks ago. My bipolar meds got screwed up the voices were getting loud and the lizard brain convinced me alcohol would quiet them down. I conveniently "forgot" my naltrexone for a couple of days then started slow with a few beers. It only took two weeks to work up to a handle over 36 hours and getting arrested and hospitalized on Sunday. Three days of incarceration in a MHU and one vivitrol shot later I'm back at home and 48 hours sober. Obviously there are a shit-ton of other issues here but I can't lose sight of the fact that ETOH simply does not make things any better -- it's guaranteed to make everything worse. Sorry I screwed up again sobernauts. I will not drink with you today.
