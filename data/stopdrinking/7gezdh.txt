I'm thinking that today is the day I give this sobriety thing another shot. It's always been a struggle but my most recent bender has really taken a toll on my body and wallet. I've always used and participated in drinking as a hobby and I'm finding it incredibly hard to walk away from..Any advice from you guys would be greatly appreciated!

Hi! I'm glad you're here! Reading has helped me so much. [This list](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) is full of great books. I started with [*This Naked Mind*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27202127-this-naked-mind) by Annie Grace. ..Sweets and fizzy water were also a big help. ..Early sobriety is uncomfortable but temporary. Stay strong! I won't drink with you today.

Check in and chat for encouragement as often as you need to. It will seem hard and anxiety will be through the roof but you can do it. Try to occupy your mind with challenging and engaging projects to distract yourself. You can do it!
