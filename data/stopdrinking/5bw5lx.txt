I'm using a throwaway to post about this because it just feels really personal. But I'm hoping posting will feel cathartic and you're such an insightful bunch. ..I was 30 days or so sober when my husband told me he was addicted to heroin (this was a few months ago). He had been taking Suboxone for about a week then. He goes to the clinic and does his required monthly therapy appointment. ..He is not interested in any kind of support group online or in real life. I have spoken from the "I" and told him how much it has helped for me and how I couldn't have succeeded without it. He says I'm his support. ..He has had three therapy sessions and he says they have all been "getting to know you" type sessions. ..Initially his mood was more stable. I could tell when it was time for him to take his pill sometimes but generally things were better than they had been. But it's a roller coaster now. Yesterday he was in a fantastic mood all day then suddenly evening hit and everything changed. He was crying. He left for an hour and came back and said he did not want me to talk to him at all (but he wasn't upset with me). We sat in silence watching TV. This morning he was angry biting my head off and cursing at me. Then he was normal again. Now he's gotten sad again and left said he would be back tonight. (I am certain he's not using by way of drug tests)..I know his recovery is his own. I know that. But if this is how he is doing recovery I cannot imagine he will be successful. But then I think that's a bad thought and I should have faith and have patience. I very much feel he's whatever the drug equivalent of a dry drunk is. ..I know I should put myself first but I don't know what that means anymore. I don't know how to be supportive AND put myself first. I feel so drained exhausted tired. I'm so so tired of being the calm one...I guess the answer for me should be therapy but I won't have insurance again until next year. ..I can't make him do things differently. I want to see him succeed. There was this glimmer of things being good for a while and I'm trying to hold onto it. But then sometimes I feel like I'm trying to save something that never existed in the first place. ..I've read Naranon stuff and it doesn't really seem to apply to my situation so much. At least I haven't found much I can relate to. ..I know no one can answer things for me. I guess I'm just hoping someone has some kind of insight something wise to say. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like my life would be better if I was on my own with my (our) kid. I don't know when to stop being patient and say "I can't do this anymore." I don't want to abandon him when he's clearly struggling. Obviously I have not been a picnic in the past. ..I hope you all don't mind me posting this here. I have a feeling it's going to be a long night for me but I won't be drinking no matter what. Thanks.

Early sobriety is a rollercoaster. Perhaps he is 'progressing' exactly how he needs to. When I set other people up for a recovery that I deem "respectable" I set myself up for disappointment...When my husband and I are in 'moods' because of something I've realized that going for a walk hitting the gym or going to take photos helps ME refocus...When I became exhausted when dealing with someone's mental health symptoms I know I am too invested. Sometimes when I care about someone so much I think ATTACHING MORE is the answer. Like if I just cling on and hold on tight then they will get better...But what if...I let go? And trusted? And distracted myself?
