Lately I have been locked into a crazy work schedule and I have been looking for new ways to stay connected with the sober universe until I can get back to my usual routine (1 or 2 AA meetings per week phone calls to other recovering alcoholics exercise quiet time without phone etc...)   I am probably the last person in the industrialized world to know about this but if you search for "sobriety podcasts" on Spotify there is a decent selection of podcasts and I highly recommend checking these out if you ever need a boost.  I have been listening to everything from crusty old AA speakers to contemporary mindfulness-based approaches to sobriety and I genuinely benefit from having these ideas swirling around me while I drive down the road or walk between meetings.  ..One thing I heard today absolutely stopped me in my tracks:  "Sometimes in sobriety you need to act better than you feel."  SO TRUE!!  Exactly what I needed to hear at that moment. Just as I was beginning to slide into a rut I snapped out of it looked up at the sky felt the sun on my skin and reminded myself that it is amazing to be here.  I might not feel my best today but that doesn't mean that I need to treat myself of others with anything short of my best.  I don't need to be fake with anyone but I can acknowledge my struggles and make the conscious decision to be the best version of myself that I can be at this time.  I am grateful to be here and grateful to be sober...Just another reminder that you can't think your way into right living but you can live your way into right thinking...Be well..Seth N...&amp;#x200B;

Thank you Seth for sharing!  IWNDWYT
I'm curious with 931 days sober and typically 2 meetings a week when you are calling other alcoholics is it to talk about not drinking?  Is it just to say hi?  IWNDWYT
