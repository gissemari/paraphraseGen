I've been sober since April 13th. It's the longest I've gone in years. I'm exercising daily eating right and sleeping well. But it's Friday and it's beautiful out. My wife is having a cocktail at home (unlike me she can have one and be done.) And literally all I want is a 24 pack of beer knowing full well I'll feel like shit tomorrow both physically and emotionally...Why do I do this? Why do I struggle with NOT doing something that poisons me? ..I always drink to blackout apparently last time I was gurgling in bed. Wife was not happy.

There are still toxins in your body at this stage so it's totally normal and expected that you would still crave it right now. Give it another few days you're almost there!
Hang in there - tomorrow morning you will feel grreat.
I *still* have an urge to do things that I know are bad for me. I get it. Don't get down on yourself - at least you're at a point where you know that you don't *have* to do them. Why do I want to do things that I know will hurt me? Because I'm so resistant to change that I'd prefer the known (dis)comfort of the grimy musty dark lonely and depressing pit rather than actually take the chance to find something better. But you know what? *We* can try to find that something better together. Neither you nor I nor any one else here is doing this alone. We are all in it and are all getting better with each other's help. Much love to you and we can do this.
