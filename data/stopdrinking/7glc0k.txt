I'm approaching the 30 day sober mark and this is always a real venture into the danger zone for me.  .It's around this the 30 day sober mark that i always find myself failing due sometimes to complacency and sometimes to a build up of stress and anxiety mostly to both i guess..I used to kid myself that i didn't really experience cravings for alcohol when i was off the drink.  i now know the truth.  .during all my previous attempts to dry out i'd cave-in at the first hint of craving so as i never really had to endure them and didn't really recognize the cravings.  .this time i went into sobriety with a much clearer idea of what precipitates a relapse and more prepared to deal with it - specifically i mean to recognize the build up in anxiety that always seems lead to relapse and to then to start counter-measures.  .well the anxiety has arrived and is hard to shift and i am now into a period of craving for alcohol - so strong and real to me that i can actually taste vodka fumes in my mouth.  this has been going on for about 12-18 hours now.  .i'm not going to pretend that it's easy to resist!  right now even though every sensible cell in my brain is telling me all the things i need to remember(inevitable shame misery DT's etc if i relapse) there is still a defiant voice in my head telling me "it would be ok just to have a couple of drinks".  .i will not cave in to these feelings this time!  i am taking actions writing this post i will medidate and gather my thoughts and strength for the day ahead.  .Not drinking with you all today.

Thank you for your courage to post!..&gt; recognize the build up in anxiety that always seems lead to relapse and to then to start counter-measures..See my last link in the list below for my most effective relapse counter-measure...Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

Stay strong!   Urges *always* pass.  They cannot last forever.  ..There are numerous different tactics to fight an urge.  Here's one source:   http://blog.smartrecovery.org/2017/01/31/5-ways-to-deal-with-urges-and-cravings/
I find recovery does include some changes in thinking.  In AA they call it a "psychic change."  The wording doesn't really matter.  You'll find the same concept in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy...For me it's a function of changing small parts of sentences in my mind.  You don't try to get rid of the thoughts you alter them...When I would say to myself "I always relapse at 30 days" I change it to "I used to relapse at 30 days."  When I think "I want to have a drink" I add "but now I have tools in place to avoid that."..You can also just identify thoughts and feelings.  This provides some distance in the mind.  If you're craving you think "I'm having a feeling right now.  I have lots of feelings they come and go."..Edit: switching to desktop
I can so relate. I always relapse fast so I never really knew what an actual craving was even when I was experiencing one. I always started drinking again as soon as the hangover passed. ..On Monday the most recent time I relapsed I was craving vodka since 4 a.m. By noon I found myself in a liquor store convincing myself I was fine. This would be fine. I'd stop before I turned. ..Now I'm starting Day 3 and I'm feeling somewhat healthy; the 2-day hangover is a distant memory. By Day 6 or 7 is when I would typically pick-up again. I didn't think I was doing it from craving. I would somehow convince myself really quickly that I actually didn't have a problem at all. ..I see now that I was probably just craving booze but psychologically since the actual physical suffering was over. I convince myself that it's crazy to stop doing something enjoyable something that makes life seem a little easier and more fun. I wanted every day to be a party even if it was a party of 1. The problem is it wasn't always a party. A lot of times it was a whole lot screaming at my SO and crying because I thought my life was so miserable. ..I'm preparing for the weekend now so by the time Day 7 rolls around I'll be ready and willing to accept the craving and acknowledge it knowing it will eventually go away and feeling deprived is not a permanent condition. ..Thanks for sharing your story. I won't drink with you today.
I ate so much freaking candy and cookies and crap for the first month or so (maybe 2 months) when I quit drinking I just couldn't stop.   I didn't feel like I craved sugar but apparently I did like a mofo.  ..Whatever - if it kept me away from the liquor store I'd scoop sugar right out of the bag.     Do whatever you gotta do at 28 days you might be dealing with your bad old habits more so than physical withdrawal but regardless  the urges oh the urges.....One day I think I was about a month without booze myself at the time I got in my car around 5PM to run an errand it was a beautiful day and that little voice whispered "wouldn't drinking a nice bottle of wine on the deck be the best thing right now?"   I was really drawn to detour to the liquor store and out of the blue (I was solo in my car fortunately) I blurted out "Stop fucked-up brain chemistry I'm not drinking!!"    It was like I addressed what was calling to me and immediately the desire went away. ..We're all different but do what you gotta do - your life will be so much better if you don't buy that bottle.  Good luck!!
