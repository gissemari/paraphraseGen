if you're struggling to begin or had a slip up a friend shared the following with me - ..lapse - a temporary failure of concentration memory or judgment. - you can begin again. you didn't fail. ..relapse - (of someone suffering from a disease) suffer deterioration after a period of improvement. - you can begin again. you didn't fail. ..collapse - cause (something) to fall in or give way. - you can begin again. you didn't fail. ..IWNDWYT - it gets easier as the days pass. i had a lapse.

I'm pretty sure that I screwed up though. It's not failure though I didn't get arrested or divorced.
Thank you for this - very encouraging !
I've relapsed before and I might do it again. But this time (and potentially the next time) might be the time my sobriety finally sticks. The trick really is to keep going. .Thank you for this and IWNDWYT
