I think of that famous tragic American singer who struggled with addiction throughout her career. She died a few years ago (may her soul rest in peace) after getting into a hotel bathtub with a temp of 150 degrees. I shudder remembering all the drunken times I bathed home alone in burning hot water. So grateful for sobriety; I just emerged from a lovely Friday night whirlpool bath with a rose petal facial. :)

a rose petal.facial sounds so wonderful!
Drinking wine in a hot bath was my late night ritual for years (when I wasn't watching Netflix movies I couldn't remember the next day). I woke up underwater more than once. It still bothers me almost two years later how it could've ended. I'm lucky - and I'm never going back there! Still love long hot baths but now with sparkling water in my glass.
