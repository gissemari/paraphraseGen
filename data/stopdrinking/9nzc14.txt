 I relapsed recently and went on a nasty bender. I decided to get back on the wagon immediately   I hit a few meetings and started my regular 6 mile daily runs. When I look back the bender started after I went two days without running (hint hint). Anyways I got restless today and decided to go downtown cause I  needed  to go to CVS. I remembered I  needed  other things from market place (this town I live in has them on every street and they ALL have liquor stores FML)as well. I arrived at market place and got some food and as I got in line I just zoned out on at the liquor section   contemplating everything. As you can probably guess I didn't NEED any of that   I was craving alcohol and I needed an excuse   I was on that autopilot we are all familiar with. I got to my car and realized  Okay I think there is a meeting I can go to  nope false I missed it by an hour. So I sat there and said  I'll eat listen to some some bill hicks and if I decide to drink I'll have plenty of options as I drive . As I drive it occurred to me how fucked I am and drinking will only fuck me up more. My life is going so well right now and I sadly get off on reminding myself I have the power to ruin it all. So I stopped and got coffee and now I'm at home. I'm back in my warm apartment drinking too much coffee with relics obtained from my night drive and looking forward to waking up without a hangover.   ..&amp;#x200B;..  .  Till next weekend

Good for you.
Congratulations on the trip through the minefield :)..I can totally relate - have made so many trips for random "needs" that are most definitely just an excuse to pick up a bottle of wine or 2...I live in a similar situation where practically every store sells booze. I have made a habit of only shopping from a grocery list - and it's a non-negotiable rule for me right now. Not on the list not buying it. It helps some for now...Enjoy your coffee!
