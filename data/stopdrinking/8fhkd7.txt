I spent most of my adult life wallowing in self pity blaming the world for my problems and convincing myself that I am a victim of my circumstances. I lived in extreme delusion where drinking wasn't the problem it was the solution. I was living to get fucked up and justified it by saying I was still young. ..I was lucky enough to have a family who loves the hell out of me and after a close call one day 6 months ago I got help. Now It all seems like a distant dream honestly and I no longer struggle with depression or anxiety. I am the happiest I've been in 6 years. I can say with 100% confidence I will never drink or use drugs again. Ever. Life is beautiful and so are addicts!!! You are not broken there is nothing wrong with you and recovery is possible (: ..
