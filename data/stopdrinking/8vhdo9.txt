Struggling on Day 4 but finally realised something from reading through the diary I had written last time I was going through alcohol withdrawal. Even when I have got the shakes huge cravings and sweats etc alcohol actually makes me feel worse. Maybe it stops the shakes for a little while but makes me sweat more anxious bloated stomach to the point of being uncomfortable and awful nausea and vomiting. No need for any comments thank you but just wanted to write this down to remind myself. Unfortunately my Doc will not prescribe me anything to help with withdrawal symptoms but will have to try my best this time. Good luck everyone and try and remember the horrible way alcohol can make you feel.

I have posted stuff here as reminder for me too.  It is a great tool to use and go back to reread when the pain fads and my brain is trying to justify that it's ok to drink again.
Reading from others post's the withdraws become worse after you quit and start again.  Please be safe...I will not drink with you today
