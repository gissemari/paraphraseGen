By the end of this month I will celebrate my 4 year anniversary of my struggle to break my porn addiction... Although I'm aware of /r/nofap I'm not very fond of it for various reasons. It feels like porn is my 'real' addiction. This is also partly what keeps me away of that first drink for I do not want to end up struggling in the same way to stay sober. My longest time porn free was 7 months and that was a few years ago. Right now I've been struggling for weeks to get past one or two days. I don't want this anymore. Anyone who relates? I will not drink and not watch porn today.

As happy as we are happy to have you here this is a sub dedicated to abstaining from alcohol use. I don't know but I figure there are better suited places for you.
