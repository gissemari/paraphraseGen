Hi SD..Today has been a nightmare for me. I decided to drink two bottles of wine last night(my badge needs to be reset) and wound up falling and smacking the backside of my head on a coffee table. I feel so incredibly stupid and shameful. Quitting drinking has been the toughest battle of my life. I am 25 and I have been struggling with alcohol since I was 14. It's extremely difficult for me to find the motivation to stop I have been using alcohol to treat my social anxiety which has now turned into depression. Every time I go back to the bottle things always seem to get worse. I know that I have a problem and it's so obvious that I cannot handle any sort of drinking. I want to stop. I don't want to feel the guilt and shame anymore.  I am so grateful for all of you guys reading the posts on here give me inspiration and hope. I wont drink with yall tonight.

Hope you are ok. Sounds like you had a pretty hard fall. Have you ever considered rehab? I went to outpatient rehab last year and it really helped me. I was a wine drinker too.
Ouch.  ..You can do it!
It starts with 1 day. You can make tomorrow better than today by not drinking. 
No need for guilt nor shame here. IWNDWYT.
