I made it three days but then Monday/work happened. It wasn't even a horribly stressful day. Even so I see it as a reward! It feels like something I deserved by making it through the day! ..However if it was a horribly stressful day I justify the drink because it puts me in a better mood and I won't be an asshole to my gf or others...I just can't seem to get mind to understand that it's not necessary! Even knowing it's not going to help anything. I know the one drink will turn into 6 and I know I'll feel like shit in the morning. ..I guess it's become a habit... almost like brushing my teeth lol but this isn't something useful or productive other than feeling better about life if only for awhile. I'm thinking of trying the medication vivitrol... anyone have experience with it?

I feel ya made it through Monday and I feel like I deserve my 2 bottles of wine. Hanging on by a thread during my  witching hour . IWNDWYT 
The struggle is real and worth it!!! IWNDWYT 
It was less of a struggle because I had the support of a therapist and AA.
