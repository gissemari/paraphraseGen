Hey all  .  .Firstly - a big thank you to everyone participating in this subreddit. Yesterday I was depressed over the fact that despite my efforts to limit my drinking I had completely failed and was now drinking more than ever. I lurked on this subreddit and saw a thread of users posting their before / after images and they were just beyond inspirational. I tried to find it to link to it but I guess it's been deleted now. Anyway I was so impressed by it and so uplifted I went over to my fridge and poured out all the alcohol I had and stayed sober that day and into the night.  .  .However I've been here before. Every time I've tried to quit drinking over the past few months I always make it a few days and then depression hits me pretty hard and I find it next to impossible not to drink. Because I struggle with depression I've used alcohol as a way to escape it and I'm trying to break the habit. I know that alcohol and depression go hand in hand so I'm sure I'm not the only one here who has struggled with depression and finding healthier ways to handle it. I was curious what has been working for other people on here. Any advice would be much appreciated!  .  .**TL/DR:** Having trouble making it beyond a few days of sobriety before relapsing because of depression. Any advice on keeping sober while dealing with depression?

Here's what worked for me /u/giraffegonesober -- [the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too suffered serious clinical depression but sobriety consistent sustained sobriety went a long way to helping me feel better.  It's sort of like a snake biting its own tail depression and alcoholism.  To break the pattern I had to stop self-medicating with booze.
Glad you are here! Sounds like you are serious and willing to get sober and participating here is a great start. It takes a lot of hard work to separate oneself from alcohol. I certainly underestimated the power booze had on me and frequently relapsed. Would you consider making a couple calls and seek help in RL? We need all the help we can get. SD is a wonderful community with wonderfull giving people here but depending on the severity of your alcoholism may not be enough. There are tons of resources available and many are free. There are people out here that you haven't met yet that are meant to help you. Seek them out. For me I had to be physically separated from alcohol in order to string some sober days together (in patient). It meant letting the professionals establish a treatment plan. It was inconvenient embarrassing ego smashing and uncomfortable but it seems to be working. I hope that you too find the freedom you seek but it takes work and does not come easy. Take care and I hope to read of your progress.
Get to a doctor - if you're clinically depressed they can help you to find ways to abate those awful feelings. I started taking anti-depressants 15 years after I got clean. I wish I had started taking them much earlier in life. They really do help. Make sure to tell any physician that you're trying to stay clean - this is important information that will help them to help you get better. Best of luck friend. 
Good job pouring it out.  Your story is mine.  I too suffer from depression.  I also drank to kill it and feel things.  I have found other ways to cope with depression instead of booze.  You don't get good at anything without practice and this is no different.  I do my best to avoid triggers and to be physically healthy so my brain chemistry is healthy.  Hope you make it you can do it.
What helps depression and sobriety in general is exercise. Like the one tool all 5+ yr sober share is exercise. Wasn't clinically depressed but def in bad headspace so I started lifting when I got clean and boy. That advice is spot on. Eats up bad hormones releases good hormones bumps confidence and pride and accomplishment. Heck yeah. Also getting out. Go to museum park mall mini golf. I like to keep moving forward make memories.      ..As to faces? I got your back.
