It's my first day here. My first day sober. I'm starting to realize that I have way more of a problem than I realized. I decided to look through my calendar through June and July and try to count how many times i had a night of binge drinking... there are WAY more than i ever realized. I am so ready to start living this sober lifestyle. Kind of just wanted to share this. I never thought i had a real problem because i wasn't struggling with wanting to drink daily. But my drinking habits have gotten out of control. I want to continue to hold myself accountable.

Welcome. This place has me drinking less than I meant to when I showed up.  A great spot for helping turn routines around.  iwndwyt
