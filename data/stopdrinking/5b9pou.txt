It hit me this morning that as I post my daily "I will not drink today" affirmation that I don't think much about not drinking anymore. Yesterday at work coworkers mentioned we don't hang out anymore because much of our hanging out was at our local bar and I nonchalantly said "I'd love to go but I can only drink 2 Diet Cokes." Everyone laughed. There was no internal struggle or temptation in the very thought...I don't want to take my commitment for grantet but it's nice it's not always in the forefront of my mind.

This has been true for me too. The temptation to stop for wine has generally faded into the background. Last night I had a bit of a temptation moment just because Friday night is a huge trigger for me but it's not that thing I'm constantly thinking about anymore. Go you on 68 days!
It did become the new normal for me but it was more like six months because I'm a slow learner. 
Awesome.
