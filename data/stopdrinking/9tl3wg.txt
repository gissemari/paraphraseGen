After the initial quitting i have found I fight my own brain. Fighting with your own brain is tiring. It can nearly drive you crazy. You know what you are thinking isn't healthy it isn't helpful it is downright hurtful. Just remember that it will pass - I have to remind myself of this. If you are feeling useless you are not. If you feel alone you are not. If you feel like you are worthless you are not. I struggle with all of these but I won't give up. I hope you won't either. IWNDWYT

I heard someone say alcoholism is a disease that lies to you with your own voice. Your post really resonates with me. That brain fighting must be done. I am working on replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. Our words are powerful. Thanks for sharing. IWNDWYT
