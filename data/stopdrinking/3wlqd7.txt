I can't shake the feeling that I'm on everyone's shit list at work due to my past episodes. I don't know if this is a correct perception or just my alcoholic brain but it feels real. How long did it take you to feel like you gained people's respect/trust back? How did you help the process along? So far I've just tried to follow through on everything I promise to do and show that I'm putting effort in to do things well but I don't know if that's enough. Before my last relapse I thought I had a long future at the job I'm currently at with promotions in line but now I feel like people just want me out. I really want to just ask my coworkers but that would make things seriously awkward...Also don't know if this is relevant but I'm pretty sure I've got some PAWS going on which complicates things.

It sounds like you're on the right track. People may have been fed up with your drunk antics before but they will see that you are trying to make up for it. It's true that you may have slipped down the totem pole a bit but now you just have to put in the good work and people will take note. ..I had to google what PAWS was - definitely seek the advice of a medical professional if you think that is the case. 
FEAR = False Evidence appearing real. Don't let it eat at you.
