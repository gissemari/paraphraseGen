Has anyone gotten a sponsor outside of being in AA? Smart Recovery seems like a better fit for me so far but afaik they don't do the whole sponsorship thing. It would be nice to have someone local to call or text who relates to the struggles.

There are people not in recovery who get sponsors but then it is usually referred to as a mentor.  And the paid ones in this area I usually hear referred to as coaches...life coach recovery coach stuff like that.  Hopefully those additional search terms will help you find the person you are looking for.

Had a  sponsor  since day 1.  He was a friend of my sister who she told me to reach out to.  He had gotten sober a couple years prior and apparently we had some similarities.  Anyway day one i called this total stranger and just broke down.  Just over two years later we dont chat nearly as much but we still check up on each other and congratulate each other on milestones.
Good question. I am in AA. I have a mentor. She is a Christian lay minister and not in AA. She is wonderful and I can be totally honest with her. Best wishes to you. IWNDWYT
