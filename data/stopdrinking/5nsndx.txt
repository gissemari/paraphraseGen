I am a recovering alcoholic. I currently have 196 days of sobriety. I am by no means a font of good information as to how anyone should go about recovering from this horrid disease we suffer from. That being said I do have many good people that are providing good strategies and behaviors that I am implementing to maintain my sobriety. ..What I want to share today is an honest look at the environment that we as Americans in recovery have to attempt to be sober in. A group leader/social worker who runs several meetings at the VA hospital in my area shared his observations about how our culture is completely against addicts/alcoholics recovering. ..At any time today I can make the choice to walk into any liquor store or drinking establishment and procure my drink of choice providing that I have a valid ID and the funds to purchase it. On television the radio and on the internet I am bombarded with advertisements telling me that I can and NEED to have a sip/gallon of whatever beer/wine/liquor they are selling. Our culture as adults pressures us to have alcohol present in nearly all situations to be "sociable" and have a good time. There is no true barrier other than money and valid ID that prevents an alcoholic from continuing our addiction. ..On the flip side of the coin those of us who need help with quitting our addiction are subjected to a process that is designed (on purpose) to deter us from seeking treatment. Those of us who need to be in an inpatient and/or outpatient treatment program must submit to a barrage of intrusive questions and procedures (breathalyzers blood tests etc.) that often cause some people to give up the idea of getting help early on. It's discouraging to see fellow alcoholics/addicts who need help continue their addiction because the "system" the supposed to help them is effectively turning them away. ..My group leader shared this with us and then asked us to seek out those individuals who we know have "given up" and try to encourage and guide them through a process that is designed to discourage recovery. I felt the need to share this with you in order to remind you that we are truly in a battle not only with ourselves and our substance of choice but with society's pressure on us to stay addicted. I ask that you not only maintain your sobriety and health but also to reach out to your fellow struggling addict/alcoholic to support them and encourage them to jump through the hoops to get help. ..Thank you for reading. I wish you all the best and I will NOT be having a drink with you.

&gt; submit to a barrage of intrusive questions and procedures (breathalyzers blood tests etc.) ..Aren't the things you mention for our own good? I would guess the doctors need to know my drinking and medical history as well as bac to tailor the treatment to my situation. To know whether I might need vit B infusions whether I am at risk of withdrawal symptoms have hepatitis etc. ..If such a minor thing like a blood test makes me give up on stopping drinking it could mean that I am not ready to do everything in my power to stop. It means I haven't given up on the idea that I know best or at least better than the professionals I am asking for help. This makes our working relationship hard. If I am not ready to be guided I cannot be guided and my chances of success are very low.
