I've been making all sorts of plans to go and buy booze. Different places I would go what excuses I could come up with. Then I came on here to read found /u/sdstrawburry AskReddit and wound up remembering the time I spent five minutes flushed and sweating with embarrassment shoving pennies into a self-service checkout in front of an attendant to buy a bottle of wine. Fuck that. Coupled with the fact that a I went to show my ID to the attendant a few months later and he said 'It's alright I know you.' Even remembering that is mortifying. I'm good sober thanks.

Are you doing a Program of Recovery for Support and to learn some coping skills and tools?  ..White-knuckling things didn't work well for me... I had to do more than trying to abstain.  I was crazy when I got sober but picked up a 20 year chip in April due to being willing to do a 12-step program to fill my time make friends and wash my toxic brain. ;) 
Well done in not drinking today I'm glad you surfed that urge! Staying on the wagon is easier than getting back on...I too remember the shame of paying with loose change! ..And there are so many other reasons to stay sober for me - I have them written for reference and the big ones burned firmly into my mind in case of emergency.
Well that is mortifying. I know the feeling.  What a wonderful thing you did by coming here instead of buying booze!  You are a winner.
