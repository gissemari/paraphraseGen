Read a post yesterday with great suggestions for getting through the holidays. A lot of people recommended having an exit strategy. My problem is I have family coming in from out of town and staying 3 days. My mom rarely drinks she might have one glass of wine but other family drink daily. I have no alcohol in the house so they are aware to bring their own. I'm ok with this. I bought lots of non alcoholic drinks for me. I'm actually more concerned about when they leave Fri afternoon. I have Friday sat and sun off. Home alone. I'm always stressed after company leaves. My plan really is to stick with my non alcoholic drinks. Hide out in the bathroom if I need to and read/ post here. I have relapsed enough to know I don't want to again. Just have to remember that

You may find staying sober doesn't create the exhaustion you used to have.  
The exit strategy can be as simple as going for a walk.  That's what I did at a party last weekend...took a walk around the block read SD and listened to music :) 
nobody skips drinks and wakes up the next morning wishing they got drunk instead.
