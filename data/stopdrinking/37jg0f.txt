-I meant to write this up yesterday on my first day of not drinking but operating on less than three hours of sleep made anything I wrote incomprehensible. Speaking of which I'm writing this on a long and very bumpy bus ride home so please forgive any grammatical mistakes and enjoy any hilarious typos.-..I'm not entirely sure what to say here but I'm hoping that in saying this to people that I'll actually stop drinking this time and will be a lot more fruitful than making a halfhearted promise to myself. This isn't the first time I've tried to stop drinking. It seems like every half year or so I vow to eliminate or moderate my drinking. The last time was as a New Year's resolution. I started January 2nd and quit January 6th. I've been drinking since I was 19. Before that I was a raging anti-alcohol advocate which is really strange now that I look back because I've always been liberally-minded and nonreligious so I have no clue why I thought that. My friend who'll we will call L introduced me to the hooch. My first night drinking involved ten shots of vodka and hugging a lot of random strangers...For most of the years following I would be best described as a "lush" but in the past few years my drinking has become problematic. I skip out early on social events with people just to be home alone to drink I've made an ass of myself on more than one occasion at parties and work becomes problematic walking in everyday slightly or severely hungover. My life for the past year and change has been wake up work go home drink drink until I've fallen asleep wake up in the middle of the night and finish what I still have left to drink repeat...For the longest time I justified my drinking because of how terrible I thought my life was going. I'm in my mid-20's earmed an MA become somewhat of a legend at my undergrad but I work a job I hate live at home with my parents have no social life have no love life* and I am currently seeking professional help for one or more mental health issues I suspect I have (I hate self diagnosing but I'm worry that I might be clinically depressed or have bipolar disorder). It feels like everyone else except me has at least one thing in their life that's going better for them than I do. So I drank to cope. Or at least I used it as an excuse. But deep down I knew I was acting in bad faith: I didn't drink because life sucks; life sucks because I drink...Notice that little asterisk by "love life" in the last paragraph? It's there because I was in a relationship around this time last year and it was with a man who was one of my missed wake-up calls. I'll call him J. "Why J?" I hear you ask. Is it because he was a jackass? Is it because he was a jerk? Is it because he was a jabroni? The answer dear friends is "yes". The relationship lasted only five months or so. He revealed to me early on that before we met he had gotten a DUI and was about to go through court-ordered treatment meaning he couldn't drink. I didn't think much of it. We all make mistakes and deserve forgiveness and understanding every once in a while. And to be supportive I was going to refrain from drinking too. Soon I found out that he was giving up drinking but only for during those times of the month he was going to get a UA. He broke up with me some time later after pounding down five martinis over dinner and drunkenly stating that he didn't think he could love me...The second missed wake-up call is my dad. He got a DUI on the day I graduated from college. I was in the car with him. This is a bit of a touchy subject for me so I won't go into much detail beyond that...The final wake-up call was almost a near-miss. Remember that friend L I mentioned above? About half a year ago they ended up getting a DUI which in turn forced them to resign their job as a social worker. They did the court-ordered treatment and looked like they were going to do well for a while but then they relapsed...This story however does have a better ending. After not talking with L for a few months because I was drunk all the time or whatever I reconnected with them the other day. They've started attending treatments and meetings and generally appear to be in a much better place now. How do I know this? I logged on to Facebook today and saw that L added a new photo of their AA 1 Month Sober badge...So here I am Day 2 of what I want to be a serious attempt at moderating or otherwise eliminating my drinking and to finally live the life I should be living. No more self-loathing no more false-starts no more empty promises. Why? Because enough is enough and it's time for a change...PS - 1000000 Imaginary Internet Friend Points is you know what my post's title is taken from and you did all on your own WOO!

Nice Owen Hart reference. Sounds like you have made up your mind. You are not alone and welcome to SD. One day at a time just say not today. 
Congratulations! I've found that life is all about showing up for it. You've showed up: great job. 
Welcome. Glad you're here...I have a hard time reconciling your first several paragraphs with the sentence near the end:..&gt;So here I am Day 2 of what I want to be a serious attempt at moderating or otherwise eliminating my drinking..How well has moderation worked for you so far?
