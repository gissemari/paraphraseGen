I have too much time to relapse now. I know it's not the thing to do and it will make me feel like shit be ten times harder. All I can think about is drinking. Just venting. Thanks.

I mean I have a quick plan that I spend very little time thinking about. If I relapse I will get up the next day forgive myself and start over. This is my first time around and I am optimistic about not relapsing but I don't believe it's impossible. If making a plan feels like planning on failure then just plan on staying committed whatever that looks like in the future.
I might look for a new counselor.
If you believe you can never relapse...unpopular opinion...you are wrong.  Anything is possible.  It is weird to think of though.  My sponsor asked me what I would do if I relapsed I said I would die.  He chuckled and said you could do that or you can forgive yourself and try again.  I know that is what I will try and do but I can't say for certain.  One day at a time I can never say I will never drink again just not today.  Food for thought...your counselor might just be making you feel uncomfortable because when we get out of our comfort we grow.  Thinking about it is difficult but when you get an answer you will have grown strong and have another tool...a very important one...an "OH SHIT I FUCKED UP" button.  Something you know to do so you don't die.  Hope this rambling helps in some way.
I think your counselor  is right because she knows  that  people  relapse. Failing to plan is planning to fail. The moderation  thing  is a big cause  of relapse That is a dream we all have..   Congratulations on your success in staying sober.
