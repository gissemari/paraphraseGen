Hi I have never used reddit before. Im looking for some support. I relapsed after staying sober since Feb yesterday and I am devastated. I keep saying I will stop and keep failing. I'm not sure what to do. Will be attending AA meetings but am really struggling. I don't think I can take anymore. Any help would be so appreciated. Thank you S

Welcome to the subreddit and good luck you can do this!..IWNDWYT (I Will Not Drink With You Today)!
I started coming here every day and it made the difference in me getting sober.  AA is a great idea as well.  When I increased my support I increased my success...Best wishes to you! You can do this!
People make mistakes. Don't be too hard on yourself but also learn from mistakes. Think about what made you drink again. Was there a trigger? Perhaps you should avoid going to places with lots of booze or hanging out with people that drink a lot. My friends and family have been extremely supportive. Try to spend more time with someone who can talk to you in your moments of weakness. Don't be scared or embarrassed to talk about your feelings. Quitting drinking is not that easy. But it's possible. Stay strong. IWNDWYT

Welcome! Sobriety is very hard to do alone. Take time to read people's messages and stories here. You will find that we are not that different and get motivated to stay sober.
Something that helps me with the guilt is the idea that yesterday is gone and tomorrow isn't here yet so that leaves only today for me to do anything about. I went through several relapses and each one generated a lot of guilt and felt like little pieces of who I am were chipping away. But then I realized that thinking (and feeling) like that only led me deeper into the relapses and made it harder for me to take hope and grow. I am on day one again today myself. If I view it as just another attempt at sobriety that I'm doomed to fail I'll probably be right. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. I choose not to believe in my past failures but rather take hope in my constant efforts to quit. I am not a bad person because I have relapses I am a good person who is really struggling to be the best version of me that I can.  I need a lot of help to do that more than most but that does not affect my intrinsic worth. I don't have all the answers but I know that quitting quitting is not the solution and that to move on I have to let myself hope and give up guilt.  I hope that you will find some peace soon and feel deep hope from your decision.
You ain't alone IWNDWYT!
Reddit and this sub is the absolute best. I also use the app Stitcher to listen to the podcast Recovery Elevator. Roughly for me what worked: Weeks 1-3 sleep chocolate and sweets weeks 2-5 water rest and patience with myself. Weeks 6/7 socializing and going out connecting with family weeks 8/9/10 exercise and gym time. Good luck you can do this everyone's timeline is different posting here was an excellent first move.

Thank for for sharing I relapsed this past weekend as well with almost a year behind me. The only advice I have is take it one day at a time and forgive yourself I keep going back to the AA prayers. Best of luck.
