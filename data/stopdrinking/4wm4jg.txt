Ugh 87 days.  Relapsed and blacked out. Upset my kids lost all the good faith my wife had in me she said she wished I'd have died last night.  Just to be rid of the drunk in the family.  I have to get this beat I have so much to lose..

Whats the plan? Things sounds quite serious. 
Plan is to go back and get to work no more drinking. I need to find some means to deal with my self hatred that brings peace to my family..
I'm with you man. 87 days was awesome. Still is. You'll get back.
