I deal with chronic pain. I deal with the frustration and struggle that "this is the rest of my life". ..My mother is an alcoholic. I watched her destroy my family...I have a legitimate support system and I still find myself slipping back to alcohol as a coping mechanism...I want this. I want to stop drinking. I want to be bigger than my weakness. ..But christ in a cracker if it isn't one of the hardest things in the world...I have been drinking. I am drinking. I will likely do something stupid and detrimental this evening but my sober head is in a good place...Please help me find my reason. Please help me raise myself from this low...Because I do not want to drink with you today but my body is failing and my will is weak. ..Even typing it out these are terrible excuses but I use them regardless...Help me.

Because you are worth it. ..That is sometimes something that people with alcoholic parents aren't raised to believe about themselves. But it's true. We all are worth it. You're no different. ..Sending big gentle hugs your way. 
Come back when you are not drinking with a clearer mind Be glad to offer up some support.
&gt;I am drinking...As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
