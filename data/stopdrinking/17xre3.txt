My girlfriend is coming home from a 30 day rehab the day before Valentines Day and I'm struggling to come up with really fun ideas (it seems everything I'm able to find in NYC centers around booze).  I live in North Brooklyn... does anyone have any awesome interesting ideas?  I don't live in an apartment where cooking is a realistic possibility and am willing to spend some money if the idea seems worth it.....Help?  :)

Ask her what she wants. After a 30 day program I definitely had strong opinions on what I needed :)..After rehab I did 90 meetings in 90 days. ..How long have you guys been together? What has your relationship been like during rehab?
Were you involved in her rehab as part of her program? 
**If you haven't yet I'd suggest hitting up an AlAnon program some time before she gets out so that you'll be equipped for her decompession stage.  ..**For 2/14 arrange something special for just her (massage manicure spa treatment of some sort).  After being cooped up some personal (nonmedical) attention might be nice...Happy love day
