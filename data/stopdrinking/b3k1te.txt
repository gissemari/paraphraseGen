(skip to the last paragraph if you want the actual "realization")..I am new here been lurking for a little bit. I just started therapy (had two sessions with my current therapist and a few this past fall with a school counselor) and pretty immediately my drinking was obviously an issue to talk about. It's not the worst - 3-5 days a week sometimes only a 2-3 drinks before bed yet sometimes (on weekends) to blackout. I've had no legal trouble or fear of losing my job or relationships yet. But I know I use it to cope with emotions - on a bad day I can think "well at least I'll drink some wine tonight and FINALLY feel good." Or I'll look forward to getting super drunk on Friday at the end of the week. ..The thing is I've been drinking like this for years. Started in college 5 years ago because it was "fun" and exciting and I loved being drunk. Kept going because it was a habit and it was still "fun" and something to look forward to. Then I turned 21 and that was fun because I always looked forward to going to the bar. ..But recently it's been too much. It's honestly not even the hangovers. It's not the drunken mistakes or the nights with fuzzy memories. It's not the time dedicated to drinking. All those things suck but now recently I'm emotionally always a wreck - I have terrible mood swings go from angry to happy to a deep deep depression and I'm always anxious. I barely even have fun drinking anymore and the rest of the time I'm emotionally paying for it. ..This what lead me to the decision to get therapy in an attempt to fix my mental health and curb my drinking. But this past Saturday my therapist told me she thinks I need to quit drinking for a months to see what it's like to live without drinking and look into medication and stuff. I told her that I wasn't "ready." I was honestly terrified at the thought of giving up alcohol and all of the coping I do with it and all of the times I use it to have fun and all of the "fun times" I'll miss...Then the next day after drinking I was (again) hungover and anxious and depressed and feeling dissatisfied with my life and I realized:..Even though drinking isn't currently "ruining" my life I am allowed to prioritize quitting it. I always feel like I am struggling to hold my life together and not let my anxiety consume me as I try to be "better". But if I quit I am allowed to say "fuck it" to those things. If I have to be a shitty friend and ditch my friends because I can't be around alcohol then that's okay. If I have to skip a poetry open mic (I'm trying to go to those more) because it's at a bar or I just don't feel like going then that's okay. If I eat a lot of candy or food to deal with the cravings (I'm always hyper-concerned about my weight) then so be it! If I have to cry and be moody then that's okay. If I spend a whole weekend binge-watching TV instead of being social or productive or "cool" then okay. Taking the weight off of my shoulders for the things that always feel like "too much" while I try to quit is what made me realize that I can be ready now. And in the long run once I'm sober I'll be able to pick up these things full speed and more. Day 4 &amp; IWNDWYT

This resonated with me on a number of levels except i did get in quite a bit of legal trouble with alcohol. I would try to look at the things you are missing out on as opportunities to focus on things you enjoy that don't involve drinking. Then maybe at some point in the future when you are ready you can go do those things without feeling like you have to drink...Take this time to focus on you again. What makes you interesting other than alcohol? Is there an old hobby you want to pick back up? Do you paint? Draw? Read? Build things? Etc. ..Since I've stopped drinking I've gotten back into drawing and painting (have even sold 4 pieces) i built a new dining room table for my house and read more often. I'm improving myself not only by not drinking but also by getting back to things that improve and interest me. Good luck! IWNDWYT
