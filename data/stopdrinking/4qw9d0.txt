today was another baby step forward even in the midst of cravings. really another miracle that i didn't pick up. some day i'd like to be at the point that i don't even have to think about it because it has no place in my life. does that ever happen? (not unaware not auto pilot just don't feel the craving need whatever to drink and its not a big huge struggle to not drink; that sobriety becomes second nature.

Congrats on getting through another day!..With time my urges waned in both frequency and intensity. Over the first few months I adjusted to living sober. At four months I decided sober is how I want and need to remain in order to prioritize the things in my life that matter. From that time I've identified as a non-drinker; and not drinking seemed way easier. Increasingly being sober became my new normal there is no place in my life for alcohol and my asshole inner alcoholic voice is easily dispatched now if there's so much as a transient whimper from him...I know that alcohol is my prison and that not drinking is my freedom. A lot of my old associations have been broken and replaced with new ones. I've unpicked a lot of my previous irrational thinking and replaced it with rational thinking. Not drinking is now the only sensible and rational choice for me.
In my experience it is rare that I really struggle with Cravings. It's kind of a non-issue. I'm not a drinker so drinking doesn't really come into my mind very often. But I do get Cravings maybe once every few months. I find myself able to deal with them better because I have developed tools in sobriety.
