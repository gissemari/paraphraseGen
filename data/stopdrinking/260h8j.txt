Today marks my 11th day sober. This may not seem significant given the number of people on here who have so much more time than I do but for me it's a milestone - it's one day longer than I had before my first relapse...Unfortunately I've not been able to get to a meeting for five days because I've been travelling but I've been reading this sub every day as a substitute. Tomorrow I leave for the summer to work in a new city and live in unfamiliar circumstances. Needless to say I'm a little nervous about my sobriety. But I'm hopeful that as long as I get to as many meetings as I can read here daily and continue to practice prayer and mindfulness I will stay sober...There's a phrase I like to trot out in my head that has helped me quash any fantasies of 'moderate' drinking: "I can do anything I want in life - *so long as I'm not drinking*. I truly believe this to be the case and that's why I need to stay sober. Cheers.

12 is a good number too! Congrats. And if your new city is Los Angeles PM me. 
It seems pretty significant to me. I don't know how many years it had been since I had gone 11 days without drinking when I was at 11 days. This isn't a contest! I'm not twice as sober as someone who quit 1.25 years after me.
Congrats /u/CollegeDrinker and 12 days sober after too long drunk is a hell of a good start.
Congrats!  I promise you it only gets easier the more days you get behind you.
Congrats on your new record!  All of us here understand the hard work that has gone into your 11 days.  Keep going!  Your phrase reminds me of the saying "you can have alcohol or you can have everything else".  Very true in my case.  Let us know how you are doing in your travels.  Stay strong and good things will happen.
