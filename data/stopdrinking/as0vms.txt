I'm polyamorous. I've mentioned in other posts but that's what this post is about. I have a boyfriend of eight years and a girlfriend of two years. They get along well and we spend time together at my house and hers. ..Part of the reason I wanted to get sober was to be more attentive to my partners. My girlfriend is going through a lot right now: selling her farm difficult roommates mom health scare last year finding new housing and a job and generally being stressed by major life upheaval. My boyfriend is looking for new work and is currently working 50+ hour weeks at a job he struggles to enjoy...I'm ten days sober today and amazed at my ability to be not only mentally and physically present for my partners but also what I've been able to accomplish for them and myself in my generous alone time...I cook three meals a day. My house is clean. I wake up early to make sure my boyfriend is up. I pack him lunches. I drive to my girlfriend's farm to care for her animals while she's visiting family. I shovel snow. Wipe down cars and start them before we head anywhere. I work on job apps for my partners and help them keep on top of their calendars while they go through some stressful times. ..I feel like a good partner. The sense of pride I've gained from being honest about my struggles and being kind to myself and by extension them is so profound and motivating. ..I'm catching myself actually excited about the future! My girlfriend will be back tomorrow and I plan to pick her up from the airport with bbq for dinner host a dinner party the next evening (sans alcohol) and start saving to join her in Argentina for a series of surgeries she will need in the fall/winter. ..Sobriety-despite the cravings and boredom and headaches and facing all the anxiety and depression-is amazing and so fulfilling &lt;3
