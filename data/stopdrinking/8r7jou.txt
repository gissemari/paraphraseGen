I always knew a big part of me drinking so much in the first place came from bordom. I have a decent job at one of the best companies you can work for in the small area I live in and I'm not struggling to make it by or anything. I've never done anything exciting with my life I get really bad anxiety when it comes to going out and experiencing thing but when I just sit in my room even if I'm doing something productive like I recently started teaching myself how to write script on the computer I still feel like I am just wasting my life away and like I'm just killing time in between days. I know I could try and take out a student loan and go back to college (I flunked out when I was 18) or something but its like I dont know what to do that I could find fullfilling. Alcohol did a really good job of making sure I didnt think about things like that and holding me back and now that I cant stop thinking about this stuff it gets kind of overwhelming.
