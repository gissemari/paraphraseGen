It's awesome!..Struggle: A bit of fear around career options but that's a good problem to have in my eyes...General chat: back home tomorrow!..Have a great 24 hours folks!..PS apologies for the late post in a different timezone today.
----------immediate responses--------

3rd day sobriety nearly over and confident it's going to end that way!..Have also given up caffeine too so they've been very sober days indeed! (aside from the chocolate and cheese binging lol)..Also decaf coffee doesn't taste too bad!
Happy vacation NMBP!..**Triumph**: I completed my Level 1 Krav Maga test.  I don't know if I passed yet.  My panic level rises with each moment that I don't hear the results!..**Struggle**: Panic!..**General Chat**: PANIC!..Edit: I passed!
Triumph: Made it through a week with relatives here and going to a wedding that was a huge party and the tiny voices that say "just one" were very quiet and disappeared oh so quickly!..Struggle: My job is busy this time of year and dealing with customers gets more difficult all the time. I'm so sick of being nice somedays it makes me wanna puke!..General Chat: Love this sub and all the crazy people like me here you've helped me soooooooooooo much! 260 days and going strong..
Triumph: day 3 no booze...Struggle Rough withdrawal. Puking s couple times a day. Keeping my fluid up. Also trying to deal with the thought of stopping foreverjust going a day at a time at the moment....General chat? Been watching some breaking bad which is pretty great.
Triumph: I deadlifted 215lbs and am buying my powerlifting singlet this week for competition. So. Excited...Struggle: In a bit of a pickle about choosing bridesmaids. First world lucky problems...General chat: Seahawks are going to win the Super Bowl.

Triumph: getting through a nasty patch of bullshit at work with some great anger but minimal tantrums. ..Struggle: remembering to breathe. Breathe. ...General chat: second week of spring and that means rain.  I have a date! 
Triumph: went on a business trip and didn't drink..Struggle: went on a business trip with folks that were drinking..General chat: I don't even want a drink.  I'm looking forward to this weekend where I can kick some ass and take some more names.  Adventure mode is turned all the way up to 11.  
Triumph:  If I make it through the night I'll have 5 months sober tomorrow!  ..Struggle:  School is insanely busy right now.  Next three days are completely jam-packed with work to do.  ALSO I cut my finger pretty badly washing dishes the other day which leads into.....General chat:  Lately been spending my free time playing disc golf with friends.  But my finger is jacked up and my game is kinda jacked up now too.  Ouch.
So....one can vacation without drinking?!?! Is that even legal?!?!  ..Triumph: may I say that I am kicking ass and taking names at work.  Just NAILING it right now.  ..Struggle: all this kicking ass has left me with a lot less quiet free time than usual.  I mean a lot less.  I don't like it and am working to readjust my schedule back from "extra difficult" mode to "normal" mode.  The thing is I don't know how to play on normal mode while sober.  I was like "I'm sober!  I have time for xyz!" but I really miss laying around doing nothing.  I think I need to build time in for that. Esp on the weekends.  And give myself permission to do that sober.  ..General: I love autumn in my adopted hometown.  
Triumph: not losing my temper during a really rough night at work.  This would have been a night to tie one on but instead I'm relaxing at home sober.  Letting go of stress has become easier than obliterating it with alcohol...Struggle: depression as usual.  Hasn't been so bad lately though...Edit: fixed a typo.
