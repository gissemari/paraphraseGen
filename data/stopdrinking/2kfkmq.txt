I made an effort this weekend to not drink because I have been struggling with a rather mentally straining decision to make about my job. To be honest I deal with a lot ups and downs in terms of depression and this weekend I almost lost it. I am really glad that I wasn't drinking because it could have been bad for my mental health...I started drinking heavily off and on at 21 in order to "cope" with life. It  has been an easy escape but the consequences are never worth it. I end up learning how to get through the day so I can go home and "forget my troubles" but I end up forgetting how good it can feel to get a solid nights rest how much clearer minded I am and how much healthier I feel...I need to break away from drinking. I need to seek help for my depression and I need to clean up my life. So yeah I am looking through the front page and I see you guys on it and remembered that I am subscribed; it is time for me to stopdrinking.

Welcome...Have you thought about attending an AA meeting or getting some therapy? I couldn't stay quit without help. My mind was a ghetto.
I suffer from depression as well even before I ever drank though the alcohol definitely intensified it. Once I was sober for about 3 or 4 months I managed to get the energy to finally seek therapy. It has done wonders for me and I can't recommend it enough. I was worried about cost and time and whether or not it would work but it really all worked out. I found an amazing therapist who does my sessions for free and is really flexible with my schedule. My only regret is not seeking help sooner. You can do this!!
