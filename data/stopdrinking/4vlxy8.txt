I have no idea where this came from but gosh I have been so insanely depressed lately. Then again who am I kidding it makes sense. I am part of an IOP after care therapy group and I had stopped going for a month. Then I popped back in last week and didn't know half the people there and it felt weird....So now I am feeling extremely disconnected from everything. I was going to individual therapy as well but due to my new job where I am working the 3rd shift that got hard to schedule right so I stopped. But I am finding without that gosh I feel like no one cares about me at all. I had a very close friendship with my therapist and it hurts not having her in my life anymore. ..So I'm going to schedule an individual tomorrow no matter what. I'll keep going to aftercare whatever. It's better than stocking up for Naltrexone (this is a relapse plan habit) I normally keep refilling the prescription anyways because I like having it just in case but I can tell my thinking is scary lately...I've been going to the dark places of the internet. The webcam sites where people drink again. And it might sound weird but that is my deepest trigger. I don't want to drink. But I really am an overthinker and I can tell by analyzing my behaviors I am really really really not in a good place...God I hate this fucking stupid disease. And it's not  alcoholism that does this. It's me. I'm broken. I'm so depressed and have to self medicate with so much shit otherwise I go back to that stupid drug. I feel like it's pathetic but whatever I guess I'm pathetic.

You are not pathetic. You are a human being with a problem. It also sounds like you've come pretty far in your recovery in that you can now recognize the signs of an impending relapse. And that's pretty awesome...Take the steps that you need to. Keep getting healthier! Follow up on your plan. Sending out an internet hug to you!
I was there yesterday....and according to my husband I have been in a dark and twisty place for at least 3 weeks.  Or as he put it "been pmsing all month". It's hard as heel to shake depression when it has a grip on you.  My therapist switched me from weekly to every three weeks  is not going well. Any way you aren't alone in the darkness I'm in the boat with you  just remember it gets better - I know it's hard when you have fallen into the rabbit hole but (being cheesy here) "happiness can be found even in the darkest of times. If one only remembers to turn on the light". If nothing else  let SD be your light.
