I'm sorry to sound a bit moany -I know I'm having a relatively easy time of it compared to lots of you out there I'm just feeling a bit crap...It's day 11 for me and up until yesterday I was doing quite well. I've joined a gym started doing yoga and meditation. I've also managed to organise things that I was just ignoring when I was drinking like booking a dentist appointment...Suddenly yesterday though I got a headache which hasn't shifted and I'm feeling really flu like. Because I can't stay busy and go to the gym I've just started going over and over all the stupid things I've done when I was drinking and the people I've hurt. I'm trying to distract myself with films but my mind just slips back to all these events that I haven't thought about for years. It's like now that my brain is clear all these memories are just floating up and demanding to be recognised. ..I get that this is quite common and that it's better than continuing the destructive behaviour of when I was drinking... I just feel ashamed and it hurts and a big part of me wants that comfortable numb feeling back. I WNDWYT but I just feel rather pants.

Would it help to write that stuff down what you did how you felt about it and then maybe write down what you learned from it ways you've improved since then or even just writing "I'm sorry for _____" to the people you hurt? You can then rip up or burn the papers and see if that helps to let things go? 
You are doing great. Part of recovery for me is learning to "sit with" my feelings instead of running to numb them. I had a similar experience during childbirth. My daughters head came out and then the contraction ended. It hurt so badly. I was wild with pain and confusion. Luckily my doula said just sit with the pain. It is okay. And sure enough the next surge came and my baby was born. What's the BEST that can happen? And btw. Write down your offenses if you can bear it - you can refer to them if you feel like "just one" drink sounds like a good idea in future!
