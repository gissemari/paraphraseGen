I worked last night until past midnight then I went to bed. At 3 am I was woken by sirens that arrived a couple of doors down from our place and couldn't get back to sleep. Apparently I Didn't realize this until I actually left for work and saw the cops coroners truck and police tape etc. Our neighbor's friend OD'd and passed in his arms....So sad and so young too. Just kids really. I was at least able to offer a hug and some support. So many (of us) struggle (sometimes for years) and some of us are able to break free from the prison of addiction. It's hard. It continues to be hard. But each day not quite as hard as the last. Sadly some don't make it...and sometimes I fell like "Shit *I* don't know if I'm going to make it through the day" because I'm so beat down from life especially work and even from family. In fact I am in real need of Divine Intervention because I am so overwhelmed with the stress from work. But I can't flake out. People - kids - need me to *be there* and be real *and* be present....work will happen tomorrow. It won't be great in fact it'll be a crazy mess but it'll happen. Oh well...For now I am just going to go to bed and pray for our neighbor who is grieving deeply for his loss. I hope he makes it. I told him to reach out if he needs to talk. It's not a lot; that's all I know to do......*And* keep putting one foot in front of the other. That's all...Love you guys. Thanks for listening...

It's awesome that you were able to give support to someone...What's going on with your job? I hope you have an excellent day. 
Tough. I have no doubt that you would not have been able to handle this situation as well if you were not sober; so you should be proud you can feel and give solid support and it was not compromised by alcohol. People can feel your stability and compassion and will appreciate it. I hope your neighbour gets through this.
Congratulations on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation!..Awesome that you can reach out.  You may never know what ripples that hug may create!..Would be great to share your story with u/Lee_in_NY for Monday's AOK !
