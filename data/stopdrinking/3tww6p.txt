My AA sponsor taught me this one...A common reason people relapse is because of a negative self image. Someone seeing themselves as worthless will just say "fuck it" after a while and get wasted. This is something we can learn to combat...Start be looking in the mirror and saying "I love you". It'll take practice to get to doing it without laughing flinching or not taking it seriously. Do that in concert with seeking the things that make you happy...It's taken me years to get to even attempting the mirror. Finding the activities that make me happy was easier. But now I can cleanly admit to the mirror that I love myself...Try it! Nothing to lose!

Stuart Smalley therapy. It actually works!
This sounds...really hard to be honest.  
I totally agree! Self love made me feel valuable enough to stay sober.
this is great :) thank you!..in the same vein - I keep [these cards] (http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Peace-Cards-Wayne-Dyer/dp/1561707864) on my nightstand and read a few before before sleep and a few more right when I wake up. a couple of them reference God (I'm not religious) but I take those with a grain of salt. the message is still good...loving yourself is the greatest revolution. &lt;3
