Hello! I am currently in drug/alcohol recovery and have been sober for about 3 months. I had 4-years but ended up relapsing for about a year going in and out of the rooms. ..Recently I have started taking stimulants (amphetamines) for my major depression and other outside issues. So far it has really helped and I feel much better on the whole. ..I am a little worried because I do have such an addictive tendency that this will lead me back to alcohol and other drugs(my big thing was downers uppers really havent been an issue). I am looking for anyone who has experience with stimulants and recovery. Please refrain from giving your opinion if you do not have experience yourself with the issue Thanks!

Was it just an omission that you did not mention "diagnosed" with your depression or  "prescribed" with the amphetamines? I don't know of many psych docs that would prescribe uppers for anyone with even a hint of addiction history.
