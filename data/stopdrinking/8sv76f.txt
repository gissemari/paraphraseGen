I'm going out of town next week to visit family. A family of drinkers who associate me with heavy drinking as well. Very nervous about relapsing when I'm around them. Any tips to help me cope/say no if they offer?

If you have to make the trip you could always say you're on an antibiotic or something? That's a good temporary excuse. I had to avoid my family for the first few months; being around heavy drinkers as they all are was not the place for me.
First of all congrats on your 11 days! ..I had a a similar situation during Memorial Day weekend when I went back to my home state for a wedding and I'm still super proud of myself for exercising self control. It made me feel invincible and now I'm not even worried about the number of days sober. ..Here is what helped: .- have an answer for why you're not drinking (antibiotics dieting if you're a woman  im trying to conceive  a  30 day challenge  you joined with a  friend  etc). Or just be honest and say you and alcohol had a breakup. .- telling my friends was actually super helpful and less daunting than I anticipated. I definitely underestimated them. .- I had drinks in mind that I wanted to order before going to the restaurant/bars. Non alcoholic of course .- logged into this site every moment I could*** .- accountability partner you talk to daily- my husband stayed home but I called him and told him I succeeded each day  (spouse/friend/ sponsor/parent.)...Overcoming that holiday weekend seriously helped me realize this is totally doable. Just break up each day and each hour as small obstacles you can easily overcome. It'll please your brain to know you can still to your own problem promises...IWNDWYT
