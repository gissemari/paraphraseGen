*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*...**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens   good or bad   and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!...**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up....**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning....**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..Good morning fellow sobernauts! I hope everyone's doing well and surviving the holiday madness...One thing I'm not missing is the morning routine that always used to plague me at this alcohol-soaked time of year. I would always wake in the mornings and struggle to ease myself into the day ...Feeling dreadful from the day before I'd be focused on when I could reasonably kick off with the first drink of the day (preferably as early as possible) so that I could  enjoy' a  hair of the dog' and get onto that crazy merry-go-round all over again...Being Christmas of course the excuses to drink were ever-present which only exacerbated the situation. In short: It was a constant battle and a living nightmare...I don't miss that at all. This year I'm up early and I've started preparing the first of three curries I'm cooking for Christmas Day (our family abandoned the traditional turkey a few years ago). My mind is clear and I'm focused on the day ahead. I feel great...I don't miss the  alcohol merry-go-round' at all. I hope you don't either. This holiday season let's focus on getting off the merry-go-round. Once we're out of that cycle the possibilities that open up before us are tremendous...So here goes my daily pledge: **I will not drink with you today!** Good luck everyone have a great Monday!..Merry Christmas / Happy Holidays [Delete as appropriate!]

Happy Christmas Eve Murphy I will not drink with you today!
Morning. Party tonight in the hotel but IWNDWYT stay strong everyone. 
Good morning. I wish everyone all the best these days. For those who are struggling (with nor drinking or/and with life itself) I hope you can find some light if your days seem dark. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!! Last Christmas Eve I was so worried about being at the liquor store before they closed will I run out of alcohol...this year screw that. I'll be a clear headed hangover free awesome dad and husband tomorrow morning 
I will not drink with you today!
Good morning everyone!..Still here still sober. Today Christmas starts for real so I can start to dig into the mocktails that I bought and eat all the snacks (relatively) guilt free!..My parents asked if I was still off the drink last night and seemed pleasantly surprised when I said yes. Now I think about it I guess I am too!..Onwards - I Will Not Drink With You Today!
Good Morning happy cooking and IWNDWYT
Just need to get through the next 2 hours of work then I'm free until the new year! And I won't waste the time by drinking myself into a stupor and making a fool of myself. Iwndwyt   
Good morning to everyone.  So far I've surviving the Christmas drinking fest although my siblings haven't arrived yet which be the real test.  ..Im also enjoying clear headed mornings and lots of hiking in beautiful English countryside.  This afternoon is present wrapping - definitely without drinks.  
Good morning SD. Wishing you all a super sober Xmas Eve. Thanks u/mrmurphyltd for getting your fellow sobernauts into the festive spirit. Sending you all a big hug. IWNDWYT    Katherine aka Divvydend xx
Not drinking today.
Checking in on Xmas eve I plan on watching that merry go round spin from a safe distance with a soft drink in hand  . I will not drink today. Good luck everyone.
Day 2. I will not drink with you today.
Enjoy the curries!..Not getting back on the merry-go-round today. It's a miserable ride for me no matter how fun I think it's going to be this time..IWNDWYT..
I will not drink with you today
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!..I've just finished getting all my foods ready for tomorrow bring on Boxing Day!

I will not drink today December 24 2018. 
Day six.  I will not drink with you today.
No booze today!
not drinking today
I hope everyone has a blessed day. Treat others as you'd like to be treated. Every journey begins with a first step. The hardest part of anything is starting. Treat everyday as your last as well as your first. There's always something to learn and gain. IWNDWYT
Thanks mrmurphy &amp; Excellent morning friends. I am so glad to be out of the madness. It is allowing me to see the true spirit of Christmas. I can live love and be me. Neil Eskelinn said..."At this time of the year we need to remind ourselves that what we give from deep within has a much greater worth than what we give from our wallets. Some attempt to impress others with their contributions but the real acts of kindness are when we give our time our talents and gifts that are a reflection of our hearts." I am grateful today to have been gifted the greatest gift of all...a second chance. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Merry Christmas Eve Everyone. Murph the curries sounds awesome turkey to me has seen its better days my wife and I arre doing lazagna this year which I am looking forward to. Well today starts my first day back to work after 3 weeks post surgery a little excited and nervous at the same time. The hardest part will be remembering that I am not fully healed and will need to back way off from my kitchen duties and stay in the office. ..So grateful to be here sober and free of the bondage that alcohol had over me a year ago. This kind of freedom is priceless and the best gift you could ever give to yourself. Peace and Joy my fellow travelers. 
I will not drink today.
No drinking here
Christmas Eve greetings to you all my friends. I am a little nervous today. My first sober christmas eve in forever and hosting a party tonight. So I am bringing all of you with me  and have stocked up with lots of sparkling water and minerals. Give me strength. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today!
Last Christmas Eve I went to the pub with two friends got upset because I thought one of them was belittling me (they weren't) and cried and had a hangover the next morning. Not tonight!! I will not drink with you this Christmas Eve no matter how much I want to later on. 
This will be my first Christmas Eve without alcohol in the last ten or so years. IWNDWYT! C'mon little badge number that could!
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you all today!
Happy Holidays and I will not drink with you today...What a roller coaster yesterday from extreme anxiety to extreme anger for no real reasons. I guess that's either how life is without alcohol or I am still having some hormonal adjustments after not drinking for some time.
IWNDWYT 
I'm not drinking today!
I will not drink today
I will not be drinking today! Best wishes for everyone in this subreddit!
IWNDWYT! 3!
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
Whenever I romanticise about the holiday's liquor pleasures I think about how fast that halo would fade (15-30 mins) and how they would impair me (just as impaired as every day Miss Sophie). I will not drink with you today!
Good morning SD! I will not drink with you today. Checking in!
Merry Christmas Eve! IWNDWYT
Went to a lovely party last night. So rewarding to see and interact with people I like.  Wine is/was my shield. Nice to have put it down. I wish everybody here some inner peace maybe even just a glimpse of it in this confusing season.  IWNDWYT
It is so much easier (and more fun!) to wrap presents and play Santa when you're not drunk or hungover...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
Iwndwy this Christmas eve or Christmas day. 
More than anything else I'm looking forward to seeing the joy and excitement on my older niece's face tonight. She is almost three (2 years 10 months) and for her this is the first Christmas she'll actually understand!..How awful if she would have to wonder "why is Auntie being so loud and acting so strangely"? The very thought breaks my heart...I got her the "almost the kind of" of My Little Pony she was wishing for (LOL) but hopefully my being fully present will be an even more important gift...Happy Holidays to all of you my SD family!
Yesterday was the toughest to get through sober so far and today should be more of the same. But I did not give in yesterday and I will not drink with you today. I hope you have a good Christmas  Eve and enjoy the curries.  
3 weeks sober today! It's hard being in Italy where wine is drunk like water but... I will not drink today.  Wishing everyone on here a wonderful sober next few days.  
Ciao from the Irish Chick in the Mediterranean Sea.. just taking a cruise as you do on the way to Italy!! ..Have a great sober Christmas Eve Beautiful People..IWNDWYT
Day 13- this will be my first sober Christmas Eve (and first sober and not hung over Christmas tomorrow) in... ever.    I will not drink today.
Happy Christmas Eve all!..I'm so grateful to be sober with you today! My wild little 6 year old is in the children's choir at mass today and the entire even has been a massive source of anxiety but I WILL NOT let my lizard brain convince me that drinking will help because it will not. ..Here's hoping today is a day full of joy and absent of any pressuring friends or family members.   IWNDWYT!
I am working all day today but have a family xmas get-together tonight where we eat good food and all the cousins exchange gifts. Everyone will be drinking but I will be drinking drinks without alcohol in them only. The past 6 weeks have been pretty awful (overworked and one of my dogs died a few weeks ago) but I've powered through it all. If I haven't had a drink after working 14 hours nearly every day lately I won't drink with you all tonight. PEACE.
Wow. Christmas Eve already. I'm sitting in the parking lot outside of my early morning meeting about to head in. I don't usually come on my days off but I think it's a good idea due to the stresses of the holiday today and tomorrow. ..My husband and I are going to my family's Christmas get together this evening. Typically we'd leave early and go home to drink a lot. Not tonight. We may still leave early but it'll be to go home and relax together. ..I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today. 
Making the pledge!  Praying I stick to it.  I will!!!!!!  
I will not drink with you today!
Gah. Phones are a horrid way to use the internet. Really should have brought my laptop.....I will not drink today. With a sober mind and body I will be able to help Mom with a bunch of stuff around the house that Dad had always previously done. 
Merry Christmas and I won't drink with you today.  Keepin it real.
What do you call an alcoholic that got shot glasses for Christmas?..OminousAlpaca..Ba dum tss..iwndwyt   
Good morning. Family dinner tonight and I haven't been more tempted to drink since I stopped. This is where the real work starts. Thank you to this sub and to this post. IWNDWYT 
This is the first Christmas of my adult life (outside of 3 where I was pregnant) that I will be sober for. I cannot wait to wrap presents with my husband tonight and put them under the tree and REMEMBER it in the morning. To wake up and need coffee because my kids are so excited but also be able to be present because I'm not hungover. Thank you SD. Merry Christmas.  
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today!
Great post Mr Murphy. Strongly relate...I wouldn't say I was dreading Xmas with my wife's family but I thought it would be hard. As it turns out we're having a lovely few days the kids are so happy to be with their cousins and everyone is on good form. But the real surprise is how me not drinking does not feel a big deal for me and so it doesn't seem to be for everyone else. Sure they're all getting right into the drinks but it's not the focus...For the past couple of nights we've sat around playing cards and board games. Not only have I enjoyed it not only have I actually wanted to stay up I've even been laughing big belly laughs with tears running down my cheeks. Sober! I never thought it would be possible...A little Christmas miracle! I wish my fellow travellers well this Xmas eve. Thanks for being here. IWNDWYT 
Happy holidays SD. I'm not drinking today 
Holiday anxiety alert!  Boop boop boop..At times like this I try to remember that it's ok that life is not a Norman Rockwell print but life is pretty freaking good in any case.  ..Wishing everyone a happy Christmas Eve!
Merry Christmas Eve everyone! I am treasuring a hangover free Christmas this year. It's low key sane and sober. 
IWNDWYT.
This will be my third Christmas Eve sober in 22 years and my first since 2013. I too am getting an early start on dinner after making pancakes and coffee for my partner this morning and driving her to work. The liquor store closes this afternoon for a few days and it's so wonderful to not be worrying about how much stock I will need to stay drunk until it opens again. To a life where anything is possible! IWNDWYT!
Instead of waking up and starting to drink with breakfast I'm waking up and heading to a meeting. IWNDWYT
Good morning SD!  ..We also have abandoned the traditional Christmas fare.  Now we make a big pot of jambalaya and a loaf of crusty bread.  I can't wait for it!..No drinking today for this  **=\^.\_.\^=  ** ..Light and love to all my fellow sobernauts!..&amp;#x200B;
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
Happy Christmas Eve!   I won't be drinking today!..The in-laws will be coming over for dinner.  My husband and I are cooking what has become our traditional Eve meal - filet green bean almandine scalloped potatoes and for dessert carrot cake with cream cheese frosting!..My father in law almost never drinks so we are stocked up on his drink of choice - Diet Coke.  My brother in law only drinks on Saturday and holidays but binge drinks on those days so he is bringing his own craft beers with him.  My husband will likely have a glass or two of wine with dinner and I will be enjoying my second sober Christmas feeling thankful for the positive changes I have been able to make in my life..
I will not drink today!   
IWNDWYT 
I'm excited to start making health and sobriety the main priority again. Been lacking a little bit. I will not drink with you today.  
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. 
Christmas Eve and I have been saving for a long time to give myself a present I dreamed about for years and years....500 days sober.. I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
won't drink today
Merry Christmas Even everyone. IWNDWYT
Good morning and happy Christmas Eve day. I am at my in-laws and the big to-do is today. I've had a few days of practicing not drinking here and I can confidently say I will not drink with you today. Have a wonderful day everybody!
Blessings to all. I will not drink today. Day7
Merry Christmas Eve! IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! Happy Christmas Eve! 
Merry Xmas. Working my way to 150 days. Almost there. Also celebrating 100 days sober from marijuana today. Hasn't been easy but thanks to this sub and some professional help as well I have stayed the course. Sober life is good. Trying to be very thankful for waking up in the morning without a hangover and anxiety. It's easy to start taking that for granted. 
Staying with the in-laws which is stressful in itself and of course drinks are flowing...this is so hard but I'm determined to stay strong IWNDWYT take care everyone xxx
Gonna spend the afternoon being beaten to a pulp by a very excited four year old! IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today 
I will not drink with you today. The holidays will be a lot more fun without it!
Enter and exit Christmas No. 2 no alcohol...Past Christmas eves included getting shitfaced until 4 am Christmas Day and being hungover all day. ..
I will not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking today
I will not drink today.
Great opening post. By now (6:30 AM always have been an early riser) would be 2-3 drinks deep Holiday spirit indeed. Instead while not exactly bright eyed and ready to conquer the world at least in a decent reflective mood- instead of being lost in a storm.
First Christmas Eve in a long time I will be sober and present for my family. Already got up early to make a huge breakfast for everyone. I am not drinking today! 
I won't drink with you today!..Happy holidays!    
I was the first one up this morning at my wonderful MIL's home in VA! I am ready to go out for my morning walk &amp; this afternoon the whole family is going on a hike on some nearby trails. I will have a healthy fun and SOBER day today. There will be no regrets no reason to apologize for anything I say or do. I can just be me. Sober Christmasy happy me. MIL and I are gonna hit the local mall one last time too!
Not today. 
Good morning! I find the merry-go-round metaphor quite apt. It's something that's supposed to be fun and supposed to be experienced on rare occasions but somehow us alkies get stuck on a permanent out of control merry-go-round ride. Just as if you're stuck on a ride that spins you're sick a lot and you struggle to think clearly and to manage your life. ..Well I've had a good holiday weekend so far. My office is closed today but I might go in (but might not). I should go in . . . but I'd rather stay home. I made up boxes of chocolate mint pinwheels to distribute to my neighbors today. Last year (in my old house) I was nervous and drunk when distributing them (will they smell it on my breath?). This year for one thing I'm dragging gregarious BF to go around with me and also I've learned that no at this point in my life drunkenness does not give me confidence. And god help me I might log on to FB to see what friends in other states are doing. Again that's a maybe. ..Merry Christmas Eve my friends! I will not drink with you today!
Enjoy your Christmas curries Mr Murphy! IWNDWYT
Haven't done a check in here in a long time.  Not drinking today with all of you.  
IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink with you fine people today or this Christmas 
I survived the first evening of friends and family drinking. I was happy to find that it didn't bother me at all. I was up early this morning  made waffles and sausage for the crowd.  I am happier this way. Life is more organized as it used to be. Wishing everyone a "Merry" whatever you are celebrating. I choose to not drink so IWNDWYTD 
I will not drink today.
Thanks for hosting Christopher! The curries sounds like a lovely Christmas Even project :) I just spent Christmas Eve hand sewing Kiddo a Santa sack because we cannot find the Christmas stocking I sewed her when we had our first Christmas down here. Such a calm way to spend the evening after our book gifts exchange and cheese fest [and turkey sandwiches for supper] and she was really happy with the fabrics I found and what she saw of it half-completed before she finally headed off to bed. Such a contrast to last year [and the couple of Xmas Eves prior] when I would be pretty blotto and totally feeling like a truly crap parent. I am not someone who sews often but I was reminded of how much I do enjoy *making* things. Looking forward to waking up not hungover and really being present tomorrow. No booze today no booze tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either..
iwndwyt
I'm not drinking with you today. Day 6.
I will not drink with you today! Today is the biggest test for me this holiday season Christmas dinner at the in laws.  My mother in law is a very strict no nonsense person so when I decline a drink like I have at other times she will say  why what's up?  This time I am going to say I actually don't drink alcohol anymore it's just not for me.  And I don't even care how uncomfortable it is  once they know for good then it will just be the norm in years to come and get easier and easier.   Merry Christmas Eve everybody!!
Not today.
Getting through my first week of sobriety is the best Christmas present I could wish for..IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. 
IWNDWYT!!!
Not gonna drink today. 
Checking in from the future. Tuesday here already.... MERRY CHRISTMAS!...IWNDWYT
I'm ill today and I'm always Santa at the family gathering. There's no way I'm drinking today. Merry Christmas    
I won't drink today!
IWNDWYT  
5th morning in a row I woke up feeling hopeful. I want more mornings like this!!! IWNDWYT 
I won't be drinking today. Much love to you all on what can sometimes be a tough Christmas Eve!
Count me in...Happy Christmas to All 
Today I'm not drinking no matter how much anyone annoys me!!
My wife and I use to enjoy a Bailey's and coffee in the mornings over the holidays.By this time last year it wasn't A Bailey's.It was at least 3.It was 3 double plus shots in my coffee.So 6 to 8 ounces by 9 am.I felt like crap by 10.Then struggle to noon and start in on other "real" booze. What an awful way to celebrate a holiday.No thanks.I will not drink with you today.
Wishing everyone a memorable and clear headed Christmas (if you celebrate). Should be easy without the booze. I know I for one will not be drinking. I no longer feel like I'm missing out on something either. Gonna be a great day. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with y'all today!   
Today is especially hard because it's a reminder about how I blacked out last year and still don't even remember my Christmas Eve but this year I won't be drinking so it won't be an issue! I will not drink with you today! 
Beautiful sober Christmas Eve! Iwndwyt SD!
IWNDWYT ...Peace to all
I won't drink with you all today. Merry Christmas 
Yesterday evening was quite the roller coaster. Kept me up for awhile just thinking back on the past year and all the changes/sacrifices and how in the end I'm doing the right thing as tough as it can be at times. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today.   
I will not drink today!.
IWNDWYT
My first long haul flight with no alcohol. Going to sleep right through i hope IWNDWYT
Stay strong everyone!! I for one have been having some cravings. I just think back to how miserable I was last year at this time and it helps put it all back into perspective. Hope everyone has a safe and sober holiday!!!
Happy Sober Christmas Eve!
Day one. I'm hoping this will be the best Christmas give I could ever receive - sobriety. Here's to it. IWNDWYT. 
In will be hard.
Good morning. I will not drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
Not drinking today!
IWNDWYT. My Christmas present to myself! 
How's it only just now Christmas Eve? I'm already sick of being at home is it time to go back to work yet? Gonna get some writing done grocery shop avoid some toxic family members and not use my stir-craziness as an excuse to hit the bar. IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today!   
Today is another day that I will not drink with you.
It's been a long time just wanted to bop in and not drink with everyone today.
Thank you for hosting our Christmas   mrmurphy!!!  I won't be drinking with you guys today cheers with hot coffee cocoa everybody.   
Christmas Eve plans meet up with mate for food exchange gifts home to finish The West on Netflix and play some RDR Online...YEAAAH! IWNFDWYT!
I'm giving it up today. I'm sick and have had too many health concerns recently. I'm sobering up in bed and the whole time I was drinking I was wishing I was just peacefully recovering from my sickness instead. I didn't enjoy this night any better because of alcohol.
My family is doing gifts tonight instead of tomorrow. For the past few years it's been an occasion where we all sit around the tree get boozed up and make stupid jokes and wake up hungover. Not tonight! No wine for me thanks mom no whiskey either thanks dad. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
I have a cold and I still feel 1000x better than the day after drinking. Keeps me going. Listening to the Naked Mind on way back to house today from Bros. I think ill be good today. 
I will not drink with you all today!.
I will not drink with you today  
Sending love and light to all today.  .. I am attending the in-laws family gatherings tonight &amp; tomorrow. I know it will be stressful and I will probably spend time hiding for some of it once it has become too overwhelming. However I will not drink no matter what happens today. 
Thanks for hosting at this busy time of year [u/mrmurphyltd](u/mrmurphyltd).  I like your metaphor of the 'alcohol merry-go-round.'  It captures the futility of that whole cycle really well.  Perhaps it might be more accurate to call it the 'misery-go-round' though eh?  I agree - that is not a ride that I want to hop on again!  I'm not a huge fan of the holidays anymore (to me there's too much pressure to create an artificial atmosphere of ideal joy so the actual event never lives up to the hype and I always feel like it's a personal failling on my part somehow) but I'm glad that I won't be using that crummy 'coping' strategy this year!  IWNDWYT
Checking in! IWNDWYT! 
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
I will not drink today. Hope everyone has a safe and merry Christmas Eve!
Thank you so much for this!  Here's to saying "NO" to alcohol and yes to being present.  No to the craziness of people pleasing and all the expectations at this time of year.  Yes to making yourself happy.  IWNDWYT.  Take care all.
Wishing everyone the best this holiday. I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT     
Lots of last minute things to do today.  IWNDWYT
Good morning! I will not drink with you today because I want to be filled with clarity peace and joy as I watch my sweet kids enjoy Christmas. I do not want to be filled with dread shame guilt and anxiety and then be grumpy and tired all day. 
Hit the gym last night cleaning out the car this morning it's a good day not to drink with anyone. Not missing the hangovers..
IWNDWYT!
Day 2 checking in sober on Reddit.  I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today!  Stocking up on La Croix tea and chocolate for tomorrow.  Let's do this!  Happy Holidays!
Happy Xmas eve people! Today is my day 9 and the SO's day 7. Feeling good and looking forward to all the holiday shenanigans with sparkly water coffee and fancy sodas! I toast you lot with my (NA)-eggnog spiked coffee!
Merry Christmas Eve SD! I haven't drank for 14 days and IWNDWYT either. 
I avoided drinking yesterday at the family gathering and I'm going to avoid it again today.  You lose Booze.  
13 days. Broke my streak of 12. Yesssss.  IWNDWYT. 
Being sober is the beat possible gift I could give myself and my family. They were sure that when I hit 100 days I'd stop the challenge and drink to my success. They told me that very thing. But here I am at 101 (yay!!) and I'm still not going to drink with you today!  ..However you celebrate-have a great holiday!
Didn't drink Saturday. Was doing good Sunday til I wasn't. Drank a bunch of beers and binged pizza. Felt like shit don't know why I keep doing this...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT! ..Back at my mum's for Xmas. Not that long ago I'd have been getting ready to head down into town and getting absolutely fucking shitfaced and then dealt with the hangover tomorrow by drinking through it. Then in more recent years as the hangovers worsened I would avoid drinking heavily tonight so that I could be more happily drunk tomorrow. ..And now for possibly the first time I have zero interest in drinking tonight or tomorrow. No intention to do so and no risk of slipping. ..It's a nice feeling...Best wishes to all the r/stopdrinking community you're a great bunch.
I will not drink today.
Merry Christmas to everyone! Still here still sober and I will gladly not drink with all of you today!
Day 5 I am sober and I will stay sober today
IWNDWYT! 
Day 85 of not drinking. IWNDWYT 
100 Days! Big milestone for Christmas Eve! IWNDWYT!
Hanging with the mom in the country air today and tomorrow! It's a beautiful day! Good luck to all of y'all :)..IWNDWYT! 
Happy holidays and IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today. 
I binged watched the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Soooo good. IWNDWYT  
Hi everyone and Merry Christmas Eve. I'm not drinking with you today.
I will not be drinking today!   
Starting this journey again. IWNDWYT
No drinks. 
Not today. Not today. Not today!!
Still chugging along. I'm already getting more accomplished over this long vacation than I would have dreamed of last year about this time. IWNDWYT and HHAHAHNY.
I will not drink today!  
IWNDWYT!
Last year I had wine while wrapping presents beer with lunch cocktails with dinner and more wine  to relax  after the kids went to bed; repeat until school and work resumed (minus the wrapping)...Not this year.  Now it's music and mindfulness with all of those things!..I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
Checking in. Witching hour approaches. This is Day 1... #473 approximately...I can't spend my life being afraid of my brain!
I will not drink with you today. 
At my in laws. My father in law is drunk and has already vomited on the porch and dinner isn't even served yet. I really want to but IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT .
First Christmas eve in many years that I will not be drinking. 
What's weird to me is that the 3 other adults in my house are all 3 glasses of wine in and they will all not get drunk. ..I have no idea how they stop (probably will all have 1 more in like 2 hours after dinner). ..Because of that clear as day fact IWNDT. 
Yay my badge is back! IWNDWYT tomorrow and all the days following. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to everyone on SD!  
I woke up this morning soar tired and feeling exhausted. .You know what I drank last night? A couple glasses if tonic water+lime...When I was getting up I was thinking about what I would feel like if I had been drinking until 3am. IWNDWYT!.Sty strong everyone. 
Christmas Eve for the first time in 8 years I will be as sober as a judge! *gavel pounding* 
I will not drink today. 
Two weeks sober! IWNDWYT&lt;3
Palindrome day! I will not drink with you today 
3 weeks today!!! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT! It's been a difficult few days but I think I'm through the hardest parts alcohol-wise.  Merry Christmas all!
Never again
Checking in.
IWNDWYT Day 67 coming to a close
I didn't drink on the 24th or the 25th of December - apart from feeling really tired and have a headache - I'm thankfully thoroughly enjoying my first sober Christmas amongst drinkers.  Had A fabulous Christmas day.  IWNDWYT

Sheesh Christmas is hard (Xmas day here) probably the biggest test since I stopped drinking. I considered drinking at least five times but I just refilled my glass with fizzy juice instead. My fam gets so stressed out over Xmas whiny kids bickering...ugh...But I am getting up early tomorrow and going to the sales to spend my Xmas gift voucher. Then meeting an old friend for lunch and helping my mum with clearing out her house. I likely would not want to do that if I was drinking on Xmas.
