Just wanted to express my gratitude to this sub and for inspiring me motivating me to stay the course and for providing me with resourced to help stay sober. ..I decided to stop drinking because I'm trying to prevent a divorce from my wife (granted its not looking good) and I decided that booze was becoming a crutch for me. In addition there are personal issues I have some of which contributed to my current situation that I was using alcohol to avoid. ..None of my issues (internal or marriage) have gone away I'm struggling with a constant level of depression and I truly do miss the temporary carelessness of drunk night out but not drinking has given me a chance to tackle all of this head on and not become as overwhelmed with it as I use too. My mood and approach to things is much more level and consistent. I really like not being tired and bloated all the time too. ..So again thank you because even though I feel quite stuck with my life right now I see the positive posts and the little counter on the side  and both give me hope and help reassure me that I'm moving in a good direction. ..Finally I wanted to share the sentiment from "Alcohol Explained" that has resonated with me the most. At one point he defines alcoholism not as the amount he drinks or how often he drinks but rather as the number of situations he feels like he needs to drink to enjoy or cope. I thought this was pretty profound and I don't want any situations where I need something booze. ..Anyway hopefully this wasn't self-aggrandizing I'm going to go back to over dosing on La Croix.

Congrats on the 50 days &amp; I'm right there with you on the LaCroix overdosing LOL. It's *hard* to face life sober but that quote is bang on - it's the very fact that I feel the need to use alcohol (or other substances) as a crutch which means that I can't use it at all.
