The first week after a relapse is hard. You deal with everything the alcohol brings back and you feel like you might as well drink since you've already messed up your streak and have nothing to lose. Well I didn't drink yesterday and the day before and I will try not to drink today.

Congratz mate! Its always better waking up and able to remember everything
Maybe try to think of it more as a math equation.  If you were sober for 100 days relapse for 7 then are sober for 93 it's kinda like 200 minus 7.  And hell every day you don't drink is a better day no matter what.  Whether or not that helps I will not drink with you today. 
Congrats on day 2!!!!..I will not be drinking with you today.
