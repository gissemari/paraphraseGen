Hey guys..  Sorry for posting here so much! ..  I keep having these super realistic relapse dreams and they are so scary and they feel so real........  I have been having them every night for like weeks!!..  Every day I wake up feeling like SHIT even though I'm sober it's not fair. I'm not relapsing in real life but I am when I dream and I wonder when will I be free? ..  I have a one on one visit with my therapist on Monday but my parents want to go out of town with them this weekend to celebrate my brothers graduation . But they didn't tell me until yesterday (Thursday) that I would have to ask for Monday off from work..... they just expected that I would do it. ..   They also want to go on this trip to go white water kayaking which I have no interest in and they keep trying to make me do because it is my dads hobby. ..  I had a childhood friend pass away this week. I am struggling with my sobriety. I have already missed two days at work this week because I was depressed. I know my brother is  graduating today and the family wants to go out of town for vacation but they should have told me sooner because now I have to ask for time off last minute also I NEED to go to this therapy visit I am very early in my sobriety and my mental health journey and I need the support . They have said "do you know sounds like great therapy to me??!?? Going out of town with you family!!!" .." oh !!! You mean that same family that fucked me up at childhood ?! Oh cool!!! Let's do this!!" ..Omfg sorry this rant headed in a different direction than I expected it too...I apologize if this post along with my life sound like a dumpster fire. ..If you have read this far I sincerely thank you.

I would do what is best for you and your sobriety. Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. Big hugs to you. .IWNDWYT.
Setting boundaries was key for me in early sobriety. I have a good relationship with my family now but I had to put that shit on hold until I could get better. Sure I missed a few family occasions but drunk me or dead me would have missed many more. I stood up for myself and was firm and clear that I needed to put myself and sobriety first. My sister didn't speak to me for a year but that's really her problem more than mine...Relapse dreams are totally normal. Try not to beat yourself up in the morning. Real life you is doing the do! Don't forget that.
