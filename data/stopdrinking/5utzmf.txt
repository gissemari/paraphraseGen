I like so many of you have been put through the ringer these past few days. Relapsed hard got caught ended up telling everyone I love about all of the years of hiding and lies...To make matters worse I drank half of a Mike's Hard Lemonade before my meeting. I was desperate because of the withdrawals. I told husband about it today so we are kinda at our lowest point ever. Got a script for Librium so that's kinda helping me physically...He is coming with me to another meeting today. When I put in the work to figure out why I drink and work on that I hope he comes around. I can and will change...Thanks for reading..K

Please consider reading "the naked mind" offered for free @ the side bar here. After  reading that book and going to AA I'm more on track than ever. Some days are difficult but much better than the "day after". .Wishing you a good day. .I'll do this with you. We all will. ..I will not drink with you today. 
Welcome glad you are here. Going to meetings helped me so much! For myself figuring out why I drank and working on that meant getting a sponsor and having him take me through the 12 steps. Doing so allowed a huge amount of personal growth and I'm sure I wouldn't be where I am today which is happy and serene and not craving alcohol and at without it. Keep doing the next right thing and things will start to fall into place at least that has been my experience. 
It sounds like your husband is supportive. When I first quit I tried to just focus on me and what I needed to do to manage my Sobriety. It was really all I could do anyway... my Husband seemed to get that and was ok with it. I scheduled each day to the max and still do and I spent a lot of time on this sub. And I still do! Good luck!
