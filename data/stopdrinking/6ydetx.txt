I have four months of sobriety today! It has been incredibly challenging but I can honestly say I have grown the most out of these four months then I have in the past year or even two years...For anyone struggling:.Give yourself a chance. You deserve sobriety. I am truly amazed by the prospects my new found sobriety has giving me. I hope I never ever forget how good this feels and how badly I want to continue my sobriety and continue to grow. I know I have a ten fold better chance at health happiness success friends and love when I am sober. ..The odds are stacked against me as a recovering alcoholic. That is why I need to remain humble in my recovery remain willing to learn. ..I hope each continuous day each and every one of us gives ourselves a fighting chance at this thing and remains humble at the prospect of recovery. ..For the record AA is working for me it has been the only thing that has worked for me. ..
