I saw my recovery coach tonight and I love her. She tells me exactly how it is. Recently relapsed. I'm on day 4. Bring on the anxiety and depression 10 fold for this past episode. I had made a new "friend" in my neighborhood whom I was extremely honest to about my drinking problem. I don't drink everyday but I will have a night of binging a few times a month and it NEVER turns out well. Went out Friday with her. She already had the booze ready to go. She provided me with every opportunity to get shit faced and I didn't say no because she made me guilty. She's been removed from my life forever. I don't blame her 100%. I could have never taken that first drink but she is older and claims herself as "wiser" and set me up for a disaster which she then proceeded to tell me yesterday that I need serious help. She drinks every single day. ..IF you want to stay sober if you want to be sober it's so fucking ok to tell people who say "you can have one" or "you're fine" or "just moderate" or "drink water in between" to fuck off. It's OK. They are not friends if they think that your struggle isn't real. This is YOUR life not anyone else's. I love you guys. Stay strong. I am not drinking with you tonight.

Damn right. No need to keep toxic people around.
"...she then proceeded to tell me yesterday that I need serious help. She drinks every single day."..She's actually the one who needs help and doesn't even realize it. Good for you that you're leaving her behind......
I had to cut out many. It is the only way for me
