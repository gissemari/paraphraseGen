This is the longest time I've been clean and sober in the last five years since my last relapse and I forgot how good it feels to not have to wake up each morning with the first thought either being  I need a drink  or  why did I have to wake up today? ..Life is so much more worthwhile now.....Hope everyone has a great day! .. .
