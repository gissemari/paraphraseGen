I just had a really difficult time in a detox center just three days ago. I was on about a 3 week bender that escalated to the point of needing alcohol in my system to function. This has been my second time I've absolutely needed to be medically detoxed in a facility. In fact this time around I almost went too late and they would have had to taken me to the hospital. I'm so happy I reluctantly went. It's not fun but to feel safe and monitored is a comfort during an already uncomfortable and scary time...So at the moment I'm technically 4 days sober. My partner still drinks and right now he went to bed and I'm struggling with not drinking the rest of the open beer he didn't finish. I know this feeling will pass but I'm also still in the throes of withdrawal anxiety. Trying not to obsess over it at the moment.

Relapse is part of the journey.  .I relapsed into heavy heavy drinking and I am so glad been completly broken was the best thing for me.  .I had to do something different or I would have lived my old life for years and years to come or killed myself.  ..Iwndwyt.
