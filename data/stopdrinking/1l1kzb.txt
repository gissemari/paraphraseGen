Good Morning/Afternoon    .Theme: Being a good person    .**"Be the person your pet thinks you are."- Unknown**    .What I get from it: Normally people are kind caring compassionate reliable responsible etc. to their pets. I am a good person through my pet's eyes so I want to be that person to the world.    .**PSA:** I will not be able to post for a week. I have to serve my debt to society as a result of my bad decisions while drinking. When I return I will continue to post. So don't worry that I have relapsed but I would appreciate your prayer. (kidding about the PSA but wanted you all to know what was up.)P.S. Don't drink and drive.    .~INY

I'll refrain from mentioning animal abuse in this post... &lt;- besides that...Only animals and kids can tell the true nature of a person. When I was drinking most days out and about I was more approachable (somehow! Maybe my demeanor?). During those times when sober animals wouldn't dare come near me and kids were naturally afraid/weary of me. ..Since quitting it's already changed noticeably a bit. I'm 29 days clean now; that's a new record for me since regular drinking. Plus I'm on anti-anxiety meds and that's sure to help my mindset patience and general attitude. ..So being sober for a bit and occasionally encountering children and pets this quote means a lot to me.....My prayers will go out to you.
Take care of yourself in there. I wish you the best. 
Be thinking of you INY. ..Peace. 
I always just wanted to be the person I thought I was.  Thank you for All your posts and best of luck serving your debt.  I wish you well!
Good luck use the time to listen and learn and you should be fine.  Let us know when you get out.
Thank you for this and all of the other quotes you post that help keep us inspired each day INY. I will be thinking of you...Good luck. :)
I love this quote.  Somewhat tangentially I once saw a throw pillow that said " we're staying together for the sake of the dog" and I've always kicked myself for not buying it!  But really pets are such a great source of unconditional love.  .Hey I hope your week goes as well as possible.  I will be thinking/praying/meditating of and about you.  Your daily posts are a wonderful service here.
