i am just looking for a way to pat myself on the back between 30 and 60 days...its an everyday struggle but I am certainly making some positive changes in my life got up today and did homework at a coffee shop that would never usually happen report from my kids is that my ex-wife is nursing a hangover I don't like to enjoy other's misery but I am sure happy its not me and that my kids have my full attention...carry on non-drinkers let's all not drink together this fine saturday

Everyday you don't drink is a triumph so pat yourself on the back everyday.
Way to go!! I am so happy for you. It does feel wonderful to be there for people you care about and to be fully engaged. Keep not drinking and keep being productive!
