I've been trying to quit for the last couple of months..I always relapse during weekends... One hour at a time I won't drink today

Hang in there I've been minute by minute today.  We'll get through this!
Yes weekends are hard.  For me lots of triggers on the weekends.  I had to find substitute rewards and substitute activities.  ..I won't drink with you this hour or today!
