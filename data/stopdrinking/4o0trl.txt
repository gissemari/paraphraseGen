That was not a pleasant way to wake up. At least it was only a dream but damn it was so vivid. ..Does anyone have advice on dealing with relapse dreams?

Take a deep breath and move on. They will become less frequent. I've even had drinking dreams where I refused the alcohol! I consider mine to be gentle reminders that a slip up is never very far away. Keep working your program.
you didn't do anything wrong so shake that right away...I just focus on how grateful I am to sober when that happens...We never have to drink again!! :) yay!
Here's a post I wrote about [Drinking Dreams that includes feedback from leading dream researchers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
I've had at least 7 already all super disturbing and vivid. I'd wake up in sure panic and so grateful it was only a dream. Here is something someone shared with me...think of a drunk dream as an amazing experience you get to experience the pain of relapsing without actually doing it.
