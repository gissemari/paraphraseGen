Hella. I made it through a long weekend of drive-in's camping and restaurants. There's been a few times of wanting a drink. I just always remember what happens to me and all the glorious withdrawal symptoms and I'm just not tempted. That's weird In a good way!..It took me over a year of continuous relapses to put together more than 3 days. I got serious in November. Had a few slips in December started out January with total determination. ..It's amazing I am to this point. I'm so proud I could cry. I have more love for myself than I can even recall ever. It's just a relief I don't have to live that way any longer. I have still got some work to do but day by day I regain my freedom from alcohol. ..I'm DeeBee and I'm an alcoholic. And I will not drink with you all this fine day.

Congrats dear DeeBee!
I am so happy for you! ..This is right around the time that I realized sobriety was going to be alright. I'm so glad you're seeing the benefits. It really is a beautiful world outside of the bottle. Keep going! You're kicking ass!
