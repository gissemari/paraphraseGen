I have been half assingly trying to quit for a year or two now. Woke up one day in october and i just didnt want to drink anymore. I never really told anyone and I made it 63 days...Then for christmas i went on a family holiday to Spain i expected there to be drinking oppurtunities and had no plans to take them. I lasted 1 hour after i got off the plane and have been drinking non stop since...I have made an ass out off myself numerous times spent money i don't have and wasted a nice vacation to the tropics. I'm back home now drank two liters of spirits the last two days and now i'm finnishing my last beer. I have 2$ until payday...From tomorrow on i will be back to the financial and emotionaly balanced person i have been since october.  ..I will not drink with you!

I will forever find it baffling how my mind tricks me into thinking the drink is going to ADD to the experiences I am trying to savor. Like really? WTF brain?..I know time and time again it means wasted days wasted memories wasted money... wasted life. And yet brain still says that drink will make this experience better. It is a lie every time. ..It sort of sounds like from today on you will be finding your financial and emotional balance. I'm fighting with you! I will not drink with you.
Honest reflection is a good foundation for change. Strong sobriety tools are essential for making the change stick.  How will you handle the next vacation or temptation?
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. 
Another f'ing reset after slipping on day 28.  But I'm not going to give up and I'm not going to drink today.
