Work was horrific and for some reason in the middle of it  I made a grandiose decision to be dry. ..I am struggle bussing hard. ..In a desperate ploy I bought deadpool and chocolates instead of whiskey. I'm hoping they will help get me though the next couple days.

Deadpool and chocolate sounds awesome.
Chocolate!!.I had a horrible week as well and I just ate half a bar of dark chocolate at my desk. I hope you feel better this weekend! Look forward to not having a hangover.
I just ate half a pint of chunky monkey. And made some tea. And have no idea what deadpool is. Lol!
