I relapsed last night. I'm so disgusted with myself. I've spent the day cleaning up after the mess I made yesterday. The hardest thing so far was calling my boss to tell her I took cash from our register at work for booze. I can't believe I did that. Ive never done anything like that before.Thankfully my boss and other supports in my life have been very gracious with me. I'm really thankful for that and feel lucky as hell. I'd be on the streets begging for booze if my dad and partner hadn't stepped in and helped me out. I feel so much guilt for it though. I can't believe how dependent I have become on others to simply stay alive. I made it a couple months sober before last night. That tells me I got too cocky too comfortable. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated I'm really down right now. But....IWNDWYT

Good for you owning your mistakes.  That shows responsibility and that can take you a long way. Messing up is part of life and growth. As long as you learn from them mistakes make you a better person. 
Good for you for getting right back to it!  That is the most important thing to not give up!  I have definitely struggled with relapsing because of overconfidence.  What has really helped me this time is keeping a list of all the reasons I don't want to drink anymore and reading it/adding to it whenever I need to.  ..You can do this.  IWNDWYT
Can you play the tape backward and identify at what point did it became inevitable? I know for myself it took a lot of trying and failing but every failure taught me something as long as I was paying attention. I think You are owning it trying to make amends and hopping right back to find community here so those are all good signs. Do you have a recovery community in real life that you can reach out to?
