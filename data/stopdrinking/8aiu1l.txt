One slip up doesn't define you or take away from your tremendous effort of 96 days.... I have had many slip ups and i have learnt not to beat myself up as it compounds my thoughts to drink even more (to numb the pain shame and guilt... I have read a quote once "if you fall make sure you fall forwards so at least your going in the right direction" .... and this you have done...Your back online reaching out for support and im sure you can get back on that horse.... 96 days proves you can do this...  
&gt;i'm typing this out still drunk..Sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post.
