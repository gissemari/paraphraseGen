Throwaway because reasons.  Long time redditor new to SD found it y'day and have already cried multiple times because I can relate to so much.  Still searching for my motivation to stop drinking but I'm here so that's a positive I guess. This community is awesome I'm hopeful you will give me the strength that comes through in all your inspiring posts...My question?  What motivated you to stop? I know I'll have to find my own motivating factor and I'm looking more than ever since finding this sub.  For the record I don't  want a pity party quite the opposite I don't think I have enough tough love in my life and I think I could use it...My story . I've been a daily drinker for the last 12 years since meeting my soon to be ex-husband separated 2 years pending divorce.  I'm 41 no kids good job stable and supportive family (recovering alcoholic father but that's neither here nor there as far as my current situation/life choices go).  My husband and I began drinking heavily together and since he left (still no pity party it's good that we're separated he was no better at handling life than I am) I've  allowed' myself to drink more citing the fact that I'm an abandoned wife (but mainly because there's no-one around to see me drunk/passed out/hungover/daytime drinking etc.)...I've been to AA seen an addiction therapist a CBT therapist a psychotherapist and I'm no closer to understanding why I drink so much than I was a year/5/10 ago...I'm struggling with motivation because I feel hopeless.  I don't care about anything anymore.  My family is solid they're largely oblivious to how bad things are although I have shared some things with them.  I live alone so I've managed to hide most of the horror show.  I have a secure well-paid job that I'm not great at but I'm getting by I'm no longer ambitious so getting by is just fine.  I have a boyfriend but I don't see a future with him; he's not the man of my dreams he's ok for right now but to be honest he's seen me at my worst lately and if he dumps me soon I won't be surprised in fact I half expect it it would be the right thing for him to do.  I no longer value my health and while I've never felt suicidal I wouldn't be devastated with a terminal illness diagnosis...I awoke this morning with an empty wine glass beside the bed oddly proud that I made it to bed I often wake on the couch; I had a couple of beers as soon as I awoke then got ready and drove to work and here I am.  Ready for another day of tedium.  ..This isn't day 1 I already know it.  There's alcohol at home and I don't expect to be able to resist the temptation.  My rational self knows that every single aspect of my life would be better without alcohol but I don't care enough about any of it to stop.  ..Fwiw I hate the tone of this post and I don't like the person who wrote it.  It's so far away from who I used to be.  I'll finish by saying that writing this has been cathartic in its own way.  I'm grateful to have found this sub.  Maybe writing this is step 1 on the way to day 1.  I don't know I feel like this community might help in ways nothing has before.  ..Thanks for reading.  .

 Maybe being that person that you like again could be your motivation. 
Hello there and welcome   I think you've done amazing in recognising you may have a problem with drinking and even more so that you want to do something about it so kudos to you! I'm also sorry to hear about the issues you've had I know you said no pity party but these life issues do take their toll :( ..For me the reason I stopped was due to the crippling anxiety that drinking brings me the next day not to mention the shame (I'm an erratic drunk fun for others embarrassment for me). When you saw the cbt therapist etc was it specifically related to drinking? Did they address how you were feeling about other aspects of your life? Would it help to focus on how you're feeling now today and utilise that? Take it one day at a time. I definitely feel a lot happier and less hopeless since I stopped it's had a HUGE impact on my mental health in the best way. SD has helped a lot so definitely come here often and ask away everyone is very supportive. Good luck to you   
Have you talked to your doctor? I have a combination of depression and alcoholism so both need to be treated. Stopping drinking has helped my depression so much but I'm also on an antidepressant. .I hope you find the motivation to make it day 1 it's so worth it   
I guess we all have our own motivations and not all of us can articulate them. I've been drinking daily for almost 30 years. Not always huge amounts but more than is good for me. I think I've just begun to notice how many people don't drink. My wife doesn't - my kids don't really.  In fact my kids have been a bit of a revelation. For me drinking was always cool rebellious... For them it's a bit of a loser thing. A generational shift? I'm only 9days in so constantly seeking my motivation.. You're here already so you must in some way be ready...Take it step by step. The big thing I've learned from this subgroup is that if you don't make it today don't be too hard on yourself. Dust yourself down and try again tomorrow..
I've been posting to SD for almost two years. Of that time I've been sober off and on for about half. I've noticed I feel so much better mentally and physically when I'm not drinking. That combined with my kids seeing me for me instead of me drinking is my motivation. The concept of not drinking for one day is a godsend. It helps me forget about tomorrow and think about right now. I have alcohol in my house 99.9% of the time because my husband drinks. 100% of the last 8 days I chose to not have one of his beers. I feel so much better in the morning when I haven't had one. ..I hope you stick around and read (or share).  We welcome everyone in all stages.... from those who are just thinking they may need to quit to those who have been sober for decades.  
As I read your post I was remembering the very earliest days of my own journey. I remembered my dogged determination to obsess about "why?" (i.e. my motivation)..Why can't I have a drink like my wife sister brother friends?.Why can't I enjoy myself?.Why do I not stop at one or two or three?.Why did I start drinking?.Why did my Dad drink? And why did his Mum drink? And why did her Dad drink?.Why do I like alcohol so much?.Why am I so weak?.Why am I here? Why should I stay?.Why do I have to cook? Why do I have to look after the kids? Why do I have to walk the dog? Why do I have to make the bed?.Why do I have to go without?.Why should I go to AA? Why are you always talking about me having a few beers? Why don't you love me?.Why aren't I thinner? Why am I not good looking? Why don't I get more attention?.Why should I give up something I love to do?.Why me?.Why bother?..Everyone's journey begins from where they are RIGHT NOW. The "Whys" can be a useful tool to reflect  - but I've found you can get stuck here. Set your eyes on the road ahead and take small steps and rest. ..Remove alcohol from your home.  Change your routine.  Create a new reality.  Go to a movie or the theatre.  Sit in a park. Go for a walk.  Learn to dance.  Whatever you do make a plan for Day One.  And at the end of Day One right before you go to sleep make a plan for tomorrow...Focus on and surround yourself with those people who love you and do what you need to do to resist the songs of the alcohol sirens in the distance...When we take action and simply "do" something new because we can the "Why" loses it's power...Courage to you on your journey - you are not alone..
&gt;I'm no closer to understanding why I drink ..Take a moment and fully consider your statement...This was me.  "If only I understood *Why*"; "If only I knew *Why* I do this that I do not want to do"...  "Why" was my quest.  I spent hours days weeks..... *Years*....  in the pursuit of **Why**..."Why" was a distraction and a procrastination tactic my mind used in a shell game to delay my embracing the actual solution -  "What"..."What" I do was what mattered not "Why".  When I let go of "why" when I stopped trying to "understand" I finally realized that was the pursuit a fool's errand...I did not need to know why.  I just needed to change **what** I was doing.  Why happens in my head and is not subject to the laws of physics nor bounded by time.  "Why" is ephemeral and indeed *does not exist in a corporeal sense*..."What" is action.  Action is subject to the laws of physics is constrained to temporal bounds is observable by an unbiased observer.  ..I was able to Stop Drinking when I focused on *What I did*.  ..Action Verbs...Verbs such as:  "Talk" to a counselor; "Travel" to a meeting; "Develop" a sober support network; "Observe" Dry People and Dry Places; "Share" in a meeting; "Assist" another person to get and stay sober...Why did I do that?   ..Doesn't matter why I did that.  What matters is it worked...Looking forward to hearing more about your progress.

You can find motivation in your hopelessness. If you stop drinking who know what limits you can reach! You may find a boyfriend you DO see a future with climb to parts of your career you never thought possible and wake up very proud that it is early and you have time for a run or walk before work. 
I think there are so many angles to approach it from. I'll tell you how I started and maybe it'll resonate. After work one day I stopped at one of my local convenience stores (I rotated so no one store would realize how much I was drinking). I really didn't want to drink but I knew I was going to. I parked my car took the keys out of the ignition and sat there. Then I had the thought: what if I just left right now? What if I didn't go in? I can still drink tomorrow but let's just see what happens if I just go home...I guess my motivation in the moment was curiousity. What would actually happen if I just drove away without alcohol? Honestly I didn't really even care if it made my night better or worse... I just wanted it different. Even if it made me miserable at least I would finally feel something different for a while. 
There is a thing we talk about in mental health called "passive suicide" which is basically what you described. It's making small choices that lead you to destruction rather than putting a gun to your head. I was deep into passive suicide mode before I finally realized how much I wanted to feel something different and got serious about quitting.  I had messed around with drying out because other people wanted me to but it wasn't until I realized that I had a choice between two things: I could either keep drinking or I could have a life.  It was the alcohol or everything else and when that thought came in to my head the choice was so obvious.  Just because it was obvious didn't make it easy especially for the first few days when I just cried constantly. But I knew a girl who literally decided that she would rather give up her finace her job and her life than quit drinking. She said that she said she would rather lose it all than quit. She wasn't even 30 and she died from liver failure this year.  While I never felt like that I spent some time with that story and asked myself what I was willing to give up for alcohol. Then I asked myself what I would be willing to give up alcohol for. The second list was a lot longer. And a lot stronger. That's what motivated me and what has gotten me through this first month. ..I promise you that there is hope on the other side. There may not be perfection but at least there is the promise for good days for joy for something you can rely on during the bad days. I'm still worried about how I'm going to make it through some difficult events coming up but I know that I can make it through today which is the best I can ask for. ..Sending you courage. And a hug. 
Hey there.  We're similar.  I'm 40 and split from my first wife on good terms 3.5 years ago.  While we cited many different reason alcohol was the biggest factor.  We're both successful but when together we couldn't control our drinking appropriately...The biggest thing I learned from that breakup was to focus on fixing me.  I stopped drinking for three months and allowed myself to be sad.  I started running more and more until I got a little obsessive about it and was running 40-50 miles per week...but I wasn't drinking.  The running let me clear my mind without chemicals.  And while the physical benefits were great the time I spent thinking on long runs (sometimes spontaneously crying) helped me over the hump.  It helped me accept myself.  It helped me start to figure out what is important and how to treat myself my partner and my family/friends...I'm now married to the best woman who has more impulse control than me.  We are expecting a baby and I'm making the commitment to not drink today so that I can be present to support her and my future child...The struggle will always be there but you can definitely do it.  At 41 if you don't see yourself with your boyfriend long term then get rid of him and the rest of your baggage.  Allow yourself to be vulnerable and SLOW down.  Without chemicals life slows down and things come into focus...The decision is yours.  You have the power to choose your own destiny.  :)
I definitely had to look beyond reasons and motivation.  Motivation would get me sober for a little while or onto meds and whatnot but it always flagged.  ..As others have articulated better than I can thinking about why was beside the point.  I have a list a mile long of reasons I deserve to drink of ways things have been messed up difficult unfair and awful.  And they genuinely are...I landed in Refuge Recovery and through daily meditation I've learned to ignore my thoughts.  I had done so much therapy before that!  CBT DBT EMDR for trauma IFS for trauma psychodynamic MBT for YEARS.  Still developed a drinking problem.  ..It was so huge to me when I realized that I was heavily relying on my thoughts because I thought my brain was my best resource BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY THOUGHTS...So most of the time now I don't bother "working with" cognitive distortions.  It's been a real relief...However you choose to get to where you're going my sincere best wishes.  This shit is hard.  But it's worth it.
