**TLDR**: please read the bolded parts...Maybe it's just rooted deeply in my mind since I come from a cultural background where alcohol is considered as a regular part of our lives and we drink on every occasion (I don't want to create stereotypes but some Slavs here might relate). ..I am sober since the New Year's Eve when things got really bad and I finally decided to quit for real this time (wasn't drinking nor smoking weed and cigarettes for 6 months before well I got drunk 3 - 4 times during that time to be honest) and I think it's getting to me now because again majority of my colleagues at work are drinking and we had some solid parties every time I meet with my friends we drink beer (I drink tea now it's more expensive than the beer!!) I even know people who say things like "he wasn't drinking at all that's suspicious I don't like it!" it's really crazy. ..So far people respect my decision and like me anyway I try to surround myself with people who want the best for me but I am my worst enemy and I am thinking about questions like "**will I really never drink a beer? stupid single beer? or a glass of wine with that nice girl?**" I can have fun with my friends not drinking if they plan to have a house party I skip just to be sure but for me it just doesn't feel normal :( ..**I feel like if I were damaged in some way** everyone having a beer because they don't struggle with addiction maybe some of them do but they don't care I don't have a girlfriend for some time already so maybe that's why I am so anxious about not drinking a bottle of wine with some girl. ..I relapsed so many times and I see now that it always starts with "just one beer" but **can't I really control myself? Am I really like a child? Why is everyone drinking without the issues I have? Am I so sick that I can't have just a beer?** And I know I had just one before maybe two but on some evenings you just feel like having a good time and loose yourself...**Please if you could share your thoughts on this. Did you have similar thoughts? How did you deal with them? Should I really dedicate to not have a single drop of alcohol ever in my life? Thank you!**

I personally tried to moderate and it didn't work. I was back to over drinking in no time. My mom almost fell into problem drinking and went a few years without drinking. She is now able to moderate successfully. Everyone is different but I personally can't take the chance. Best of luck to you! 
Just for today.

I romanticized drinking into something it was not in reality.  Drinking was life-defining so it was hard to let go.  ..I like chocolate chip cookies.  If I could never eat another chocolate chip cookie I'd say  oh well  and move on.  It was harder than that with letting go of drinking. It has its hooks in my mind. ..Good news: I found one day at a time and working on mindfulness showed me a new way.  My life is so much better without alcohol and I don't want that one beer.  The peace and freedom of sobriety are better for me...I might not worry about the rest of my life.  One day at a time helped me find answers. IWNDWYT 
If I have one drink I will then drink until I pass out. I know this from many times trying to just have one drink. And I don't want to drink until I pass out. So I'm not worried about whether I will ever have a beer at a ball game or a champagne at a wedding. I know I don't want to drink today and I won't. That's all I can do. Tomorrow I'll wake up without a hangover and probably decide not to drink that day either. But that's tomorrow and I can only take on today. Best wishes to you!
Do you really want the glass of wine or do you want the nice girl to talk to?..If you do hang out and talk with that awesome girl a coffeeshop will do nicely.
I drank to get drunk. No ifsands or buts about it. I dont really see a way to suddenly erase all those years of brain conditioning and drink one glass. ..One always will lead to more for me. Maybe not that night but in the days weeks to come. It's like a permission slip in my brain. ..It's's like a slot machine that paid out one time and you keep going back and losing while you're trying to win. ..I also dont want to erase the progress I've made physically mentally spiritually. I feel like whether its one drink or 20 it will fuck that all up. ..I also think : its ethanol. Its poison. Why would I want one glass of poison? How about none?..Just some thoughts from my mind...iwndwy. ..
