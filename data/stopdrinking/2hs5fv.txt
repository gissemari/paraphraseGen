Wall of Text:..I have spent the majority of past two years grappling with my new wife's (married two months ago) alcoholism.  Without going into too many details on her alcoholism it has been a battle.  I have attended al-anon meetings AA meetings read countless books and reached out to family and friends regarding alcoholism.  She has struggled the past two years but is strong and has been in AA with a sponsor for a year and a half.  She has relapsed twice but is constantly improving and is a source of inspiration for me.  Even with all of this great material in front of my face I refused to be honest with myself about my own issues...I (29m) have always thought of myself as the jovial boisterous drunk that is fun to have around.  Sure 20% (or is it 30% it couldn't be 50%) of the time I black out or cause family/friends to worry or look after me but that's normal right?  Everyone has those times...everyone has family and friends voice concern about their drinking occasionally right?  Apparently if you can't spot the drunkest person at a party/bar it's you!  It took me six years to get a bachelors degree I destroyed a couple of my own relationships and had to move across the country to get a new start a few years back.  None of these things were flags to me.  Although I suspected booze to be at least partially the culprit I continued on my path and skated along content knowing that at the end of the day my glass of JW Red would help me render myself voluntarily unconscious.  ..In the past year I have been fired from my family business dealt with a suicide attempt by my fiance and moved back across the country.  I have made an ass of myself at my wife's friend's wedding.  A few weeks ago I was drunk and fell in a parking lot the night before my sister's wedding.  I cracked the back of my head on some pavement and bled pretty profusely none of which I remember.  I woke up in the morning on top of a pillow covered in blood and with a raging headache.  I attributed this headache to a hangover and did the only logical thing; I found a beer and drank it immediately.  ..Fast forward a few days and my headache is not better and dare I say it has gotten worse.  My wife insists that I go see a doctor and I am told to get a CT scan at the Emergency Room.  Long story short I have a subdural hematoma.  My brain is bleeding.  I suffered a massive concussion and very well could have died.  This was disconcerting on many levels and my wife was a wreck.  I was internally a mess but had to be strong for her.  ..Seeing the pain and tears in her eyes I made the decision then to stop drinking and I haven't touched a drop since.  I have toed the line in the past and always gone back to drinking.  Not this time.  I have too much to live for.  Oddly enough I was given my diagnosis in the same ER that my wife was taken to during her last relapse which was approximately 8 weeks ago.  During this visit the ER doctor informed us that she was pregnant (for those concerned the baby is healthy and the relapse had no ill affect).  ..I have always known that I have a problem with alcohol.  This is my "aha" moment.  The culmination of many "aha" moments rather.  I have too much to live for to be risking everything for a damn buzz.  The best times in my life thus far have occurred when I have been sober and I know I have so much more to look forward to.  Now time to read up on curing morning sickness...

Hello and welcome! It's important to do something different this time if you want to maintain sobriety. What helped me was going to AA meetings and a therapist. There's more to getting well than simply not drinking. ..Kudos for 15 days!
