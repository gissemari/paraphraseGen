First full day today after a bender that went on almost a month on the back of 2 and a half months sobriety. The anxiety and regret is a real motherfucker and is what always leads me to relapse. But once again I'm gonna ride it out and get over the hump. In a few days I will be much better. The one outcome of this bender is my confirmation that I am an alcoholic. Armed with that knowledge I'm now gonna fix myself. There is much I wanna do and at 46 I've left it very late to do it but not too late. Good to come on here n vent. Good luck to all! IWNDWYT

Day 2 here. The anxiety is incredibly real but if we pull through we never have to feel like this again! 46 is definitely not too late. My Uncle was a little older when he married my Aunt over 25 or so years ago. They ended up creating a business that has already flourished and been sold years later. Plus many years of happiness. You got a whole-nother lifetime waiting on you.
I'm 48 and day 2. I know how you feel
Absolutely exhausted but now safely home sober and watching the football (soccer for you Americans). So tired as day 1 draws to a close. Hoping for a good sleep tonight. Good luck all and thanks for the support!
