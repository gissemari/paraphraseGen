Hi Gang-- Look at that 70 days! We are now entering uncharted territory! 10 weeks is to my knowledge my longest intentional (non-pregballs) sober stint in the past oh I don't know... 20 years or so. ..Of course the previous times I've pulled 10 weeks it's been with just the goal of getting to the 10 weeks for fitness reasons so one could argue that I entered uncharted territory on Day One this time around but... there you have it. 10 weeks!..And I have to give some "big ups" to this group. It would have been a vastly different journey so far without you all. I can't even express how helpful it is to know that you are all here fighting the same battles facing the same demons letting me see my own struggles from different angles giving me time to get outside myself etc...So WOOT WOOT! to all of us!

Congrats!! We have so much else in common you are just gonna be as stubborn as I am and be at 277 days before you know it.  We'll bludgeon those demons down together.
