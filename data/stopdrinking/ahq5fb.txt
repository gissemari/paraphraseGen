I believe in  you. You're stronger than you feel right now. You're in the most difficult phase and this will pass. Wether you make it to day five or you cave at day four; you are worthy you are loved and you are capable. Either way don't be so hard on yourself because every minute is an achievement. 
Big love to you!!
