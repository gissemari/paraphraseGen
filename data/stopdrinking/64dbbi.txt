It's my first sober morning after a relapse.  The more time I can go between relapses the worse the hangovers seem to get.  ..Not drinking today!

Welcome back! I will join you in not drinking today!
This is called "kindling" and is a real phenomenon. Welcome back!
Not drinking with you!
First sober morning for me as well after a couple week relapse. For me these first few days are tough as hell not to pick up a drink because of withdrawals but I've done it before and can do it again. Stay strong dude.
