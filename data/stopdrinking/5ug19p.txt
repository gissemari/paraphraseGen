Last night one of my closest friends called to "check in" on me. Apparently I blacked out after the show we attended together on Monday night and started talking about suicide again and how I was worried I needed to have my relationship fail/heart broken so I can be creative. Part of what freaks me out about this is that I remember the night as being really fun carefree and positive but apparently that's just what I remember. I've only gotten drunk a few times in 2017 thinking that if I only drank occasionally instead of nearly every day that would make me "normal" but I'm slowly coming around to the realization that for me that just might not be possible...Anyway I moved to a new apartment a couple weeks ago and there is a rehab facility ~5 blocks away that holds daily AA meetings. Today I might finally bite the bullet and peek my head in...**Edit:** Thank you all so much for support and for sharing your own experiences with AA. I work from home so I attended the daily noon meeting today. Although I had planned on being a "silent observer" I ended up making a huge spectacle of myself by sobbing uncontrollably when given my 24 hr chip. As a result I ended up getting called on to share during which I did even **more** sobbing. So that was kind of embarrassing but it was also cathartic and cleansing. After the meeting numerous people hugged me and one lady even told me that she too has struggled with suicidal thoughts and gave me her phone number. All in all it was a positive and very overwhelming experience and I think I will probably go again at some point. Also it felt really good to be able to respond to the text I got from my best friend/ex-girlfriend telling me that we needed to have a conversation about my drinking by apologizing and informing her that I went to my first meeting today.

Going to AA is the best decision I ever made. I can't say enough good about it
By all means go!  It will be a bit scary at first but you will find a warm and inviting group.  It took me a few times to "get it" so keep going!
I laugh at how nervous I was to attend my first meeting.  Now I look forward to them and some of the people there have become my closest friends.  .Maybe just make it your goal to walk into the building and sit in a chair.  That's it.  Don't even have to introduce yourself or talk if you don't want to. 
For me getting sober means not having to worry about losing control during a night out or having my memory betray me when reality ends up being different than I think. ..I get a lot out of AA meetings even though I don't agree with them 100%. ..Best of luck to you.
Why not give it a shot? You have nothing to lose...
I am happy that so many people have found success through AA but you shouldn't be dismayed if it's not your thing! I only went to one meeting very optimistically I should add but I realized that AA is not the thing for me. Instead I had to explore alternative methods (counseling/CBT/"The Naked Mind") that have colectively been working wonderfully. I wish the best for you there but remember that if it doesn't work out there are tons of other options!
First meeting I ever went to was this really sad and depressing meeting. Everybody was crying and I felt really uncomfortable. Every other meeting I've been to has been a lot of funny and happy people trying to help others who are in a bad place. Every meeting is different so maybe try a few. ..Grab a cup of coffee (it's not very good haha) and just listen to what people have to say. I'm a very shy/introverted person and there's a lot of handshaking and introductions at first. You're not going to remember everybody's name right away so don't worry about it. Most people seem overbearingly/cheesily nice. I'm sure some are but a lot are also genuine. ..Find somebody who has a similar story as you. Someone who describes how there life is and you realize that's what you want yours to be like. Talk to them for a minute. You don't have to ask them to be your sponsor or anything just see how their life is going and how they got there. If your not sure you are an alcoholic than ask somebody why they think they're an alcoholic/ what that means to them. ..Being shy/introverted I didn't do any of these things but I'm telling you but I wish I had. I've met some guys who no matter how bad my life gets/how long it's been will pick up the phone and talk you through a rough spot...TLDR: Give it a shot. It's not as scary as I thought it would be. I hope you come to the same conclusion. 
I was in the same boat. Didn't need to drink all the time but when I did drink I would take it too far. Definitely give being sober a chance. 
So I looked at your past posts and saw that you are female. Sometimes women's meetings are less stressful for women as I understand it. One of my female friends in recovery finds them easier to attend. (I'm male but even I get creeped out by some of the dudes in the program)..Hope this is helpful! AA isn't perfect but I've found if you take what you need and leave the rest behind you can make progress.
Before I quit I had cut down to 1-2 times a week but was disappointed to find the consequences were exactly the same.  Not drinking at all has been so much better.  Let us know how it goes tonight!
I know for me moderation doesn't really work. Either in "just a few" or "just once in a while" terms. Once I'm a few drinks in I don't have the willpower to stick to the just a few and I end up getting wasted. Similarly if I let myself indulge "from time to time" it just gets more frequent and more each time over time until I've backslid to regular problem drinking. I'm committed to going the teetotaler route at this point.
