I got a call today from my sister in law. She told me my brother hasn't had a drink in 10 days. She said that my example gave him the courage to try. I have never said a word to him but I know he has struggled with alcohol and I always hoped in the back of my mind that somehow my decision could help him. What I've done I did for me nobody else but its stuff like this that get me really emotional about the journey we go through to get sober and the amazing stuff that can happen if you just clear a little path.

That's amazing and really inspiring! I hope I get to experience the same thing some day.
I struggle with not inserting desired results in to my communication and actions. However when I don't do it I am always amazed with the positive outcomes I get from just doing the right thing and just communicating without steering it in a direction.  ..Well done and enjoy your positive outcome. 
I help by being not by yelling or telling. The best amends I've ever made is just by being in people's lives and trying to be who I'm becoming...
We lead by example. when close friends were preaching and forcing me to get sober it never worked.  I was not till I decided for myself.  Seeing someone else succeed is sometimes the kick we need to start our journey.  
I had a meeting with my AA sponsor yesterday and we talked about the ripple effects of recovery. We both know too well the fallout that our alcoholic drinking caused in our individual worlds but we concentrated on the positives of recovery and we had a long list of benefits that covered many more than just ourselves. It really was a profound and moving conversation and we came away filled to the brim with gratitude.
