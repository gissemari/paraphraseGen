Been really having a hard time lately. Out of this year I've managed to stay sober four months falling off the wagon three times. Last night was bad drank a ton and made some very stupid decisions. Very lucky none of them have permanent detrimental effects. Called in sick to work feel awful today. I need to quit my job I'm a bartender and can't deal with being around booze but don't know what else to do. I'm feeling like a lost cause today. I called my dad to tell him I have been struggling and he said I never stick with anything. He is right. I can't keep a job or relationship long term I get bored and just give up. Really wishing I had an answer to this problem. I'm 27 and scared.

Wish your dad was more supportive. It's hard to reach out with the truth only to be shot down. I'm sorry. How did you do in school? Have you ever considered you might have ADHD? (Just a thought) I'm a woman who struggled too and found out late in life that I have it. ..You're right; bartending is not a good job for someone who is trying not to drink. ..I got a lot of support in AA. Actually it saved my life! I don't agree with everything but the fellowship is wonderful. It gives hope and people to show the way. 
I'm sorry you're struggling. Why not keep coming back here and give it a go?
