Relapsed on Saturday while on vacation. Still on vacation. Have drank every day since. Missed out on so fucking much. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. My cousin thinks I'm  sick.  ..Last drink was about 8 hours ago. I can't do this anymore. A friend is coming to join us and I haven't seen her in a year. She knows I'm struggling and I know that when I get downstairs I'm just going to sob into her arms. ..I cannot wait to get back home to my family and cat and get the support I need. Get back to my IOP and just let it all pour out. I feel like I'm on the edge of a nervous break down. I can't live like this anymore.

Good job getting back to sobriety. Best wishes to you.
Ah God's gift of desperation. In time you will find it was a wonderful gift. It ended up being for me I wish you well friend. Thinking of you. ..IWNDWYT
It's OK.  You can get through this.  Hang in there.
I hope you feel better.  It's so hard with family on "Vacation" and being out of our comfort and support zones.  Stay close to your friend and any other support you have until you are back in a place that helps you with your recovery.  You can do this!!  IWNDWYT
You can try the free eBook "Understanding and learning from relapse" You should find lots to help you in that. [here](https://lyingminds.sixboats.co.nz/understanding-and-learning-from-relapse/).
Maybe try some SSRI's for a year or two to manage the anxiety while you work on quitting. Many people drink to address anxiety issues and don't know that you can address those issues in other ways.
Godspeed friend! IWNDWYT!
