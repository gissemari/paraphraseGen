FYI - This *may be* longer and there will be no TL;DR...I been trying to post this for about 3 hours now and I don't know why I have not been able to.  ..I quit drinking on 09/08/2012 and have made it through all the major holidays my birthday losing my house having to surrender my dog moving to an undesirable location and other crap with no true temptation or desire to drink. I mention this as with the exception of Halloween and Christmas its been relatively easy...today...as Adam Sandler said in his first comedy CD "Fuck me in the goat ass."..I truly have no desire to drink and I do not fear a lapse nor relapse whatsoever. I don't have an issue with being around alcohol 98% of the time at the bar social gatherings such as BBQ's et al the club days...yeah tried that twice and I'm not able to handle; time will tell if that's lasting. This is the first 4th of July in 20 years since 17 I am sober or not drinking today and what fucking sucks is I am missing everything...My brother lives on the largest lake in the TC and is having a pool/lake party today. I passed. This time last year I was there having a blast with family friends and a woman I almost got engaged to and the love of my life. The sting of knowing that was one of if not **the** last truly happy event/time we had is overwhelming. Seeing hundreds of hundreds of people out on the lake having fun the vast vast majority of whom are drinking happy (yes I know that's an assumption and subjective) so I feel/felt well I know it's/was in my best interest to not have gone and those REM shiny happy people piss me the fuck off and make me angry as I cannot be one of them...There was no pressure no "Oh come on...just come out for an hour" I simply cannot handle it nor want to break down as I am doing right now in my "home" tearing up as I type this out...I try hard to not regret my past actions/decisions are they are what made me who I am for better or worse as yesterday is gone and I cannot change it. I made my bed I'm sleeping in it took ownership over the situation and am doing my very best to not repeat not repeat (yes twice purposely) my mistakes in my previous life and make the wrongs right or liveable. But today today is fucking overwhelming and just disgustingly **FUCKING MISERABLE!!!!** It just flat out fucking sucks. I'm sorry for the cursing but I have a potty mouth as is but its just what's going through my head...So here I am alone trapped in my head the regret reel on repeat missing the LOML regretting the pain and suffering I caused to those around me and I am very very disappointed in myself (I do know that I should not feel this way but I'm just in this state of mind) that I am letting an arbitrary date impact me like this as I have not really experienced this thus far. ..I know this was a long post and thank anyone in advance for reading. I don't expect replies. I don't want a pity party. I just finally could get it out in a place I feel pretty safe that I won't get trolled nor judged...Happy Independence Day please be safe. I cannot toast/cheers to you (bad luck little Italian in me =0) instead I tip my cigar to you all and thank the men and women of the armed forces past and present for their service to keep America free...Be good to each other...J. ..EDIT: Spelling..EDIT 2: Made a mistake it was the 4th of July two years ago not last year related to the ex last year I was shitfaced in my home alone...**EDIT 3 & Final @ 2130 CDT:** A kind of funny below in the comments that give me a chuckle to end the night...

Poor poor pour me another one...That's what I tell myself when I get in these moods. But the fact is I can have just as much FUN as I ever did when I was drinking. Probably even more. And there won't be any negative fallout like there usually is when I drink.
Good for you for getting that out of you even if it took awhile to hit send. Letting that stuff sit festering inside is what's toxic.  I'm slowly learning that myself...I feel your pain about not being able to go out and have a "good time" like everybody else. It sucks. But for me one fortunate thing about being a drunk for so long is that I've isolated myself so much I don't have any friends to be tempted with! Good thing my bf doesn't drink!..If you're a meeting goer you could try to hit one or two up. I know from being at yesterday's meeting you will be far from alone in the state of mind you're in...Keep on keeping on your path. :-)
I hear ya. It sucks. My wife is out of town so I went to my parents' place in the burbs to avoid all the beer at all the grill outs. They currently have friends over and we are all siting outside right now only I'm the only one who didn't grow up in India and doesn't speak the language they're using. That's why I'm on reddit on my phone right now. I miss my wife and my friends. But it's for the greater good that we're doing this. Hang in there you're doing the right thing. So am I.
Man your words are so descriptive. The hardest thing for me in sobriety is having to just fucking SIT in my emotions. I can't cover them up with anything. I can't drink to make the day go by differently/faster/easier. ..I have no words of advice other than man being aware and sober really fucking sucks sometimes. I hear ya...But holy shit you got 300 days tomorrow! Amazing. Keep it up. 
probably not much help but good on you dude. your only human sometimes things are going to smack on the face like a wet fish. sober people can have a pity party too! it's not exclusive to us. you've done pretty bloody well to get through the day intact.
I've spent my Fourth of July playing Left 4 Dead 2 for free on Steam. Sometimes you just have to find something and cling to it if not for fun then for a distraction. 
I read the whole thing.  I am sorry it's such a shitty day for you.  I'm proud of you.
I am puzzled by your post. You've been sober quite awhile and survived tough situations and reminders. Would it have been impossible to go to the celebration and have fun? You sound angry. You are grieving. The event at your brother's might have been an opportunity to face your fears. If it's been two years related to your ex is this not an issue you've worked on with you sponsor the steps or a counselor? ..The shame and regret you feel is addressed in the steps also. It was wonderful to acknowledge my guilt in gory detail and then to make amends accepting the past as something I cannot change. I just wonder if you know the opportunities for personal growth which are available in the 12 steps. (Throw out the god-stuff if you are so inclined) ..It's ok to have days like this but it sounds like you have a few heavy-duty issues blocking you from serenity. If you are miserable being sober it is high risk for relapse. Not every person on the lake today is drinking and they are still having fun. ..You're an articulate intelligent guy (except for that cigar) and sober for almost 300 days. That's an awesome accomplishment. I hope you find what you are looking for. .Make peace with the heartache so you can let go of it and her. You *can* be one of those happy people. Take care of yourself. 
I am sorry you are having such a rough day but glad you took the plunge and posted this to get it out. I hope it made you feel a little bit better. Tomorrow will come and this too shall pass. 
&gt;trapped in my head..As the mechanic says to the travelling salesman 'well there's your problem.'..An alcoholic's mind is like a bad neighborhood at night - you don't want to go in there alone. Spend a little time facing reality instead of your thoughts and impressions of it...I've been nursing a butt-hurt since a little before noon today. After I did my usual hiding in bed for a couple of hours I went outside and sawed tree branches instead. I applied the skills I've been teaching myself by meditating and made sure to concentrate myself entirely on the work at hand. That helped much more than feeling sorry for myself and I'm going to try to remember that the next time.
Ya it sucks there nothing I can say to make it  different but I feel you my man! We just have to push through it. 
thanks for posting
You're not alone.  I'm in a major funk today too.  Don't know why don't know what [if anything other than time] would bring me out of it.  My brain says a beer or twelve would take me out of it like it used to (distorted memories) but I know that's not really true.  I'm sitting here trying to think what a good buzz would do for/to me right now and honestly I think it'd make me so manic I'd go completely off the deep end and then sink to a horrible low.  I am just trying to ride this funk out instead so I can get back to feeling normal hopefully tomorrow.  Good luck to you here's hoping you feel better soon.
To quote Billy Bob Thornton from *Bad Santa*:.."They can't all be winners kid.".

I am suffering too but still sober it was hard watching people party today
Put my dog to sleep yesterday (heart tumor which blew up slowly suffocating him internally) then had to host my family most of who are very passive aggressive and have never been satisfied with my efforts. However talked to a sponsor had another one call me and got to touch base with another friend of Bill W. Tomorrow is a new day and one of the best things about a one day at a time program is that I get to decide when the day ends.....Which is why I am going to bed for a good nights sleep instead of wondering what if.....

Idk what time it is near you but can you maybe make a meeting? The meeting I made today was packed cuz 4th of July is a big drinking holiday. I wanted to drink. I've been feeling the slow slip coming on for a bit and it helps to get in a room with people that understand. 
Its 2130 CDT fireworks are going off I wanted a Diet Mt Dew but the Excursion is in the shop with a blown head gasket (last Ford evar) and I was thinking about how I totaled my Maxima while drinking and driving on the bike ride to the gas station. I walked in and right past [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/dWyQLCY.jpg) and my mind drifted to [THIS](http://www.troll.me/images2/fast-and-furious/whats-the-retail-on-one-of-those-more-than-you-can-afford-pal-a-sentra.jpg) sans the Sentra when thinking about drinking again...Anyways thanks again for listening er reading.
It's ok to have a bad day even on the 4th of July. The mistake is thinking that alcohol will make it better.

300 Night.
You'll eventually drink if you stay unhappy. Things got worse when I quit drinking because alcohol was the way I handled life--to celebrate to have fun to socialize to mourn to work--it all took alcohol. I went to AA and followed instructions and learned how to live without having to drink. Not easy not always happy--life's not all blowjobs and pajama parties but it is now meaningful and worth living.
Are you in 12-step? Why be miserable?
Are you going to AA or other meetings?  I'm sure there were some sober events in your town yesterday.  For me not drinking without a support network would be as going back to drinking.
