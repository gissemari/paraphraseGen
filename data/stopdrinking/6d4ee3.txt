Crazy symptoms. Day 2 was awful. Felt like a bad hangover. Still have a slight headache but no more shaking and feeling like I'm going to get sick to my stomach! .. ..If anybody is going through what I am the keys for me have been a steady diet of greens lean meat and water. Then some more water and more water after that. I throw in lemons or cucumbers to spruce it up. Also drinking lots of Gatorade and some Sprite to break the monotony. .. ..I also have had a prescription to xanax for years so that has seemed to help quite a bit with the anxiety and shakes. If you can get ahold of that it will help too... ..I am however struggling with lethargy (fatigue). Slept nearly 10 hours straight.. Feel very tired and hungry at night. Then I feel extremely bored. I know it's my body trying to get it's "fix". Does this feeling of boredom go away? Thanks all

Hmm why does my badge say 2 days.. =/
I have moments of extreme fatigue especially in evenings when I typically would've been drinking. The type of fatigue where I could just fall asleep. This is very unusual for me. I'm not a good napper. I also have times of really good energy which I hope will become my norm eventually. 
I still have fatigue. I nap a lot now :P....I just figure that after 10 years of being drunk on a daily basis my body/mind deserve a few months of rest. 
everything will change in a few weeks...each will be different....i was all wacked out the first week.  Sleeping habits have completely changed...and im sure they will change again in time....no more passing out unconcious
