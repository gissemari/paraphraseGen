I have been drinking for almost 10 years and started as a teen as most are expected to do where I live. Consequences and groundings were ever short and they were given only when I threw up not because of the drinking itself. I was a binge drinker mainly but had my spouts of daily drinking for weeks at a time. Since I've managed to be functional so far people wouldn't think I had a problem so I would manage to convince myself that drinking was just a normal and expected part of being  a young man..It wasn't until I started taking antidepressants and entered a manic episode that the drinking was exacerbated the black outs were constant and the regret was permanent. I became much more aggressive and yet "enjoyed" drinking much more. I wrecked my car got into fights and almost ruined my three year long  relationship with my girlfriend..Yet when I told my close ones I no longer wanted to drink they think I am just exaggerating my girlfriend thinks I am/ am becoming boring and my mother was insisting that I should drink with her during our last vacations..Perhaps I am only venting but ever since I  stopped drinking I feel a lot better but since no one knows my inner struggle no one seems to understand that I need help and support and I just don't know how to convey it or what else should I do to help them understand.

Most people will never understand. We are "wired" different than other people. Just do it for you and your reasons. If they don't understand it is okay. It takes a lot to make the decision you made. Good luck on your new path!
That's the crazy thing. It wasn't even enjoyable at the end...It was more just a way of putting in time. And until what? My last breath someday? That's what my life would have amounted to?
