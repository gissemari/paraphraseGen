(Almost 21 year old alcoholic [and addict of many things] male psychology and sociology student gay if that matters)..I've been 21 since I was 16 ya know? But I relapsed hard the other weekend. Now I have ten days. WOO! Every day an addict doesn't use is a blessing. I wish I could get my 90 days and some change back but today is all that matters...Anyway I need to prepare for this trigger now. I'll be going out with my family that day (no friends at home only tons at school) but what will I do when I carry around a legal ID that can purchase my death sentence?!?!..(I just asked to reset my badge. Clean date is Nov 1st of this year.)

Birthdays are just the measurement of how many times you circled around the sun which has little relevance to whether or not you should drink in my opinion. If you were in Europe you could have been legally drinking for years already but that does not mean that you should be any more or less likely to drink if you were over there.   ..You will get new social pressure from friends who know you are of age now to buy them beer if they are underage or go to bars if they are 21 and up but feel free to ignore those requests. If not using will make you a better person and/or prolong your life think of every birthday as another lap around the big ole gas ball and the coming year as a chance every day to finish the next lap as the person you want to be. Your friends will either understand your choice or maybe they are not the right kind of friends.
Someone told me early in recovery that "special events" (IE: holidays birthdays Saturdays....) are no different than any other day for him...because when he drank he drank every night.  That spoke to me so deeply it made it easier for me to make it through my own first sober holiday and birthday....Because for me it was true.  I drank every night.  Every day ending in Y.  For a "normal" person a holiday/birthday is a special occasion and a reasonable excuse to imbibe alcohol.  For an alcoholic they can be excuses to try to fit in...and feel "normal" because everyone else is drinking.  We don't have to hide so hard when others have booze too.  ..For a birthday you get to make your own rules and your own party.  Talk to your family about your plans to go out and let them know you want to stay sober....so personally I'd select a restaurant that doesn't serve booze.  I'd make plans afterwards non-alcohol-based such as a movie night or other special treat (like ice cream if you live somewhere warm) or a specialty latte at the local expensive coffee shop.  ..Celebrate your way but have a game plan an escape plan and sober support.  You can do it!!!..
