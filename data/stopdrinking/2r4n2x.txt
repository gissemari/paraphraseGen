I know the whole "alcohol is still a drug claim" but to me that was never the case. After admitting myself into rehab Oct 28 2010. I was determined to stop using but only "cut back" on drinking. I'm an addict that's how we function. But as soon as I got out of rehab I moved half way across the country for school. I thought that I was on a new path to finally get my training done and start my career. But booze got in the way of that. When you move to a new state don't know anyone. No family no friends shit gets boring. So I started drinking more and more. My parents stopped supporting me because of this. So I was on my own going to school and working full time. Shit got to be too much to handle. I moved here 4 years ago come Jan 10th. I dropped out of school to work moved in with a friend and coworker who is also struggling with drinking. I'm going to try and get him to stop as well but I just gotta focus on me right now. On the 9th I have to goto court for 2 consecutive DUIs I'm scared shitless but I know what I did. And I take full accountability for my actions. The only place I can go from here now is up. And I'm very thankful that I have my friends here to support me.

Yes. Alcohol is a drug...but sometimes it takes quite a while for us to realize and accept it.  Some people can take "drugs" such as alcohol...prescription meds...etc. without abusing them and getting hooked.  And then there are the rest of us.  ..Realizing it is time to change is important.  It is a shame it took two DUIs for you to get to this point but since you haven't mentioned any major accidents possibly you got off lucky.  A DUI charge is scary upsetting embarrassing and will cause challenges for you.  A vehicular manslaughter charge due to drunk driving is a whole other life destructive ballgame...so maybe you are changing just in time.  Thank goodness.  ..Your friend/coworker will need to work on himself and as you say you've gotta focus on yourself.  You can't give someone anything to help them if you have nothing to give away.  ..4 days is a good start.  You are heading on a challenging but potentially lifesaving path.  So....what is your plan to stay sober?  What support system are you putting in place? Are you going to get help or attend meetings?  What is the plan?  ..Posting here is definitely a great start.  Keep posting...keep reading...and stay sober.  I'm rooting for ya!
Welcome /u/gregrawry to r/stopdrinking--yeah this is a pretty difficult bottom.  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) it's how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I hope you join us on the sober journey.  Trust me: this dark shit of your own making could turn out to be the best thing that ever happened if you stop drinking and get sober.
