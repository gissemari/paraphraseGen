I'm obviously new not a long-time lurker. In fact I've been lurking for four days. I think I want to reflect and I would appreciate anyone pointing out any germane pieces of wisdom. If not writing has always been a way for me to process my thoughts and feelings in particularly complicated situations...Uh background I guess: At least a sixer a day for the past couple of years more on the weekends usually. What can I say? I love high-abv craft beer and have been blessed with hereditary high tolerance (grandpa was a sweetheart of an alcoholic spending the last 40 of 88 years drinking a 24-case a day without ill effect notwithstanding the medically-supervised detox he underwent as a precaution during his first long hospital stay a year before his death). So not exactly playing in the big leagues but enough to be a concern. I had also quit before--a couple of times and never very long. Maybe four hangovers in the last two years. Only occasionally make a total fool out of myself ("C'mon buddy gimme a kiss...")...I had an argument with my wife last Friday. We had both been drinking. I'm a happy drunk and she...isn't. So at some point after she had calmed down a little I said "You might have had a bit too much to drink. Why don't you go to bed sleep it off a little?" Well she tore me a new one for that ranting about how unfair I was being: I *always* have a bit too much to drink but when she does it's bedtime. ..I'm a fair-minded kind of guy so I saw her point right away. We agreed: From now on weekends only. So it was business as usual on Saturday and Sunday and Monday dawned. We'd used up all the booze in the house. After work on Monday I was super-paranoid. I'd been doing some reading and cautioned my wife to expect some withdrawal symptoms. Felt a little queasy after dinner but otherwise okay--probably ate too much...Tuesday I mowed and trimmed the lawn tossed some fallen branches from a stormy weekend we had a nice dinner went to bed. Wednesday I replaced the ceiling fan in our bedroom and she trimmed down the platform bed I'd built over the weekend ordered some pizza read a book went to bed. ..Uh...am I not supposed to be withdrawing? The worst I've been getting is major fatigue which I understand--I'm still not quite getting unbroken sleep and am probably not getting too deep and know not to expect much better for another few days or weeks. But at this point I'm starting to think that our original agreement--weekends only--is not going to happen for me. There's too much risk...The lack of a real sense of withdrawal sucks because now I'm thinking I could probably get away with drinking over the weekend and quitting again on Monday. Obviously I'm not all *that* addicted right? Only the fear of kindling is stopping me from taking that idea seriously. ..Then I'm thinking well two or three beers one night a month or two from now. That'd be a relapse sure but I'd start over again the next day. But that would be a kind of moderation and what I've seen on here suggests that it's probably not really possible; I have also seen a very good point which is: What's the point of sobriety if you're already planning your next drink? And why test this?..My wife and I were talking in bed last night before I went to sleep and she seemed a little alarmed when I told her that I wasn't sure I'd be able to even consider drinking again. It *might* happen but not today. And when it's tomorrow it's also going to be not today. And when it's the day after that....."I'm not sure I can deal with giving up wine for the rest of my life" she said. .."The consensus seems to be that it's not for the rest of your life just today" I pointed out. "And that choice is yours. Nobody's making you give up drinking on my behalf and I don't want you to feel as though it's your fault if I relapse at some point in the future. It's my problem."..That seemed to hit her hard. Her biodad is an out-of-control alcoholic. He's been through thirty years of drinking and sobriety and finally went on that one bender last year that ruins lives and has just spiraled downward since. Her stepdad is a functional alcoholic who at 70 years old still works part-time as a security officer at a state-government building and in his spare time constantly has a beer or a shot in his hand. So in both cases she's heard the same line before: "It's not personal. This is his problem not yours."..And I'm worried to be honest. I don't want to be that one sober guy who looks at someone he knows who has a drink every night and says "Man you have a problem you don't even realize." I don't want my wife and I to suffer from the difference in our situations. Maybe she has a problem maybe she doesn't. I just know that *I* do and things are going to have to change. ..It's not going to be easy. We have a wedding coming up in my home state in a couple of weeks so we'll be seeing my family around the same time. All but two of the alcoholics have died out; the survivors are sober more or less. But my dad likes a couple of beers a night my mom likes a cocktail after dinner and they both have had enough experience with family alcoholics that they'll know immediately what it means when I start ordering club soda with lime for dinner and turning down my dad's beer at home. I'm not looking forward to that heart-to-heart...One of my closest friends might be moving to town at the end of the summer; our friendship grew out of a shared love of beer. I don't think he's addicted but I'm concerned about the effect of my sobriety on our friendship. I suppose I'll find out how close we really are. ..Well...this is day 4. ..**EDIT: tl;dr:** Guy on day four of no alcohol thinks about shit.
----------immediate responses--------

About the fatigue I wouldn't worry so much about it. From what I've read the quality of your sleep will increase. I was surprised about feeling the fatigue too...A lot of my "close" relationships were built on substances and alcohol as well. Parents especially the mom who has an alcoholic mother drink daily in sometimes not-so-small quantities. Maybe the relationships will be tested maybe they won't. Worrying about it probably won't help though except maybe preparing what you might say to them and how you might react if they pressure you to drink...Unless it's intervention-level drinking I'm not sure we can impose the idea that others have a problem on them. It might be good to view not drinking as "this is something good for me" rather than "this is fixing a problem I have" but I don't have enough experience to know that for certain. It doesn't sound like you're imposing this on others at all. This is your choice not anyone else's...I've heard that others may get uncomfortable if they know you as a drinker and you give it up. Maybe that will fade with time since they won't know you as a drinker with more and more days of sobriety...Good luck to you and congrats on day 4.
Exactly whom are you quitting for? If it's not for yourself then you're gonna have a bad time. (I would link to a South Park meme here but I'm sure you get the gist.)..Sorry -- I don't mean to dismiss the other aspects of your post but your primary charge is to get YOUrself / YOUr drinking / YOUr life under control. You can be a positive role model for your wife if she wants to go there. Something to consider: what happens if your wife decides she's OK with drinking ongoing? Is getting sober an important enough goal for you that you could sustain that? That's further than "just today" (our common goal)... but have you considered it?..Sorry... I don't mean to be a downer. I'm trying to boil down your post to a few key elements. With regard to your friends and family how about a "not today" in response to a beer offer? Or an "I'd really like a seltzer and lime right now" in response to the same? You're not announcing a major change; you're just saying "I want something else today". ..I know it's tough. I suffer from the same desire to "fit in" with the current activity. But what I've learned in the past few years is that most people don't give a shit what I'm drinking if I don't make a big deal about it. I don't need to announce a major lifestyle change; I just need to say "not tonight". And that's the best way to deal with this change overall right? One day at a time...Total aside: Nearly every goddamned retailer asks me whether I'd like to contribute to a certain cause that they're promoting at every transaction. I've found that the same response -- "not today" -- works wonders. I'm not heartless; sure maybe another day I'll do it but right now it doesn't work for my budget. I don't know why but realizing that this is such a wise strategy for things OTHER THAN drinking has helped me deploy it for just drinking. ..Sorry for the mini-wall-of-text reply here. Rock that goddamned "not today" / "not tonight" response if you can!
