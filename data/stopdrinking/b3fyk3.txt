I've been drinking for 15 years and now that I quit I am struggling to make new friends without the liquid extroversion.  I am also open to tips on how to meet sober people other than AA meetings.  I am a married 30 year old male who loves the outdoors despises politics yet loves history and also loves video games! This post is kind of weird but who knows I might meet some awesome people! Mahalo!

We have a rule against soliciting PMs and outside contact with other users. [From our FAQ:](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_don.27t_solicit_or_offer_pm.27s_or_outside_communication)..&gt; **Don't solicit or offer PM's or outside communication**..&gt; It is inappropriate to request or offer to communicate with someone via PM Skype text message telephone email etc. We strive to create a helpful and safe environment. /r/stopdrinking is most helpful when all community members have a chance to weigh in. /r/stopdrinking is safest when all communications are done out in the open.
