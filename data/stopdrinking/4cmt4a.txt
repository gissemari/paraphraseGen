Hello Hump Day folks! How ya? Share your triumphs struggles and complete nonsense! ..---..**Triumph:** Spent Easter at a good friend's house as I had no place to go! Dyed eggs ate good food played with the pups and watched my dog learn a lesson! Oh and I hit eight months! Oh and I beat my sponsor in cribbage...**Struggle:** Lost the side view mirror in the van on the interstate - it literally just popped off. Also had increased anxiety levels when my dog came bundling down the stairs after facing off with my buddy's cat (nice cut on the pup's ear but otherwise okay). ..**General Nonsense:** Doing any reading movie watching or music listening? I'm looking for new playlists and reads!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** Coped well with a work crisis discovered I've learned things kept calm too :)..And it's my cake day!!..**Struggle:** still lots to learn!..**General Discussion:** looking for new reads too - I should remember to dip into r/sdbookclub!
**Triumph:** Today was my first day of therapy (group). So far it seems that I got lucky and was put with a good bunch of ladies.  I told my parents that I started my road to recovery. They were very happy and supportive. ..**Struggle:** Still having cravings. Still have to deal with an addicted parent...**General:**I got a haircut that I have been dying to get for a year did laundry and put some Doctor Who pieces in protective film. ..Found out Doctor Who is now back online on Amazon Prime. Yass Queen!!..Other than that not much going on here. ;).
**Triumph:** Had a good day even though nothing really special happened. Did some reading met up with some friends and picked up my 2-month chip. Every day is a new record! Haven't had any cravings for a while and feeling pretty well adjusted overall...**Struggle:** Still can't get shit done. I need to just *do* the stuff that I need to fucking do and *then* I can keep "working on myself" which has been my excuse for procrastinating my way into Buddhist books. I also need to start practising meditation daily not just read about it...**General Nonsense:** If you like weird films The Lobster (2015) is one of the more interesting ones I've seen recently. It's not for everyone but I really enjoyed it.
Triumph:  Survived an accident house hunting and an emotionally stressful discussion with the girlfriend sober.  Things feel crazy busy and stressful and I'm managing to keep my head on relatively straight...Struggle:  See above.  Girlfriend is feeling desirous of getting a little crazy at a bar and it's triggering anxiety about drinking and sexual permissiveness...Nonsense:  I NEED to do some reading!  I finally bought The Power of Habit.
**Triumph:**  Knocking a buncha #$!&amp; off my plate at work so feeling a little less "DAMN can I catch a break?!"       ..**Struggle:** Buncha #$!&amp; on my plate at work so feeling a little "DAMN can I catch a break?!"         ..**General Nonsense:** tonite's a lifting night! Skipped out Monday for Walking Dead and junk food but back on the horse - goodbye cortisol hello gainz!

**Triumph:** I went grocery shopping and didn't buy any alcohol even though that's a really triggering situation for me. I also possibly found an online AA support group to attend on Skype a few times a week...**Struggle:** I'm stressing a lot about some financial things and generally just having a hard time relaxing. My cravings aren't that bad but I can feel my depression creeping up on me more and more...**General Discussion:** I'm going to be watching [Knock Knock (2015)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3605418/?ref_=nv_sr_1) tonight. I have a feeling it's going to either be really great or absolutely awful. Anyone see it yet? 
**Triumph:** Got a few things done that I've been procrastinating about for two weeks. ..**Struggle:** In a new environment with people I've just met and will be here for a while. Everyone is getting to know each other by going out drinking so I get left out of the camaraderie. ..**General Nonsense:**  Watching Band of Brothers for the first time. How did I not watch this before?!?
T: I didn't drink on Sunday. S: depression anxiety insomnia. GN: mental staic.
Triumph: This is my fourth full day of sobriety after attempting to moderate. I had a super productive week at work and I'm going on a first date tonight!..Struggle: First dates/dates always seem like a big deal in my mind. Knowing how to bring up not drinking is always weird until I realize that no one without a drinking problem cares if you have one beer on a date or not. ..General: I am flying home to see my parents. Usually I only go home for holidays but I am taking a quick trip because my dad is moving to another country and my mom started preventative chemo. ..Cheers!
**Triumph:** Was massively productive today and finished "spring cleaning" the house in time for company tonight.  Housecleaning has never been my favorite past time but I had a lot of catching up to do since drunk me never seemed to notice those cobwebs.....**Struggle:** Having a houseful of guests arriving soon and not much room in our house. Also concerned that one of the guests will be looking for a drinking buddy....she won't find one here anymore...**General:** Psyched to have my niece and nephew arriving and looking forward to hanging out with them and showing them the sites.  Also I got to pick up the 4th book in the Dark Tower series from the library today. Looking forward to spending some time with it after guests leave in a few days (reward!).
**Triumph:** Hit all of my targets at work to bring in the best Q1 in our company's history...**Struggle:** Learning patience. I need to take solace in progress and not put too much pressure on myself. ..**General Nonsense:** About to buy a fitness tracker. Was thinking FitBit Surge to track runs heart rate and sleep patterns. Any recommendations? GPS is key for me.
T: I made it to the gym this morning! S: my anxiety made me a little unproductive today. Could have been worse. N: it's my brothers birthday! Hbd from 16 days sober 
**Triumph:** Maybe not triumph. Absolution? From the woman I was seeing when the drunk phone call halted all that. Feels great since I don't remember shit of what I said. ..**Struggle:** Anxiety from hell about finances since I cut back to human hours of work. Stupid I know I will be fine I ABCDE the hell out of it and I still have times of panic. ..**General Nonsense:** I finished the Times Eye series by Stephen Baxter and Arthur C Clarke. I think I will revisit some of Baxter's  series next. I have discovered Ludovico Einaudi and I am obsessively listening to his una mattina album like it is the freaking sound track of my life. 
T: Fifty Days!!!  ..S: Daughter has Scarlet Fever.  Yeah Scarlet Fever... wtf.  The ex took her to the urgent care this evening.  Fight with ex followed.  Daughter is currently sleeping.  Will drop off prescription for antibiotics in the AM...GN: Picked up Monster of God by David Quammen.  It's a non-fiction book about predators of humans.  I saw Batman V. Superman.  I liked it.  That's all I'm going to say about that.  I've been rocking out with the chakra balancing meditation music.
