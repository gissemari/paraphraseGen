I didn't drink! Not only did I not drink I had zero desire to drink. I have to thank Annie Grace's book This Naked Mind for helping me to reshape my brain to realize that alcohol is nothing but an addictive poison and that I want nothing to do with it. This whole retraining your brain thing has worked wonders for me. I have listened to the Annie's audio book as well as the audio book Alcohol Explained by William Porter about 3 times each and my brain has literally changed how it views alcohol. I struggled for close to 10 years to control alcohol by various means and this has by far been the most successfully thing I have found. I'm not sure if it works for everyone the way it has worked for me but if you are struggling with cravings etc I highly suggest you checkout the audio book versions of these books. If you can't afford the audio books search the authors names on YouTube and you will find a wealth of free videos that will help. Annie in particular has a ton of free videos on her YouTube channel...Just thought I would share my success with you guys and tell you DON'T GIVE UP. If you are in a recovery system that isn't quite working for you think outside the box. Do some research and give another method/system a try. There is something out there that will work for you!

Those two books in particular and this forum have done wonders supporting me.  Over the years when I tried to stop drinking I never made it more than a month or two.  This go-round I just hit 10 months and am feeling confident about the future.  I *really* wanted to be free from alcohol this time more than the last tries - which were more like punishments I imposed on myself for doing incredibly stupid things while drunk. I had to be in the right head space for others' stories and the books' simple logic to take root.  But they have really changed my outlook on drinking ethanol for 'fun' and 'relaxation.'
This Naked Mind is great. I'm about half way through my first read and I'm just disgusted with how I've let alcohol take over every aspect of my life. No more!
Even at 1000+ days I still follow the Number-1 Rule [Dry People/Dry Places](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/) and only go to events if there is a Very Good reason for me to be there. With barely a month in being in a place where everyone is drinking would have had adverse effects on my sobriety and "I will not drink" can easily turn into "Gee maybe *one* won't hurt."..I'm not saying you will never be able to go to stuff like this but getting a few months of sobriety under your belt is really the best thing. Good luck and if you go keep your glass full of pop at all times.
It took me about 6 months until I could go to my old bar/restaurant. Fruit punch every time. It's so delicious. 
It's a great book. She also has a podcast with some really good short episodes.
