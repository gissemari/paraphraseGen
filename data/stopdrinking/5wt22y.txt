----------immediate responses--------

300 days in a few hours here. Feeling pretty humbled. 
Had the guts to approach my boss about a promotion (dream job just opened up) and I'm in the running! ..Win lose or draw I'm happy. And some comments I left seemed to help others on SD last night. So pretty darn good end to Tuesday - looking to have even better Wednesday!
Triumph: 8 weeks sober coming up this weekend. Pretty much no cravings. Im comitted and feel better than l have in years...Struggle: having drinking dreams several times a week they feel absolutely horrible...Realized that most of my "friends" were just drinking buddies. That sucks. Still have some real buddies who support me and understand my situation fine fucking men.
Triumph: Got a new team approach to work agreed with everyone and in progress..Struggle: Constant; in the mind. There is one hell of a war raging in there everyday. The only thing I can do is keep re-enforcing the good guys with munitions against the god damn addiction sympathisers...General: Free writing daily whenever possible. Get the fluff out of your mind. Some valuable stuff might drop out of it; get that stored somewhere to be useful later. The rest of the fluff just let it go.
Busy but something another SD user said has been sticking with me: that a lot of us are delusional when it comes to alcohol...When sane people are tired they sleep. When delusional people are tired they drink. It *is* as simple as that...Happy hump day SD!
Will be catching up with an old drinking buddy of mine tomorrow. No doubt he will suggest a couple of beers. I am confident i can handle this as I have no desire to drink and fuck up my sobriety. I will not drink with u all today :)
*Triumph:* Sixty days tomorrow (badge is set not quite right--put in request to reflect accurately). Feeling pretty low at the moment but that's something. ..*Struggle:* Friendships are changing and that's hard. ..Also up for a big job and waiting to hear back but the anxiety from waiting on a response is having a deleterious impact. I've felt ill and listless for the last two days. I'll be crushed if I don't get it but also being offered the job seems scarier. What if I end up being a giant failure and I can't do it? I feel paralyzed. ..*General:* Cat cuddles remain the best cuddles. Also I've been watching *Insecure* on Amazon and it's fantastic. 
Triumph: it seems small but getting to 4 days has been huge for me. I was having real trouble getting over the 3 day barrier with multiple resets over the last month. It's given me a small boost....Struggle: unexpected  1000 on vet bills in one month is tricky! But it could have been worse and I will be insuring my pets from now on!...General:  did everybody else ruin the first pancake last night (may be UK specific)? Every year since I can remember the first one is a mess (my mother before me her mother before her...)
Won't drink today
Triumph: I reached 16 days. Haven't gone this long without in years. Yeah I was in jail for the first 9 but I haven't had a drink since I've been home either..Struggle: My mom has taken away all of my meds. She used to give me the meds at night but I didn't ask for them last night so it's been awkward..General: Focused on health. I need a job but I have to meet with mental health court tomorrow so I should just focus on that issue first. Jinkies.
**Triumph:** Week number 2 is steadily turning into 3 weeks of sobriety. Got a meal plan created and have really been making some progress in the gym. I'm going back to school and have Spring Break coming up all the free time will push my limits I'm sure but I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty tenacious in my will to not drink daily. .**Struggle:** The bad habits I had created while drinking are still sticking around. I have trouble sleeping and I have slept through multiple classes and have been late to work twice because of it. At least I am bright-eyed and bushy-tailed when I get there! Cravings are not as frequent I think today was my first day with one that was almost totally negligible. But the intensity of them when I do get them are pretty strong. Usually just looking in the mirror helps curb them. .**General:** Might be in the honeymoon period still but I am absolutely pumped for the future. Really looking forward to what week 3 holds. 
I chose not to drink in my dream last night caught myself just in time!! Happy hump day everybody. I won't drink with you today not worth it!
I will not drink today. Staying strong 
**Triumph** I went to the volunteering meeting in an animal shelter. I am a volunteer now and I'm going there tomorrow to take some puppies on a walk. It is more like therapy for me so I'm very excited. I plan to adopt one of the doggies later. I'm not exactly sure who will be saving whom literally. ..**Struggle** I'm in the point in my threapy when we dig into family stuff. It is super shitty. I feel very vulnerable. ..**General** I don't know when last 60 days passed by. I should be proud of myself but sobriety is more like lifestyle now. I never was full-blown alcoholic. I left the party early. It is easy to stay sober and not smoke now. It is super hard to stay with shitty feelings I feel.
Triumph:  6 days excuse my language but HOLY SHIT!..Struggle:  it's been a tough week at work we're already short staffed and my counterpart is on vacation so I'm wearing a lot of hats.  Though I struggle with wanting a drink (or 10) at the end of the day starting the morning clear headed and well rested is awesome. ..I will not drink with you today.  Hope everyone has a great Wednesday!
Triumph: My dog is currently asleep on my stomach/chest. It's the little things right?..Struggle: Feeling burned out. ..General: One of my strategies in staying away from booze and junk food is to keep busy/distracted. Unfortunately that meant going a little overboard with buying videogames last month. This month I plan on being a bit more sensible with my money. 
Triumph: I did not go out for Fat Tuesday! It's not a big thing where I am but most bars will try to make a thing of it by putting jambalaya on the menu and handing out beads. For me it was always a good reason to drink on a Tuesday but not this year :)..Struggle: Ongoing drama with my husband's ex who we're raising grandchildren with are wearing me down. This weekend I guess I was a scumbag by association because he didn't get a text message. It just feels like nothing will ever be enough so why do I even try? I know that is not true and I need to keep on going regardless of what others may think of me. ..General: Sorry you had a crappy week u/sfgirlmary I hope things get better.
I am starting to sleep less feel a bit more energized and focused as if I am finally lifting out of the fog. How long did it take you to do this? One friend said 2 weeks!
**Triumph:** Bringing balance back into my life after a busy month of work...**Struggle:** Balance. It's easy for me to swing to extremes. Too much work too much me time too much gaming... I know what I think is appropriate but it's harder to achieve in the moment...Sorry about your week sfgirlmary. I do think it's great when our struggles and triumphs are the same but we get through them without booze.
OK here we go. Day 1
Just checking in to say I have my beautiful girls today so I will not be drinking today.  
Struggle I guess: Having to fight to avoid picking up a wine bottle tonight. The weird thing is not actually craving alcohol that much like not sitting here dreaming about gulping down wine. Just had an emotionally draining day and in a real "fuck following the rules" mood. Cracking a wine bottle and giving the middle finger to sobriety has the same attraction right now that laying into a punching bag would if that makes sense. Anyway not actually going to drink. I wanted to vent but at the same time this vent is so pitiful that it didn't deserve it's own post. The vent is working because I am smiling at my own childishness while I finish writing this. Hope everyone else is maintaining a more adult frame of mind than I am...Edit: Also my three months rolled around today (technically yesterday its 1am here) and I forgot. Which I guess is... good?
Triumph!  I hosted my book club last night and there was plenty of wine but I did not drink a sip.  I announced at the beginning of the night that I wasn't drinking and no one batted an eye :)
Triumph: the fog is finally lifting. I feel energized. Did crow pose and tripod in yoga for the first time--been trying for years. Let it go now. .Struggle: being with my old friends who are drinkers.General: "it's getting better all the time" (beatles)
Day 1 down :) resisted the urge to buy booze while grocery shopping last night.
Triumph: A year sober is just around the corner. Life does happen and I'm getting through it with a clear head. ..Struggle: My parents are separating and my mom has to move in temporarily. This year I've been learning how to live sober and this situation isn't ideal but I have confidence in my new ability to adapt to life's uncertainties. My head is spinning but  I'm putting my sobriety first and sticking to the program. ..General: Learning to let go of resistance has built resilience. 
Triumph: I'm still sober. 48 days. Finished one day w/o sugar yesterday...Struggle: I'm still procrastinating A LOT and getting some flack at work because of it. Emotions- good and bad- are super intense. I cried watching Finding Dory yesterday- it's not even that sad a movie!..General: For me quitting was the easy part. Living a sober life is the hard part and I still have a lot of work to do.
First post...Triumph: made it through 2 weeks of Mardi Gras in New Orleans w/o drinking. My first two weeks none the less. ..Struggle: managing my anxiety re-evaluating my identity and my social life as a non drinker. Trying to get a grip on how much of a problem I have and what it means for my future while I haven't talked to anyone for real about it yet other than my non-sober but supportive partner...General: simultaneously eager and dreading going to a meeting for the first time next week.
!Que pasa miercoles?!..Sorry to hear about your crappy week Mary!  I hope it gets better...**Triumph:**  Not descending into depression over my tumultuous emotions. Just sitting with the feelings and not taking any action.  In the past I would be so reactive I would take possibly unnecessary or escapist action and end up regretting it.  I may be at the other end of the spectrum and not acting when I should but I think there's some wisdom in just sitting with my feelings until I really intuitively know what I should do...**Struggle:**  I think I'm probably in the wrong relationship but there are some really great things about my partner and I am really reluctant to end things.  I'm worried that I just want "easy" instead of valuing who this person is.  I'm worried I can't trust my intuition because of my escapist tendencies.  Working on making a therapist appointment to get some additional viewpoints...**General:**  SPRING IS COMING!!  And that means starting vegetables and flowers in anticipation of creating food and beauty in another 2 months.  First time doing so with my own house - I'm excited to start turning my backyard into an oasis.

**Triumph:** I made the step to see a therapist for the first time ever. I've been meaning to for years now and am proud that I sucked up my pride and am finally doing it.  .**Struggle:** Finding ways to fill the time that was previously spent consuming alcohol... evenings especially.  .**General:** Feeling pretty confident about tackling my issues head on. I may tell myself I'm a weak person but taking these steps a day at a time will only make me the strong capable person I know I am.   
Triumph: made it thru my biggest trigger a super successful work day without picking up a drink. Picked up some fried chicken instead went home and now I'm full and laying on the couch under a pile of cats. ..Struggle: I think I am going to have to give up on AA. I've tried ten different meetings and some a few times and I find almost everything about it alienating. I wish there were Refuge Recovery anywhere near me...General: the birds are singing at dusk again first sign of spring!  
I am headed to law school soon and schools all over are well known to have an intense drinking culture.  I went to my first couple social events at the school I am attending this past weekend and I got through them without drinking so that was a good feeling.  It will be difficult to do that for the next few years but I am confident I will be able to do that.  
Cheers to another sober day! I will join you all in not drinking today.
T:  If I wasn't where I was I'd want to be where I am.  (Huh?)..S:  My health hasn't been great.   I had a migraine for the first time since I quit drinking. ..G: Hepatic encephalopathy occurs when the body is unable to stop internal bleeding in the gi tract due to liver failure.   Bacteria in the gut eat blood and produce excessive ammonia.   Ammonia is able to cross the blood brain barrier.   It does stuff to the brain... like bad stuff confusion coma death.  Something like that.
