What's up everyone? 0bac here. I'm just checking in to say that living sober just gets better and better. The first month was a ride through Hell and all the hope in my heart shrunk to a faint and flickering pinpoint deep and distant in the darkness. What I'm saying is it sucked...Time + effort = healing. And the fruit keeps coming. As I began to drink heavily parts of me began to die. Since I quit drinking and started the Work (on myself and the way I make my way through the world) these parts have come back to life and even begun to thrive in ways they never did...It's still happening. I keep working. It's not perfect. I'm not perfect! I don't have to be and that's cool. I take steps backward and steps forward. As long as the forward steps number one more than the backward I continue on away from the abyss...And thanks for being here. I always tell people who are struggling with drinking that this is the place to come for support for advice to share the good and the bad. This is a great community. ..And I will not drink with you today.

Congrats on 8 months! I'm not drinking with you today!
Well said
Congratulations!  You and I quit drinking on the same weekend back in June.  So happy that we're both still here!
