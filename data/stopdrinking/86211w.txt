Unfortunately I caved in last Saturday.  To be fair I only drank 3 glasses of wine.  We went to see some friends who we always have such a laugh with and wine of corse.  My brain is now telling me it might not be so bad just to have a few every now and then.  Trying not to drink in the week still.  Desperately trying to lose a bit of weight.  Struggling with keeping my calories down with or without wine.  If I don't drink I crave chocolate etc.  I'm a bit confused.  Fancying a glass of wine too :/  Might as well ditch the badge.

In my mind your badge is for you.  Use it for yourself.  You can reset it if you like to show the number of days you have been sober.  You can just hide it too.  There's a box in the sidebar that lets you not show your flair.  When you stop drinking your body is used to the carbs so it wants something else to replace the alcohol.  I went on and on with ice cream every single day and still have it quite often.  But I improved my diet by adding in more fresh vegetables and making smoothies instead of ice cream daily.  What are you feeling confused about?  
Losing weight on your own can be really difficult? Could you try joining Weight Watchers or Slimming World? I did WW for a while and found it really gave me focus and kept me accountable. Plus you can still eat chocolate!
