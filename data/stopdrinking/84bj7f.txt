Alcohol has been taking over my life since I relapsed hard in December 2017...After many faltering attempts I'm truly ready to quit and understand how vital this is for me...Just got past two night sweat sleeps accompanied by terrible nightmares...When you begin to quit you realise how necessary it is....I need to make it stick this time. Ready to lean into this sub when I need to.

Glad you are back and ready to try again. IWNDWYT!
I'm ready to make this stick too. You can do this. We can do this!
I treasure those days now looking back on this period as a rebirth.  You're right when you quit doing it you realize how very necessary it is to leave it out.  You feel the reasons why so strongly.    You're doing a really good thing for you hang in there!  Remember water!  I will be over here somewhere in Canada not drinking with you today    
I m glad you re back. We got this together! Coming here every single was a lifeline in my first months. Every day every effort got me closer. I will not drink with you today.
Keep grinding bud you for this!
I'm scared of holidays and Christmas myself - it's gonna be a huge test for me if I get that far xx iwdwyt x
