I can't believe I have been alcohol free for 100 days in a row.  In the last 17 years I was clean for a few weeks at the most and that was because of illness.  This.  This is totally different...There have been struggles.  Desires.  Frustrations. Most importantly there has been happiness.  No more self doubt and shame.  No more feeling physically ill every morning.  No more phony friendships.   No more saying *tomorrow will be the day*.  ..I look forward to the next hundred.  And then the next and the next.  For the first time I can say I got this.  In 3 weeks I'll have hit 100 days with no cigarettes (shout out to /r/stopsmoking)..Now if I can get this exercise and diet thing down I could rule the world.  ..Thanks everyone!  You've helped more than you could know.

Nice work huckster. I hit 100 yesterday myself. Longest ever in 15+ years of drinking.
Huzzah!! 100 days is awesome! Congratulations?..What are you doing to make sure you stay with the next 100?  What are you doing different? Why is this different?
Well done!
Hail new centurion!
Keep it up!  Keep keep it up! (Said like a cheerleader in my head.)
