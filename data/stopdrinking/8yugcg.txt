I just relapsed yesterday and today when I had 5 days. Earlier I have had 4 and half months and just over 2 months so I know I can do it. The problem is that the anxiety just gets really gnarly after a few days sober and I don t know how to deal with it. I m starting again tomorrow and hope I can get through 2 days with bad urges before it gets better. Wish me luck!

Have you spoken to your Dr about your anxiety? I have real problems with it myself drinking made it worse! I'm now on meds that really help and can honestly say I've felt more joy and positivity in the last 6 months than the last 6 years! ..Keep at it you can do it! Don't let your relapse stumble you!
the first week is a motherfucker. onwards an upwards. i would try to identify the trigger and learn from it for next time...you can do this; relapses are often part of the process. for me it took several attempts and now i am sober for the longest amount of time ever since i started! it is possible. and it does get easier. ..hang in there!
