I  decided to jump into a relationship with a girl in AA - we both have about 2 months. I knew it was stupid from the start and she just ended things last night. Just struggling now which is expected. Im not gonna drink over it but it really sucks.

My sponsor told me not to make any big decisions in the first year of sobriety. Hang in there though break ups suck.
That sucks sorry to hear it...I try to remember this one in moments like this: "There is no problem that alcohol cannot make worse"..Stay strong. IWNDWYT
Well you live and learn. And you're right you don't have to drink over it. How is the step work going?
