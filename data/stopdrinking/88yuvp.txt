About 16 months ago I stopped drinking. I wanted to stop and I had to stop I was so tired. I was deep down the liquor hole. And then a year ago I found out I was pregnant(!!!) I'm now sitting here still a sober woman nursing my 6 month old and watching the Justice channel. I have never been happier (funny considering I get less/no sleep have more stress hardly have time to shower only eat frozen meals with one hand get spit up on..I could go on haha) point is life is beautiful and I get my happiness from my daughter my husband and so many other things. I could never find it at the bottom of the bullet bottle anyways.  Anyone else struggling sobriety is SO worth it. I found my pot of gold.  Ps- My husband who never judged me never made me feel ashamed held me when I was lost...I love you I love you so very much. .My daughter my boo boo thank you for choosing me to be your mom. I'll always be your tree. I love you to the end of the cosmos.
