I feel so full of energy hope optimism and gratitude about my new sobriety I just wanted to post about it because it's my second attempt after a very successful 4 months into and over Christmas but where I fell off the wagon just before New Year. ..I have seen a few posts about relapses and just wanted to say that You Can Do It! ..When I was back drinking and miserable (I posted about it  Back In The Arms of the Beast') I couldn't see how I would ever get back to where I was despite cognitively lining up all the benefits and remembering how happy I was. ..I was enjoying my drinking too much excited to be back in my favourite pubs with my husband drinking too much (and some more after at home) and to be  enjoying' watching the Six Nations again (always a great excuse to start early drinking safely at home at the weekend and be well and truly drunk before dinner). I was turning up at my new-ish job which I love with hangovers and feeling flat and uninspired. ..I let myself slip down that funnel fast and was up to 1.5- 2 bottles of wine most nights before I finally found the motivation to stop again. I picked up my copy of This Naked Mind and started reading it again and waited for the Wave. That's how it feels to me (and I'm not a surfer lol!) you paddle around on your board in the water aimlessly until you see that wave coming wherever it came from get ready and JUMP on it! ..For any of you paddling at the moment you can do it! If I can then so can you.  Go catch that wave.   And IWNDWYT.
