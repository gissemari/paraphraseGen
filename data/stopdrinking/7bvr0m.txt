After a nasty relapse after six months I'm feeling pretty low and helpless this morning. I hope I can be celebrating a year from now.

I'm sure you've heard this before but:..Just take it one day at a time
Well it's the day the Wall came down in 1989 which meant the beginning of a move toward freedom for a lot of people so there's that.
One day at a time and be kind to yourself. You're obviously very strong to get to this point well done :)
