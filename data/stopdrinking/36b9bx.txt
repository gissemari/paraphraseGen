I've almost got three weeks under my belt. Thanks everyone for all of the replies advice and words of encouragement. I still struggle with mild (and sometimes severe) panic attacks and my caffeine intake is something I'm continuing to work on but I've remained sober longer than ever before and I have you guys to thank for a lot of my success. ..So thank you! This sub is a wonderful thing and I hope to continue posting and sharing and being part of this community in the weeks and months to come. Best of luck to everyone.

I am new to this community but from what I've seen so far it's pretty impressive.  Congratulations on your three weeks!
