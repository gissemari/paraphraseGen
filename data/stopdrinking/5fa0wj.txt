The previous day has tought me a valuable lesson why drinking is bad. My wife was drinking yesterday and I was not yayy day 17 today!). I felt in need to talk about what happened this weekend and get my emotions reset. She was resentful to futile things not being herself. She shut me out completely playing a stupid game on her tablet while drinking. I thought about my years of drinking and MY numbness to HER pain in the past which I did quite frequently. I couldn't deal with all the stress and emotions so I drank. And back then she was left alone with her feelings. ..Well this time the tables were turned. I was just so close to just giving in. I felt like a emotional wreck a hollow vessel yet there was just enough room to lug around a great black block of emotional pain throughout the day. I have tried to be strong for my family over the last few days and kept it together as much as I could but I was falling apart. Then the mind tricks us right when we are at the edge of despair with emotions raw that your skin physically hurts from it. The mind whispers to just "go on take that drink just one you will be relieved from your pain". I was going to. I needed support desperately from her. ..I was struggling not to drink for three hours she had her last drink a while back and I saw her slowly return to normal. At one point she noticed my state of mind (or what was left of it) and we talked. We hugged we cried together and we talked about our pain we were there for each other. We talked about our loss she talked about her loss in the past. Our emotions open and bare I felt vulnerable but got soothed by touch shared tears and the feeling of not being alone in this. I felt better. She felt better. We talked for hours so long her voice was hoarse at the end.....I neglected a very important aspect both on the receiving and giving end. I never realised how important it is to give your emotions and feelings a voice. And how important it is that this voice is heard by someone else. Drinking on either end severs that connection plugs that outlet. It may be your partner a friend family member buddy sponsor in time of need we should not be alone in this. Keeping everything boiling inside. It will build pain anger and indifference and grows weakness. That one drink you can easily forego when your mind is sane might be just there waiting for you when your emotions are shot to pieces. ..It was an important lesson and strengthened my relationship with my wife as we needed this and the loss of a dearly loved pet has not been in vain. I came out stronger together with my wife. ..I sipped the last of my soda and found a peaceful sleep. ..I know it is still early (6:22) and quite deep for breakfast reading but here is my pledge; I will not drink today.

Great work!  Congratulations...One reasons meetings why were essential for me in the first days was it gave me a forum where I could talk about these types of feelings without having family or friends involved.  The people in the meetings weren't invested in the relationship wouldn't get their feelings hurt and understood that talking about it kept me from having a glass of wine...Got any meetings?
