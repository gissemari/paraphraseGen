So I was going to make a throwaway account because I have a lot to be ashamed of but then thought fuck it this is who I am and the mistakes I've made and this is how I'm going to change...Today is day 2 of me being sober. Ive had a lot of these days but this is the first time I am begging myself not to relapse. To make a long story short I've been basically a functioning alcoholic for the past 8 months. I would have anywhere from 2-3 drinks a day mostly beer but I would buy the cans with 8%alc by volume. Some days I would drink an entire bottle of wine and not even feel it. I once drank more then half of a bottle of whiskey and spent the whole night blacked out in the bathroom. I have 3 small kids and I can honestly say I've never driven drunk. I always drank on the days we had nowhere to go and mainly all this past summer since my oldest was out of school. ..Since it was an addiction we stayed home quite often. I'd plan all my chores and errands around drinking. My husband started noticing I had a problem so then I started hiding it. I used to keep my empties on the high dresser behind our door. Then i started throwing them in the trash cans outside before he came home so he wouldn't notice. He then would check the trash bins outside. Most of the time I hid it and didn't care. I would feel guilty after I sobered up but it wouldn't matter. I had a problem and wasn't sure how to quit. ..I think the reason this all started was one night when I was drunkenly feeling that loving feeling for my oldest son. He is 6 years old and has always been a difficult kid. His behavior is very hard to deal with because he's super smart like borderline genius level. And so he uses this to his advantage to push buttons and manipulate me to do anything he wants. I love him but after having two other small boys in the home I felt like I wasn't liking being around him. I know this sounds horrible. So one night I had gotten wasted and felt the biggest out pouring of love for him and I think every other day after this I was drinking to chase that feeling. Every time he would be badly behaved would be another day I'd feel the need to drink I used it as an escape...I've known for a while that I have a problem. I keep saying I'm going to stop and I will stay sober for a day or two sometimes 5 or 6 days and then immediately convince myself I need to drink again. Only recently did I feel guilty enough and strong enough to put my foot down and stop it. My breaking point was this past week. I took my kids into the liquor store which I swore I would never do but needed my fix and my husband wasn't going to supply. I felt awful the whole time and got a super dirty look and attitude from the cashier but I didn't care. I needed it in my mind and knew once I got that feeling my guilt would go away. ..This past weekend we spent at our friends house a few hours from us my best friend and I have birthdays one day apart so we wanted to celebrate as we do every year. Their entire fridge was fully stocked with all types of alcohol. I went nuts. I woke up Sunday morning had a beer at 8 am. Then had a shot of whiskey. Followed by another beer. Then throughout the day just kept hiding shots and beers without anyone even noticing. I spent the entire day more then buzzed. Before we left that night I wished I could just take their fridge home but knew I couldn't so I asked my husband to stop at the supermarket on the way home so I can use the bathroom. I went in bought a 40oz went into the bathroom and chugged it. Then threw the empty can bag and receipt into the trash and walked back out to my husband and kids in the car. I knew this was wrong but I was too addicted and partially buzzed anyway so had less guilt. Little did I know my husband said he too had to pee. The whole time I waited for him to come back I just KNEW he would find my empty can. I kept convincing myself he wouldn't realize it was mine but no my suspicions were right. He came back into the car quiet and weird. I asked what was wrong and he asked me if I had a drink while in the bathroom of a fucking shop rite. I couldn't lie he was pissed I cried and that was my last drink. ..I told my husband that I'm going to stop it's not going to be easy and I might slip up along the way but I love him and hope he will support me. He said he loves me too and he will stick by me every step of the way. I'm so blessed to have him. It's not easy to stop. I'm thinking about and wanting a drink right now as I type this. But I know I need to stop. I need to be a better wife and mother. Just because I can drink everyday and still get all my tasks done doesn't mean I should continue. Not to mention the damage and destruction it's probably doing to my body. I'm sorry this was a super long post but it felt nice to type to it. I'm ashamed and guilty but I want to fix it. Thanks for reading. ....

You're lucky you have your husband and you also have support here in people who understand; you're not alone. I've also gone several days without drinking after which i convince myself I'm fine and that I just need to take it easy from now on.  It's never worked.  Don't beat yourself up over what you've done in the past the important thing is that you recognize that you truly want to get better. It's not always easy some days I have to take it an hour at a time. When those cravings pass it feels wonderful that I didn't cave. ..I've regret drinking more times than I can count but I've never regret NOT drinking. 
I swear you've just said the exact things I've been thinking all week.  You're not alone and I will not drink with you today.  Tonight we will be sober moms
