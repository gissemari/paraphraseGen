Earlier this year I entered rehab for the first time with the help of my family. I was 31 and after a terrible breakup and losing a great job to a DWI for the next 4 months I fell into drinking a fifth of whatever I could a day. I had 3 seizures from withdrawals and drank upon leaving rehab. 3 months ago I began the monthly Vivitrol injection. Because of my financial situation I was able to receive 6 months of injections for free. I cannot express how life saving this treatment is. AA and support will help but for those like me (where it didn't) Medically Assissted Treatment is the answer. I'm happy to answer any questions about MAT or my struggles.

Been on Vivitrol over a year now. I can't say I've noticed a huge difference in things but it's helpful to know that if I did choose to break my sobriety I would get nothing good out of it. It's a fantastic safety net...I think a great way to share your journey on MAT would be to let people know how you got started on it. A lot of folks are scared of talking to doctors or even being open about alcoholism in the first place. How to get the nerve to seek treatment would make a great share here.
i understand vivitrol is very expensive if you have to pay for it out of pocket. if you can't get vivitrol after six months you should be aware that the pill form is very cheap in comparrison.
I took Naltrexone and it stopped the cravings for me. With the disclaimer 'Including a team based quit effort including diet exercise and therapy support'
