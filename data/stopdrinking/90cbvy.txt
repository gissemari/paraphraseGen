I've been drinking every night since I was 18. It started as a recreational thing because everybody does it right? Except I really enjoyed the escape from all of my responsibilities. Drinking quickly led me to a very dark place that only perpetuated the habit. ..I've been drinking every night now for 5 years now telling myself every night that I will wait tomorrow because the anxiety is ruining my life. Tonight after a few days of serious hindsight I'm ready to quit. Tomorrow starts day 1. I'm ready to get my life together. I know I won't need help with it because I'm confident. Regardless I feel like this subreddit is a good place to share my progress and struggles along the way. My best to all struggling with this love hate relationship.

Welcome! We're glad you're here. ..I waited so long to get sober. Every time I drank I swore I would get my life together tomorrow. And then that turned into a month and months turned into years. ..I'm so glad that for whatever reason I stuck with that decision 614 days ago. ..Check in here with us as often as you need to. We're glad you're here. 
Good on you.  I drank alcoholically for 30 years.  Don't be me.
