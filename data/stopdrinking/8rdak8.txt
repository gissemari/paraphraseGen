Hi everyone . I know I can't drink any longer  my life will not ever allow it . I've been trying to quit for good for a long time . Today I've drank 1 x in 30 days . I love it being out of my life . But my life ? I feel kinda lost . I'm looking for a job and I've always worked . I'm staying with my ex and I'm used to my own place .          I'm NOT sleeping off hangovers and struggling to get to and through work . I'm NOT guilt ridden bout texting people and being over dramatic about everything . IIM NOT DRINKING ! Time it just takes time to find a new way . Thanks for reading  hope your day is a happy one .

I completely understand. I think it will take a while to re-get to know ourselves and build a new system and way of being in the world. All the things I'd been successfully able to keep shoved down or mostly out of sight with drinking are right here on top now and I don't have any other tools built up to deal and I don't feel connected to anyone enough to get a break from myself. It's hard. I can only keep telling myself it will get better. It will get better. I won't drink with you today. 
Ahh I know that lost feeling.  What you have done was ripped the sheep's clothing off the wolf of alcohol which makes you feel disoriented.  Getting myself to knowing the sober me has taken a lot of time and is still a work in progress.  Hang in there Sobernaut.
I'm with you.. .I can never ever drink it again. ..You were not you on alcohol. You haven't been the real you in a while. Figure out you again!! =)
