I'm on day 9. I just got into a dumb fight because my SO wanted a beer knows I'm trying to/have quit drinking and I'm supposed to be cool with it... but something about my persona changed as soon as he brought up getting a beer and I could get an iced tea. It sounded so boring for me and I changed the vibe and... it didn't go well. I all of a sudden wasn't fun or in a good mood. I'm so frustrated that this ruined my mood and my SO's afternoon. Now I just feel upset with myself.
