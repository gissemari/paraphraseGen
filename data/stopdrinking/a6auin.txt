I have tried to stop a few times and each time last about 1-2 weeks before relapsing due to some trigger. A street artist in my city has recently been putting up posters saying "It's my responsibility and I will fix it. Repeat daily for a meaningful life." and that really spoke to me. I'm not blaming anyone but myself but have recognized a pattern of triggers and am seeking some advice to avoid them...I work a job that is demanding high stress and also fulfilling. I am on the top of my game professionally which I can't quite figure out how is possible due to my alcoholism. I also teach students in my field so a regular day is 8am-8pm and well I guess you can all have a guess at how 8pm-2am pans out. I am not religious and no offence intended to anyone but I think the idea everything is written down in a book and all we have to do is believe and follow is a bit stupid. I have been to quite a few AA meetings in different places and it has been a mixed experience. I went to a meeting yesterday which immediately followed a NA meeting so most people were there for both. I am not judging those people I have an addiction and my life is fucked up too but it was a bit too much. It was just a round table of catharsis and despair and as soon as I left I went to get a drink...I found one meeting that runs late Friday nights which is perfect for my schedule and the people there really attracted me. They got it. They worked the steps and the focused their efforts on outreach on working with others. Everything from homeless shelters to prisons and hospitals. I feel like that could be a healthy way for me to recover but am filled with shame and guilt that instead of going this week I stayed at home and drank...Any advice or input would be appreciated and thankyou for your time reading this rant.

You're doing the right thing. It sounds like you found a meeting you're interested in and you can go to the next one. Try not to be so hard on yourself-early sobriety is especially tough. You can also check out SMART recovery which is not faith-based. I haven't read it but a lot of people on here recommend This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It seems to have helped a lot of people. And keep reaching out to people. You can do this :) 
Wishing you all the best.  I've got no great advice but to be honest I don't think you need it.  I've read what you shared.  You seem self-reflective and honest about your situation.  You know what will work for you.  For what it's worth I don't think the AA meeting you described would work for me either.  ..It's awesome you found a group that does fit though.  Maybe you can interpret the shame and guilt you feel for not going as a reminder of why this is important for you?  I hope you don't beat yourself up too much about it.  Nobody's perfect. Maybe you could  send a scheduled email to yourself so you get it Friday afternoon with a link to this post.  Just a reminder from you to you that this late Friday night meeting will help you recover.  And that the outreach you'd do may save someone else who needs you.  ..Take care.  I will not drink with you today.
