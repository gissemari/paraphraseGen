... but being sober has enlightened me to some serious self-doubt problems that I didn't realize I was covering up. Usually I know when something is wrong and I let myself think about it and deal with it. But this just completely caught me off guard...I've only recently tried to stop drinking - April 26 to be exact. I got one week drank once then got two weeks and then drank twice. Not an intentional pattern just happened that way. I'm giving myself credit for having only a total of 3 drinking days since April 26 but at the same time I don't know if that should be enough for me...It's so sooo tempting to try moderating. I've heard what everyone has to say about that and I have no reason to think I would be any different - yet there's still this part of me that WANTS to be able to moderate and I might end up just having to know for myself that it's not possible. I'm trying to stick with this and not go down that deceiving path at least for now...I had some extreme self-doubt on Tuesday that made me realize drinking was covering up my own worries about my abilities my future and everything really. It was humiliating even in my own mind and pretty much self-loathing. I don't know if I've ever felt such a hopeless worthless feeling. I feel like my self-confidence in my abilities and worth decided to follow the alcohol out the door...And without alcohol I don't know how to cope. I drank last night and the night before. The night before I felt so much better. Last night it did absolutely nothing for me. I think I know at least some of the reason: now that this glaring reality has become apparent to me I can't make myself un-know it. I'm struggling and for as much as alcohol helped me push that under the rug before (completely unintentionally) the secret's out now and I can't put it back in my subconscious. Maybe I can numb it but I can't put it away again...I wanted to be healthier. I wanted to lose weight. I wanted to stop hiding bottles from people. I wanted to have energy to give my dog the exercise and attention he needs. But above all I wanted to have the mental clarity to write. Writing is my passion. That was however selfish my single biggest motivator to stop drinking...Now the attempts to stop drinking have enlightened me to the fact that that's one of the things I struggle to be confident about. I knew I had a lot of work to do but I thought I at least had POTENTIAL. Now with the rose-tinted glasses off I'm not convinced that I do. And this is not what I expected to be dealing with. If anything stopping drinking was supposed to make me feel better about writing not worse. It's not just the writing - that just happens to be a big example. It's everything...I reset my badge but to be completely honest I'm not convinced I'll get right back on the wagon. I'm trying to deal with this I really am and if I fall I'll keep getting back up. It's just a shock to the system that completely blindsided me. I knew being sober wasn't going to be peachy just like that but I didn't expect to feel quite this low...Even having said all that I still know it's the best thing to do for myself. But then what do I do for myself after that? I don't know how to move forward from here. But I want to. I'm going to...I feel like I repeated myself a lot and rambled but thanks for reading anyway if you did. :)

What a great post! I agree that it sucks to lose a sobriety number but what we're doing is just building another one and it could be even bigger than the last! So we're always moving forward if we're working on our sobriety...I suffered trying moderation for years. I heard others share their story about how it didn't work for them and how it made things worse but I had to find out the hard way. Boy do I ever wish I didn't. It made quitting drinking way harder.
