You're always welcome here. 
You can post here I relapsed this week and had to reset my badge
Are you sober right now? We have a rule about posting only while sober.
I'm  not  sure what caused it really. I graduated a recovery program in May. Then 2 weeks later slowly started picking up drinking again. I've lost my new found faith  in God. Havent lived in the state but 3 years. The "friends " I have now are all church friends. They want  to  push God on me. Saying I have heart issues to work through. Isn't there a way to get healthy and happy without God? Why can't I accept life sober? Keep in mind.  I have used since I was 14. (Anything I could get my hands on. I am 26 now)
Here is fine!  Welcome!
