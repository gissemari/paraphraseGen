Im officially on the longest streak of sobriety in many years. I should be proud and happy but somehow I just cannot bring myself to it. Maybe Im just not appreciating sobriety enough. Every morning I wake up with a clean head no grogginess or nausea from poisoning myself the night before. Why am I not appreciating it? ..Today was the first day back in university after the summer and boy oh boy do I crave a drink right now. Physically I feel much much better but my mind is playing tricks on me; telling me I need a drink to 'actually feel good' and saying 'Im cured'...Goddamnit I hate being an alcoholic but it is what it is. Ill keep doing my best and not drink. Anything but drinking...This is pretty much just stream of consciousness but I just felt the need to write something. Thanks for reading! ..

I understand your struggle! Keep your head up and reward yourself for doing good I've drawn up a calendar and cross off each day and just something so small gives me such joy! You get excited knowing that's there's something to look forward to each day !:) 
You are under no obligation to feel proud and happy.  You can feel cranky and miserable and downright moody if you want!  8 days is a tough spot.  The shiny newness of not drinking is starting to wear off but the comfortable non-drinking routines haven't yet kicked in.  Hang in there and feel as moody as you need to feel.  You got this.
