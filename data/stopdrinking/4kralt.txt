They say stories are the best way to teach morals. Songs are often lyrical stories or at least the perspective of someone else dealing with vices accompanied by an overarching point/lesson. These are a few of my favorite songs that relate to the topic of drinking alcoholic for those of us that moderating is extremely difficult if not virtually impossible. ..[.Say Anything - Do Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhm5TSJIKy0):  "Drink alone and watch TV you're expecting harmony. Tap your spoon to Silver Spoons anthem of impending doom." Followed by chorus of "you can do better you can be the greatest man in the world"..[.Sia - Chandelier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vjPBrBU-TM): This super popular song is entirely about this topic. "Party girls don't get hurt. Can't feel anything when will I learn?" "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier. I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist" and "Keep my glass full until morning light 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight." Observing the sheer hopelessness of the song may shed light on your own addiction. Of course it's important to give compassion to yourself. Therefore listening from an impartial perspective may be enlightening...[.Conor Oberst - Milk Thistle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIBoEZOVLIE): In lieu of quoting specific lyrics I'll just summarize this is a beautiful song about someone in the position desiring abstinence yet dealing with the implications of quitting. All the things drinkers avoid facing including our own mortality...While some songs like this could contribute to relapse (by thinking of the benefits of drinking) I think it is important to listen to songs like this to facilitate your own understanding of the importance of sobriety...Does anyone else have meaningful songs related to drinking addiction and recovery?

I really like the song "Wait for Me" by Kings of Leon...
Greg Laswell "It comes and goes in waves". Probably not related to drinking/addiction/recovery but it is to me!
For me personally these have always struck a chord with me..  .The Allman Brothers Band - End Of The Line  .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1ay-YDOlyk  ..Blue October - Into the Ocean  .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZES3nJQYJok  ..Blue October - Hate Me Today  .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDxgSvJINlU..

I don't have a song in mind but I just wanna say how inspiring that Say Anything song is! Max is such a great writer! 
Thanks for this! I love finding new music on this sub. Dave and the guys have been singing to me for a long time through all kinds of things I've been dealing with. This is one that I listened to a lot in my early days of getting sober... [Foo Fighters - Walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_77jIQxe1WY)

Wow!  I just fell down a Sia rabbit hole. She's fantastic and she's [One of Us](http://www.etonline.com/news/171692_sia_celebrates_5_years_sober_with_an_inspiring_message/)!
