My brother got married this weekend and as the best man I gave my first public speech. I generally spend the majority of my time alone with my dog and have historically avoided large gatherings of people (unless I was drinking) so needless to say I was fairly nervous to present a speech to a crowd consisting predominantly of strangers...Anyway I did the damn thing. I went up and gave my speech and even made the crowd laugh multiple times. I have an exceptionally dry sense of humor so I was a bit shocked at the level of laughter. While giving the speech may have been unavoidable but because I stayed sober I consider last night a significant step in my personal growth and development...I am so grateful to be sober again. I am so grateful to truly want to be sober. I am so grateful to have recovered from the worst relapse of my life and to have the opportunity to thrive and enjoy life again...There is so much for me to write but I will wait until I am one year sober by that time my house will no longer be my house and I will be traveling around the US in my camper with my dog with plenty of time to write...thank you
