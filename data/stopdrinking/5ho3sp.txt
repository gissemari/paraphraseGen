I have been struggling for a couple of days actually. I am very anxious about my big anniversary coming up. I almost feel like I am back in month 1 between wanting to use and the way that my emotions have been all over the place. I am also really anxious because I have been asked to speak a few days after my anniversary. I don't handle public speaking well. But I know this has nothing to do with me. It is to help others stay sober. Technically I could say no but I can't. AA has done so much for me I feel like that would be wrong. ..This is just another hurdle and I know that I can make it through. I just need to stay focused on the present moment and not get so wrapped up in what is going to happen tomorrow or the following week. I just needed to share where I am at. Writing out what is going through my head helps a lot.

A good friend of mine in the program experienced what you are describing as he approached his one year anniversary. (I did not don't know why). The good news is that he said it passed immediately. 10 more days! You can do it!
Thanks for posting this.  It's helpful to know some things I/others may feel in the future.  I'm not as many days along but God willing I will be soon.  So sorry you're struggling but thanks for helping out the rest of us.
