so its been more than 24hrs. feeling a lot better. still im afraid of the coming weekend. I know I will struggle and wont know what to do on Friday night. its my trigger - any time I have no commitments for the next day. I will stay near AA meetings throughout this weekend. I told my wife im going to try to quit again and she was supportive but really doesn't know what to do. the trouble is my resolve dissolves on a Friday and I become confrontational about my justifications for drinking. I will hold on to AA for dear life this weekend and pray that God sees me through.Thanks

I'm on day 4 of what is probably my 50th go at it. I'm focusing on how glad I will be in the morning when I wake up without a hangover or disappointment in myself for not having the self control to simply not open a can of something that is doing me no good and poor it down my throat. I won't drink with you tonight nor Friday night! 
Way to commit and great work on making it to today! It really helped me to get some numbers at the meetings and connect with some people built a little lists of guys I call and get coffee with after meetings and such. Good luck and have a great sober 24 hours!
