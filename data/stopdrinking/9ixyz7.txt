21 years old here. I made the decision to fully quit alcohol as it had taken its toll in the form of far too many blackout drunken nights and horrible hangovers. ..So its been 3 days so far but today was the real test. I went to a huge party...it was lit as fuck lots of free drinks around being offered. I was offered some directly from friends and I am proud to say I didn't have a single drop...It was tiring and a bit awkward to socialize sober. I really struggled a bit but I powered through it and persevered...and thankfully it paid off...I am proud of myself. Usually I'd always be the one taking the drinks at parties and getting drunk. I saw the appeal and temptation but decided against it something I really thought I'd never be able to do.

dude that super cool. Enjoy your morning tomorrow :D
Keep it going. I wish I had the awareness to stop at 21.
Go you! I love other people who quit in their young twenties. We get our whole lives ahead of us!
fucking yay!
