From a whole bottle emptied in your stomach. The warm feeling you get when it hits. To the altered state of waking up hungover ( still drink rather ). Being able to say what I actually feel. Just so much I love dribking. I love the negative I love the positive. I have been binge drinking sense I was 14. Sometimes it gets to a point where I can feel the nerves on my skin dieing but I love the painful "sensation". I've lost jhs to drinking friends and family. I can't lie though I like the desperation and the struggle it gives me. ..I naturally just do not care what people think or feel about me. My friends and/family know. The jobs I have been at never know and always assume I'm just a innocent child till I sleep inn and decide hey I don't need to go to work and then get fired. ..It's mostly controllable. I know I need to stop drinking as much or at all. I love it though. ..I need advice/help. I am not interested in the cult known as AA so please do not mention it.

Yeah I loved it too. I did not love the side effects you mention though - the losing jobs friends family. The desperation. If you enjoy that then why do you have to give up drinking? Sounds like you're not necessarily done?
If your still romanticizing and really love it as much as you say you do you're not ready yet. You will be one day though... Or youll die this way. 
Idk I'm gonna delete this now but that k you all
