A lot of people on here have very strong reasons for quitting. I am finding myself trying to figure out why i should too. I have really reigned in my drinking. I have limits and stick to them. I dont fight with my wife like i use to. I dont wake up hungover. ..I have been been (slowly) improving my life. I started working out. I have started volunteering on weekends. Im looking into going back to school. .. If anyone else has/had this problem how did you solve it? Thank you for reading i am committing to not drinking with you tonight.

It's one of those things where you can't quit unless you want to. Why do you want to? Are you lying about drinking alcohol or is it negatively impacting you? You have it reigned in for now - this is not an assurance that you will always not fight with your wife not wake up hungover.
It might the case that you don't need to stop. But since you're asking what are the negative effects you're experiencing?
We do what's best for ourselves.  Heaven knows that I tried to set limits for myself etc. and "moderate" my alcohol intake but it never worked.  All it did was prolong the misery for me.  I simply cannot moderate.  I've had temporary successes with it but never anything lasting.  I always wanted my fill of alcohol.  I kept fighting against the idea of abstaining because I thought alcohol was too important etc.  However it eventually "clicked" in my head that I should stop altogether.  ..For me its been a godsend.  I find sobriety so much better than drinking ever was and I never want to go back to the old me.  Still recovery was a process for me not an event.  ..That's great that life is improving for you; I hope it continues.  My only warning would be to be wary of the myth of the high-functioning alcoholic.  A person doesn't have to "fight with the wife and wake up hungover" to have a problem with alcohol.  Not saying at all that's you just saying that people with alcohol issues often reframe their situation to make it look better than it really is.  Been there.  Done that.
I think it's up to you whether or not you're at that place as others have said. A very wise (and very sober) friend of mine regularly tells me "You don't have to hit every rung on the ladder on the way down." So true but also - only you can decide what's right for you.
If we are honest with ourselves we know.
As long as I looked for "Why" I could not stop drinking...There is 'this reason' and 'that reason' and 'his reason' and 'her reason'....  I tried on reasons like a suit of clothes to see if it "fit" and felt comfortable.  I would even wear one of those Reason-Suits around for a few days.....   Then I'd trade it in for a new Reason-Suit....   But I kept drinking...Then I understood:  There is an **infinite** number of reasons to drink or not to drink.  ..If there is an infinite number and I have demonstrated that I replace them randomly without any appreciable difference in outcomes it brings me to this:  *The value of a Reason is* **zero**...When I divide by zero it get:  Undefined...The equation to find a reason to quit yields "Undefined"...That's why I was getting "no success"...When I stopped looking for reasons and Decided what is important in my life I realized that alcohol was not among the attributes of success for me.
