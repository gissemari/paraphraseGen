For real. I had so many day ones .... everyday was a day one. But I'm still here. So thank you for your stories. Even the relapse stories  happy or sad... they all got into my soul and helped me to stay sober.  I'm too sleepy to talk about my rock bottoms but I'm here and loving being sober. Ok I want a drink every day. There. I said it. But it's over for me. I am an alcoholic and I am grateful to you all. ..Fin

Happy days  
I'm happy for you friend! Keep up the great work! Did you go cold turkey or did you go in to a detox with medicine? 
Hey! The naltrexone made me feel like shit. They started me on 50mg and it would make me feel weird. Like slow. I can't explain it. So some people online were saying the same thing and so i broke it in 1/2 and that really helped. Then I felt normal. It works.  It made me feel like I do when I'm pregnant at first. If your a guy it's hard to explain. It's like you think about drinking but it makes you think it's gross.  Like you feel full.  It's weird. My doc told me I would get really sick if I drank on it. And I drank on it one time and nothing bad happened but I was at that point tapering off the pill and knew I would go back to drinking. You have good support and like I said my man doesn't drink so it helped me just having someone in my life who was rooting for me. Go with the naltrexone and see if it works for you.  Again it worked for me but i wasn't ready to quit. You got this!!!
