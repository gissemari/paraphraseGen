I'm making new life decisions and while I'm confident that I can beat this on my own if need be I could use the help. I've generally been high-functioning and done a rather good job keeping my souring relationship with alcohol a secret from those around me. If I'm going to beat this thing I figure that might have to change...If you don't mind me asking those of you that confronted friends and family about your struggles what did you say? Who did you tell? I'm just not sure how I can put what I'm feeling into words when face to face with those I care about.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3s0xyd/update_on_3_friends_who_did_not_respond_well/) is a post I made today as an update to a post about three friends I told who did not respond well. The comments in the first post really helped me see that I needed to be open with my friends that I felt I should tell. 
I'm replying to you because I'm in a similar situation.  I have built a reputation among friends as being a drinker.  I'm constantly being bombarded with requests from friends and family to have a drink with them.  I too would like to confront them and be honest with my struggles while politely declining the offers.  I'm not sure how to do it.  It is very uncomfortable right now that I have been avoiding situations and people that I usually drink with...My only response now is "that I'm trying to lose weight so I'm avoiding alcohol".  While this works sometimes it is really hiding the true fact that alcohol has a mental grip on me that goes far beyond just wanting to lose weight...Good luck - I hope we are both able to be honest about this someday soon.
I didn't really go out of my way to confront people. The vast majority of people I talk to accept the first reason with no followup. Anything from health to work tomorrow or medication. All of those have generally worked. A few friends knew about the crazy anxiety and are just happy I feel better. There shouldn't be any confrontation about wanting to feel better. ..For the first month or so I just hid from the world until I was ready to deal with it. Looking back it still seems like the way to go. 
I've only told a few close family members and friends. I'm a private person and don't need everyone knowing what's going on with me but I think if you let a few people in on what's up (especially friends you see often) it keeps you honest. Once they know it's out there in the open and you can share your guilt. It's not such a burden on you anymore and you have your own personal sponsors that you can talk to about it
