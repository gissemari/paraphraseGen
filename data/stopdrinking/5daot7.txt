Nearly 60 hours (doing hours makes it easy for me at the moment figured I'd stop after a week). It dosnt sound like much really but feels like a lifetime. Still not sleeping much but must have because of the crazy dream I had but preparing the kids for school and myself for work. I feel pretty good actually. Cautiously optimistic about it. ..I am lucky in a way I can flick a switch and just stop drinking and not really have cravings (not quite right but it's hard to explain certainly not white knuckling it anyway) just working through the detox. The big issue is my head and keeping it in a positive space letting emotions come and go can be challenging right now and always will be I suspect but that's ok it's just something I have to work on. ..Its the next steps that are going to be critical working through the why I want to drink to self destruction and preventing another relapse. It's always going to be hard work but I know it's worth it. ..Thanks all. ..

Great job on 60 hours! I was just here to post something myself including a link to an article. In that article (about what happens to your body when you quit drinking) the author mentioned that 72 hours was an important threshold for the body. So you're about 12 hours away from hitting that goal which is awesome!..
Good luck and congrats on your hours!
