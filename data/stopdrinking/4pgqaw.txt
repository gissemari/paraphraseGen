As always with vacations there have been a few strong cravings. But I have not drank!.The concert was absolutely incredible. If any of you ever get a chance go see Tim Barry. He is truly incredible genuine and his outlook on life will inspire you. ..And if you're into punk Against Me! They are mind blowing. What a time! I probably would have died in that mosh pit if id have relapsed last night. ..Thanks everyone for all the support! Checking in here is sometimes my only game plan but it does work!

Sounds like a blast! I haven't heard of Tim Barry but I've seen Gillian Welch and Dead &amp; Co since I stopped drinking and both were amazing. Also got to enjoy a bonfire jam session at a small local festie. The music was fantastic - and I remembered it all!!..Glad you had fun. :)
Clearly a different generation but my first sober vacation was to Las Vegas and I saw Elton John (first sober concert in years).  Also an amazing performer live.  But the best part was he opened the show with "the bitch is back stone cold sober as a matter of fact!"  I took it as a direct sign to me.  xo.
yay you!
