I'm coming up on 1 year of sobriety and of mostly lurking on this sub.  (I'll take this time to thank folks for their great posts.  It's been really helpful to read about so many people experiencing similar struggles and achievements.)   I'm going through something that I don't recall seeing before but I'm sure someone else has experienced and overcome.   I'm feeling more worried now about a *future* relapse than I have been in several months.   I'm not fighting specific urges to have a drink but I've been frustrated with constant thoughts of drinking in the future.  I'll go to a BBQ out to dinner work in the yard on a sunny day etc. and I just find myself day dreaming about the same situation in the future when I'll be able to drink "normally."   I'm not craving a drink in the moment but am fantasizing about the future. I've even caught myself saying to myself "When I hit a year I can try drinking again."   Now that one year is just around the corner I'm worried because of course I never really drank "normally" but always to get drunk and I'm sure that's what it would be like in the future.  I'm having to consciously remind myself that having day dreams about future drinking really proves that I'm an alcoholic..."normal" people just don't daydream about drinking at all.  Any thoughts on resetting my perception on what should be an exciting milestone but is now one I'm actually dreading a bit?

I know those  someday  thoughts are tough...I decided that not drinking was life or death for me.  I was not close to death in the physical sense. But I was a walking corpse. And eventually drinking would have taken my life...I know that if I drank all my thoughts and energy would focus on the drink.  I want to be present and live.  It's a choice between living life or existing for the bottle for me.  If my brain tries to offer another option I know it is lying...Best wishes to you! IWNDWYT 
I'm glad I'm not the only one who wonders about this.
