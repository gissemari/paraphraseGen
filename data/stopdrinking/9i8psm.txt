So I'm going to preface by saying that my personal practice is I'm a sober person who prefer sober places. That's been essential in my recovery. And there are life events that are important for me to attend and at this point in my sobriety are not an issue for me to attend when there's alcohol provided I follow things like leaving the minute I think about drinking always going with a sober friend who happens to be my husband so that's pretty easy and basically anything that puts my sobriety first...Both weddings had completely different energy. The first wedding was full of love and really bizarre people and I mean that in a wonderful way because I consider myself a little bit bizarre well a lot bizarre and I connected with people that I didn't know and felt completely comfortable enjoying myself socializing talking about funny experiences about the groom without any desire for alcohol. I also am grateful for the free Diet Cokes and Juice pouring all night. I woke up so refreshed although I probably had way too much caffeine...Last night's wedding was tougher. My heart went out to the bride and groom. There was very obvious family tension even mentioned in the cringiest way in speeches to the bride and groom and a whole lot of really unhealthy drinking. However I went with two really hilarious women as well as my husband the women are co-workers of my spouse and I definitely want to hang out with them again. They drink alcohol and I was able to engage in their level of silliness totally sober without social anxiety...That included for me attempting line dancing with seasoned line dancers. Singing opera in the bathroom and getting really goofy with photos. I don't need alcohol to allow my ridiculous and fun self to come out. But I thought I did for a long time. Because I had and have so much Social Anxiety that I used alcohol to allow this part of me to come out. But it's still there!..When the alcohol was manifesting in bizarre ways my husband and I left and returned home to watch some Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I also samg Lonely Island on the way home completely sober and just feeling celebratory for connecting with new people who I really enjoy...The point of this is to say that there where points in my sobriety where I thought I was really boring that I'd never be able to go out and dance again like a goofy person because I'm a terrible dancer and that I would forever be incapacitated by anxiety...I still struggle with my demons but I was able to allow my true sober self to be silly fun and enjoy life high on positive energy around me. And a whole lot of sugar. Let's be clear about that.

Thanks for posting this and congrats on 600 days!..Most days I'm able to get by without too much trouble if I stick to the thinking about one day a time. I get pretty stressed when I think about the future and about how I'll handle events like weddings. It's nice to hear success stories that deal with navigating those waters. Thanks!
