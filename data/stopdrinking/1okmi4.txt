Hi!..A few weeks ago I stumbled upon this subreddit had a look around and liked what I saw. I don't know if I will stay in the long run but as I keep coming back reading and sometimes commenting if something strikes a chord at the moment I thought I'd introduce myself...I'm sober for a few years now. At the start I was in detox and rehab and can only recommend it if you have any possibility to do that. Since then I visit a local support group once a week and would recommend that as well. I usually don't like the counting of the time I or anyone else has been sober since in my opinion it doesn't really matter. All that counts is that I'm sober now. But as I don't really know you guys I find the badges here really helpful to know where someone is standing so I just requested one as well...Have a good day without too much of a struggle.

Some of the badges are resets. Some newbies have a lot more sobriety than you would think.  Jus sayin...
Welcome. Glad you decided to join us with a little "flair"! Hope you'll hang with us. 
Welcome aboard.
