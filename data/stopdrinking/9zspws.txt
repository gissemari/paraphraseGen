Hungry. Angry. Lonely. Tired. ..When I was in outpatient rehab two years ago my counselor told me that if I felt any of those things I was more vulnerable to relapse!! I used to write HALT on my hand as a reminder and it did help. I figured I would share as it may help somebody! So when you're feeling hungry angry lonely or tired... eat de-stress find/make a friend sleep etc!..I wish you all another happy healthy 24! IWNDWYT!!

Love this!    ..IWNDWYT! 
Excellent! Thank you. Slept and ate way too much today recovering from my drinking temptations yesterday. IWNDWYT
So true. ..Thanks I will remember this when I get weak and almost always it is one of these basic things that is like a trigger for cravings.
So true for me too.
That's great! I think you can substitute sometimes "HALT" with "re-connect with your body" if it would be helpfull for you in some point of perception. When flashback strikes and trauma get inflamed(hello r/CPTSD) not only I instantly feel low depressed lonely rejected and angry but also blocked all over my body! The thing is to turn on "the robo-mode" i call it and to force yourself to just start doing something and it almost always helps out to cope.   
HALT has helped me many times. I learned it from a post on this subreddit a while ago.
I heard that in addition to these ones that being bored is also another high risk state for going back to drinking. All super helpful to stay on guard!
I needed this today. I am trying to take one minute at a time as we speak. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I haven't slept at all and spent the night reading posts or preparing texts to family members I shut off. I can barely sip water. I just wish I knew why this person in my body can so easily be talked into drinking. But I'm also very often angry lonely and tired
