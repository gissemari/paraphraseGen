This is my day one after countless day ones this is it. I'm going to kill myself if I continue drinking. ..I think I'm going to my first meeting tonight but I'm scared. What are they like what should I expect? How does AA work? I know I need help and support and it would be nice to connect with people who are experiencing the same struggle as me.

It's a great support network. Don't feel the need to speak at first if you don't want but everyone is there to listen and help
  hey. Glad you posted. Glad you are still sticking with not drinking. I attend AA and have since the start of my sobriety this time around. In general my experience with AA had been positive. ..What is it like? .The length and format can vary at AA meetings (60-90min) but most meetings are ran as such: ~10 min at start will be dedicated to the  secretary  a person who runs the meeting. They will say some pre-scripted stuff about AA and welcome the group. Then they will usually turn the meeting over to a fellow member who will share their story or a quote for ~10-15 min. Then the meeting will open up to the attendees like you. You will be able to respond to the speaker share a thought on your mind or your story. You can pass if you don't want to talk. In general aa meetings are a place to connect with other people who have a desire to stop drinking. ..Meeting formats can include: discussion meetings (as described above) literature meetings (reading out of AA books &amp; discussing) or speaker meetings (where someone talks the whole time no discussion). ..Go to a few meetings as the feel and dynamics are unique between meetings. There are Young People meetings women only men only LGBT focused open (meaning supportive friends/family can come with) and closed (closed to non-alcoholics more intimate and great for people really nervous about opening up) to name a few. Meetings should be marked as such online and in meeting schedules/guides. ..Go to meetings until you find one that fits you. Where you feel most comfortable. If AA is helping we recommend you attend at least one meeting every week and get involved. We call these  home groups.  I love my home group. It's at these home groups where you'll really connect and develop friendships with other sober people. I would not be sober if I wasn't having fun and my sober peers and I have fun!! Who would have thought? Lol.
Congrats on day one and on your decision to hit a meeting...Yes it's scary. But you *do* get to connect with others and it helps to know we're not alone. You may need to bounce around a bit until you find your tribe but you're gonna be just fine ;)...Here's a piece about [what happens at a recovery group meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_what_happens_at_a_.5Bwhatever_recovery_group.5D_meeting.3F)...There are many paths to recovery I'm glad that you're actively working on yours :).
