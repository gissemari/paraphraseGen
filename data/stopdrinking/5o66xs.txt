I posted here earlier this month excited about my first day then about how I messed it up and had a drink well as soon as I had the one it turned into a week of drinking daily and significantly more than normal. I was disgusted with myself and just kept going. I started to blame others in my rationale even this sub for not giving me an outpouring of concern when I admitted to slipping but it's my fault and I need to take this incredible struggle a lot more seriously. ..But here I am again. I will not drink today. I will not drink tomorrow but today is all I care about. I love my family and myself enough that this needs to happen. I will lose weight go to the gym again (I blamed the New Years crowd for my recent lapse in working out but it was the booze) and just be present. I just started going back to school at night for a computer science degree and alcohol has no place in my already full life. It has ruined my past opportunities but this time is different. No more. ..Let's not drink together.

So glad you're back!  It takes some serious strength to climb back up on that horse but you did!  Proud of you. I won't drink with you today.  
Welcome back. Day one for me as well. ..And I ain't drinking with none of y'all!
Good for you for starting over!!..I won't drink with you today. 
You came back! Great move! We're here for you you're on the right path...just keep coming back :). 
Realizing it's time to make a change is half the battle think of all the alcoholics out there who are drinking tonight and still in denial that they have an addiction. Everyone in this sub is already doing great on their journey whether they've just relapsed or have been sober for years.  I'll stay sober with you today. :)
