I'm back. Thankfully it's not because I relapsed...I decided to leave Reddit (and in particular this board as it was the only real sub reddit I was using)  as I tend to have a bit of a set against social media. A lot of it can be narcissistic and just shows a side people want to see. Plus while this board is good for instant feedback it's not a program like AA or SMART  recovery. You can get the feedback but not the tools so to speak..However I overlooked how important that feedback is/can be. I'm now on my 97th day of sobriety but I've noticed recently that my focus hasn't been what it once was. The indecision the obsession was increasing and the ability to be present in the moment was starting to wane. Having relapsed before I know these are the first steps towards drinking again..I'm very much in the camp of people recovering their own way. If people find that a method isn't working for them they should try something else. However instant feedback and community is so damn important and I had it in spades here..Glad to be back and IWNDWYT!

Welcome back ! Yes I agree the strength of this community has been a huge support for me to reach 301 days without a drink. I also go to AA and weekly therapy. This is a cunning disease we are fighting. I find it takes multiple methods to keep on the path each day.  IWNDWYT 
Yes!  I use meetings AND this sub and it works really well for me!
Welcome back!!  I agree with you this sub is a great tool in my Recovery  but one of many...Keep up the good work.   IWNDWYT 
Sweet! I am with you. Use what works. Meetings 2- 3x a week a sponsor and SD are currently my go tos! Therapy in the past and a short use of naltrexone helped me to get over my relapse hump of 30-45 days! Nice job reaching out...happy to not drink with you tonight !
