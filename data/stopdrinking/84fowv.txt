I assume that's changed for most of you...But yesterday I relapsed I saw for the first time ever(I think. blackout epiphanies never stick) just how much importance I have given alcohol just how many things i've put beneath it and (HA!) that I can't be around casual drinkers...I stayed away from an invite from one of my few remaining non perma-drunk friends felt so lonely and "it's just this one timey" that I drank a little so I would feel like I fit in at their bar gig &amp; then once I was a little tipsy I went to the off-license to get more alcohol instead of actually going into town to see them(which is the reason I drank in the first place at least for that night)..My hangover isn't so bad at the moment but i'm embarrassed at how my thought processes over the year have changed..

Unfortunately far too late. For me booze was a part of fun things then it was a part of everyday things then one by one those things went away and it was just the booze. It's silly when you look back upon things.... the fun times would have been just as much fun( great company)- might have been better it's out the sauce- less unintended bullshit emerging from my mouth better communication with my SO more nights I truly remember... hell you know the list. 
When I was asked to make a list of the most important things in my life and getting drunk was the first thing that came to mind. Ouch.
