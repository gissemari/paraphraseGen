I was a binge drinker so I can go for weeks and months at a time without "craving" alcohol... people can drink around me or I can go down the liquor aisle and it doesn't even phase me... because of this it leads to thoughts of "I can have just one" and "maybe I wasn't as bad as I thought I was because I don't even want one"... I tend to forget the misery of binges that turn into full-blown benders.....I had over 2.5 years of sobriety and all it took was the stupid thought of "I can have just one because I don't actually want one but I'll have one just to socialize"... that led me to a 14 month relapse... ..Am I the only one without cravings & white knuckling & salivating at wine displays?
