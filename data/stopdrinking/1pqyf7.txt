25/m..So I've been sober now for 40 days. This is officially the longest I've gone since the first time I got drunk. I was 16. ..**Support system(s):** This subreddit has been huge for me. It's like a little meeting in your pocket. There have been multiple times that I've found myself in a trigger situation and pulled up this subreddit. It's pulled me back from the brink. This place is truly invaluable. ..AA has been another huge help. Full disclosure: I'm a long-time atheist and have no problem with the religious aspects of it. Of course all groups are different. My home group isn't affiliated with any local church so it doesn't come up very frequently but it doesn't bother me when it does. Sobriety is a peak with many different paths. ..**Struggles:** The first struggle was overcoming the cravings but those didn't last too long and are increasingly fleeting. I never feel like "uh oh I really *need* a drink." Instead the "cravings" (for lack of a better word) come in the form of nostalgia as in "A beer or two would be really nice right now." But then the sober voice comes online and asks "Okay but how many times have you had just a single beer?" and my brain says "uh never." And the sober voice says "Right and how many times have you ever kept it to just two beers?" and my brain says "uh never." So while I sometimes feel a sense of longing and fond remembrance the reality is much more grim. And this knowledge keeps me sane and sober. Surrender for me is the only option. Alcohol is going to kick my ass every single time I try to tangle with it and the only for me to win is to not even climb into the ring in the first place. ..The other hardest part which was more physical was correcting my sleep schedule. I put in more than a couple 24 hour days trying to fix it. It took a few weeks but my sleep schedule is now balanced and I keep relatively normal hours. In tandem with the messed-up sleep schedule the other difficult things to bear were the drinking dreams. I'm almost six weeks in and they've *mostly* subsided but it was rough for awhile. In those dreams I was always a few beers deep before I recognized that I was dreaming. But the worst part was waking up from those dreams because there would be a few seconds of panic before I realized it was a dream. And afterwards I would always feel weirdly hungover for a little bit. Foggy and slow. But as with the cravings they don't occur nearly as much anymore. ..My social life has somewhat lessened which I'm okay with. I don't get invited out as much because my friends know I'm not drinking and they're generally supportive of it. Right now I need to be working on myself which is also why I'm not dating anyone at the moment. I'm in no state to be in a relationship with anyone right now. ..**Improvements:** All in all through all the emotional ups and downs that seem to come with early sobriety my life has improved dramatically. Immensely. My sobriety has touched and improved literally every single aspect of my life. Early sobriety has been rough at times but there has never been a doubt in my mind that this is absolutely the right path for me to take. I don't have hangovers anymore and this alone has improved my clarity tenfold. I'm sharper at work because of it my productivity is through the rook because I actually do stuff during the day now instead of sleeping off a hangover all afternoon. ..I look better. My face isn't all puffy all the time and the bags have disappeared from under my eyes. I've lost weight without altering my diet at all. I smell better. I'm quicker to smile. And sometimes I swear that even the blue is coming back into my eyes. ..My finances are slowly and steadily getting back on track. I didn't realize how much money I was spending on booze. And I had the nerve to bitch about being poor all the time. ..This whole post has been somewhat of a ramble. I apologize for that...I think that when I first started out on this crazy journey of sobriety I expected sobriety to cure all my woes. That I'd quit drinking for a few weeks get my life in order and I'd be shittin' rainbows from here on out. ..This is not true. The only problem that quitting drinking fixed was my drinking problem. It has however touched on all other areas of my life for the positive and while it hasn't fixed all of my problems it makes them so much more manageable. Mishaps in life are no longer hair-on-fire fuckin' catastrophes. I can deal with them. ..This is the best decision I've ever made for myself. ..Even the colors seem brighter. ..

This is so cool! Thanks for all your positivity it's really what I needed to start my day off on the right foot and for that I thank you. Keep up the great work and have a beautiful day as you have definitely made mine better just with this post.
Print this out and keep it. It will be a great bit of nostalgia and may help you later when the last drink seems far away...I have a journal from my last year of drinking.  It has been most helpful.
Thank you for this!  It is inspiring and motivating!
Very inspiring...and well written. You have a gift for concise articulation. It's a skill I envy. Congrats and cheers to your continued growth.
This is awesome.  Thanks so much for taking the time to post it.
Congrats on the 40 days I hear ya on the dreams they make me feel exactly the same way. Good to hear they are becoming more infrequent.
Wow I relate to so many things! I've been sober 17 months and I STILL have "drunk dreams." They are so realistic and in them I've already started drinking and I feel awful about it. After I wake up I am thankful that I am in control and can choose not to take that first drink. In a way even though I hate those dreams I think it shows that I still have a healthy fear of relapse and am not getting complacent. As for emotions when I was 40 days clean I was a MESS! Even though I felt a million times better physically I was an emotional roller coaster. I would become irritable and angry for no reason. Just try to acknowledge what's happening and know that it will pass. My addiction counselor told me that it would take awhile for my brain's chemistry to regulate itself esp since it was now without a chemical I had been feeding it almost daily for years.  But it gets better I promise! and HELL YES it is the best decision! Congrats!
