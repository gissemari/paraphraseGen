Visited my mom on Thursday. I knew this would happen. I'd avoided visiting her because I knew she kept large amount of alcohol (cabinets full of liquor boxes of wine). I don't know how to visit her without relapsing. I love her so much and I want to visit her. She's also an alcoholic but not as bad as I am. I don't know what to do. I know she's unable to face that she's an alcoholic but I don't want to not visit her again.

Me being serious about my quit i would visit her off site like a coffee shop or something.
Also I'm so glad I've only gotten downvoted when I'm asking for help. Great community. 
Have you talked to your mom about this?  She doesn't have to get sober with you but maybe she can make it easier for your time there.  And for me it got easier to be around alcohol with time.  I needed a month or two away from it but now being in its presence isn't a big struggle.
