I have a good life 2 young sons and a loving partner. I've been accepted into a TAFE course part time and I'm really looking forward to it. Sometimes  I just can't help myself from buying a bottle of wine. When I'm not drinking I tell myself how great it is. I feel great in the morning. I'll go a few days and then I cave and buy a bottle. I always tell myself a few drinks in the evening won't hurt but we all know it does and we all know it's not a few it's the whole bottle. I don't want to do it anymore but I'm struggling to stop. I don't know why. I guess I've always been addicted to something since I was young and I don't know how to get out of this vicious circle. My mother was an alcoholic and when she was drinking she was a completely different person to the sober loving and caring mother I loved and adored. I don't want my sons to have to go through what I did with my mama.

The sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit has links to all of the major recovery programs. They exist because they work. AA was really the only option for me back in 1992 but it worked. I hope you find one that works for you. The good news is that you don't have to face this alone. Good luck. Keep us posted. IWNDWYT 
Keep coming back here!! IWNDWYT!
That you recognise it's a problem is the start.  I wish you all the best and this sub has helped me to see I am not alone.  Lots of good books too to help rationalise things if you are interested.
Whenever you want to drink think about your reasons for stopping! Works for me! Get out into the sunshine IWNDWYT
