thought I'd try this page out for a little moral support.   ..I've been a drinker on and off for about 12-13 years now... i have stopped for a few months several times before with out issues and I'm doing it again.  i find my trigger is when something happens that flares my temper.   ..on a day to day basis I'm fine with it mostly i consider myself to have my habit mostly under control...   I've never had it inter-fear with work and any other commitments I've had...   its always been just something i do at the end of the day while i play computer games.    the struggle is hard though when you finish work at midnight or 4am live alone and literally have nothing to do (cant make noise) or people to socialize with.   ..I guess the fact that every place you can buy boose from is closed makes it easier.  but it doesn't stop me sitting here really wanting to have a drink and play games.  ..anyways thanks for reading...edit:   left out the crucial part...   haven't had a drink since before i went to bed Christmas night.  so i guess that makes 5 (almost to the hour) days since my last drink.
