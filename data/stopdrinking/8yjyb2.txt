Hello all..Just checking in to sort of celebrate my 10 weeks/70 day milestone.  So many of you have helped me on my journey.  I just wanted to say thank you to every single person here:..* **Lurkers** \- You remind me of myself when I first started considering starting this journey.  Keep coming back maybe one day you'll finally decide to start your own journey..* **New members** \- Your posts remind me of those early day struggles detoxing sleep problems lack of energy self-doubt etc.  We've all been there and when reading these it reinforces in my mind that I do NOT want to go through all of that again!  I also enjoy trying to motivate you all to stay the course..* **Members with around the same time as me on this journey**  \- You provide me with a sense of camaraderie.  We've got this!.* **Members with hundreds or thousands of days** \- You provide me with inspiration and sage advice.  Thank you for continuing to post here and be active helping guide us all..* **Those who stumble** \- I have seen so many posts about this and they may be the most helpful of all for me personally.  I have seen folks making it a day or two then posting that they are starting over and I have seen folks with years sober posting for a reset.  You ALL are an inspiration!  What you see as failure I see as tenacity and bravery you are committed you fall and get right back up again and try and one day if you keep trying it will stick!  You all are my constant reminder to be vigilant and to remember that this is not easy and I cannot entertain the idea of moderating my drinking in the future no matter how long I stay sober! ..Thank you all for being on this journey together!

Stop Drinking is why I am sober.  The kind brave people here saved me. ..Congratulations to you on 70!  You are awesome and I'm proud of you.  IWNDWYT 
Good job! Do not settle. Go for more. Make those 70 days forever.
I like your bit about new members here and how they make you reflect on what that first bit of struggle was like. I feel that same way. I read through posts here and in moments of weakness I use those early struggles to remind myself why a drink would just bring all that back again and quite frankly...I do NOT want to go through that again...Congrats on those 70 days. Feels good don't it? :)
Twinsies!  Here's to day 71. IWNDWYT
