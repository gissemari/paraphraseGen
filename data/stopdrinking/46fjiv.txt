My brothers in the hospital. I read his suicide note. I found him overdosed. Anyone would go drown their sorrows in liquor right? Anyone would. I just want to not feel anything. 
----------immediate responses--------

I'm sorry. I wouldn't drink because there is nothing so bad that alcohol won't make worse. Your brother needs you and you can't be of help if you're drunk. It sounds like you could use more support. What you've been through is traumatic. A therapist and AA meetings made it easier to stay sober. 
Two years ago-me would today's-me would not even have the fleeting thought... Your brother is in the hospital you still have a chance to help. ..If I was you this is the time I would have to be the strongest and the most sober (mind and body) your brother needs help how are you going to be there for him if you are in the puddle?..I would play the tape forward and look at where you end up if you take that first sip where does that lead to where will you wake up?..I will not drink with you today and your brother. ..

How terrible. I am so sorry. ..I would like to think that in that situation I would be strong enough to imagine that me being drunk would certainly not make him any less critically ill and would absolutely make things infinitely harder on everyone else. They would have 2 to worry over instead on one to worry over and me to help them...Much love warmth and strength to  you your brother and your family my friend!
Does drinking help your brother in any way? Maybe you can set an example for him by staying sober.
I have been severely and chronically depressed and anxious for most of my life. It would break my heart to learn that a sibling ended up harming themselves due to the stress of dealing with me and my illness especially when part of my desire would have been to spare them more pain (this understanding of suicide is part of the jumbled thinking of depression of course). ..This is a serious trauma for you and you must be in incredible pain and worry right now. Of course you don't want to feel anything: no one wants to feel the kind of pain that comes with finding a close family member close to death and the experience of reading their suicide notes and all of the gut-wrenching awfulness and helplessness and terror that accompanies it. You are human. ..One tenet that has helped me in serious situations like yours is the reminder not to do anything that will make a situation worse (even if the only other thing I can do is "nothing except lie on a couch paralyzed"). Sometimes I have to pace or walk to nowhere with headphones on because structured exercise requires too much cognitive organization. ..I know someone who recommended freezing oranges for times of overwhelming emotion because they encountered them during severe episodes in hospitalized settings although it's not an immediate access solution. When you feel as though you are melting down or need SOMETHING to pull you away from overwhelming emotion or pain you take out the frozen oranges and squeeze/dig your fingers into them as hard as you can. They're very cold and solid-but-squishable feeling the tearing skin and crushing pulp releases citrus oils that are fragrant and it gives you something tangible to focus on in the moment and buys you time to self-soothe. Plus by the time you're done squashing them you're pretty juicy and if you're able to at that point the ritual of taking a shower buys you a little more time to regroup. YMMV of course.
Goddammit...Yes anyone would want to numb that type of pain.   But you wouldn't shoot yourself in the foot to distract you from the pain of a herniated disk....Stay talking to us and see if there's an AA meeting nearby that you can go to....I would also call my Dr and my therapist to let them know what was going on....Stay with us Finn.  Drinking will not help you or your brother.  It will bring you a temporary reprieve followed by an amplification of the pain...You don't need that.  Stay with us.
I am sorry to hear that your brother is in so much pain. We know that picking up is not the solution. My mother-in-law is in the hospital and she is dying. No hope for recovery but just eventual death. My wife and my children are dealing with it the best they can I am too. I get to be there for her and my children and our extended family. A shoulder to cry on a comfort and when things finally do go south I will be there to make people laugh and help pick up the pieces. If I drink today I will be hurting more than myself in the process. I know it hurts right now but try and be there for others who are affected. Support those around you (including your brother). Take care out there.
Don't back down. Not once. This is a time of growth. You have to cross this bridge no matter the cost. In a week you will look back and thank yourself.
My heart goes out to you and your brother.  I completely understand your urge to drink but please don't.  I want to tell you that he needs you sober right now but I don't know that.  I do think that **you need you sober right now.**  I will not drink with you today; I will hold you and him closely in my heart.  Blessings.
No.  Not everyone would. My buddy found his 16 year old daughter dead on her bedroom floor from an aneurysm a few months ago.  He didn't drink. He surrounded himself with friends and loved ones and allowed himself to feel sad about something horribly sad because his family needed him at his best. 
If I were your brother I'd probably want you visiting me instead of away drinking. I don't know. What do you think?
Anyone would/could but not anyone **has to**. ..A while ago you decided not to drink. Maybe for a while maybe for a moment. But you stayed with not drinking for a while. ..If you are 100% positive you want to make the decision to drink drink. But if there's 1% of you that says "Maybe this isn't the right thing to do" then wait until tomorrow. ..Tomorrow ask yourself if you are 100% positive that you want to drink. If you do drink. But if not give it until the next day. Wait until you're sure. 
Oh man. I am so sorry to hear of your situation. Please hang in there and you and your brother are in my thoughts today. I don't see how drinking will do anything to help you your brother or anyone's situation. Yeah it's tempting though. But by drinking now to numb your feelings it just means you'll wind up having to feel those suppressed emotions later on. May as well deal with them now (while sober) rather than having them come out all sideways later on down the road. Good luck and hope things improve quickly.
How would alcohol make any of this better for you? Sure you'll feel numb now but what about later? You will have to deal with these emotions either way so why not deal with them with a clear mind. Be there for your brother instead of running away from these emotions. Helping another person will in the end make you feel better...Im really sorry by the way. I hope your brother recovers.
Hit the gym. Ride a motorbike. Do something that overwhelms your mind with the physicality of it. Find some space from the moment.
Yes I know I would want to drown my sorrows.  I have so many times drank my feelings down.  Now if I'm sad I just feel sad and go for a walk or just cry and it passes.  Sorry you are hurting my heart goes out to you.
I am sorry for your pain. I find that drinking at a time like this doesn't work. Sorrows are not drowned. And the pain only grows. I hope you can be present for your brother as he recovers. I definitely feel your pain
I hear you man but obviously maybe some tranquilizers or short term benzo's might be the way to go you get to drunk and you might do things you wish you didn't or experience things you wish you wouldn't.
Thank you all so so much... I haven't drank today. I'm going to bed sober. I've cried a lot. It feels uncomfortable. I hate crying and don't even remember the last time I cried. But I know I'll be glad for this in the future. I'll have to get through this time either way I'd rather come out of it healthy and stable. 
.Hallo! ..I hold onto board posts for a while. .How did all of this shake out?..
