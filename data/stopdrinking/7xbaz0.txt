So here I am about to make it to one week and I'm excited. Every Monday I play DnD at a brewery. Every Monday I would have a few drinks and then proceed to get home drink more and play games. This would lead to Tuesday to being a work at home day with barely any work completed...I got past my biggest challenge only had ginger beers at the brewery (which were nice and spicy!). Thanks stop drinking for being there for me. Monday's will always be my toughest day but I want to come here Tuesday have have my day counter increase...I will not drink with you today.

I love ginger beers (spicier the better)!  I save them for super special occasions where I will be in drinking situations such as a family get together.  
Yay! I've never tried ginger beer and I love ginger and spicy things. I always thought it was actual beer though! And I never liked beer that much I was a vodka girl. I'll have to try some now!
