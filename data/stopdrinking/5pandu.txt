I've been feeling a little itchy lately too. I have been taking the time over the last few days to come here more often and comment / participate.  It's helping. I'm also going to seek out some real life support like meetings. I might try a few different groups like SMART refuge and AA to see what I like best. I don't know if you do that already but it might be worth a try. At this point I need all the help I can get! I also think I need some sober friends to hang out with in the evenings. I won't drink with you today!!
Thanks for sharing these feelings.  With a few weeks behind you I can understand this feeling.  I must not drink with you today so have a great one!
The daily check-in does wonders for me. I think it is a great way to get in the right mindset for the day.
Glad you'll be checking in more :). I commend you for coming here and knowing that we need to remember we have a problem with alcohol and we must not drink today. I'm here with you and thanks for the reminder!! Great job on 80 days :). 
We can do this! I will not drink with you today =]
Good job spotting the warning signs! We always need to check ourselves from time to time and make sure we are moving forward and not going back to the thoughts and behaviors that made life hell for us and those we love. Stay vigilante friend!
No harm or weakness in that.  We have an issue and this place helps us.  
You drink today the brain retraces it's footsteps you re-energise all those nerve endings in your brain that are affected by alcohol so it's harder to get away again! Suddenly it's day 1 again!
Right there with you.
