Welcome! It took me a few years to find my way to extended sobriety. This sub is a great support :)
Welcome! This is a great place to be. I learned more about myself in a few months here than I did for a decade rambling on my own. It really picked up pace when I began participating. I will not drink with you today!
Welcome! Stop Drinking saved my life. Congratulations on 5 days! Good luck! IWNDWYT 
Hi! Your post could have been mine :) Good luck! IWNDWYT
