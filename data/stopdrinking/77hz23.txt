Im approaching a year of no booze. Dont know whats been going on lately honestly. Been having a lot of intense intrusive visualizations of drinking. It makes no sense to me. I play the tape through i know i dont want it. Shit just comes on strong and distraction seems to not work.. any suggestions? Struggling :(

Each morning after you wake up take five or ten minutes and ask yourself whether or not you're glad you didn't drink the day before. It might seem silly but when I do this it helps redirect my thought process. It's a daily reminder to myself that though drinking may seem like a good and rational idea at the moment it won't end up that way. Your next morning can either be filled with regret and grief or with gratefulness and hope. That's your decision and it's the easiest yet most important you can end making  
I work a program and have several practices that support my intentions of being unimpaired...Got any meetings? Sober support network?
When we grow old parts of us wither and fall away. With a full cycle around the sun approaching maybe your old self is freaking out about its irrelevance and staging one last protest before it goes down. Note its complaints its desires to return to the old reality the familiar and rote and say goodbye. Sometimes it feels strange to cut a new path--sometimes you feel lost and like you have no feet. You're not lost. You're here. Keep walking.
