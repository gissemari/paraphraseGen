YaHOO!
thanks everyone I went on a walk this morning and actually jogged half of it I haven't done that in years :) I have actually put on a few pounds in the last month because I replaced my evening drinking with ice cream and on vacation I ate to my hearts content instead of drinking so Im anxious to get to the next level of this sobriety thing and take off some weight.
Wonderful! Keep up the good work!
Keep it going full steam ahead!!
Woot woot!
Way to stay strong and sober!
Congrats man! In my experience getting to that first 30 days was epic! Keep it up!
