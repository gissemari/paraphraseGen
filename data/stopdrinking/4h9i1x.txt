Starting day three today - proud and happy that I woke up and chose not to drink today - and I'm slowly trying to wrap my brain around my top priorities and wanted to check in. I've been finding SD super helpful when I start feeling anxious over the last 48 hours.....My drinking has typically been tied to anxiety. I'm a major procrastinator and that's also been a huge source of anxiety in my life. After my #1 choice to not drink today was made #2 was to knock out a video project that I should have been working on all week. I feel like crawling back into bed but that wouldn't be good for me right now.....I'm also feeling very torn up by the conflict with my SO caused by my drinking. He's been giving me the silent-treatment since my last binge drinking episode although we've talked before about that being a major trigger for me. When I feel alone or punished I've acted out in the past. I did some digging and was lucky to come across this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2vqpwz/well_that_didnt_go_so_well/cokm5jt.. ..So here's the plan and I hope I'm heading in the right direction:..- I will not drink today..- I will work on the overdue project that is looming over me..- I will give my husband the space he deserves to handle his own pain and anger..- I will not expect him to be supportive ..- I will support myself by not drinking today

Sounds good. A while ago someone posted here that procrastination is an addiction. Since I have found that an interesting way to work on that problem myself. I can see better now it leads to a mindset that facilitates bingey drinking too...in myself at least. Procrastination is like this kind of cognitive arrhythmia that depends on a kind of selective consciousness as it relates to accountability enjoyability of life...all kinds of stuff. ...I am putting this to words for the first time here which is probably obvious. ..Anyway good luck on the project and nice job on three days!
I could've written this myself. Felt horribly anxious today and I too am only on day 3! Procrastinating is what does it for me too. I try to remember that finishing something and really being proud of it really does feel better than drinking. Here's to us for doing work instead of drinking! :-)
