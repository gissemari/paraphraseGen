I was on my way to get some booze this morning in a serious moment of weakness and an NPR podcast came on today about addiction. For once I didn't feel so alone hearing all these people call in about their struggles and the recovery process...I went to the grocery store instead and got some tea and powerade. You are not alone and you can do this. It's scary. It can be  isolating. But you are not alone...IWNDWYT. I love you all.

What was the podcast?
Good job!
There are other addicts for sure! 
It became easier for me when I began to think of my alcoholism as a disease. Realizing I'm not alone in this affliction has also helped me to understand this better and not fight it. 
IWDWYT! 
Addiction podcasts have been a huge help for me. Since Right Now is my favorite but I also use Recovery Elevator. When I need them they definitely help me feel less alone!
That's so encouraging to hear. I'm going to try and find that episode. I'm happy and relieved I get another opportunity to not drink with you. .
