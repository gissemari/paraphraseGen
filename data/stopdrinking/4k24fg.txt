I'm thankful that I have an opportunity to make a positive difference to young people's lives...I'm thankful I have a hobby that gives me the opportunity to travel and meet a diverse range of people...I'm thankful sobriety has given me clarity of thought to take a proper objective look at my business and the service I'm looking to build rather than try to survive day to day. It's scary as it will involve turning potential clients away which will take courage. Hopefully I have the wisdom to accept the right clients and reject the wrong. If I can master this I will build a successful business.
I am thankful that I will be hitting two months sober soon. I just weighed in yesterday and I've lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 pounds since quitting.
Great friends with appropriately placed words. They're like a warm hug from a big woman. 
I'm thankful that the weather has been nice enough to enjoy the outdoors with friends.  Hiking is something I discovered in sobriety and it's brought me so much joy and peace.
Thankful to have a roof over my head.  Thankful that I live where I can be free.  Thankful that I have enough to eat.  Thankful for my family  which I love so much.  ..
I'm thankful despite my shortcomings I have time to turn things around and while life is difficult for me I am trying...And chorizo ramen...sweet sassy molassey it's better than typing "cats being jerks" on youtube.
I'm thankful that my sweet tooth has finally calmed its balls. I was going super hard with the carbs for the first two weeks but have managed to get back to my normal eating habits and lose five lbs which makes running easier which will make me lose more weight. Shout out to the power of compound interest on my investment in myself to be sober.
I'm thankful for this subreddit and for all of the wonderful supportive people who come here. 
I'm thankful to still have my health despite the things I've done to my body. .I'm thankful to have a supportive family they mean the world to me..Though I wish none of us had this struggle I am thankful that there are others like me whom I can learn from.
Having a hard time being thankful this morning but the quote about being thankful for adversity spoke to me...I woke up to find that my pet bird had died in her sleep last night. No warning at all...After losing my shit for about an hour I just took a deep breath made a plan for me day and am posting here...I will not drink today and will deal with this on my own terms.
I'm thankful for friends and family that love me no matter how much I've been pushing them away.  Thankful that I didn't drink yesterday and that I have another opportunity to do that today.  Thankful for SD's support and encouragement.  ..And I spent 2 hours with my adorable baby niece yesterday :D That's what sobriety gives me!
I'm thankful for life. ..6 days ago I totaled my car in a single-car wreck. Thank God I was the only one involved. ..I had tried to quit drinking before and I'm ashamed that it had to come to such drastic measures to make me wake up and see what I was doing to my life. 
I'm thankful for this cup of coffee sitting in front of me and that I have the stomach to drink it...I'm thankful that even though I woke up sore and tired I didn't wake up lightheaded dizzy or nauseous.
I am thankful to be alive and sober...I am thankful for the adversity I have experienced. I am grateful that there was not more but just enough to burn away some weakness and leave me stronger. In that strength I can savor the good things that are now happening.
I'm thankful for my health. Even though I've abused my body for years I don't have any problems  which is a miracle. 
Adversity: well I am struggling with the rollercoaster emotions and passive-aggressive actions of my girlfriend.  While speaking with my therapist she told me there are a lot of skills I can learn when in a relationship with someone like this.  I'm not ready to let go of this relationship so I am grateful today for the opportunity to learn healthy coping mechanisms and how to be emotionally resilient and set boundaries.  I am also grateful for the chance to see a therapist and to have the luxury of working on myself instead of living hand to mouth.
I am so thankful I was strong enough to say "I want to stop killing myself with alcohol" 
Thankful I didn't drink last night and grateful to SD for stopping me. 
I'm thankful for the man I have become in my sobriety. I am thankful for my cat she reminds me to love unconditionally. Yet she is so unimpressed that she also reminds me to be humble. I am thankful for today and for all of the opportunities that it presents us. I hope we can all see an opportunity today to make progress or help progress to be made. Much love everyone Happy Thursday!
I have a 16-year-old battling with severe depression. I hope not drinking will make me more able to help. I'm thankful for being clear-headed enough to try.
I'm thankful for my demanding but often oh so rewarding job...I'm thankful that I get to play awesome music with awesome people - a feeling I haven't had in ages since I've slightly or more buzzed in every rehearsal session since forever...I'm thankful for not taking that first drink today. I'm sitting in a bus surrounded by young rather drunk people and I can now see smell and hear how I must've been like for so so many times.
I am thankful for the calm I feel which was so elusive when I was drinking.
Thankfull for life. and seeing through the alcohol haze
I'm thankful for my second day of sobriety.  I'm thankful for a job and a home and a little baby boy to go home to after my shift is over.  
I am thankful that spider didn't attack me. I am not scared of spiders but that one was lying in wait behind a door so...
Today I am thankful for having a job that allows me to help people. ..Today I am also thankful to a friend who randomly posted something publically on Facebook that basically just said that I'm an awesome person and that made my day. It's weird how sometimes you don't notice how much unsolicited compliments can mean until you get one and your whole day seems brighter. I thanked him a lot because it means the world to me right now. ..Most of all I'm thankful that I have EIGHT days now. I didn't think that was possible until today. Thanks to everyone here! 
Thankful to have 16 days clean and sober! Longest ever in my adult life. Thankful for an amazing supportive girlfriend shoutout to my boy H for being supportive and who is also on the road of sobriety. Especially thankful for SD and all the people who have commented replied and just been there. This isn't easy and it gets hard sometimes but at least I have a place to turn to..Cheers and have another sober day friends! .
I am thankful that I didn't wake up with a hangover today.  It was my first time drinking coffee with almond milk instead of creamer and if I was hungover- I totally would have barfed.
I'm thankful for adversity as well. I decided to get sober at a time in my life that's been the most difficult I've ever experienced and I still don't know how things will turn out. I've lost "friends" who have listened to mis-truths about me and lived to tell the tale! If I can stay sober through that I've no excuse for ever going back and I'm thankful that the cravings are fleeting and manageable (for now at least)...I'm thankful for folks on this sub who share their stories successful ones or otherwise. Every time we share we have the potential to help someone else with their struggle or even just to strengthen their resolve though they might not be in a tough struggle at present...Lastly I'm thankful for my time with my child. I have grown so much in practicing patience and kindness and love that I am better able to manage my emotions through frustrating times to guide her through the tough process of growing up. Which is happening too quickly by the way!
Thankful to be alive and experiencing all of these emotions. Emotions that I would have drank away in the past. Waiting on biopsy results and great grandma has just had hospice arranged. But I still have my sense of humor and can no I WILL get through this. Thankful the sun is shining and I am able to run. Thankful that I can eat ice cream at night and not gain weight (at least for the time being). LOTS to be thankful for!
I'm thankful my bills are paid and my fridge is full of food. 
I'm thankful for the nice weather today that allowed me to play frisbee with my dog for hours after work. I'm also happy that I was not having beer or drink after drink while doing this. I'm sure my dog was too!! I will not drink with you today!
I am thankful for the people in my life supporting me and for my self-instilled clarity. ..I still deeply miss the friendship of a girl that I am no longer dating but I will get through this; not drinking helps me to level my emotions and pursue my self-growth physical growth and my hobbies.  
I still feel and look fat as fuck however I did lose 7 pounds since I stopped drinking.  My diet isn't that great however it doesn't include alcohol which is a very important factor...I started bicycling again.  Never realized how much I liked it.  My cardiovascular is increasing and when I move in a month to the big city of Phoenix I'm getting a sweet road bike and I'll be commuting that way in order to get in shape and lose weight...In any case I'm thankful for having a loving wife being in college having a little bit of cash and a fully functional penis.
I am thankful for my dogs my new clarity which really helps in difficult situations my SO and also for my simple yet fulfilling life.  Reading the Wash Post's metro and front page sections  we see a lot of really lost people in my city--especially youth who either were let down by their families or by the system and spiral into destruction rape and murder--and reminds me how truly lucky I am.  I want to someday be thankful for what I can do to help them.
I'm thankful for all the new friends I've made and new experiences I've had since becoming sober. I feel like I've really lived every moment of the past 97 days which has been a beautiful experience.
