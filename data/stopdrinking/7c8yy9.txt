Apologies for the wall of text seems A LOT of feelings come out after a slip/relapse and the gabapentin I took last night (yep after only *one* night because I drank so much I got sweaty and shaky) is making me a little rambly so feel free to skim what I wrote  . Edited for grammar because I saw an error and it really bugged me...I contacted my aftercare folks including the nurse practitioner that works there and came in to the clinic at 11am yesterday. I saw the nurse practitioner who gave me some gabapentin to help with my anxiety I was feeling and we decided I'm going to start Vivitrol shots; spoke to my counselor who was amazing as always; and participated in any group sessions that were going on where once again everyone was amazing...Everyone was SO supportive probably because they know I was super hard on myself. They highlighted the fact that I stopped poured out the remaining alcohol and contacted the right folks while majorly hungover and got help. Not one person was critical which I've never seen after a relapse but I guess my desire to get back on the wagon was clear.(Plus I think I was crying all day). I stayed at the clinic almost all day talking to various counselors and whatnot. Decided I'm going to attend additional sessions for the next month. ..They do have to report this to my case manager...but I'm hoping and praying that because of the steps I took after my slip it will not get me in trouble...not sure how this works all I know is that Virginia is tough and that county is known to be super-tough. If anything happened I'd lose my clearance and potentially my job. I thought about hiding it and keeping it to myself knowing they'd have to report it but I knew deep in my heart that if I wasn't honest with others I wouldn't be able to get the help I needed and I wouldn't be able to heal. Please be sure to keep me in your prayers or send positive vibes or whatever..I don't think they'd come down on me for one slip but I've learned not to assume...We also talked about what led me to relapse and I realized that it was not just my mom's health..it was the stress of work the fact that I had to miss sessions due to work...and probably...the fact that on Monday I shared in group I was raped while drunk when I was 24. I had never told anyone and did a damned good job putting it in the back of my mind convincing myself that it wasn't real rape because *I* got myself drunk and he was a little pushy but I eventually went along with it and stopped saying no...after he had started...and kind of enjoyed it so it couldn't be rape right? Wrong. The #MeToo movement got me thinking about it again and on Monday I shared the general details in a makeup session nothing like what I've typed here but it got me thinking..and I had a nightmare on Wednesday night where I was re-living it...So yes that probably contributed to my feelings of being overwhelmed and my emotional breakdown. Normally when I'm triggered I can think logically and play the tape forward but I was so emotionally distraught I wasn't thinking clearly at all. I made a mistake but my sponsor as usual was not empathetic. I am going to dump her as soon as I find someone new...her lack of empathy and compassion is wearing me down and if I'm being honest while I take full responsibility for my relapse I don't think that she helped the situation. I didn't call her because I didn't feel like she would understand and would just tell me if I had worked the steps earlier I wouldn't be feeling this way or some bullshit like that. I'm done. ..Meanwhile my closest friend in AA was the epitome of empathetic kind compassionate supportive etc. Too bad she hasn't finished working the steps or I'd ask her! Going to ask a woman to coffee this weekend whose father also has cancer that will never truly be cured (like my mom) just to talk to her feel her out and see what her sponsorship style is like and if she'd consider sponsoring me...I'm going to more meetings now yes. But I'm also taking care of me. I've been so busy trying to check every box that has to do with recovery that I realized I really wasn't taking the necessary time to be kind to myself. I won't make that mistake this time...So rather than just self-identifying as an alcoholic let me try this:.Hello my name is notgonnadrinkagain and I am human. I happen to suffer from alcoholism but I am so much more than that; I am a daughter an incredibly loyal friend a government worker a history nerd an amateur chef and foodie a slightly-obsessive fur parent to my adorable rescue dog a volunteer and a redditor to name  a few. My consecutive sober time is two days but I previously had 224 days with one slip. I was strong after the slip in that I was able to stop get help and now I get to start my recovery anew without all the distractions of my breakup jail etc. and for the first time simply focus on my recovery. Am I glad I relapsed? Not right now. However I have a feeling this is the best thing that could have ever happened to me...Before I was simply doing what I knew I was supposed to be doing in my recovery but ever since jail I was not enthusiastic about my recovery. Now I have that fire inside of me again and I am excited about my sobriety...TL;DR IWNDWYT I did all the right things after my slip I have a ton of emotions but figuring out what led me to it going to dump my sponsor hope I don't get in trouble with my case/probation manager and most importantly **I feel more alive today than I've felt in months.**..Your messages of support meant the world to me yesterday and got me thinking in the solution instead of the problem (oh God I'm turning into a walking AA bumper sticker).

You sound like someone with sky-high motivation to stay sober and that's paramount:  being motivated.   I think you'll get through this bumpy time in your sobriety.   ..Regarding your comment on the dangers of self-identification there are people who agree with that wholeheartedly.  In SMART Recovery for example they eschew labels.  They dont want you to label yourself as "Mary the alcoholic." because SMART believes its counterproductive to identify yourself as the manifestation of the behavior you want to change.   .."I am Mary.  I drink too much and I want to change" instead of "I am Mary the alcoholic."   ..Not saying that one approach is better than the other.  Just saying that there is more than one way to look at the same issue.  ..Thrilled to hear that you feel more alive today than you've felt in months.  IWNDWYT!
Wow! Amazing. Glad you are back. Anyone who is critical of the steps you are taking to change your MO is not worth your time. You are doing everything right. You made a mistake you recognized it and are taking the steps to put yourself back into the right path. You are very insightful and frankly- I'm damn proud of you!
