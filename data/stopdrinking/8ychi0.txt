Welcome back!
I'm back after a seven month relapse! Welcome back. I'm glad we're both here. 
I like to think the 6 months laid some groundwork for you. Good luck to you. IWNDWYT 
Welcome back!
Relapse sucks. Let's not do it again together. 
I'm super happy for you great job! .Relapse sucks so bad currently almost a month deep right now. Super scared to go through withdrawals again. Did you taper beforehand?
Welcome back friend. Hope you stay a long time!
Today is my day too. Good luck we'll see you in here I hope. I am going to get through just this one.  I might just post something stupid here once a day. I hope I will see everyone in here again and again.
But at least your back and not drinking tonight.
Isn't it crazy? You relapse only to get sober and realize...... This is what has had a hold on me for so long. Fuck this lame wack ass shit. Then you just stay sober for.... seemingly ever.  Everyone has one relapse. It's figuring out that it's just not worth it that's the part you've got to learn from.
This place has been huge for me... Posts like yours they resonate with me.. the positive comments! Keep posting... you have a readership! 
Welcome back! No one can ever take those six months away and I'm sure you learned a few valuable lessons along the way. Sending positive vibes!..I will not drink with you today!
