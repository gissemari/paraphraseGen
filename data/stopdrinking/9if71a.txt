It's been almost 40 days since I have been free.  I have no regrets I am happy I have struggled for the 19 years of addiction that I did and so very thankful to be free.  Some of the things that help me feel like I truly will be free everyday that I set my mind to it are:.1) I am a runner and when I run I set intentions I started imagining alcohol as a gnarly hand of sharp nails digging into me over lots of runs I imagined those nails losing their grip.  One day to truly my amazement they did!  I was free of that mother fucker- alcohol .2) I read This Naked Mind- I cannot say how little I had faith that this book would do anything for me and I couldn't have been more wrong.  It completely changed how I look at alcohol.  I have no desire to drink I just have no illusions that it would do me any good any more..3) I didn't change my habits.  I love going to a wine party cooking with friends even going to a vineyard.  I still do I drink sparkling water and love being in the environment.  I love waking up fresh the next day and remembering how good the conversation the food and the company were..4) I don't call myself an alcoholic I live life knowing I'm badass for quitting but don't dwell on the years I spent in slavery to the addiction.  .I hope that those still in the struggle know I truly never thought I would be free now here I am and it's really for real glorious!
