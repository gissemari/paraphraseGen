Its late (1:15am) and im laying here awake listening too sabbath. 3 year old daughter all snuggled up next to me sleeping looking cute as ever. Im on day 4 sober from booze and pot after what can only be described as a year long relapse of complete and utter chaos. I went out for a beer last jan after 6 months sober well that 1 beer turned into a year long drunken drugged shit show that dragged me deep into depression and nearly destroyed my life at only 32. Today i had the best day ever. Sober. It was 45 degrees and sunny here in indiana (very rare for a chicago winter lol) me and my tot went for a long bike ride (she has a baby seat on my bike) played at the park ate sandwiches at jimmy johns flew model air planes in the back yard played with her new rc car cuddled watched movies ate junk food drank lacroix and so much more. It felt like a dream. Ive beenso buay smoking pot and drinking trying to escape reality this past year i forgot how beautiful life is. In this moment i feel like a milion bucks like ill never need a drink again but i know all to well from last expeirience s that i may wake up in the morning wanting that beer and this current mindset may be gone. Oh the joys of being an addict. Im going to post deeper thoughts as time goes on but for now i just felt like rambling. Thanks for reading. Im glad i didnt drink with all of you wanderfull people today. I will truley remember this as o e of the best days of my life for as long as i live!
