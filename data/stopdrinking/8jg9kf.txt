After having fallen off that wagon yet again a few days ago; today I was struggling with temptation so I came and lurked here for some support. ..Reading the posts I was inspired to go to my first ever AA meeting tonight and I am so glad I did. Just hearing the shares and knowing there are people I can reach out to who understand and genuinely care that I succeed in the journey makes all the difference. ..I can do this. Thank you. IWNDWUT.
