Good morning everyone!  Five months ago today I quit drinking. I was a wine only drinker and only drank after 5 M-F.  I typically held to the same pattern on weekends unless I had company or was traveling etc.  However it was at these  times that I would really go off the rails. I became a different person that said and did things that were horrible. I hurt people I love and made a real ass out of myself. These episodes gradually increased in intensity the past 10 years. I could no longer stop them even with the best intentions before I started to drink.  It felt as if I was soulless during these episodes. I knew I was going to loose the battle if I didn't quit completely.  Previous attempts at cutting back just did not work!  I bargained and bargained with myself only to end up with morning after anxiety regret and shame.  I am grateful today for my sobriety and all the wonderful kindred spirits that have helped me along the way. For those of you who are still struggling you can do this. You will feel so much better mind body and spirit. Please keep reaching out as I will too. Blessings...

This is a very familiar post.  I couldn't moderate either.  And the bargaining!  I'm so glad not to her the blather in my head about it now.  IWNDWYT
