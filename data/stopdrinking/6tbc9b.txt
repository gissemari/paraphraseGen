Thankyou to all of you in this sub who constantly give unconditional support and love not just to me but everyone fighting their daily struggles...I just came back from a night watching films with my friends and husband. I'm lucky that the supermarket near my house stocks a wide range of "adult" soft drinks and dealcoholised products that I am fully able to enjoy without the hangover or shame from the night before...I feel like I've been sober a lot longer. Something I noticed at work made me sit back and think. I came across some of my own work from 3 months ago and couldn't understand how I'd managed to fuck it up so badly. Then I remembered the night before that day I had got blind batshit drunk and had the police called on me. So my work the next day was shabby to say the least...Stuff like that still gives me the horrors but I'm looking back to see how far I've come.
