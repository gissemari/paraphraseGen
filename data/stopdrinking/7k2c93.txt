This past weekend I had quite a scare when I passed a kidney stone but I noticed for the first time that my stomach had bloated pretty severely over the last year or so which I hadn't paid much attention to. So I made an appointment to get some blood work done as my urine was orange and fizzy which had happened before but after some pedialyte would go away. Anyway got my blood work done on Tuesday and they called me with good and bad news the bad is my insides are wrecked (which they were from having cancer in 2011 already) the good is quitting will help stop me from further damaging them. I used to think I didn't have a problem because "I only have a night cap to go to bed". I realize now I was just self medicating I just happened to do it right before day time as being lit at work was not an option and as such I didn't have a problem and I could control it. Sunday made me realize I couldn't. So I guess I'm 4 days in I'm not counting Sunday as I woke up still drunk and I'm working on day 5. This might sound odd but I don't really miss it but this insomnia isn't fun. Sun - Weds I barely slept any but last night I slept 6 hours uninterrupted. I'm looking forward to this challenge though I know its going to be rough at times but struggle is the best teacher and nothing worth it is usually easy.

I take melatonin about an hour before bed it helps zonk me right out.
I slept like shit at first.  However when I had that first night of totally hangover-free and alcohol-free sleep it was one of the best feelings of my life.  Honestly I never noticed how bad my sleep had gotten because I didn't think I had much of a problem.
Old school but it works:  heated milk is a natural sedative.
