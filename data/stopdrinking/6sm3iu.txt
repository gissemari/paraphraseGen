I have reached the month mark since last having a drink and indeed a cigarette...It is good and I don't feel like drinking or smoking but I have been getting a lot more depressed this past week and feeling very tired and run down.  I haven't been exercising either so that won't help and I haven't seen anyone socially for a month either for fear of relapsing...Hopefully things will level out better soon and reading this group has helped me get to this point and keep focused on staying sober! Thanks.

Congrats on one month!.After one month I also started to feel quite tired (after being really energetic in the first sober weeks) maybe it's just a natural thing to be a little exhausted after fighting to become (and stay) sober...I totally understand your fear of relapsing but this shouldn't keep you from going out. Maybe you could find some activites where people don't drink alcohol (idk just something that is not booze related; like playing soccer or going to a book club ;-) or AA meetings) so you could meet friends/new poeple without putting yourself at risk in terms of relapsing. .Spending all the time alone might make you feel even more depressed.
Congrats on a month!  Double congrats for dumping the cigs too!  I won't drink with you today. You got this!
Congratulations friend! That is an awesome achievement. It's easy to think we have to do several things in tandem but truthfully *not drinking is sufficient*. You're doing awesome.
