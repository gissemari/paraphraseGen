I am a bit worried about my ability to resist slipping back into the habit of having wine with lunch.  For the last two days I've had a struggle for about an hour before lunch basically arguing with myself that no it wouldn't be a good idea to have "just one glass"...I am happy to say I did go out today and had a lovely alcohol free lunch.  I have been finding that the bottom line mantra of "I am in control...just so long as I don't have one glass".  I finally got an appointment with a therapist (for next week).  Perhaps she can aide me determining if I really need some further group therapy...I have been so happy to wake in the morning--I still wake with a sinking feeling of "what did I do?" and then the happy realization of NOTHING :)  No pain no alcohol stink no regret and nice sleep.  I wish the other voice wasn't so annoying later in the day.

&gt;I have been finding that the bottom line mantra of "I am in control...just so long as I don't have one glass"...I like this. I have been tempted of late to have "just one". I have been having arguments with myself and thankfully the sober me is winning.  Congratulations on your 15 days!
there is no such thing as just one glass the second third and more come along maybe not immediately but far too soon.  You know this...your inner addict is trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge  - it lies.
Thank you!  I was so happy just now- I'm on my way home and the thought flashed that I "get a weekend" paired with a vision of an alcohol- free/active weekend    So amazing to have a positive and exciting craving.  
When I make a firm decision in the morning not to drink NO MATTER WHAT I am less tempted. I needed lots of support too because I didn't know how to build a sober life on my own. There is more to recovery than simply not drinking.
