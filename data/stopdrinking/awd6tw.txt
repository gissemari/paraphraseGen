"Comparison is the thief of joy." This quote by Teddy Roosevelt keeps coming up for me in a variety of situations. The "bad" side of comparison is the tendency that I use it to make myself feel better than someone else or that I feel badly about myself in comparison to someone else.  That's the tack Teddy was taking and I think that it's right on.  ..Comparison can create separation in a really unhealthy way. Neither feeling better than or less than someone else serves me (or them). The whole self-judgment piece can be debilitating (and drinking made it so much worse). Even in sobriety I can compare my recovery with someone else's. I can bludgeon myself for my relapses when I see others who have strung together more continuous time sober. I can think I should have my shit more together and compare myself to someone who seems to be further down the path...But then I remember high school writing projects -- "Compare and ***Contrast***..."  Holy moly; if I ***contrast*** where I am now with where I was three years ago when I came out of a six-year relapse I'm astounded.  If I imagine where I want to be in the future and contrast what my current behaviors are to see what it will take to get there that's a totally different approach to my recovery and growth; not shaming (which comparison can feel like) but empowering...**For your Weekend Writing consideration:** Has comparison been a thief of joy for you? Is contrast an antidote?
----------immediate responses--------

I was sitting with an old friend in a hot tub recently talking about how I needed to get my shit together how I felt behind and he said "Antsy in our friend group seems like you got your shit together more than just about anyone." And I  stopped and thought: he's not wrong. Why do I feel so stunted so behind? For someone of my age in my profession I have set this idea of success but without really analyzing the values that are implied. Is that picture of success at all what I want for my life? That sacrificial tunnel-vision profession that demands single-minded devotion? Would I have traded the years of parenting my kids desperately needed? No. Would I have given up life experiences and adventures? Not really. would I live a life without any time for music and art? Err I'm slipping down that path already and not lovin' it. I've been **comparing** myself to an ultimate version that I don't even really want to be. ..Perhaps it's just the extended job hunt and the struggle to choose which career path to seek that has me fretting and feeling inadequate. A comparison to an undefined and unattainable *something better.* Maybe it's the desperation to crawl out of debt to be able to go to the dentist to be able to have the surgery I need to have a good enough job to not feel like I'm just treading water a hundred miles from shore. ..The **contrast**? The contrast is that even if I don't know which shore I'm heading for I'm not treading water in circles. I'm closer to dry land than ever. 
Comparison has definitely been awful for me in the Facebook era. The main reason I stopped going on FB last year (around the time I stopped drinking actually) was politics and being sick of seeing my mother picking fights with my friends about politics but a close second was comparison. ..When I lived in California my late husband and I had a small and lovely friend group. All the people in that group seem to have done so very well since I moved away from there in early 2010. My life hit the skids that year while theirs all kept improving. Seeing their beautiful families and homes and vacations would make me so bitter. I hated that. I want to be happy for people I love when they are doing well or when good things happen to them. ..The families part was especially embittering. Their families grew while mine fell apart. ..Now when I think of those people I realize that several of them also had big life changes around that time and they re-made their lives into better ones in spite of periods of great difficulty and pain. I've done the same now; it's just taken me a bit longer. And the ones who seemingly coasted on a smooth upward trajectory toward 6 figure salaries and Costa Rican vacations? I don't know what secret struggles they've had or have right now. ..Tuning out of Facebook and turning my attention inward has been very helpful toward my recovery from alcoholism but also toward my continued growth as a human. I do look at Facebook again now occasionally. I have to have an account for work now anyway. I keep my visits there brief and I do not post or comment usually. Just see my friends who are doing so well and smile for them. I'm doing well too.
I really shouldn't compare myself to other people because I haven't met anyone that has had a parallel story line to mine.  Mom got small cell lung cancer when I was 23.  Dead a year later.  Really struggled for awhile.  I got my act together enough. ..Got my girlfriend pregnant.  Shit went from bad to worse.  I absolutely hated my job.  Home life was absolute hell.  Things declined further.  I drank to cope.  ..She drank and smoked and smoked weed.  Straight vodka no chaser at least a pack a day at least a gram a day.  Six years ago I came home from work and she was drunk...  she wanted me to read something she'd written and I said hold on let me get settled in.  ..I thought I was going to die that night.  She threw a hatchet at me.  She threw hedge trimmers at me the Edward Scissorhands looking type.  Then held a shovel like a baseball bat and was in a batters stance and ready to swing at me...I understand why victims of domestic abuse stay with their partners.  I stayed with her.  There's a rainbow period that comes after the storm.  But it storms again.  Each subsequent storm gets worse than the one that came before it.  ..One day as I was leaving for work she asked me for money.  I didn't have any.  She flipped the hell out on me.  Kicked me out.  I told her I wanted her to leave for a few days to get her head together.  She responded by going on a binge.  ..It was a Sunday morning and she was absolutely trashed.  And our daughter was with her.  I had to leave work to go get our daughter.  I picked up our daughter without anything.  She was completely naked and covered in paint.   ..That was it.  Tried to work things out here and there but that was pretty much the end of it.  I decided I was going to get my life together...I went back to school.  I quit drinking.  I got custody of my daughter.  Quit my job.  Company got sold.  Got some money.  Clawed my way through school and graduated.  ..I met up with some of my classmates back at the end of last year.  Many of them had gotten jobs already.  I found myself comparing myself to them.  I had not gotten a job yet.  ..Had any of them been through anything like I'd been through?  No.  I know that for a fact.  Has anyone ever been through the things that I've been through in the order that I've gone through them?  It's possible.  That would be the barometer of who I'd have to compare myself to in order for me to get an accurate assessment...It was really difficult to write all of this out.  This just a very brief synopsis.  But even this was painstaking.  I had my finger on the backspace key ready to delete it all pretty much the whole time I wrote this.  I'm going to leave it though maybe it will help someone.  Anyways it's the truth and the truth shall set you free.
I found your insight most helpful and I thank you greatly for posting it. That old comparison trap really is a noose! I didn't really realise its thrall (I still might not I think it must run deep). But your great insight the contrast the lifeline out... brilliant...Like you I've tried and  failed' but hell as I reflect back on the past two years (the time I've been conscious of alcohol consumption as a problem for me) I realise that the act of trying so many times has itself led to my behaviour being much healthier. So I'm trying again. It has been two weeks today this time. I turned 40 a few days ago and can honestly say I haven't had a drink in my 40s (ten years ago there's no way that was even on my radar turning 30 was a huuuuuuuge piss up!). ..I want to keep this up for another few month but another two weeks at least knowing or sensing that this first month is a vital and precarious time. I hypothesise that previous relapses have stemmed from a sense of something like a  fear of heights' or some kind of elasticity that snapped me back to the futility of alcohol. ..This time I'll seek more and different supports over the next two weeks (contrast). ..Thank you!
So last weekend - some people we used to hang out with all went out to a club and hung out the next day. ..Me and my SO felt a bit perturbed and sad that we are no longer invited due to tensions between us and them but then this weekend I ended up hanging out with a mutual friend who had been out with them...They said they all went out the night before and the next day went to the pub drank loads and then see went to see the guy she'd been dating. She was so hungover the next day she said he looked at her which such a sense of disappointment that she is also questioning her drinking...I realised that I am not missing out on anything. ..Yesterday I went out to a couple of places. I danced around a bit my boyfriend DJed for the first time we laughed and all went home before 11pm. I was sober so was another friend and the third barely drank at all...I realised if I was still drinking I'd just be doing exactly what I was doing last year - drinking all day feeling awful the next day. It's just the same routine on repeat...And the biggest thing I realised is I get to be the fun sober friend! I am the person people can hang out and feel no pressure to get wasted. I will no longer nudge you to get another drink. If you hang out with me - you get to have fun and go home before midnight...So yeah - when I compared - I felt sad and thought I was missing out...But in contrast I realised that my life is way better. 
that quote is so true wow.
Wow your first sentence is definitely spot in &amp; life changing lf I can constantly put it into practice..."Comparison is the thief of joy" needs to be in a t-shirt or something.  Powerful words.  I find myself comparing myself to my twin brother at times (heck it's natural). But.....The older I get the less I try to give two rats tails what other people have. So hard to do sometimes but worth it.  Live your OWN life with no regrets &amp; you can't please everyone 100% of the time.  Sometimes you gotta do what YOU want to do &amp; F everyone else.....
Comparing myself to some people has made me feel like I should do more. On the otherhand all of them work very hard to be where they are. I have looked for too much comfort for the past few years. Drinking did play a part in that. I didn't have as much time and energy as I could have because I kept drinking all the time. It has left me with the feeling that I have wasted my time drinking definitely does that..
