This is something that has probably been discussed on this subreddit countless times before but I'm pretty new here.....I'm an alcoholic and I know it. I've been struggling with my dirinking for about 3-4 years now. I **know** I should quit for good right now but the best I've managed during the last couple of years have been a few streches of 12-18 days of sobriety...But my point here is this: I just feel it's **so** unfair that there are so many people who can drink with moderation when I can't. Like my friends. Like my family. Like my SO... I mean WHY? **Why did this have to happen to me?** This may sound like self pity and maybe it is but I really feel extremely sad about it right now. I want to cry... I mean when we have a girls' night out with my friends (which only happens a few times a year these days) why is it that **they** can party like crazy (well have something like 5-7 drinks during the evening) and then suffer their hangover the next day. And **stop it there**. When the first thing **I** do the morning after is reach out for a bottle of wine... and then for another one... and then continue drinking all day. And then the next day (if possible).....Well of course I know I'm not alone seeing all of your posts here. I know there are so many of you out their struggling with this same disease I am. But I still feel like I didn't deserve this (obviously none of you did either!) because I've had to face so many other problems too ever since I was a teenager: an eating disorder depression anxiety phobias...

Acceptance is a huge part of recovery. In the early days of my first go at this I had the same issues and beat up on myself. "Why does my wife neighbors and friends still get to drink?" I finally had to come to accept that I couldn't do it the way they do it. Sure it feels unfair but moving on is what's best...Stay strong! I will not drink with you today. 
Glad you're here...Sorry to hear about your sadness...I at first grieved what I thought was a "desirable" attribute of my life...That's changed to *Gratitude* that alcohol is no longer part of my life...I did the work and have never been happier!..I hope the same for you.
&gt; I didn't deserve this..Neither did I. I struggled with a difficult childhood too. It set me up for addiction. Now it's my job to deal with that fact of my life and all that comes with it...Thank you for your courage to post!..Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

you're not going to get an answer to "why".  none of us do.  at the end of the day it doesn't matter anyway.  you could ask the same of the good things in your life.  why were you born in a first world country instead of a 3rd?  why did you have access to education and clean water?..i used to want a lot of things to be different in my life.  and now it's just my life.  however it is for as long as i have it.  those friends who drink 5-7 drinks may feel terrible the next day.  they may reach for a bottle the next morning.  none of us can really judge someone else's experience good or bad.  which means we can also start being easier on ourselves.  we just are what we are and we're different from each other and it's ok.
It's not fair no. But I'd rather be an interesting and flawed person who fights for happiness than one who floats unthinkingly through life. ..Quitting for good is daunting to me so much so that I don't think about that. 
Welcome :) I am feeling the same way. My husband can have a six pack right now or ONE glass of wine and not touch the stuff for six months....I have friends that are the same way. It isn't fair! Why can't I enjoy just one?? no I have to have more and more and more.....So I can't have the first one. The only way it will stop is if I never take that first drink! I will not drink with you today

I get upset when I think about how I can't get tipsy during a night out with friends and the next day not think about drinking at all.   If I drink then the next day it's the first thing I think about doing as soon as it's possible. Pisses me off so much but the results are always the same after many years trying to moderate.  I'm trying to learn to cut it out completely this time around! 
It is unfair. There has been a lot of unfairness--the desperation and pain you dealt with as a teenager wasn't your rightful inheritance either...And this probably will not make you feel better right now but the fact is that people who have to rebuild from trauma and overcome great challenges end up with incredible gifts that are simply not available to those who never had to walk through fire and discover the soul of healing...There is always another side to the coin. Abuse during childhood was the means by which I developed a very finely tuned empathy--I had to know what others were feeling in order to keep myself safe. I'm sometimes vaguely jealous of people who had healthy parents but at the end of the day people who never have to seek healing rarely have access to the wisdom that results from the work. It's one of those things. ..Unfairly you have inherited the seed of such profound self knowledge transformation and peace.
I have begun to think of it as a gift not a curse. I hope that happens for you as well.
It really is unfair. I miss all the fun and positive parts of drinking with friends. I saw a group of people at the lake this summer laughing and taking pulls off a bottle of Jamison and it was sad to me that I can't do that. Frustrating. Unfair. But for me it wouldn't have ended there and knowing what it would have turned into for me hours/days of continuing to drinking I realized it is what it is and I am who I am... the way I look at it I would rather have this condition than 100s of others people in the world have. At least I can control this one. And as long as I don't drink this condition doesn't impact my health. *off soapbox* :)..Hang in there I will not drink with you today!
I felt that way too for a long while. But then I read [*This Naked Mind*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27202127-this-naked-mind) and I felt much different afterwards. I realized that **many** of those people who can drink "normally" are dealing with their own internal struggle. Even if they don't equate the struggle directly to booze... it's there. I don't have **any** of those booze-related problems anymore. And for that I am grateful. ..&gt; But I still feel like I didn't deserve this..My anxiety and depression were made almost unbearable because of vodka. **We all deserve peace of mind.**..Stay strong. I will not drink with you today. .
