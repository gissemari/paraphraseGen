Failed after only 3 days this time. Grad school stress depressed fiancee and personal mental health issues etc. How do you stay above the stress of the workload and looming deadlines fellow #gradstudents?.

For me I realized that alcohol does not relieve stress just delays and then magnifies it. 
AA has been helping me with these issues. Still not working on my dissertation but at least now I have a purpose a plan and a design for living. 
I'm not a grad student anymore (finished my PhD in 2011) but I can tell you my drinking started to amp up during that period. Good for you for taking charge of it. ..I still have looming deadlines and an insane workload (much worse than grad school for me actually) and getting sober has cut my stress in half easily. I can deal with shit and keep going. I'm no longer climbing up a muddy hill.
