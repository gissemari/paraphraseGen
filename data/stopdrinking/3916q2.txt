In the past when I've made attempts a switch would flip in my mind where deep down I knew I would drink again it was just a matter of when. That's happened a couple times in the past three years but I told myself that I will probably die before that day comes. Meaning I can stay sober today one day at a time and live a long life and death will find me before my relapse happens...Right now it feels different. Not like I'm going to drink today or tomorrow but in the next year or two. One thing I can attribute this to is burnout or a weariness with my current job and situation. My job involves helping recovering alcoholics and other drug addicts. It's been very fulfilling but I almost feel like this isn't my calling in life...The problem is I don't know what it is I want to do after this. I don't make much money I used to. But I've been so happy the past few years and realized that money can't make you happy. I don't need expensive things or a big bank account. However I would like to travel and pursue hobbies those things do require money. So maybe if I was fulfilling myself in other ways I wouldn't be so tired of my work. I don't know...Back to drinking. I am catching myself making the same mistake many alcoholics have made. I am picturing myself in the future after more therapy the right meds and a solid place in life with travel hobbies and a fulfilling job being able to drink socially. I would be satisfied in life have all of the tools I've learned in sobriety and would have no reason to drink alcoholically. ..But I know it doesn't work that way. I remember the slow build up of tolerance over the years. That leading to dependance and the need to get rid of negative symptoms of withdrawal. The ensuing spiral. The wretched shaking paranoia fear filled mornings that only more vodka could relieve. The disgust at the fact that I had alcohol in my system 24/7 while working visiting family shopping just living my life. It was the only way I could function...They're two characters in my mind right now. The one saying that if I drink that will all happen again. The other saying I'm a different person now and that alcohol wont effect me the same way anymore...

Why do you want to drink socially? I understand where you are coming from and maybe I'm too new to sobriety but I had thoughts like that at times where maybe in years I can have a drink socially but then I thought about it and knew that I would always want to get drunk or really really buzzed. If you've found a good replacement drink there really is no benefit to socially drinking alcohol. I can relax on a beach with a non-alcoholic fruity drink and get less dehydrated I can enjoy a hot summer day on the deck with a nice lemonade or flavored carbonated water or in winter a hot cup of coffee. ..I guess the question you should ask is what would drinking socially provide you that you aren't getting now from not drinking? And depending on that answer then you may know how to combat these thoughts - if that is what you truly want. 
I had a disturbing moment of clarity when I quit drinking...Even without alcohol I acted like an alcoholic.  ..That is when I decided to stop walking the 'white-knuckle-path-of-abstinence' and started working a 12-Step Program. ..Made a huge difference in the way I think act behave and live. .It also transitioned me from a place of 'wanting to quit' - to **staying stopped**. ..But that's just what worked for me. ..&gt;I'm a different person now and that alcohol wont effect me the same way anymore...I admit even AFTER 20 years... I get moments when "I wonder' if I could just have a glass of wine with friends... or maybe a little ~~coffee in my Baileys~~ Bailey's in my coffee.  ..For me the reason that I'm a different (and BETTER!  Really!) person is because I have stayed stopped. ..I tired to quit for 12 years.  I am pretty convinced that it's all or nothing for me. 
The more I enjoy my life without alcohol the less desire I have to drink. Money can't buy happiness but being broke doesn't make people happy. I don't think there's anything abnormal with being unsatisfied in your job but if it's making you want to drink then it's a problem that needs addressing...I went to a dinner party on Saturday and was around normal drinkers who were uncorking bottle after bottle of wine and in the past I would have been jealous or felt left out but instead I just watched. They drank they acted pretty much exactly the same as when they're sober and then they drank coffee to sober up at the end. *So what am I missing out on?* Feeling high for a few hours? This was the dream situation for me to do what they just did and yet I didn't feel like I missed anything at all. I was happy just to chat like them stay sharp and present and not have to fight a hangover afterwards. I felt physically great and emotionally good. Forget all the bad things that would have happened if I had drank; I had a good time NOT drinking so why would I want to drink in the first place? That's how I need to feel in my sobriety - like my life is complete without it. ..EDIT: [I'm sure you're looking at my badge like...](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/003872877/willy-wonka-116680671607_xlarge.png)
I can relate a bit. After a year I started to feel able to assess where I was in life and **how** I got there.   Now that I really want to make changes in my employment situation and location I'm unable to see how doing it soberly is going to be different than doing it drunk. I have zero frame of reference of what it's like to make a decision for reinvention without addiction being muddled up with it. ..I'm really stuck on this - my job is really unsuited to the type of personality I have. The overall culture of a rural rich farming culture is particularly *drab* for outsiders.  ..Good luck. Probably best just to stay in the 24 hours that you've got.
