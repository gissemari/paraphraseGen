Link: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/02/philip_seymour_hoffman_s_drug_death_the_science_of_addiction_recovery_and.html..This showed up on my FB feed and I thought I'd share it. Relapse is a scary thought for anyone who has ever struggled with addiction. .This quote from the article is something I intend to keep in mind:.'There's a lot we don't know about alcoholism and drug addiction but one thing is clear: Regardless of how much time clean you have relapsing is always as easy as moving your hand to your mouth.'

I used to hear a lot of people in meetings trip out that stupid phrase "I'm only an arms length away from my next drink". ..Well I've glad I'm not. I'm an arms length away from that second drink. But I'm a million miles away from the first one. I'd have to do a hell of a lot of things wrong for quite a long time to pick up that first drink. But of course once it's in me all bets are off the craving will kick in and within a couple of weeks I'd be drinking 24-7 and most likely taking drugs to enable that to happen...What would be the point of following a program of recovery if every day a relapse continues to be as easy as moving "your hand to your mouth"? I'm over 3 years sober and that has only been possible because I have followed a program or recovery that has delivered on certain promises. Namely:-.."We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is how we react so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition". ("Alcoholics Anonymous" AA world services edition 4 2001 pp.84-85)...I don't hear it so much now in meetings at least not the ones I attend. Anyone who says that "all it takes to relapse is moving your hand to your mouth" knows nothing about recovery. So I make sure I tell them that perhaps they should try the program of recovery that has worked for me and for millions of others. Perhaps then they wouldn't relapse so much. ..Good luck - it's that last sentence in the quote above that holds the answer and the rest if the book tells you how to do achieve it..
Thank you for the link. PSF's death has been the subject of much conversation before and after the AA meetings I've been attending. It's easy to forget how dangerous our addictive propensity is when we start experiencing the benefits of sober living. Maybe a few meetings dedicated to discussing the real progressive debilitation of substance abuse is warranted.
