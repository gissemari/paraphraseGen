If I could relay anything about what it means to have maintained a clear mind for the last year it's this: I didn't even think about it being my 1 year day today until I was pulling out of my driveway.  It wasn't the first thing that crossed my mind I wasn't counting down the days today was just another day.  That's a HUGE difference from the first month or two when it was a bit more of a struggle and was the first thing on my mind each day...That's the hope I give to all of you who are in those first few days/weeks/months: it gets a LOT better!  ..I've lost 10 pounds in the last year (190 down to 180) and I've saved a lot of money.  I was spending $25/week minimum on booze so that's $1300 in my bank account.  I never wake up cursing myself.  I can focus at work.  I'm present for my family.  ..Everything is better now and I have this sub to thank!
