At 35 and many years of nonstop drinking I finally submitted that I was an alcoholic. I spent a week in detox and was released back to society. ..I began out patient therapy the next day and have been submitting UA's and taking breathalyzer tests every time I walk in. I went to my first Smart Recovery group today and I felt it went well. I plan on going to more going forward. The therapy I'm getting from these groups has been amazing. ..I feel so much healthier but I realize there is a long way to go. Yoga and meditation have really helped. I still have many issues to crawl out of due to my drinking (1.75L of vodka every 1.5 to 2 days consistently over many years with rare breaks). I'm hurting financially but can hopefully repair the damage I caused. ..I've been reading a lot more and discovered the book *I Am Here Now; The Mindfulness Project* and couldn't be more thrilled. It has really helped me with meditation and staying in the moment. I highly recommend this book...I am new to this subreddit and have enjoyed many of the stories shared. I appreciate everyone who has shared their struggles and success throughout sobriety. I am sober today and it feels great. Everyone around me has stated I look healthier and happier. I am optimistic about the future and feel more motivated than ever. I am much more grateful for everything/everyone around me. It feels great being so much more clear minded. ..Well... I'm done carrying on for now. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit and I appreciate you reading. Have a great day and keep up the good fight.
