So I am still struggling with booze I have had successful streaks of about 15 days or so clean I alway mess it up and go back.. I am trying to change. Last night I was with a friend and she told me that I should give up on quitting and just accept that I am a drinker and control it. She told me people would respect that more than quitting altogether I had to laugh. I lost a friend last night but I can't have people saying or thinking that about me

k. what are you going to do to ensure you don't mess up this time?
People who base their respect on whether or not I drink are people who's respect I don't care to win. I should know I used to respect people based on how much they'd drink. ..As has been pointed out it's important to have a plan. Nothing will change if nothing changes. 
Never quit quitting.  Every time you have to start over is an opportunity to learn from your previous slip up.  What caused you to take that first drink?  What can you do differently this time to ensure that situation doesn't happen again?  Wishing you all the best.
