Howdy yall..Binge drinker here. Scored 19 on the sidebar test... I normally function well during the day and then drink until the early hours of the morning wake up and do it again. I do this in a 2-3 weeks on one month sober interval. I swear that I'll get my life back on track and a few weeks later I fall back into it. ..I've been struggling with some personal issues and as they come to the forefront of my mind I push it back with drinking. Recently I've not been functioning as well at work school or extracurriculars. ..I'm normally a go-getter well spoken friendly studious hard worker. The day after a binge I don't even want out of bed and when I do all I want is to go home and drink. ..The buck stops here. I want a slow marathon of "one day at a time" as opposed to sprinting. ..It's time to ease back into exercise get a haircut become okay with who I am and accept I can't predict the future. ..I look forward to being a part of your community. ..Thank you much..Ben
