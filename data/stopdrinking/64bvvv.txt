Tomorrow morning you will not regret not drinking. Sadly mental health really parallels addiction in that it is highly stigmatized. ..I have noticed since getting sober I have some disordered eating. I am either binge eating or dieting. There is no middle ground. ..Having mental health issues is NOTHING to be ashamed about. Get the help you need in whatever form you need it. You deserve a good life. ..I won't drink with you tonight! You should make the commitment now not to go to the store tonight. Worry about tomorrow tomorrow. 
Hi :) when you say you are overeating to hurt yourself I am not too sure what you mean. I feel like I am reaching for snacks to try to get rid of my cravings. I am trying to make it a healthy thing looking for vitamins and minerals that will help me in these early days and eating foods rich in those nutrients. Maybe you could fill your fridge with some healthy foods you enjoy. If I have eaten too much I focus on the good things I have given my body. Turns it into a positive with a bit of a goal. I think I am probably still consuming less calories if I was snacking on donuts I'm not sure I would be. I have a whole slew of issues too. It seems like a lot of people here do. I can relate to the shame as well. Challenging my thoughts have helped me a lot today with my anxiety. Posting here has been my biggest help though :) how many days in are you?
