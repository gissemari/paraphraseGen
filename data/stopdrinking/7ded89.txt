Hey all I'm on day 5 which I realize isn't a long time but on my first 2 days I read This Naked Mind in its entirety and I literally haven't been tempted to drink whatsoever (yet). I even went out with a friend who I ALWAYS drink with when we hang out and I just said I'm not drinking tonight and he didn't care and I had as much fun as I ever have..In previous quit/cut back attempts I've always had to struggle through every day but this time I just have no desire to drink whatsoever..Just sharing that little breakthrough.

That is wonderful! I'm happy you had fun without alcohol in the picture it's something that is hard to do sometimes. ..I'll join you in not drinking today!
I am right there with you day 4 for me.  Same thing happened right down to the reading of TNM and going out w/a drinking friend Tuesday night and successfully only having soda water. Feeling great so far and IWNDWYT too.
I'm so happy for you! Day 7 here for me and going out tonight but I am mentally strong enough to only drink water and tea. .IWNDWYT
