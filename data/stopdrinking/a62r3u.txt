About three months ago I started mentoring someone I met through my gym that is new in recovery. I took her under my wing and she is making amazing changes... She had a relapse on Halloween but has bounced back. And tonight she texted me telling me she was in a bad situation felt triggered and left before she made a bad decision. I told her I was proud of her. She told me that meant so much to her...Little things like this being there for someone who is struggling helps me stay sober. To all who are struggling don't be afraid to reach out. We are all in this together!
