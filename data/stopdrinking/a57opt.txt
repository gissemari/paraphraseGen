Not sure if this is normal or just me but wanted to say around day 30 I started to get really irritated but everyday things/interactions with people. I thought "maybe this is just who I am (an impatient/judgmental asshole) without alcohol?"  It's been about a week since then and now feel back to my normal friendly/optimistic self...I think it's important to remember that while sobriety is an incredible gift you can give to yourself it's not a magic pill that will make every one of your problems go away. You will still have ups and downs though imo you will be *far* better able to handle those ups/downs while sober. To anyone out there struggling with some adverse personality changes on your journey hang in there they're only temporary!..&amp;#x200B;..I won't drink today.
