I have been struggling to keep promises to myself recently...any one else experience this?..&amp;#x200B;..I go a few days clean and sober...and I feel great. Motivated. Healthy. Then I fall back into the trap. This cycle repeats. I feel like I'm making progress overall but I still struggle...&amp;#x200B;..I appreciate your advice..&amp;#x200B;

Hmm I never thought about it as promising myself to never drink again or anything.  I'm a type of person who will never break a promise but because of that I rarely promise anything.  I had a huge health scare and to be honest I really didn't even enjoy drinking anymore I just "had to."  So I was completely ready to quit but early on after a week sober including a seizure and jaundice I just thought there is no way in hell I'm going through that shit again.  Now I don't really think about it but I remember in rehab if people checked themselves out early or something I thought fuck that.
