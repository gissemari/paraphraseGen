Hi everyone! I *was* doing a daily accountability post here but I'm struggling to keep up with it. So I'm going to restart doing that but with a much simplified form. I was doing fairly long posts which is part of why I haven't been doing them - I haven't always had the time and energy to keep up with it. But I *can* do a short check in...Anyway I am still sober. I've had some ups & downs physically and emotionally over the last couple of weeks but I guess I'm still fairly early in my sobriety so that's not too unusual. I have not been going to AA meetings daily but I am going to meetings when I can. I get a lot out of the ones I make it to I'm just having a hard time some days doing anything beyond basic self-care...It's significant to me to make it past 60 days. Last year I made it to 60 or so and then just decided to give up and start drinking again. I'd been having health issues and was discouraged that getting sober hadn't fixed that and made life generally easier. After I'd started drinking again I came up with all of that "maybe I don't have a problem" nonsense and I found it frighteningly difficult to even start to think about quitting. But the decision to take that first drink was pretty conscious. I knew I had to stop drinking but I guess I just figured that I'd deal with it later. Bad decision!..So anyway this time around I know that drinking isn't going to fix my problems any more than quitting drinking did and it would also pile on new ones...One of the reasons I think I haven't been posting here that much (and also probably part of why I decided to drink again last year) is that I'm just really uncomfortable being conscious and aware and "in the moment" when I'm sick. I'm finding it really uncomfortable to be fully present and engaged when I don't feel well. It's not even so much avoiding the physical sensations I'm avoiding being in the mental state. I used to think that I drank to slow my thinking down and I guess I partially did but I really hate feeling slow and dull and sluggish in the brain. I don't know. I just don't feel like myself some days. And I'm diving into some less destructive but still head-in-the-sand avoidance strategies - video games mostly which I haven't done for years. I am incorporating little bits of meditation into my daily life although no formal practice or anything yet...It's frustrating to be pretty much as functional sober as I was when I was drinking. I was at a meeting on Sunday where several people talked about "Sunday mornings now" vs. how it was back when they drank. And I'd pretty much had a morning exactly like I woulda if I'd been up all night drinking except I'd gone to be early. Frustrating. *But* I know drinking is not now and was never the answer. I'm also remembering that I've still be sober a relatively short amount of time and things will probably get a little better down the line. ..I'm going out of town this weekend. I have a quasi-work related event to attend with a friend. I did think about canceling since I've been sick and I've got a load of stuff to catch up on. However I probably wouldn't be all *that* productive if I stayed at home. And this is not a party trip - everyone going drinks very lightly or not at all. The friend I am sharing a hotel room with knows that I've quit (although not the full story though I'd actually like to tell her if I get the chance since she is a good friend.) She and I actually went to Amsterdam for a short trip a couple of years ago and never drank more than a couple of glasses of wine a night (I was being restrained for the sake of keeping up appearances not by any virtue of anything.) *Plus* one of my sobriety triplets lives in town /u/ucantsimee and we've arranged to go to a meeting together on Sunday...So anyway that's me. I will post again first thing in the morning. Take care /SD!

"It's frustrating to be pretty much as functional sober as I was when I was drinking"..This is exactly how I've felt in my previous bouts of sobriety.  What I've realized though and why I prefer other programs to AA is that quitting drinking is only a small part of the equation.  The drinking is a symptom of something deeper it's not the actual problem.  Stay sober and keep searching!! There's something in all of us that causes us to drink.... it's not just an addiction to alcohol but someting deeper
Great to hear from you.  I am glad you are doing ok.  I was toying with the idea of sending you a pm.  The most important thing is you are doing well.  Once again sorry for your health issues hopefully they will sort themselves out.  \o/
