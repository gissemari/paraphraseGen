We all woke up to sad news this morning that another famous figure has decided to end it.  I love Anthony Bourdain.  His funny no nonsense candor about his past struggles with substances is fairly well known.  Obviously I'm not saying that this is what caused his demise but even in recovery alcoholics/addicts are 120 times more likely to commit suicide.  When i was still drinking I had two attempts though they were more or less a cry for help.  And unfortunately if you attend AA like I do at some point you are very likely to experience loosing someone this way.  My friend Krista relapsed 2 years ago and hung herself.  She was so ashamed of "being weak" in her words she felt trapped.  I knew the feeling.  You cant keep drinking and you cant go on like this.  And for me all I could think of was what everyone else would think of me.  Well now I can tell you what they would think.  And its "Thank God we got her back in time".  Anytime i see someone returing to the rooms or message boards I feel a little sigh of relief.  If you are lurking because you are hurting or scared of what we will think I hope this will clear that up.  Remember suicide is a very permeant solution to a temporary problem.  I once heard this in the rooms and it always helps me...Its not so important that you stumbled so much as that you got back up again.  And mistakes don't erase all the good work you have done and how far you may have come...If you need help I am begging you to hold on.  **Pick up the phone post a message talk to someone.**  This disease will take everything.  Please don't let it.  Even if just for today.  ..**If you need help call 1\-800\-SUICIDE or chat online at** [**hopeline.com**](https://hopeline.com)** they are certified in crisis intervention**
