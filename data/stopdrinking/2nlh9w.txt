I might be in debt up to my eyeballs I might have just broken up with my ex-girlfriend that ripped out my heart and I might have a shitty dead end job and I might have a ton of other things to complain about but more importantly I am thankful for being sober. All these things the job the debt the GF can all be replaced and fixed but I have to remember that drinking can destroy all these things including my life permanently...I'm coming up on two years and I'm about to turn 26 and I have to remember that not drinking is ten times more important than anything else. Looking back at all the failed attempts I had thinking I could never reach just one month let alone one year I am so grateful for making it this far and I'm so thankful **for each and every one of you members of this sub** because you guys are truly the difference between life and death for me. I don't post here a lot but I do make sure to always include this sub on my list of subscriptions and I always read your guys' and gals' stories. Reading about how hard you are struggling with just a few days clean reminds me of where I was and reading about the person with thousands of days clean reminds me of where I want to be. Today I am thankful for you that random person over the internet that I might never meet that has changed my life. Thank you.
