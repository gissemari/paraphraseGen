I'm really happy to be 10 days into my sobriety. Mentally I know I've made the right choice but physically I haven't been feeling great. I was a heavy daily drinker for around three years before quitting and I've found myself struggling to get out of bed in the morning and feeling generally lethargic lately. This morning I woke up with a headache that has become steadily worse over the course of the day - there's no way it's dehydration because I've been drinking TONS of water the past few days. I'm wondering if it was the melatonin i took last night - I don't usually take that stuff. No matter what it is I'm glad it isn't alcohol that caused it.

Well done on 10 days! I can't really comment on the health but hope you start feeling better soon :) 
Probably just residuals from giving up a substance that your body had been used to for a long time.  Melatonin gives me pretty weird dreams but never gotten a headache from it.  ..If you're worried about it see a doctor.  Try no melatonin tonight and see how you feel tomorrow.  ..Nice work on the 10 days!
In my experience going from feeling like shit everyday to not the first couple weeks I was freaking out about any ache or pain. Like did I stop too late?! Then I realized oh yeah sometimes my shoulder hurts after a day of work and that pain in my side is hunger not my liver!  Feel better!
