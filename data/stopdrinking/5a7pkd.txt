Whew...super close call for the sober bus today folks. Got all caught up in "I'm never going to meet anybody" "this is a doomed experiment anyway" "I'm never going to have any fun" and worst of all for me "I'm a cave man I'm missing out on everything!!"..Worked myself up into such a mood that I had one foot out the door to go day drinking. You know why? Because for a second there I thought I could tell the future. Bullshit. I have no idea what's going to happen. I have no clue what good stuff is coming down the pike for me so I need to chill the hell out..One thing I DO know I DO know how shitty and small my life was when I was drinking all the time. I DO know that maybe I CAN drink today (or just have wine or just on special occasions) and get away with it but INVARIABLY there will come a time when I'll have one drink and not be able to stop again..Why am I making such a public spectacle of all this? Why am I risking the humiliation if I fall off the wagon? Why am opening myself up to skepticism doubt and shit talking? Because I know I'm not the only one struggling with this. If I can put this shit out here and it helps someone else then good. I can take whatever anybody here can dish out and I'm at the age where my philosophy is "This is me. This is where I am. It may change tomorrow it may not. Take it or leave it." I do care what people think but not enough to make me stop trying. Being authentic and vulnerable are POSITIVE traits in my eyes they are attributes of my best self..And my best self doesn't drink.
