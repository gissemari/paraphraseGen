Hang in there! I'm only on day 6 and the little voice just won't go away today but waking up this morning hangover-free and just getting out and enjoying the weather (instead of curdling away in bed and feeling lethargic for the day) is a wonderful thing...Don't get me wrong it's hard work and we get so few of these days over here that the usual beer garden routine seems a wasted chance but the clear head in the morning on what looks to be another glorious day tomorrow outweighs the buzz and fuzz of a Saturday night drink

We are with you in spirit! Today is like the mother of all drinking days in the US the Kentucky Derby AND Cinco de Mayo. Raising my cup of coffee to you! 
Yeah it is particularly difficult today. I learned that our thought are like clouds they come and go but we don't have to act on them especially the ones about drinking! Stay strong!
