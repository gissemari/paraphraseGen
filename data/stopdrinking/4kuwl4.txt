It has happened! My first year is done!..Firstly a huge thanks to this entire community! Seriously i would not have one year without this place. Anytime I have felt a craving or felt down I came here. There was always someone here or posts to be read or replied to. So seriously.... So many thanks!..I don't have any super inspiring stories or insights to share. I have stayed nearly the same person just without drinking. And I am 100% okay with that. I have had struggles and triumphs this year... And none of them included or needed alcohol. Its beautiful...Looking forward! I plan to be a bit more active on here. I also have begun journaling and am going to try to use that as a tool to improve my mental health more. I am also going to focus on getting healthier again! (high five if you've gained weight after getting sober! Woot woot! Lol) ..Otherwise... I am gonna just keep going. So today.... I will not have a drink! Please join me!!

I would love to join you. Congratulations on your year.
Way to go!
The fact that you have gone a year without drinking is more than inspiring! Looking forward to reading more of your contributions in the future. Congrats on 365 Days you rock! 
Congrats!! I'm happy to join you in not drinking
A year is by no means a tiny accomplishment you should be extremely proud.  I've never even come close to that and still can't even fathom actually reaching that milestone but at the same time I've never been sober for 23 consecutive days either. 
Nothing teeny or tiny about it....It's a HUGE accomplishments.  Shout it from the rooftops if you wish.
I am looking forward to my first year!!..**Congratulations on your first BIG year**
Congrats new Dino! Check your inbox :)
