[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I was having breakfast with a friend. I took another piece of toast and she said  Wow you eat a lot!  It was rude of her to say so but actually I was pleased because two years ago I could barely eat at all. My restored appetite is a sign of good health in my opinion...**Struggle:** My mother grew up during the war in England when there wasn't enough food so when I was a child she used to force me to eat when I wasn't hungry. As a result I still struggle with food issues as an adult. ..**General:** Feeling frazzled? Need to add a few moments of peace and calm to your day?
