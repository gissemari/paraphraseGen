Hi. On Day 3 again...I have been trying to get sober since last July after I totaled my car got in a grease fire and got fired from two jobs all for being drunk. Luckily noone was too hurt from my actions besides myself and even then just scars now. ..I finally checked in a rehab in October and made it until 3 months until January I relapsed on some painkillers and before you knew it I was off to the races. Six weeks or so of constant morphine xanax and 2-3 bottles of wine a day after just one dose of morphine in the hospital. ..I finally decided to stop again over the weekend and Im on Day 3 after having a minor seizure DTs and such on Sunday. My fiance made sure I was alright and helped me detox...Id say Im dissapointed I relapsed but Im not. Those three months I had I learned alot but I also went through alot of pain of realizing all that I had done to people for a decade or so. This time not so much. I kept to myself and mostly just tried to kill myself through drugs and alcohol...I am starting to do things again...I went for a run cleaned my apartment looked up jobs and slept pretty well for the first time in a month. Today I know I wont be drinking!
