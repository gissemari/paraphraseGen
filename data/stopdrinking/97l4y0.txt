This weekend I was called out by my boyfriend for drinking an entire handle in around 4 days. I was embarrassed ashamed yet I STILL continued to drink until last night to cope with it all. I am almost 24 hours sober and just need some support to stick with it. I have been a struggling alcoholic for around 5 years and need to make a change before I lose everything good in my life. Sooo here is to day 1!

Its the right choice way to go! Some people seem to decide enough is enough put the bottle down and never drink again. It was significantly harder for me to get a few weeks under my belt. If you stumble early on don't beat yourself up. ..Congratulations on making an extremely positive change in your life.
