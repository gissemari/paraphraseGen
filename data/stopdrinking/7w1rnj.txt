So i found this sub a few weeks ago and it is great. I have struggled back and forth with attempting to quit drinking for a long time now. .Went and got smashed for the Super Bowl and did some catastrophic damage to my life and once i sobered up a few days later i decided to try again. Remembered this place and started reading...wow...This sub is amazing. I always think about quitting but never last more than a few days because it felt hopeless. I've tried 100 times before so why will it work this time? Reading the stories here has made me realize that my situation isn't unique whatsoever and that there are many people who have struggled with and overcome exactly what im going through right now...I realized that the severe anxiety and depression that i experience the first few days is normal and it will go away(makes it seem so much less hopeless)..I've also come to realize that the relationships I've damage though bad now are still within repair and i just need to fight and show everyone that i am serious about this and that this is the last time that i will ever tell them that "I swear im done drinking"...I've been browsing this sub most of the day battling the urge to drink and it has been super helpful and motivating...Can't wait to wake up sober again tommorow! Thanks for listening to my rant...Edit:phrasing

Good for you!  Read  This Naked Mind  if you can.  Let's not drink together :)
Yeah man this fight is worth fighting :)
You and I are both at the end of our second day! I am definitely glad to see that I'm not alone in swinging between depression and anxiety. I wish you the best and I will not drink with you today.
