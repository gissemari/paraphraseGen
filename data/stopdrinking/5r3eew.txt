Finally FINALLY I had a great nights sleep. Wow. I've drank daily for the past 9 months and this feels amazing...I also got to enjoy a few cups of delicious hot coffee made just the way I like. Normally especially on a Monday I'm hesitant to have more than a few sips for fear of setting off the hangover-enhanced anxiety that makes me a nervous wreck on the way to and for the first several hours of work...[TMI WARNING] I forgot what havoc alcohol plays on your gastrointestinal system. I've been struggling with IBS as well as constipation off and on for a while and I take a proton pump inhibitor (anti-heartburn) drug daily. That combined with a daily dose of wine/vodka/beer and my bathroom situation has been well you can imagine. Adding probiotics and trying everything (except drinking!) hasn't had much impact...To the contrary perhaps inspired by the coffee things were MUCH more pleasant. Normal even. ..I feel like singing!

Wow!  What a difference even a few days makes!  I won't drink with you today.
Lol...So I had this issue too because I would take a ridiculous amount of pepcid when i was done drinking for the night...Everyday. my gut was like fuck you bitch. I found that coconut water kefir worked wonders
Yes it was nice to finally have a solid bowel movement instead of shitting brown water. I can't believe how long I accepted that as just normal. I will not drink with you today!
Good shit! 
Oh I think that your bathroom situation will improve greatly and you will be happy about it.
