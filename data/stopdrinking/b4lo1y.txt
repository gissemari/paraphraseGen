I'll admit I've found this subreddit helpful in terms of trying to quit drinking. I'll also admit that I'm ashamed to say I'm not sober since yesterday. One day at a time I guess...... I thought I'd share this for those who are still struggling. It's also however a reminder to those sober folk of why you quit and a reminder to never go back. .. I am the foolish pain in your head.I am the stubborn stain on your bed .I watch you when you sleep.But your secrets I will keep .I am that voice inside.That tells you .You wish that you were dead .You were dead.You were dead.You were dead.Don't touch the bottle .Your mama said .Don't touch the bottle.But that's your best friend .Keeps you numb.Keeps you dumb.Keeps you searching for that long lost crumb .Of solace.Of peace.Of some mind to keep .Of happiness.And joy.But it's fake .It's a ploy.You're not happy .You're just sad.But you forgot about those feelings.With the help of a brown paper bag .......
