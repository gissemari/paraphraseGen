I want to look into getting an addictions counsellor. I know I 100% want and need to acheive sobriety but am really struggling (badge is not accurate). In my teens and early twenties I was suicidal and didn't care if my drinking killed me but somehow despite my drinking actually managed to create a life for myself. I have so many wonderful things in my life that I want to be able to enjoy and drinking is my biggest barrier. I think that talking to a professional could be useful. ..So goal #1 is to look into getting a counsellor. ..2nd goal is to make it to a few AA meetings this week. Every day is not an option for me but I can go at least a few times. I don't love the religious aspects of AA but I know that I need to start meeting sober people. ..Am I missing anything?

**Goal 1**  Should be to Stay Sober **one day at a time.**  ..  Change 1 and 2 to 2 and 3...  Remember being here the number one goal is to always stay sober.  Great list and I wish you the best.  AA is great to meet other people to talk to and find advice. ..  Edit: Can i ask why AA isn't an every day option for you?  
I have good news for you AA is a spiritual program not a religious program. The Higher Power referred to is the Higher Power of YOUR understanding. Not Jesus not Buddha not Allah your own personal conception of a power greater than you. Religion need not enter into it all. I know a guy who uses electricity my buddy uses nature. It's personal. Don't be thrown off thinking it is religious.
