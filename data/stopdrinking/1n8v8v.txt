Hey y'all. My badge is a lie. I always "compromise" by doing some other drug and then hit the drink hard. I've strung 90-120 days together before but it doesn't stick. So I'm wondering from those with some experience what changed that kept you sober? What kept you from cycling through again? I'd prefer answers that are more in-depth than "I finally submitted to AA" but hey if that's all it was that's all it was. Thank you.

I relapsed once after being sober for three weeks a few years ago. I don't consider the last 6 months of my drinking a time of relapsing and being sober. It was more constant drinking and unhappy periods of sobriety. I really didn't want to get sober. I thought death was a sound alternative if prostitution and living on the streets didn't pan out (never did that but it was my next plan)...I was living with my parents at the time and it was a constant "game." They constantly babysat me and when left alone for more than 30 minutes I'd manage to get alcohol and get wasted. My dad even followed me to the liquor store once and followed me home and I told him to go fuck himself that I was getting drunk in the woods all day. MY DAD: My number one fan. Two hours later they found me almost drowning in a river I kicked and screamed my way home begging them to let me keep me 40 of vodka...I got a call on Wednesday May 25th saying that June 1st was my admittance date to rehab. I was sober because I was going through terrible withdrawals after a three day bender during which I was awake but have no memories. I drank on May 27th 2011. I didn't want to. I cried when chugging the huge 1.5 liter of wine. I was abusive to my mom that night. I haven't drank since...Rehab was 24/7 supervision. Rules homework meetings group sessions medication three healthy meals a day hanging out with other alcoholics hearing horror stories hearing about relapse and death. I soaked it all in. All of it. Even half managed to swallow AA (thought it was the lamest thing on earth)...I got home from rehab 35 days later. I went to at least one AA meeting a day for the 9 months. I got a sponsor. I also went to outpatient treatment for a few months which helped immensely...
Not sure what you consider a long-timer and if I qualify.....Here was my approach:..* I told the people important to me that I was going to make a major change in my life (cutting alcohol out of my life).* I sought support outside of my wife (I chose SMART individual therapy this subreddit the accompanying webchat in the sidebar).* I read the Allen Carr book in the sidebar.* I focused on doing **one thing** completely (not drinking) and let just about everything else slide.  I went to bed late I woke up late I ate crap I drank a shit-ton of coffee (and water; I drank lots of water) I watched lots of movies I watched lots of TV I continued to be lazy.  But I didn't fucking drink..* I gave myself a break.  I knew this was it.  I knew I wasn't going to give in and drink.  I knew it was hard.  If so many people in the world struggle with alcoholism it has to be hard to quit.  So I knew I was embarking on a difficult journey and that I should give myself a pat on the back...By using the means of support I described the idea of not drinking became easier as I saw others who were struggling with the same problem.  Also it helped to interact with people who seemed to not be struggling so much (like frumious raevie offtherocks AF sf\_derp sustainedrelease and others).  This inspired me to realize that I'm on the right path and there is hope...By reading the Allen Carr book I started to see how I could approach life without alcohol.  Alcohol offers nothing positive to my life.  I really looked at all of the things I thought were fun (and related to drinking) and realized that it wasn't the drinking that was fun.  I realized that all of those things would be just as much fun with a glass of water.  And I've been right.  Seeing and doing these things helped remove my desire to drink completely...I don't think that quitting drinking improving yourself and being sober are things that can be accomplished by half-assing it on some support forum.  If you look at the people who used this sub-reddit as their sole means of support (otr reavie ...) you'll see that they got involved early.  And they **really** got involved in the sub-reddit and the webchat.  They post they comment they help people.  I try to do those things following their example but I also did the other things too.  I wanted to be damn sure that when sobriety got difficult that I'd be ready with tools to deal with it...Finally I found fun things to do.  I ride my bike.  I play tennis.  I take Krav Maga classes.  I play board and card games with my friends.  I go to Terps and Redskins games.  I watch TV shows with my wife.  I play around with Open Source projects.  I have so many things going on in my life that I don't have the time or energy to drink.  Nor do I want to.  I couldn't imagine being hungover while playing 4 hours of tennis and taking a 1 hour Level 2 Krav Maga class.  That's madness...Good luck!
10 years ago I had a good job people respected me I earned loads of money attracted a good woman we got married and we had kids. We were both heavy drinkers - worked hard played hard. But she had no trouble stopping when the kids arrived. Given enough reason most people - even the heaviest drinkers - can stop and can control their drinking. My wife could get drunk just like I did but she only did it a couple times a year - christmas  weddings that sort of thing. But eventually there came a time for me when I had to drink every day and I had to drink to pass out every day...I went to AA in 2002 it was either that or us my wife told me. She rang them up and found out when the meeting was and sent me there. I didn't like it - people where talking about their "feelings" and it was in a church and they were holding hands and praying and I was thinking any minute now the tamborines would come out. I don't talk about my feelings and I don't beleive in God so AA isn't going to work for me. I went back home and told my wife that they'd told me that I wasn't an alcoholic - I was lying. I knew straight away from what they were saying I was an alcoholic. They spelled it out to me. Once I started drinking I couldn't stop and when I managed to stop it would only be a matter of time before I picked up another drink no matter how bad it had been no matter how strong my resolve. My resolve was not enough and I knew it but I told my wife I was OK and so then I started to drink secretly. ..I started to drink in secret a lot of the time. Waiting till everyone was in bed or putting it in my coffee or hiding it in the garage. I was trying to control it - If only I could just drink 2 bottles of wine a night I'd be OK. But of course on top of all the drinks I'd be sneaking during the day 2 bottles of wine would send me into blackout and in blackout I'd go out and get more booze. This went on for years. ..My wife couldn't understand how I'd fall down drunk after sharing a bottle of wine with her over dinner. I started to act strange to her I was turning into a mad man. I remember her telling me she was desparately worried that I'd turn into the kind of man who would kill his wife and children before turning the gun on himself. I terrorised her and my children eventually I engineered a situation where I would leave and make it look like I was the injured party. It was always everyone else's fault - If you had a life like mine you'd drink - that's how I saw it. The reality was I wanted to leave so that I could drink as much as I wanted and now was my chance...I lasted 6 months. God knows how but I managed to hold onto my job but I was pretty much drinking 20 hours a day and passed out the other 4. Alcoholism is a progressive disease. It never gets better it always gets worse. The quantities you consume go through the roof no matter what you try to do. This means you end up pretty much in blackout all the time with only brief periods of lucidity. During these brief moments of clarity all you want to do is kill yourself. ..After 4 suicide attempts I ended up on a bridge. The highest one around. I was stone cold sober and the most rational thought I had was to jump - I knew I could not go on drinking and I knew that I could not stop and stay stopped. But I didn't have the balls to go through with it. So I did what I always did when I was frightened and anxious and didn't have the courage I went a bought a bottle of vodka. I wasn't surprised how easy it was to get a bottle of vodka at 7:30 on a Monday morning I'd done it a thousand times before. ..I was too proud to drink it in the street. It was pride that was killing me really. I would rather off myself than admit I had a problem that I couldn't solve. I had missed a deadline at work and that's why I was going to kill myself. I was willing to scar my kids' lives leave them without a father and their mother without an income to bring them up because I was too proud to admit I had failed. I had failed to control my drinking I had failed at everything else in life. I was too proud to be seen drinking in the street so I went to my usual drinking establishment - locked inside a toilet cubical at the train station. ..It was my intention to down it quickly and then hurry back to the bridge climb over the railings and just fall into the water. I knew I had 20 minutes or so before it kicked in and I'd blackout at which point I'd fall off hit the water at about 90 miles an hour break every bone in my body and drown...I came to in a small room sat beside two police officers. To this day I have no idea what happened on the bridge. They had been with me for a couple of hours and they would not leave me until I had seen the psychiatrist. I was in hospital. I remember asking them why they were there bothering with the likes of me and they said that they'd rather be here with me than out there chasing some chav in a stolen car because they thought that I might have a chance at rebuilding my life. It was the first time in years that someone had shown an interest in helping me. All my friends and family had lost hope years before...I saw the psychiatrist and he asked me if I wanted to be sectioned or if I wanted to admit myself voluntarily to the psychiatric ward. I asked him what the difference was and he said about 6 months so I chose voluntary admittance because I had to be back at work soon bacause they wouldn't be able to cope without me would they?. I was completely off my rocker...It was a locked ward. They gave me librium to stop the seizures you get from withdrawals and they showed me the same care and love that the policeman did. On the first night I had another moment of clarity I didn't want to die this time though. I just realised that the game was up and I also realised that I couldn't fight it alone but that didn't matter because it seemed that everything would be ok because other people were willing to help me if only I asked. All my pride had gone my ego was well and truely deflated but somehow it felt ok even though I was locked up and unable to get any booze. Ordinarily I would have been climbing the walls but instead some kind of calm had descended...Over the days it became clear to me and the staff that I was not insane I was just an alcoholic. The psychosis was temporary. Alcoholic psychosis is short lived. Take away the alcohol and the psychosis goes. They suggested that I go back to AA. Up until then I hadn't even occured to me that the problem was my drinking. I went back to AA and since then I have never left...Just over 3 years ago my lifelong obsession with drink left me and as long as I practice a few simple daily steps I'm pretty certain it won't come back. I now know a new freedom and a new happiness. I don't regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. I comprehend the word serenity and I know peace. That feeling of uselessness and self pity has disappeared. I have lost interest in selfish things and gained interest in other people. Fear of people and of economic insecurity has left me. My whole attitude and outlook on life has changed...I don't plan on drinking again. For the majority of people like my wife alcohol is harmless - they get drunk every once and a while and it's not a problem it's funny. But if you are an alcoholic of my type some day sooner or later you'll pass over the line of no return and you'll never be able to drink safely again. It suddenly goes from funny "ha ha" to funny peculiar and eventually it ends up in tragedy. The only hope you have then is to admit you have a problem and ask for help..Good luck.
Thirty two years. Never relapsed. My respect and fear regarding alcoholism was and remains profound. I was very sick drinking 24/7 to stay out of withdrawal. I went to inpatient treatment AA got a sponsor did the steps went to counseling and a women's support group. I would have done anything to get well. And did. Also I worked full time and had two young children to raise one with a disability. My time was filled with positive activity and hard work.
For the first six months I slipped and slid I would get a week and then pat myself on the back with a six pack.  I was defiant I was trying to do it my way I still had all the answers I still thought I was a little bit unique and that there had to be a loophole for me.  I was going to AA but aloof...I was miserable.   Then one time I took the proverbial cotton out of my ears and put it in my mouth.  I stopped sitting with the other backsliders I gained that tiny piece of self esteem that said I could do it.  I let myself become accepted in my AA meeting.  ..There were times it was not easy after wards - the divorce at 4 years sober had some close calls but I did not pickup.
I tried to quit a bunch of times. I tried a lot of "only" smoking weed experiments which were of course a really bad idea. I think the longest I went completely sober was about 2 weeks the shortest was about 5 hours. (From "I gotta quit!" to "I can totally handle drink" in under 1/4 of a day. Yes.)..By the end I fully knew it was a huge problem. I knew I was alcoholic. I knew it would have to stop that I would have to quit completely. I kind of just embraced it for a while thinking "I need to quit someday but not tonight!" All the while my bad nights were getting worse I was making a bigger ass of myself and endangering my health my livelihood and my safety. I just got so sick of it but never sick enough of it to quit...Then suddenly on my last night I ended up in the emergency room getting a catscan and a dozen stitches to the forehead. It was not cute it was not romantic it wasn't gritty I wasn't Sam Spade or even Charles Bukowski. I was a sad stupid drunk who damn near killed himself at age 34. That was what did it. I was just done with it. I think it was the stupidity of it that really clinched things. If I had died that night it would have been an utterly stupid way to go. Call it vanity but I didn't want my epitaph to be "what a waste". Thats what made it stick - that I was just so sick of it and had given up any thought that I had options other than quitting completely. It was quit or die. ..It made the choice very easy to be honest...
I'm no old timer except I'm older-43-don't really know how old you are...I've quit drinking three times in my life and this one has to stick I feel like I've run out of time and like I've run out of options if I drink again I can't guarantee that I'll live through it...I got to a point where suicide was looking like a very logical option...At that point I realized that I was sick (&amp; I didn't trust myself because I didn't want to die-I've got things to live for) not bad not weak not stupid not a failure just sick and I need to get well...When I came to AA everything just started to make sense. I understood why I felt so depressed angry ashamed guilty unhappy unsatisfied when I stopped drinking I realized that I was addicted I realized that the insanity that proceeds the first drink happens to everyone who is like me (alcoholic) I realized that I don't have to do this alone I realized that I have support of other fellas who just like me don't want to get drunk today...If I pick up a drink I will get drunk that's the way it's always been since the first drink and there is nothing to present as proof that it can ever be any different for me....I listened and held on to the belief that somehow I'm going to get well. I have a sponsor and I've gone through the first seven steps of recovery in AA and continue to do what is suggested to me by folks that have gone through what I've felt and feel and experience...I'm not alone anymore. I couldn't stay sober by myself and I stayed sober for over six years one time. .
Surrender. You slip for a multitude of bullshit surface reasons but you really slip because of only two. You still believe alcohol is going to be fun or you think you can control it. Slipping and coming back to AA smashes both of those dead. You need to see that your answers don't work or you would be sober or controlling your drinking. Similarly if drinking was working again you wouldn't stop. Drinking doesn't work other drugs don't work food doesn't work. You need a spiritual solution.
A.  a junkie died in my bathroom cuz I was drunk and didn't know how to deal with it..B. FINALLY realized this equation Drinking= Bad Things Happen.C. After a pretty good while of sobriety am thrilled daily to wake up with NO hangover.       .D. 18 years sober. I know I cannot have 1 drink. I am a drunk. I need them ALL.    So I don't take 1.  Still and always one day at a time.
Wow. Powerful. I read all of these so far. I am grateful for this subreddit alot of recovery here. It's a good place to go when i'm loosing hope. Reminds me why I stopped in the first place.
I drank during out-patient treatment.  There was too much freedom to fuck up.  Only after I attended an in-patient treatment 60 miles from home did I break the habit of drinking.  I'm not saying that alcoholism is just a habit.  I'm saying that I had to get away from the daily routine of going to the liquor store and camping out in my home office every evening drinking what I bought.
I'll tell you exactly what keeps me from relapsing. It happened again last night.  ..I go to AA meetings and although I'm not buddy-buddy with most people there I do know them by name. I've seen a few of them relapse.  ..Not one person ever came back and said it was fun. Not one. I see the hang-dog look on their faces the pain the shame the remorse and I want no part of it.  ..Sure I fight my cravings. Yeah I've heard that DrunkVoice trying to seduce me. And I hold strong to the fact that no matter how tough it seems to stay sober it's even tougher to GET sober.  ..I relapsed once and it was not an experience I want to repeat. The big problem is **now I know better**. I know that drinking just isn't going to help me in any way. I'm not going to solve my problems or even avoid them. I'm not going to enjoy it. I'm not going to feel better in fact I'm going to feel a LOT worse.  ..It's not going to be fun. Failure self-loathing remorse and depression make pretty lousy mixers for C2H6O but in my case they aren't optional mixers they're mandatory and I don't like the taste.  ..Last night one of my AA brothers picked up another Desire chip. Night before last he got hammered showed up yesterday hung over at work allowed a co-worker to provoke him got into a fistfight and now is unemployed. He was sober for over a year picked up the booze for a single evening and drove his entire life into the wall. I think I'd rather remain sober.
My one relapse if typo want to call it that was 11 years ago. I got drunk one night. Iv woke up the next morning and my first thought was why did I do that. I may be some Wootton to the rule because I can drink just one beer one our twice a year but never two. The second one I feel and when I feel it I fall. I can not stop street that second one. Since there is damn little difference in 1 and 2 I don't drink at all. I can not go back to being the person I was before june 3 1993.  I served in the military saw some bad things got hurt and with that added in I know if I start drinking again bad things will happen. They will happen and the people I love will be the Victims not because I would hurt them physically. Its what I would do to me and to anyone that tried to stop me. That's a one way train I don't want a ticket on.
I have yet to slip. Relapse is not a requirement.
I realized that I was alcoholic. I was drunk without intending to be my behavior was substandard and the idea of living without drinking sent me into  melodramatic self pity. I rescinded my drinking privileges. I was finally surrendering to reality. Reality is my higher power.    
Antabuse got me to 146 days.  I've never gotten this far before.
I'm no old timer but I've met a LOT of people with many years of sobriety who haven't relapsed. They always tell me the same thing: "You don't have to relapse. It's not required." And they didn't. They just stayed in AA worked the program and didn't drink a day at a time...I have to keep that attitude because if I start thinking relapse is a part of recovery I'm done for.
I slipped right before I had one year the first time. I have 25 years now...I was at the beach with my family and I ran into a bunch of kids from my hometown. I hung out with them for a few days and one night I put down my soft drink and picked up a beer.  I had been to a meeting that day and done my meditations and talked to my sponsor...What I learned from that situation was to be vigilant. This alcoholism thing doesn't completely go away. I may not think about it much and the craving may be gone but it's there. I also learned to really pay attention to H.A.L.T.   When I picked that beer up it was a about 2am and I was both hungry and tired and surrounded by people I didn't know well...I also went straight back home to a meeting...FYI - My experience with other drugs (I've had 2 c-sections wisdom teeth out and an emergency gall bladder surgery) is that prescribed or not  drugs make me crave.  If you are "compromising" by taking other drugs rather than drinking you are making it extra hard on yourself by keeping the craving going.
Hmm after countless meeting an intervention a halfway house and a stint at an inpatient rehab...along with two fiances and countless jobs I found myself selling cars and clearing silly amounts of money still trying to rationalize it and pretend it would all turn around once my finances were in order doing my damndest to be a "functioning" alcoholic. But ten years of raging alcoholism couldnt keep the strength of the denial up...It occured to me that from a utilitarian position my best bet was to kill myself. It also occured to me that although that was the simpler choice in terms of effort put in for results I could just sober up...So thats what I did up until that point the most id strung together was 6 months 2 weeks and 4 days. Ill have 3 years december 20th. 
I tried to quit 1000 times.  I'd wake up each morning and think "I'm going to quit today."  Failed each time.  I failed each of those times because I was physically addicted to alcohol.  If I drink one day I will want to drink the next day.  That want is hard to overcome at least for me.  It's like being stuck on a hamster wheel...I've quit for longer periods in the past.  A few weeks here &amp; there a handful of others.  One time I quit for 6 or 7 months.  None of those times stuck either.  Looking back I can see that I was never fully committed. I was always looking forward to drinking again "someday."  Because of that I was never entirely comfortable with being sober.  ..Even in that period of 6 or 7 months I would still go out to bars occasionally &amp; not drink. But I wanted to.  I thought I was being strong by not drinking. It made me feel good about myself to stare temptation in the face &amp; not succumb.  I thought I was making progress. And I suppose I was in some ways. But in other ways it was detrimental.  If water drips on a stone for long enough it will eventually bore a hole through that stone. And the stone doesn't even see it coming.  The whole time the stone thinks "pfft a drip of water I'm way stronger than that."  And it is. Until it's it.  It's just a matter of time.  I think it goes the same way for a person who both a) wants to drink and b) is hanging around in bars...This time around I spent a lot of time convincing (brainwashing) myself into not wanting to drink.  I spent a long time contemplating "forever" and I am completely OK with not ever drinking again.  It's not easy to get your mind to that place but if you can do it I would recommend it.  Many people prefer to go through their lives thinking "one day at a time."  For me one day at a time is nice tool to use when the necessary but for my regular day to day life I don't think in terms of one day at a time.  I think "I don't drink."  I don't smoke I don't eat razor blades I don't cheer for the Cubs and I don't drink.  ..I can't remember the last time I've wanted a drink.  It wasn't always like this. The first month was rough. There were trying times along the way.  Days where I had to actively work to stay sober that day.  Bike run talk to a friend go to bed early.  Not enter a bar or go to a party where alcohol was served if I wasn't feeling 100% secure.  I do believe that it takes being 100% sure btw. You might think 90% is good enough I don't think it is.  Been there done that.  I know that if you do something you're 90% sure of 10 times you will end up drinking one of those times.  Water eventually bores through stone.  Las Vegas isn't losing money.  It's just math...There's more of course. I got involved in this community. Doing so educated me and helped me solidify my mindset.  I am able to watch others &amp; learn from their mistakes so I don't have to make those same mistakes myself.  Then there was confronting the reasons I wanted to drink. For me I drank to run away.  Getting drunk was like a little mini-vacation where I could forget about my problems &amp; worries.  The problem with that is that those problems never go away if they're not dealt with.  They fester until you one day reach a breaking point. There is lot of interpersonal work that comes along with quitting..."Sobriety isn't about not drinking it's about becoming the type of person who doesn't drink."   That's what I've focused on.  
Don't compromise. You know that other drugs lead you to drink. So don't do that. Learn from your triggers and mistakes and don't keep repeating them...I don't know if I qualify as a "long-timer" but I'll answer anyway. I'd quit before in the past for various periods of time. Weeks months even a year or so. But the intention to quit for good wasn't there. I hadn't accepted that I had a real problem and I certainly didn't identify as an alcoholic. In my mind it was more like taking a break. I thought moderation was possible so I did a lot of experimenting before coming to terms with that not being an option for me. That's what changed this time around. I accepted that I had a problem. I gave up the dream of someday being able to moderate. When I accepted that I couldn't drink no matter how much my brain tried to rationalize it when I accepted that I was *done* that was my turning point. 
324 days isn't long time by any stretch of the imagination but -  the stark realization that drinking was a not so passive slow form of suicide and if I have another drink there won't be another chance to quit.
