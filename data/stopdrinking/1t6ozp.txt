I have "begun" AA several times this year. And I've felt fed up with life a lot this year. Then a couple weeks ago I just felt "fed up with feeling fed up" fed up with things I don't like about myself and fed up with not doing things that I know help me when I do them...Especially fed up with the fear I have about starting things about people and fellowship and socializing...I have a couple of great relationships. There's been some stress there recently and I'm a little apprehensive. One of my partners wants to talk with me about something I can't help but be apprehensive. But I know she is one of the kindest most compassionate people I know struggles as much as I do with feelings and communication and always intends well for her relationships and people she loves...I also know that I've had partners who can't wait before. I've had relationships where my partner wants to investigate every bad feeling they have about me immediately. In chat for example. During work for example. I'm grateful for having people in my life who can wait who can ask to make time for discussions...I've begun going to meetings in earnest attended fellowship for the first time on my birthday this weekend made some contacts towards having a sponsor. There are a couple people offering their help and I've been lightly agonizing over this "choice." Partly because I think they're both good!..This morning I decided I could just make a coin flip and someone at a meeting reminded me this choice wasn't and needn't feel permanent...So I made my coin flip (after writing down specifically what the "head" and "tail" would mean and I feel good. The same partner whose desire to "talk" later has me feeling somewhat apprehensive she also voiced that it was cool that I had two choices both of which I felt good about...And that's true. 16 days and I can allow myself to feel grateful for opportunities for good options in my life and for the practice of leaving some things to a higher power...I still am carrying a general dis-ease and apprehension today and feeling very procrastinatory at work. I think I'm going to try to meditate for a couple minutes and say the serenity prayer to myself and then see if I can get myself up to at least one significant task..

It sounds fine. You're doing fine.
It's ok. Just ride the wave.  Easy does it.  Then take a nap.   You deserve a rest.  :)   After you do that read a book exercise and eat some chocolate.  :)
