Yesterday with an idea that humankind is doomed to fail in their long term commitments i relapsed on not only one but on a lot of my commitments. One of them was drinking of course. That's why I would like to share all the negative outcomes I faced yesterday so if anyone is thinking like me can rethink his/her choices. ..\-The feeling of guilt about both the things I've said and done in addition to the feeling of guilt as a result of relapsing...\-Nausea all night and in the morning...\-A really disturbed sleep...And interestingly some of my friends thought my relapse is a success for the reasons that I will never understand. I don't think that way and I will commit again to not drinking today. ..Good morning and have a nice day everyone IWNDWYT.

Don't give up.  
It's never worth it! Great job making the list
Welcome back. IWNDWYT 
I'm right there with you - resetting today  
With relapse comes learning 
That sucks. The best way to stop a relapse is to call somebody who supports you in going sober the second you think about drinking again.
Keep your guard up.  In my experience the first few days after a relapse are prime time for another one.  
Any friends that cheer you on after relapsing sound like really shitty friends. They should want to support you but I guess that shows a lot about their own character. Hang in there. You got this. One step at a time 
Thank you for sharing.  This is a very difficult path and the best is to get back up when we fall.  You can resist that first drink.  iwndwyt
