October 19 2018 I went out over a stupid resentment. Since then I've had almost 20 resets. And 58 total. Today I find myself on day 1. Again. The difference is that in a few hours I'll be going to my first meeting since I went out. I know AA works and if I want to get better I need to make a change. So hopefully this Good Friday will mark my new life. Until then IWNDWYT. thanks for reading.

Go for it.
You've got this! IWNDWYT!
Welcome back Corgie!   AA has helped me tremendously.  Just finished reading the Big Book.  I really enjoyed the stories of others in the book.   I also love the people.  I've never been so welcomed by a group of strangers.  ..I've had my share of day ones but I can't tell you how much a learned every time a fell.  Failing has helped me understand what works and what doesn't.   I know I'm still not perfect but I also know that I am resilient.  ..Sober on with me my friend!
