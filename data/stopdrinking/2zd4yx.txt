Hey everyone! ..I've noticed a lot of people posting on here that one of the biggest issues they have while trying to stop is a very hard time with sleep whether it be falling asleep staying asleep and the like. While I am by no means an expert I'd like to share some tips and advice on how to minimize this and maybe make the struggle a little easier...**First of all how much sleep do you need?** The National Sleep Foundation recommends [7-9 hours for adults between 18 and 64 years old](http://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need) which is what I would assume to cover most people in this sub (if you fall out of that age range there's a really helpful chart on that site). The 7-9 hours is just a good starting point though and only you really know how much sleep you need...Now that we have that out of the way let's cover **sleep hygiene**. Sleep hygiene is essentially just having a healthy way of getting yourself to sleep and staying that way. University of Maryland Medical Center has a pretty great [sleep hygiene overview](http://umm.edu/programs/sleep/patients/sleep-hygiene) and it covers the bases pretty well...One of the things covered in that last link is to establish a pre-sleep ritual which for me has been the biggest factor in getting a good night's sleep. I'll walk you through it:..Since I had to be up at 6 AM when I first started this routine my goal was to be asleep between 9:45 and 10:15 PM so I'd start my bedtime routine at 8:00 PM. I know a lot of people have taxing jobs kids etc. which might make such a long routine unfeasible and I totally understand. **The important thing is that you find a healthy routine that works and stick to it**...* **8:00 PM**: No more cell phone TV laptop tablet or anything like that. I understand that that's not possible for some people and if that's the case then I *highly* recommend using a blue light filter on the device. [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) is pretty awesome and is the standard for laptops. [Twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en) is what I use for my Android devices and it also works very well. This is important because the blue light from your electronic devices is designed to light up like the sun and hold your attention which really messes with your [circadian rhythm](http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Education/Pages/Factsheet_CircadianRhythms.aspx)...* As soon as I power down the screens I would plug my iPod in and listening to some music while I read with a low light. **Try to avoid reading in your bed**. It is very important that you only associate your bed with sleep and sex that way when you get into bed it'll let your body know that it's time to sleep. As for the music I prefer something light and low. A couple bands that help me sleep are [The xx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pib8eYDSFEI) and [Beach House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuvWc3ToDHg) but *whatever* relaxing music you like is on the table. Remember this is all about making you comfortable!..* While reading I also like to drink a cup of sleepytime tea. I particularly enjoy the kind with valerian root but to each their own...* **9:30 PM**: Shower time! A nice warm shower is very good for [lowering your body temperature and making you sleepy](http://sleepjunkies.com/tips/warm-shower-helps-you-sleep-better/). I have an adjustable light in my bathroom and honestly nothing gets me more ready for bed than a warm shower with very low lighting. It's so relaxing. I also like to use a specific soap during this shower as this helps establish the routine further and helps me associate certain scents with sleep...* **9:45 PM** In bed lights out. The best kind of sleep environment is cool and as dark and quiet as possible. I know the quiet is out of your hands much of the time (and I myself like to sleep with a light fan on because I have tinnitus). If your room is too bright at night I recommend getting a set of blackout curtains for your room. They honestly work wonders...* **6:00 AM**: Rise and shine! Getting out of bed as soon as you're awake is a very very good habit to get into and helps maintain that circadian rhythm that was mentioned earlier...This is my routine. As I said it's most important that you find what works for you and stick to it! ..A couple of notes:..* I didn't cover melatonin because because I'm not a medical professional and I don't want anyone to take supplements without first researching it. Same thing goes for other OTC sleep aids. The one thing I will say is that after a particularly stressful day a half dosage of Zzzquil* right before my shower seemed to help but again **do your research before you try anything!**..* I also didn't cover alarm clocks because I was more focused on the falling asleep than the waking up but honestly the clock you use is important! I recommend getting a [light-up alarm clock](http://gizmodo.com/a-light-up-alarm-completely-changed-my-life-1535668863). I have the alarm clock linked to in that article and it is incredible...* Clean sheets (and a clean room in general) are a (wo)man's best friend!..I hope this helps some of you guys! I've been a lurker here for a while now and even though I've never commented here you guys have gotten me through some ugly nights so I wanted to try and give a little something back :)..**EDIT** as /u/puckhead66 pointed out Zzzquil is 10% alcohol so be *very* careful.

1. Great post.2. Beware Zzzquil is 10 percent alcohol! ..I used it for a week before I realized. I also feel off the wagon during that week:(..I don't blame Zzzquil I blame myself but unknowingly adding alcohol couldn't have helped. ..
I used to press snooze all the time but then realised I could just set my alarm later and have that extra bit of sleep instead as long as I get straight out of bed. Since then ive always felt much better in a morning. Alcohol not playing a factor in that one. 
i've found that music doesn't do much to help me drop off but what **does** work for me is leaving my laptop on my bedside table and leave it playing a stream of South Park or something with the volume down so low that I can barely hear it. ..I think it just helps to drown out the dumb chatter in my brain that always stops me dropping off.
A nice cup of chamomile tea before bed can really help to send you off.
Thanks for the post especially the hints for software for dimming the blue on screens got both of them for my laptop &amp; tablet. I read books on my tablet before going to sleep and always found it quite bright even on the lowest setting. They work great and are a lot easier on the eyes :)
