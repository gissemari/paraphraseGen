But damn it if I don't feel good about driving down to the office and trying to open the front door that was locked. My internal dialogue was all over the place before I gritted my teeth and just went for it.  Yeah it will be uncomfortable and my heart will beat fast being around strangers but I need to be around some other people familiar with the struggle.  I will call the office tomorrow to see which meeting times are active.  I'm 7 days in after relapsing after 4 1/2 months.  I think this is a big step for me in terms of maintaining long term sobriety.  Have a good rest of the weekend guys and gals.

I'm so sorry it worked out that way but good for you!! You did the best you could!! And wow what a good attitude - I would have definitely taken it as a sign of defeat and quit. But you want to keep trying! That is a great sign! Woohoo
Aww shoot! Well don't give up.  You made a big step by being willing to attend a meeting...so I hope you try again!  Congrats on coming back and making it a week. 
Willingness like this will take you a long way.
You are correct.  A support group is a big step for maintaining long term sobriety.  Make sure you call and find that next meeting. 
what area do you live in? The meetings aren't listed online? ....Sunday night a lot of places have a lot of meetings. You could still make one!.
I go to meetings and talk to another alcoholic every day and I see a councilor every two weeks. I'm determined to stay sober this time.. it's worth it. Keep coming!
