Today is the 10 year anniversary of my Daddy's death. For at least the past 7 years I've gotten absolutely trashed on beer to cope. I'm 54 days into my sobriety and will not bury my grief in alcohol. ..Arrived at work and its taking all my strength not to go home and just say 'fuck it' to all the work I have to do. But I will get through today and I will do it without alcohol...My Daddy died due to addiction (Opiod/narcotics) and I have definitely struggled with addiction myself. I quit drinking because I want to live. ..I want to have a family. I want to see my kids graduate from college. I want to be there when they get married when they have children of their own. I want to be there for all the things my Daddy wasn't here to see me accomplish...I'm 28. Daddy was 38 when he died. I'm overcome with grief but I'll survive. For my family. For my friends. For myself...I love and miss you so much Daddy..IWNDWYT.

&gt; I want to have a family. I want to see my kids graduate from college. I want to be there when they get married when they have children of their own. I want to be there for all the things my Daddy wasn't here to see me accomplish. ..&amp;#x200B;..This was a part of my motivation to get clean as well. I was 28 when I finally acknowledged I had a serious problem and made my first steps to quitting. I'm almost 2 years in now and my husband and I are considering having kids in the next year or at least try to anyway. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've also lost my father it was one of the roughest points in my life because I was such a daddy's girl he was the rock of the family and it felt like my world was turned upside down and never fully righted itself. ..&amp;#x200B;..Keep strong IWNDWYT
Your a strong woman and I'm glad to hear your beating your addiction....keep your chin up and stay strong. Something tells me you can do it
