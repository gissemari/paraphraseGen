I'm at the point where I don't think about how I'm sober every second of every day. I feel like I'm just going about my life now. I definitely think that at this point 69 days I need to be sure that I don't become complacent..I've had a few realizations about myself:.1. I need to work on setting boundaries and sticking up for myself. I'm easy going/generally non-confrontational and therefore easily taken advantage of..2. My brain is weird and that's okay. I don't have to beat myself up for having anxiety and crazy moods I just need to rely on the healthier coping mechanisms that I've found..3. Things bother me that probably don't bother other people. I'm sensitive and highly empathetic and that's okay. I don't need to drink to deal with those feelings. Feelings and thoughts pass on..4. I always try to remember HALT especially the lonely aspect. I'm an isolator I used to isolate with drugs and alcohol but that's not healthy and could lead to relapse. I'm trying to force myself to hang out with my buds even when I don't feel like it..5. I'm experiencing anhedonia and it sucks but I'll just keep at it. Maybe sobriety will change that in time...I also had a challenge. I've been interested in nootropics  and am trying a few but I ordered kratom without realizing it had abuse and withdrawal potential. I canceled 1 order but the other is going in the trash as soon as it arrives. It's definitely a scary situation. Even though I know I don't want to throw away sobriety and progress it still freaks me out that I'm being tested like this. It was a huge mistake to order it without researching more. I'm finally at a place where I don't constantly crave a substance to ease my emotional pain. No way am I going to prolong post acute withdrawal. I worked so hard to get where I am...I just got a gym membership today. :) I'm eating healthy and drinking more water. I'm in a good place; a place of growth. Next step might be seeing a psych doc. Getting sober is a whole thing. I will not drink with you today...
