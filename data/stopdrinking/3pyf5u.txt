I'm up against a lot right now in the process of a divorce dealing with depression still work at a winery.  That little voice keeps suggesting I engage in some irresponsible behavior but I don't want to be hung over this weekend with my kid.  9 months in but it seems like it is getting harder in recent weeks.  Probably the sudden divorce.  I've been telling people that I am trying to go at least a year without drinking but I' afraid that I am setting myself up for a relapse at that point.  Thanks for being here helping me narrowly avoid the "fuck-its".

As someone who can empathize since I went through the same thing in my first year. I was terrified of losing custody of my children so this was a powerful motivator. I had an alcoholic father; I don't think you want to be one. Your "kid" deserves a sober Dad. Do something fun with him/her this weekend. ..Taking it one day at a time was easier for me than thinking ahead. Worrying about a year sober was overwhelming. Thanks for your post.  
Had to eat a monster burrito of questionable origin but it filled me up and kept the cravings at bay (never liked drinking with much food in my stomach go figure).  Kid is in bed now for a bit of sober chill time.  Couldn't do this without SD.  Thank you all.
