Well guys and gals.  I'm going to need a reset.  I relapsed over the summer and it ended with me getting a DUI on Oct 20 (thank God no one was hurt).  I haven't had a drink since then.  I have a new fiancee and step daughter to be.  They are the light of my life.  Quite literally the best things to ever happen to me.  Over the past couple of days I have been craving a lot.  ..That old self loathing creeping in. .. That voice that whispers to me you can't do this.  ...You don't deserve this.  ..Just a couple of drinks.  Just to take the edge off.  Maybe find something else too. ...I shut my fiancee out last night.  I retreated into myself.  I hid from my feelings.  I hastily put up the old walls and cowered behind them.  But she broke through them.  She would not let me hide; she wouldn't let me wrap myself in hate any longer. ..So I am here to be accountable...To take account of my thoughts and feelings....I'll see you all tomorrow.  For today though I will not drink. ....

Glad you're back.  I don't think you deserve your own self loathing either.  I think making the decision to take action for yourself and your family is awesome.  I won't drink with you today!
Not drinking with you today. My one night relapse ended in the first run in with police I've ever had.. 6 nights ago.  For a day or 2 I thought my life was over but I have a new beginning that can end happily.  Yours can too !
