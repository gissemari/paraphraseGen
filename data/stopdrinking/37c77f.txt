I'm proud of myself!!! It's been one month since I had my final drink! My alcohol counselor said that if I make it to three months (90 days) I have a 3X better chance of staying sober and not relapsing than  those who make it to 30 days. So this is crunch time. I know I can do it! I feel fantastic and never want another hangover again!

Badass! You're already a third of the way there. You can totally do this! 
Great to hear.  Keep at it! It's inspiring to read these kinds of progress updates from all the different timelines of sobriety :)
Yes yes yes! You can win! You feel great! You. Can. Do. This!
Awesome! Keep on working at it! 
Yaaaas! Warning: my second month was more challenging than my first. I hope this isn't true for you but if it is know that you're not alone. It's normal for this to be challenging. Keep going. Don't quit. Find other ways to deal with the holes that alcohol fills. If you're like me you won't regret it one bit. :)
That is GREAT!!
Nice work!
I failed after 62 days and again after 104 days..Be careful.
