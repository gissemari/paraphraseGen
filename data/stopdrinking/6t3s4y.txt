I CAN'T seem to get more than a week of sobriety under my belt. I keep relapsing at the Day 8 mark. This has been going on for years. Back in 2012 I quit for almost a year (11 months). Now I find it more difficult than ever to stay sober for more than a week. .How can I take my sobriety to the next level?

What's triggering you on the 8th day or after a week? 
Maybe don't think of it as Day 8 (or 7).  Every day is Day 1 with respect to not drinking for that day.  I know the whole "one day at a time" thing is bandied about a lot in alcoholism circles but it really works.  Forget about your number of days and stick with just today... 
I don't like the words " I can't " . I'm going to stay sober I'm going to make each day one more day that I don't drink . I also think the alcohol addiction has its own voice and I like to tell it to shut the f*** up . You can do it ! I wish you strength  
Perhaps you can try different paths to sobriety? 
You just told my story. I can't wait to read the advice as I enter early sobriety yet again. The past 2 years I've yet to put together more than a week. Rarely it's past 30 days. And once 13 months. I *think* I'm finally worn out from it all -- and scared. I have a therapist now too and it helps to talk.  I also know I can go to an AA meeting anytime; there are hundreds where I am and although I don't like it it's a safe place to go if I need to get out or feel the urge to stop out...
