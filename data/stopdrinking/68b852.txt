Every two to four days I am back at the Guinness. Went for thirty days last August but my self control and trigger response is letting me down. Going to meetings but the last two were bad. Cross talk and advice. Had to take a couple days off and the result is that I relapsed. So starting again.

If I relapsed it would be a choice. ..A bad AA meeting doesn't force me to drink.
Good for you. Keep trying!!!
