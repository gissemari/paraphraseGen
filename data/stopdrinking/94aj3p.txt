Hi sobernauts.  I had about three months where I was doing really well but in the past couple weeks I've fallen off the wagon and I'm right back where I started.  It's amazing how quickly it happens.  ..I'm trying to get back but the first day is always the hardest.  It's so easy to just say  I'll stop tomorrow  or  after I finish this bottle  or  after this next vacation  or... you get the idea...I could use some help and encouragement to get through this Day 1.

Yes it's so easy to start that horrible cycle again.  Well done on achieving three months before and you know you can do it again.  It's just taking that first step one day at a time.  I was in a similar situation had 50 odd days sober then got too comfortable with myself and started all over again.  Absolutely awful but am determined not to make that same mistake again.  Good luck to you and IWNDWYT
Glad you're back :)...The first few days I kept as busy as humanly possible...I hung out here on SD the IRC went to meetings hit the gym whatever it took to not pick up...You had 3 months - you'll do it again and more ;).

You can do it! Tomorrow will come and you will have that first day all tied up. One foot in front of the other and before you know it you will be back to where you were but stronger with the knowledge you now have about how quickly it can unravel. IWNDWYT. 
Now you know.  Come back up on this wagon and rest a while here with us!  We got your back.  **iwndwyt**
