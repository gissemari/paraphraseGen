Good on you mate for not having a drink. That's a hard situation to be in. What are your co-workers like about you not drinking? 
I have friends that are bartenders and sober. It's been done before. Just be careful. Be conscious of your long term goals.
I work in a bar too and it can definitely be a challenge but not one that's insurmountable.  For me it made a huge difference when I told everyone as they stopped offering me drinks and expecting me to drink with them.  For the most part my coworkers have been supportive and even admiring...Congrats for not drinking and I wish you a good 24...PM if you need anything!
Good work on not taking the after work drink!  I know it can be extremely tough especially in that enabling environment.  That's a victory right there.  .  .I work in a restaurant and I found that the first couple of shifts were the hardest for me. Why? Because I had a habit and reputation of always staying after my shift and getting drunk. Once I linked together a week of going directly home I noticed a change in my coworkers who had probably noticed a change in me...fewer drink offers fewer questions about my abstaining.  After the first month I had a new reputation...as the guy who goes straight home after work. I Think it gets easier with time.  Best wishes for you in this fight!    
Might be best to lie to those people and protect yourself.  Say you have a liver issue and the doctor says you shouldn't drink VS sharing personal stuff about why your not drinking....seems like that opens the door to "come on you can have one". Just a thought...good luck
