The day I relapse? ..Go to my first AA meeting? ..I've never been to an AA meeting but I'm really feeling some holiday blues...  ..How do I find a meeting?   Do you just go and show up?  How does this work?  ..Thanks in advance

Meetings are easy to find. Just google your city name and AA. Often there's a website with meetings or there might also be a number you can call. Then you just show up. There's no cost nothing to bring or say or do. If you have a desire to stop drinking you are welcome. I personally have found a lot of relief just being around people who understand if only for an hour. It's reenergizing. I think you're onto something here. I'll be looking for one myself soon.
You just go there is no obligation in doing anything. Go sit and listen no worries. 
Google your city name and AA meetings. It shouldn't be too hard to find one. Just show up and try to listen for similarities rather than differences (for example as a 31 single male I don't have a lot in common with a 60 year old mother going through a divorce but if she describes how she felt when she was trying to not drink I can relate to that). ..At the beginning of the meeting they might ask if there is anyone attending their first ever AA meeting. If you introduce yourself people will approach you after the meeting and offer to exchange phone numbers etc. If you don't feel like introducing ourself that's fine too. The only rule about sharing is that you shouldn't give advice to others that is referred to as crosstalk. Instead you are simply encouraged to share about your own experience. If you don't have anything to say or don't want to talk simply don't raise your hand. That's fine...Good luck! 
Here I had to help http://www.aa.org/ I have even called the AA hotline and they arranged someone to come and get me because I can't drive.
