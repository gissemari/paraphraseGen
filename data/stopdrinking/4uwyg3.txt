congrats on day 13 that's awesome! a really good milkshake has sometimes helped me a lot with cravings in these early days. sitting outside in the summer weather and doing some people watching while sipping the milkshake somehow helps. whatever you end up doing i hope you are happy and proud of your accomplishment so far and imagine how much a hangover would suck! keep it up and keep on keeping on :-)
Yesterday I had a day like that compounded by overwhelming sadness for no clear reason. I read a bit made myself an Italian soda and did some major mindful breathing.  I stayed here on SD the majority of the day because it helped me so much.I took a shower before bed and imagined that I was rinsing away all the shitty bad feelings of the day. Woke up today in much better spirits. ..I think maybe for some of us these funks are part of our journey. I will join you in not drinking today. Keep moving forward and we are all here for you.
Congrats man I'm not drinking with you today.
I had the foggines and tension headaches around week 2 also for me I just had to get through it but it's gotten better. 13 days is awesome keep it up!
