[We have a tradition of doing milestone posts (link)](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/14ghxc/5000_subscribers_a_look_at_sd_by_the_numbers/).  We were at 5000 such a short time ago that 6000 blew by without me even noticing.  And here we are at 7000.  Wow...Badgebot's badge number represents the total of all of our badges.  Last time we did this badgebot had 1146144 days. Today the little feller' has 1592174 days. That means badgebot has added 446030 sober days in these last couple of months.  That's 446030 hangovers foregone 446030 regrets not had 446030 bad decisions averted and 446030 * $(god only knows how many) dollars saved.  A conservative estimate might put that number at around $5000000.  Way to go badgebot.  You rock...When I first started coming here we had just over 1000 subscribers.  It's been kinda neat for me to look back at the old milestone posts & see my own comments. It's a strange feeling really. I remember writing the words of course but in some ways it seems like they were written by a completely different person.  Time changes things.  Sobriety changes things...I thought it would be kind of fun for everyone to leave a message for their future self on this post.  No format really just anything you'd like to say.  You know how's it going?  What are your struggles? What little triumphs have you had and what did they mean to you?  Who are you spending your time with?  What are you worried about?  What's your general outlook like?  What changes are you hoping to make? What are you having for dinner tonight?  Whatever...I'll link back to this post sometime in the future. When you read your comment back you'll be amazed at how much you've changed.  You'll be reminded of how far you've come. And who knows you may not even recognize the person who wrote it...Thanks to everyone for making /r/stopdrinking such a special place. You guys are the best...**Edit:** [For you numbers geeks](http://i.imgur.com/LxK5hjk.png).  You know who you are.  @@cough@nowhereplans@cough@cough@..x

hey! you did a great job last night!..i hope you see this and remember that eveything you are going through now was worth it...too many times you go it alone and i hope you learned to alleviate some of the pressure by building a thighter bond with T____ and E____...nothing is in vain if you at least tried. ...
I made it a year here and it doesn't seem like it was a year... times are still rough but I'm able to talk them while sober which helps more than anything else. I still have the habit of wanting to drink sometimes I don't think that ever will go away. It doesn't change my life but sometimes I want a glass/bottle of wine sometimes I want something to spike my coffee and I wonder if that'll ever go away. It doesn't change my life but it always irks me the next day because I thought those thoughts would be entirely gone by now. 
I am going to read each of your letters to yourself as if you are writing it to me.
Sorry about the credit card!..did you remember to keep first things first? and has it snowballed since 2013?
There's no going back.  You cannot undo the years of manic destruction nor can you ever find peace in a drink knowing what you know now.  Now step over the bodies and take a seat.  You're in the right place.
This is to never upsetting my wonderful girlfriend again and have her put up with my drunken ass of a self...This is to never waking up in a jail cell again wondering how I got there...This is to never having to experience the pain/nausea of the next morning hangover...This is to always being in control of my own actions...This is to not spending the last few dollars I have on shitty malt liquor...This is to never getting into it with my dad again...This is to never feeling dehydrated or 'sucked up' again...This is to not ever alienating my friends/family/strangers because I am a drunken asshat at a social event...This is to never having to feel the shame that I drank and neglected my responsibilities...This is to being able to be fully there in a dangerous situation...This is to never having to feel the guilt to having done something while I was drunk...This is to a new life a new me a new beginning!....
Hey future me. I did this for us. You're welcome!
Dude you really quit at the right time didn't you?
I have a million things I wish I could say to past-me but I had to think awhile about talking to future-me.  I would like to say:..&gt;&gt;As you know I squandered the last 10 years.  I'm better now but a big part of my recovery has been the promise of the next 10.  Ditching the booze is just the first step.  Are you doing the work to become a better person?   Less selfish less petty less lazy less bitter?   More giving more friendly more open more forgiving?   I've started down this road but I do tire easily these days and my progress is intermittent.  I need you to keep at it.   And so do others...
Well if we're doing this every ~1000.....Hi JBH_mike from March 25.  I hope you're doing as well in the future as I am now.  March 25 should be about 127 days so good job.  Pat yourself on the back...If you're struggling remember that feeling you've had over the last 100 days.  The energy the clarity the happiness.  It's all be so good.  Now remember the bad times from 101+ days ago.  You put poor $wife through so much.  And she's been so supportive.  Isn't it worth keeping those good feelings going forward?  You're even *closer* to 40 now (with 28 more days under your belt).  You look better than you have in 10 years.  You're closer to $wife than ever.  You've gotten your work-mojo back now that your brain's normal is a sober one...You've come too far now.  Keep it up!
Hey future me I hope you're rocking out sober. I'm counting on you the make the right decision. These past few months have been really productive and amazing in my health relationships and money. ..It's like when you stop drinking all the fortune cookies came true...WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU START DRINKING AGAIN AND RUIN THE MAGIC THAT IS THE FORTUNE COOKIE?..Stay strong homie. 
You made the best decision you could have ever made! Way to go!
Friday August 14 2015 = rollover 16000 as long as I keep doing what I've been doing .....
Dear Future Self..Hey it's Past You! You're about to go to outpatient therapy for your bipolar and you're going to acknowledge the fact that maybe you aren't an alcoholic yet but you are a problem drinker. I hope you learn ways to cope that don't include alcohol. I hope you make it one month sober again and then two months three months...one year. Alcohol is not part of a healthy lifestyle sadwhalenoises don't forget that. Be the best you you can be without alcohol. ..Learn to love yourself so I can sign this "with love" next time. ..Past Self
Dear future self..It's today when I'm writing this. It's today when you're reading this. Stay in the moment.
76 days you didn't drink. You don't need to do 76 more you only need to do this one. Worry about tomorrow tomorrow...Going to a meeting today is not some gigantic commitment for the rest of your life. It's just going today greeting some people and that's that...Relax. Breathe. Cry if you need to.
Now I understand the Badgebot!! Great idea also thanks!! .
You should've stopped drinking when you had the chance.
Dear future self.Hello there beautiful! If you are reading this it means you stuck with our sobriety. Which also means that I am so proud of us because we have come a long way. Be sure to thank moose and show him your appreciation every day for helping you through some of the tougher spots. Thank mom for being supportive enough to join you in your journey. Although right now things are scary and it all seems hard I hope you will see this and smile because you kept going. I'm preparing to go to a meeting right now so that I can feel more confident in my ability to make sure you are healthy and capable of performing to your very best potential. I'm learning more and more about us every day so look around all of your blessings and smile because you CAN and WILL keep winning this daily battle with alcohol. If you're still the scared little girl on the inside don't feel ashamed it's only natural. Besides I know you are brave enough to press on despite your fears. Keep up the great work I can't wait to be you. 
Hey there Future Me!..Today's status update is:  28 days in!  That's four weeks since you made the decision to stop drinking.  When you took an honest look at the Wikipedia definition of 'High Functioning Alcoholic' and realized with sad recognition that that was you.  That you were driving people off with your reckless behavior.  Twenty eight days since you woke up at 4am and sadly drank the last of the shitty Rite Aid wine.  28 days since you read a thread here on /r/stopdrinking that inspired you to go to your first AA meeting.  To admit that it was your first day and get a 24 hour coin and a copy of the Big Book...What an awesome milestone.  In the past month life has been unleashed.  Your potential is limitless.  Just imagine how far you can go!..P.S.  offtherocks:  Thanks for the numbers porn -- love the spike in January.  Nothing like those New Years' Resolutions!.
&gt;446030 * $(god only knows how many) dollars = **$5000000**  ..http://i.imgur.com/s8aDtPw.jpg...That was very converative... in my old days I've spent between 200 /270$ and 400 /540$ **each** weekend!..**Hey future me!!! Hope you've stayed strong!! It's feeling great right now and If you fell off the wagon get back on it! Sober life = best life! ......Ouzzzzzzzzzzz!!!! (insider)**..Oh yeah currently on 102.7kg..A delicious hole for you (NSFW): http://i.imgur.com/4EfdpPh.jpg..
Hey Eric ..I want you to reply to this post in one year and tell me how great you're doing sober. I'm proud of you. You can do it. 
hey there future me. It's been over a year now since you decided to stop drinking and isn't life awesome. Hopefully you're running your business full-time by now and you're training for your first marathon...I hope Paige passed year 12 and she's about to start uni. You were able to help her achieve that by being a stable supportive and non drinker in her life. Yay you...Thanks so much for not going back to drinking and creating a much better future for us...
You don't have another one in you.
Jaysus this is growing quick!  Fair play
Remember why you are doing this for your wife your kids and you.  Never forget how good life is now versus it was then.  Continue to take it slow listen to others and smell the roses.  And quit picking your nose at work.. You sick fuck.
Well done for making it this far! You made the first and biggest step in improving your life and kept at it because you knew how important it was to start living and enjoying life truly. You stopped throwing away your weekends poisoning yourself in a pub feeling sorry for yourself and collectively wallowing with others without actually doing anything to improve your situation. ..Well now you have! Feel proud of yourself man because this is huge. You took control of your life. Every single day you made a small effort to better yourself and your life. You stopped talking about wanting to follow your passions and actually did something about it. ..Once you cut out the alcohol your depression anxiety and self doubt subsided significantly. You no longer worried about needing to get a few drinks into you before you could come off as confident and impressive and you certainly didn't need to worry about the stupid thing you said to someone or how you acted like a drunken mess in front of them. No more terrors of black out and being freaked to death about what happened during. That's all behind you now. When your social circle expanded beyond the few drinking buddies you had you found other people that shared your passion and interests and together you created something spectacular. You know what I'm talking about!..Every single day at a time. That's what it's all about. Work it and who knows what amazing things you'll accomplish in the next 1000 days...P.S. Check out those awesome liver function tests! That was a risky moment wasn't it? You're doing fantastic now.
Thanks to everyone in this subreddit for sharing their stories - I feel like my journey was strengthened by reading every struggle setback and success that you all were brave enough to share. Thank you...I hope "future me" isn't so hard on herself for making bad choices. ..Future Me stop thinking about what could have been! You can't change the past. You can only change today. You should be proud of every day that you stuck with your decision. You should be proud to be alive now because you often thought you wouldn't make it. That's success. Be grateful for every day you woke up and didn't wonder what happened the night before. If everyone else can forgive your mistakes then you should be able to forgive yourself too.
Dear Future-Me..If you're drinking again I'm gonna kick your ass...-Present Me..P.S. Say hi to ya mother for me.
Today's day 3. What's day 368 like?
It's been over a year. Lots of tough decisions coming up. You stayed strong through even tougher. Here's to you.
Dear future self..You are totally capable and I love you.
Allright quotaman. You better fucking not have started drinking again. .."Just one beer wont hurt right?" "Aw cmon we havent seen eachother in ages lets hit the pub!" "You dont drink ever?" - all of these things have happened or will happen. ..I hope you have the presence of mind to understand that you can't go back you can't be a "casual" drinker you can't have "just one" and drinking is not going to fix anything. I hope you can remember what it was like when you quit for the last time forever. Why you quit. Why it is so imporatant to stay quit. ..Even as an athiest I pray for you. I pray you will keep it together hang on to what is important remember who you are and why you are that person. Stay strong. Stay golden...
Dear future me..I love you.
This is where it hits the road me. I can do it.
What the hell were you thinking?

Message to future self from current self: I believe in you. Have courage. 
Hey future me.  This week you had a dream about your dad.  You got to hug him for the first time in so long.  He drove you to a meeting - an AA dream meeting of all things.  Whether or not there is an afterlife - his spirit is with you pushing you to keep going. I'm so proud of you.  He would be so proud of you.   You've grown up into an incredible person ever since you decided to take this journey head on.   You could not have made a better choice for yourself.  Stay strong.
Nothing bad will ever happen that is a direct result of sobriety.
Hey future pinky_promise. ..Do you remember what your old life was like? Do you remember how many precious weeks and months and years that went by so gray and unfulfilled? Do you remember how many opportunities you destroyed? But...do you also remember what saved you? And what you were saved *from?*..One desperate night in that hotel room you just shut your eyes and said *"no more."* And stopped you did... living your life as a man who just ceased to drink. You didn't know it then but you also made a more important choice: life. You chose to live again. And you're 26 days young as I write this. As you reread this now have you grown? Have you invested in yourself? Have you invested in others? Can you say that you're proud of the person you're becoming?..**Hope is everything.** And I hope you say yes.
Dear sober best possible future self thanks. Keep feeding the good wolf.
Dear me..Calm down and stop obsessing over it and/or her. Life is meant to be lived not observed. So **STFU** and go say hi to that newcomer. You may have what they want...PS: Would you just move to New Zealand like you've always wanted and stop with the what ifs?!
Have you stopped living in the future?  Have you given up or are you still trying to run your life?  I sincerely hope you've cut back on the chocolate brah.
