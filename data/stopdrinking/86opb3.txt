I've been sick and pretending to be well for a long time my world sort of came crashing in on me about 5 days ago. I've been sober homeless and jobless for 4. I relapsed after years and am so terrified. My now ex-gf told me for months I needed help she did practically everything but walk me into the the doctor's office. Yet I didn't put in much effort usually just stopping altogether. As it is now I moved practically halfway across the country to get the help I need and I really doubt I'll be moving back there. ..It's a long story I don't want to repeat it yet again. I've been to treatment before I wish I could be there now I'm going to a 90 day program but I'm scared of what comes next. I can't even watch a TV show or movie just chill. I'm at least staying hydrated and getting food in me and trying to walk around not take naps so I can sleep at night. My anxiety about the future and what I have put my ex-gf through with my alcoholism won't let me rest. I don't want to keep texting or calling my sober friends I just have to make it to Monday.

Try to focus on positive thoughts and taking care of yourself until Monday! Hydrating is a very good start! It sounds like you've got this! 
If it were me I would break up the two days waiting into wait into smaller more manageable chunks.  I would focus on hydrating and eating.  I found that when I ate I was less likely to drink because i always drank on an empty stomach.  I would also go somewhere anywhere that doesn't have or remind me of alcohol.  Even if AA is not my thing I would hit a meeting or two and spend time with sober people tell them I'm headed to treatment and ask for support to get through until Monday. Basically take everything either hour by hour or task by task or activity by activity.  The time will pass all by itself.  90 day treatment sounds like a blessing.  I would embrace it with every fibre of my being. .Can you check in with us later please?  IWNDWYT.
