It feels as though I am juggling between two different mindsets between the morning and evening. Some insight from the community would be much-appreciated!

I think it's about when it's socially acceptable to drink. ..Morning: time to be productive it's odd drink. .Afternoon: a little more acceptable to open a beer.Evening: everyone is setting in and drinking ..It is frustrating to wake up feeling great but as the day progresses and you see more people opening their first drink. ..By evening it's easy to forgot how great it felt to wake up that morning.
I needed to plan new activities for the evenings.  My party run was 5-8 pm.  I found a couple of SMART meetings during the week nights.  Got a membership to our park district fitness center.  That took up some more evenings. Later on I got involved in Yoga classes.  I need alternative activities to retrain my brain.  These are all instrumental to my continuing recovery.  Plan ahead and change your pattern. After all you are building a  new  you!
For me it's work. Wake up nice and refreshed in a good mood. And then by the end of the day (sometimes only 5 minutes in) those fuckers will always find a way to ruin  my good mood and bum me out.
