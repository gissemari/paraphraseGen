I was watching the season 1 finale of Nashville on Netflix last night and [spoiler:](#s "Deacon a character who'd been sober for 13 years goes through a very stressful situation and relapses hard.") And it kind of stressed me out and triggered me a bit. ..I've been sober for nearly three years but I went through a very stressful situation over the summer with a friend (she has OCD attempted suicide and refuses help) and I was having super intense cravings and I feel like I nearly relapsed. The fact that I accidentally took a sip of alcohol a week or two prior (they screwed up my mocktail at a restaurant and accidentally gave me an alcoholic drink) didn't help. So I don't cope with stress well and I know what it's like to be on the edge of relapsing like that. So it really scared me and now alcohol's on my mind a lot...It especially scared me because I'm going through a stressful time in my life (I'm nearly finished my master's degree will be finishing in June or July but school is totally kicking my ass) and I'm worried about the same thing happening. So watching this TV show brought up a bunch of emotions in me. Can anyone relate?

When I am struggling for whatever reason I remind myself that I can stay sober for this day only. If I go to bed without drinking then I chalk it up as a particularly sweet victory.
If the show has constant drinking it becomes like static noise to me but sometimes it'll conjure some thoughts. Take House of Cards alcohol scenes in a bar? Static noise. But when Claire and Francis are scheming late at night and there's the closeup of the whiskey decanter and pouring of a finger....yeah. it makes me think. Not that i want to drink but the sexy fixture in life that the marketing creates.       ..I just take those moments as mini temptations to practice saying no to.
