**Warning:** *A long post awaits ye for those who dare travel below these depths*..The mission of this post is to document my first 30 days of experience with alcohol rehabilitation recovery; what led me there; the struggles; what worked and how life has changed since...**Mayday   A time for change**..So things were getting to a point for me that I have had just enough of living in this fashion (with Alcohol). I started getting a lot of panic attacks as of recently depression and thoughts of self-harm. I found a lot of things that I would have no problems in doing previously in my life which now give me anxiety as my confidence diminishes...So after a public and humiliating panic attack / semi-break down (as I look back in time and again people were just showing genuine concern; but I can't deny those feeling either); with the potential of not being able to pay my rent and losing the apartment; I went straight to my doctor...After about a 30 minute conversation he calmed me down gave me a lot of helpful suggestions: Moving back in with my parents temporarily (I've been single and lived on my own for about 8 years) counselling and more exercise. He prescribed me Pristiq anti-depressants and have been checking in with him daily to check in on any withdrawal signs like the DT's. We will also be doing blood work when I am feeling better as I currently have the flu. My doctor said he wasn't surprised that something like this would happen (the flu) as I was under so much stress plus the withdrawals were bound to compromise the immune system...Along with the help from the GP I signed up for help with a Drug rehabilitation counsel worker (out-patient) and a clinical psychologist but more on that later...To my surprise of all the punishment I've dished out onto my body over the years my blood work came back perfect. (I had the following done: blood pressure Glucose Serum Chemistry liver and kidney function Haematology Vitamin D and B12.)..**Moving forward**..Part of my treatment in counselling was apart from one-on-one keeping a journal and doing various reflective exercises. One of which was something you all might be familiar with:  Cost Benefit Analysis'. I thought I'd just share that worksheet in its entirety now without comment as a sort of baseline comparison for where I started out. ...*Cost Benefit Analysis of continuing my drinking the same as always*..**Pros**.. 	Adds some excitement.. 	Relieves boredom.. 	Gives some form of sleep (not rolling around all night).. 	Relaxing.. 	Able to feel something...**Cons**.. 	Deteriorating health.. 	Guilt of previous night's activities.. 	Poor sleep.. 	Beating myself up mentally.. 	Disdainful looks from others for my actions (real or imagined).. 	Pale / moon face.. 	Dermatitis.. 	Beer gut.. 	Lethargy.. 	Unable to get up in mornings on time.. 	No motivation to engage in activities and to just be lazy.. 	No money.. 	Unable to budget money.. 	Can't go out and socialize.. 	Can't engage in coherent conversations at times.. 	No personal confidence.. 	Unable to date people.. 	Cutting off of social friends (online/offline) due to belligerent behaviour.. 	Unable to sustain a job.. 	Poor concentration.. 	Stomach problems.. 	Constant lying (myself and others).. 	Loss of time.. 	I hate blackouts.. 	Fear that I might hurt someone else (emotionally or otherwise).. 	Being told I'm unreliable.. 	Alienating friends and family.. 	No vision of future self.. 	Lack of self-image.. 	Depression.. 	Death from intoxication.. 	Self-inflicted bodily harm (accidental cutting).. 	Thoughts of suicide...It's been good for me in keeping a journal as I've been able to reflect on my state of mind as I progress. A big change no needed to be made in my life away from life. I know need to fill all those sober hours up with something; so engaged in some new activities including: re-learning the piano running yoga meditation reading and just generally organising my day so that it was full (I also notice my apartment was a lot cleaner)...**An unfriendly encounter**..(a paraphrased post on /r/stopdrinking 2weeks in). Just got off the phone with a lifelong friend just then. First time I've told him what was going on with me over the past 2 weeks .So he knows I've got problems with the bottle and we've talked about it productively. But when he heard that my councillor recommended detox at hospital he said  fuck that shit you don't need it  which turns out I didn't I did detox by myself while I was sick with the flu  See exactly . However then he became disappointed when I told him I would be visiting a local hospital alcohol counselling centre for assistance along with psych meetings and anti-depressants...From there the said well the writings on the wall you got to get out of that shit (which is what I'm doing). Then went on to suggest before I had finished study and training I should be doing and friend that can help with a resume and maybe get an interview and that this is all just down to isolation (which is a part of it). And looking back on the paragraph that I had just written that sounds all very reasonable advice to give someone unemployed...The problem is I'm not in a healthy state of mind. Those conversations go off in my head all the time also from family members and job case managers. The problem is multiplied with all my other stresses piled on top and with the manner I was handling all of this  with alcohol...This push; pull; shove (loss off / no control of life and the anxiety associated with) was exactly where I was at when I had my breakdown (detailed in above link). He had to go before I had a chance to explain all of this (I heard his kids causing havoc in background). Although I know he doesn't think it or I had this inner monologue where he was about to say  Just toughen up and be a man  you know shitiest thing to say to a person in depression (yes I know I'm projecting internally here but it should give insight to my state of mind)...I was having a good day today but now I feel low and like shit. As my social worker said you need a break from life for a few weeks so you can sort all of this out before going back into the world. So I wrote the post to vent a bit and to get it off my chest. He said to come around on the weekend to talk through things which I will do. It's just I wished I hadn't picked up that phone today it set off some anxiety I didn't want and am trying to recover from...Anyway I not drinking so that's a good thing. I'm going to go for a walk around the block and listen to some classical music to bring me down a notch. ..**2 weeks and the state of the nation**..A list of things and changes I've noticed this far in:..  I've stopped using Visine on my eyes. They use to be red all the time when I woke up due to dehydration. Not getting that anymore they're white when I wake...  Sleep: I'm actually getting quality sleep I get tired at 11pm and feel like sleeping so I do then wake up at 6am without breaking it or rolling around  which for me is amazing...  Mornings are easier to get up when the alarm goes off..  My face is starting get back some colour (from the pale grey)..  My eyes are now wide open so I've noticed and so have my friends and family commented on. My eyelids tended to sag like I was tired all the time (because I was)..  Black bags under the eyes have almost disappeared and are less puffy..  I don't feel like shit all the time (anti-depressants (Pristiq) probably have something to do with this as well as abstaining (started meds at same time I stopped))..  No hang overs (obviously)..  More money in my pocket (I would have spent $280 AU in the previous 2 weeks in comparison an average bottle of vodka in Australia costs $30)..  Living sober feels different without alcohol than with it (can't explain it really that well I seem to be more in the moment)..  I'm more able to keep my commitments to family and friends I'm also able to schedule my time well and stick to it (reading study meditation exercise cleaning piano practice ect.)..  Filling up all of the sober hours in the day was hard at first but what I did was made a brain dump list of all the possible activities no matter how small or large (shaving brushing teeth study IT technical manuals yoga ect.); that I could do...  Anxiety levels are down and confidence is up..  Losing weight...**A close call (another reddit post)**.. So part of my therapy is seeing a social worker and clinical psychologist. I was asked to start keeping a journal and tonight for some reason dived into some childhood memories that really hit hard and raw...I knew these triggers were happening as I was writing so I kept deferring to drink later once I finished the log I was out the door and off to the bottle shop...It was a very slow and long walk than would normally take me as I was feeling pretty shitty. I then started to negotiate with myself  you don't have to go on a full bender anyway because your tolerance is down  so I cut the number of beers I was going to have in half. Then I thought well  I'm on anti-depressant (Pristiq) medication could be dangerous for me or make it ineffective so I don't want that. I was about 50 meters from the store as I stopped and I negotiated down to 2 beers and finally thought a thought came to me  <insert name here> as shit as you feel now beer is going to make it worse. Go home put on Netflix and watch some comedy movies . So I turned back for home and here I am writing this post...Today was a shit day but I didn't make it worse by drinking.". .**This   is your (new) life!**..A lot has changed for me it's difficult for me to associate with the person I was on alcohol with where I am now. I'm happy and content and my days are full. Although I am optimistic I'm not na ve. Life will eventually slap me in the face and I need to learn to deal with that without alcohol. So coping skills are a new must have for me as I'm learning to cope...Mindfulness has been an extremely potent tool for me in combating cravings and urges (although hard at times to just ignore and go on auto-pilot). The ability to stop and be aware of your emotions what's happening in your body and question the logic of your thoughts (opening a dialogue with yourself). A long with that has been guided mindfulness meditation which has helped me reduce stress http://marc.ucla.edu/..Another major component was learning that guilt helped feed the cycle. You need to learn to forgive yourself of past indiscretions but not of the responsibility of them. Also be compassionate to other people at the very least we've all learned what it's like down that hole and we've gained some empathy for the human condition...The biggest problem I faced when going sober was shifting from a day that had 8 hours sober to 16 hours sober (not including sleep). You've got to find new activities (cause clearly the old ones won't do) and try and structure your new days out (don't plan too far ahead). At least plan today and tomorrow...Don't know what to do try brainstorming. Write down every little activity you can think of from ironing washing to exercise talking to friends on the phone. Call up your local community centre and see what's going on at the moment. I called up my local centre and they have archery for newbies so I'm going to try my hand at that on Monday. 2 hours for $8 I may like it I may not... but it's something new to try and isn't going to break the wallet. Shit I might even meet new people...**To be continued**.. and so life goes on I'm cautiously optimistic but also wary of incoming hurdles. Although this ends this post and I thank you for reading I hope your recovery path works well for you. I'll conclude with a list of resources I've used in my journey:.. 	General Practitioner.. 	Social worker.. 	Clinical psychologist.. 	Pristiq anti-depressants.. 	Journal.. 	Daily schedule.. 	New activities.. 	Exercise.. 	Mediation http://marc.ucla.edu/ (free guided mindfulness meditation mp3's).. 	/r/stopdrinking.. 	Dr. Stanton Peele books:  7 tools to stop addiction' &  Recover: how to stop thinking like an addict and recover your life'..
