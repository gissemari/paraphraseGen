I relapsed last month on day 7 - but today I'm on day 8 that's exciting!  ..I'm very irritable today - SO is dragging me to a concert tonight which I am dreading.  Meeting friends beforehand at a restaurant/bar and then an arena show. I tried to get out of it but SO got upset.  Grr.  I'm not going to drink.  I guess  I'm irritated because 1) concerts aren't my cup of tea anyways  2) my strategy to remain sane over the last week has been to go to bed SUPER early and this is going to mess with my schedule.  ..I didn't like concerts for a lot of reasons (loud stay out late etc) but you also can't get your drink on very well there - long lines people pushing you etc. So at least I don't have to worry about that.  Plus I can drive so my SO can relax and have a few drinks if he likes.  I used to make him always drive so I could have a few 'extra'. ..I will look at the menu at restaurant and make a plan and get excited about what I'm going to eat and drink.  Something I had never noticed before is that quite a few places have "mocktails" on the menu.  Who knew!!..Ok feeling better already. ..Happy Monday sober peeps!..
