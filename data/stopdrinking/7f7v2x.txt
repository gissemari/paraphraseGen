Well this has been a long time coming. I've been off work all week and drinking accordingly. Woke up Wed feeling pretty shitty and decided that with Thanksgiving being the next day I wanted to be thankful for not being hungover. Just had a beer with dinner and nothing else (normally I start at dinner and just keep going steadily until bed time). Then the wife came down and wanted to go out in the hot tub. Without even really thinking about it I poured a martini as we got ready to go out. Drained it while soaking then came in and grabbed a snack and figured a beer wouldn't hurt with some food. By the time I went to bed way too late I might add I'd gone back for a glass of sherry and 3 or 4 more "sips". You know the ones where you just pour a little booze in the bottom of a big glass and mentally justify it as "not counting" since it's not a real drink or even really enough to constitute a shot? Even though for me it's probably more than a standard shot pour. Anyway woke up yesterday feeling pretty shitty again and realized I'd killed my goal of being hangover free for thanksgiving. Decided staying sober all day was the next best thing. ..I started reading some posts here for motivation (been lurking for a couple years) and it started seeming like a better and better idea. I realized I can't remember the last thanksgiving I spent totally sober but it was probably at least 15 or 20 years ago (I'm only 35). I came across a post about planning for dealing with cravings and being around booze and gave it some thought. I planned out all sorts of excuses and arguments to make when people offered or pushed booze on me (I'm in no way comfortable explaining to my wife's family that I quit drinking because I think I have a problem yet). I opened SD on my phone kept the tab up all day just as a quick way to remind myself what I was doing. We got dressed got the kids and wife loaded up (she's on crutches at the moment) and by the time I headed back into the house to grab the pie I was about ready to grab that gin bottle for a quick nip before we left. I didn't...We got to my in laws' and I was offered a beer before I even got my coat off and kids in the door. "Here we go" I thought and braced myself for battle. I said "no thanks think I'll stick to soda" and that was it. My father in law said "ok happy thanksgiving" and walked away. it was just that easy. At dinner they were passing out wine glasses to the adults and I said "no thanks" and that was it. I was actually a little astonished. I sort of imagined it being some huge internal struggle or expected someone to push or offer repeatedly but it was literally just that. A no thanks and everyone just moved on like it was no big deal. The rest of the day passed pretty uneventfully. I noticed that almost no one else was drinking which was weird as I seem to remember a lot more drinking going on in years past but maybe that was just me. We stayed until 6 or so headed home and put the kids to bed. "Now the real battle begins" I thought. I watched the basketball game which I remember had some leftover dessert watched a few old Thanksgiving episodes of Friends with my wife and went to bed. Once again that was it. No big battle nothing. I'm almost a little disappointed like it feels like it should have been harder or something...Anyway today I feel good. Tired but good. Today is thanksgiving part two with my family but I'm less worried (they're not big drinkers). I can't say if I'm really ready to make this a forever thing but I think I can at least say that I won't drink today and go from there.
