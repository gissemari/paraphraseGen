So let's say I go two days without drinking... hooray! But the next day I have a rather stressful day at work and I decide to grab a beer afterwards. The cycle has been broken and once again I drank by myself (I'm trying really hard to only drink socially). It's a Wednesday. Which means I might as well just finish out the rest of the week and continue breaking this promise to myself... I'll just try again on Sunday. Does this make sense and does anyone else on this subreddit struggle with this?

Yes. Except I've mostly given up drinking socially as I am embarrassed for people to see I have a problem. But otherwise yes

The cycle is real for me. I don't go out to drink. I stay in.
All of the above plus: Sunday is the 26th. I might just as well wait till the end of the month - June 1 will be the start of my new life...I decided not to wait for 'special' days because they're meaningless. Our calendar is a made up system. The best time to start is right now. Sobriety is like a superpower. I wouldn't delay cashing in a  1m cheque so why should I wait to start such a great journey?
