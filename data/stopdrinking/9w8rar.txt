so between september and october i done 30 days and was so proud but then relapsed at a party and blacked out for three days. I was ashamed but I'm almost at the month mark again! In fact i should be able to reach 33 days this time. (i have a birthday party on the 24th which i'll probably end up relapsing at as it's a family thing and i'll get super awkward otherwise).  ...i'm just glad i can actually go longer than 3 or 4 days now. what a difference.

Way to go! When I have occasions where I feel like drinking is going to be impossible to avoid I make a plan in advance. I would try and think of an excuse like medication illness early start trying to lose weight...? Lots of possibilities. I believe in you and your ability to not relapse if you don't want to! Such a good job anyway keep it up    IWNDWYT!
Congratulations on all the progress! IWNDWYT
