First NYE Sober since I was 14... so about 18 years!.I did crave alcohol a few times but it was no issue at all I just distracted myself from it and I had fun! It was great waking up today and not having a hangover. It's actually been nice to hear about OTHER peoples brutal hangovers and feel so damn glad that isn't my life anymore..I feel great. I look better. I struggled to get here but I got here nonetheless..Don't give up sobriety is a process not an overnight thing.
