I regained my will to live and moved into a sober living house after I got out. I was attending 1-2 meetings per day minimum and got too confident. Eventually I decided to move out of this sober house full of great guys and great recovery and move on my own. Almost instantly I started using again. This was a couple weeks ago. What was I thinking? Everybody was skeptical about me moving out but I remained stubborn and in denial. Now I know better. I'm on day 4 again have yet to go to a meeting because I don't want anybody to see the state I'm in... I'm usually a real gym rat but eating one granola bar a day and 1000 calories worth of booze takes its toll. ..Man this was my 3rd treatment center. I was doing well. The little things started to get to me at the sober house - having to be out from 9 to 4 no girls allowed that little trivial stuff. Stupid things to get upset over. Living in that sober house was the first time I hadn't felt lonely in a very long time. ..But anyways I just wanted to say: Your words of support really helped me open up when I finally sobered up at the treatment center. I'm going to man up again and get over this. The same treatment center offers a free 2-week "refresher" in case of a relapse. Veterans Affairs is also offering to send me to a very "nice" 56 day program. I'm sick of leeching tax dollars even though everyone tells me I deserve the help. I feel like a leech. People could argue against this 3 rehabs ago but so many people have put so much effort into me. I have feelings of being unable to repay any debts even by simply being sober and being happy...Has anybody here fucked up and relapsed as many times as I have? Is there honestly hope or am I doomed into rehab after rehab until everyone gives up on me and I can just drink myself into oblivion?

I have been to the nut ward and more rehabs detoxes and outpatient programs than I can count. I would estimate around a dozen at least. If you're still above ground there is still hope...It sounds like you had a formula that was working. Any chance you can get back in the sober living house?..As far as not wanting to go back to meetings I understand. It was tougher for me every time I went back. This last time I decided that I really wasn't going to learn anything new by going back for another round of treatment. So after detox I swallowed my pride rented some couch space from the parents and threw myself into meetings with enough desperation that this time it stuck.
