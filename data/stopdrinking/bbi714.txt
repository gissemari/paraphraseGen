*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*...**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**...I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others..It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!.*****..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**....Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!.What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up..*****...**What this is:**...A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning..*****...**What this isn't:**...A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread..*****...    This post goes up at:.    US Night/Early Morning.    Europe Morning.    Asia and Australia Evening/Night...A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar..*****...Good morning sober friends! ...There are many ways (I think I hope) to get and stay sober. I have respect for everyones path to stay sober for today. What I do think we all have in common is that we need support. For me it was undoable to stay sober on my own. Tried many times always failed. I could quit (short or long times) but I could never maintain. ..Support can be found in different places or you can combine them all :) You can go to AA meetings get a sponsor talk to a doctor therapist psychiatrist psychologist counselor. You can do SMART recovery in some countries and/or other recovery programs which I may not know of. You can have supportive friends family partner. You can use this subreddit for support and/or it's IRC chat. You can go to rehab. Lots of options! Feel free to add what I forgot or don't know! ...My addiction made me very isolated in the end. I wasn't able to connect with people anymore I couldn't even connect with myself. I needed sincere human contact again needed to talk to people who where like me. Who didn't judge and understood my struggles. Opening myself up to support has helped me so much. In my case I have a wonderful therapist I read this sub every day or chat a bit on IRC my doctor helped me out a great deal in the beginning and I go to a meeting twice a week. (I'm not the best AA participant maybe I only share and listen to others -and help clean up the coffee cups- but I need and want to be in contact with fellow addicts. There is also no other program available where I live to meet fellow addicts except one group I go to twice a month so I take what I need and leave the rest as somebody over here said once). It doesn't matter (to me at least) how you fill in the support as long as you get it! For today I wish you all support! So we don't have to this alone (anymore) and you deserve support :). Have a good day today!! ...Cato and cats

IWNDWYT:  what a glorious pledge......gosh darn shoosh golly....there may just be life after alcohol...I could be a slimy pub crawling drunk but it won't be today.......almost giddy typing these silly words but unlike some of our dear friends we are still here to make this pledge.  Great strength and hope to those of us out there who might be struggling.  Hang in there fine friends!!!!!!

IWNDWYT.
Sober today looking forward to a sober night's sleep and a sober Wednesday!

*" My addiction made me very isolated in the end. I wasn't able to connect with people anymore I couldn't even connect with myself. I needed sincere human contact again needed to talk to people who where like me. "* I resonate with this so much. Meetings are allowing to connect to the world again. Thank you Cato &amp; cats...IWNDWYT
So tired at the minute but IWNDWYT
It's 2:00 a.m.  Wide awake - but sober.  Scared.  But I cannot waste the time I have left being drunk...I will not drink with you today.
Good morning friends. Up and at  em! As per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
I will not drink alcohol today.
I will not be drinking tonight with you for 2 reasons. The first is I don't want to and the second is that I have me first counselling sessions tonight...Day 3.

Good morning from the UK IWNDWYT. :-)
Instead of drinking I will work on this every day to avoid slips (Sobriety Losing Its Priority).   ..There's a learning festival going on in my city this week lots of free events talks workshops etc. so today I'm going to try out needle-felting.  ..IWNDWYT :)

 IWNDWYT
Today is going to be a little tough.  I have to go with my mother to put her dog to sleep.  He's 16 and has had a good life.  He sure was a mean little pain in the ass but he always protected my mother. I will miss him. ..My heart breaks for her but I will be there with her because I'm sober and I don't have to make an excuse of why I can't go. ..IWNDWYT  
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today. I go to a job interview.
IWNDWYT- I'm finding it tough but trying to hang on in there. Avoiding the cravings is the tough part  
I will not drink with you today!!
No booze today!

Good morning everyone. IWNDWYT

Thanks Cato for another beautiful post.  For me drinking was so isolating: hiding my drinking not letting anyone know how bad it had gotten  hiding my shame etc.  Such a sad way to live.  Learning to be vulnerable and ask for help can be so terrifying but I am taking baby steps!  IWNDWYT!
Will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today   
Count me in :)

No alcohol today
Long-ass workday today for a first time in almost a year. And I made plans to go out for dinner with a friend that I dont really like. Why? I dont know. Might be using her for social needs or trying to work on my own social insecurities. But I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.

I will not drink today.
Not Today.
Morning y'all. No cravings but trying to ride out this wave of ennui :/ Hope y'all are treating yourselves right IWNDWYT
Thanks Cato. My therapist and this group are my support too. I haven't tried a group like AA yet (mainly for lack of time). I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
Day 6. IWNDWYT
Heading to a meeting in a few minutes then to work then to yoga this evening. Had therapy and my weekly meeting with my sponsor yesterday (along with work). Learning and working on a lot of new things change is good. At least I keep trying to convince myself that it is! ..I will not drink with you today!
Staying sober today.
I will not drink today.
Way too early to be here but I'm awake anyway so what the heck. IWNDWYT.
I too was self-isolating the last few years of my drinking. I worked but once done I was done. So happy to be out and about interacting with my family and the rest of the world...No drinking here!
IWNDWYT ... day 8 is great'
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
Good morning from the Midwest!! IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT!!
/u/silvercato thank you for your post and for hosting...There was a time in my drinking history that I couldn't imagine stepping out of my routine to socialize. It was off work stop at the crappy liquor store (not enough time to go to the good one) head straight to the porch when I got home for cigarettes and craft beer and shooters until after bedtime followed by middle of the night insomnia and sweating and panic feelings and regret (plus feeling my organs hurt but ignoring it)...No thank you! Today I walk a different path. I've been sick and my baby has too. It was a rough night. But I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today reset my badge again and I'm frustrated. Is there anyone I can talk to?
Not drinking today.
Iwndwyt
I will stay free from alcohol today.
Happily I will not be drinking again today  
Happy Wednesday everyone. It's morning here in Canada and it's finally getting a little nicer outside day by day. Today is kind of dreary but at least it's not freezing! I'm going to move through today one moment at a time and appreciate the day for all the good and bad that may come. One thing I know for sure is I won't be drinking.
Glorious sober morning orning soberniks!  Vigilance IS the key to success!  Solidarity you bunch of nerf smurfers! IWNDWYT

Good morning all!  No drinks for me today that's for sure  
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT. Have a great day everyone.
Nope not today..IWNDWYT
We have yet another blizzard headed our way. Yes in April. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Afternoon SD. 100th day today (after countless attempts and badge resets over the last 2-3 years). Gotten so much out of reading this sub so thank you. Hope everyone has a great day - IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today  
This is my day 1. I will not drink with you today.
I haven't been on SD in a long time but I'm still not drinking and I will not drink today. I think I need to put in some more time to my recovery as I've checked out of checking in here and I rarely make it to my agnostic AA meeting. I can hear my brain saying "you can totally drink normally nowadays" but I'm not buying it.
Day 100 yay! IWNDWYT
Halfway through another week. Sleepy this morning and needing some more caffeine but IWNDWYT. I may nap though. :)
I finally got a job offer this morning! I'll celebrate with movies and tea - IWNDWYT!
I've been thinking about my drinking today and I think that my binge drinking was in part because I wanted to enjoy things without the socially anxious me bringing all her problems along - I drank to be a different person because I believed that the happiness and inhibition I felt when drunk was only attainable through drinking. This is a common reason for drinking but I've never really seen it as one of the causes for my own as I usually drank alone at home...IWNDWYT!
Good morning! Good stuff as always this week! The isolation is real. I forgot how to really live and express stuff without alcohol towards the end and looking back that was just miserable. Even worse than it felt at the time. Here's to another day of sobriety. ..IWNDWYT! :)
Day 2 for me.  Had 2 urges yesterday  got through them.  IWNDWYT
I will remain sober with you today - Wednesday April 10 2019. Have a wonderful day Cato.
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT. Day 4 of attempt number (mumblemumble)
I'm a bit anxious this morning. I am almost at the end of my bachelor's degree in accounting so I need to start gearing up for the job search. My university is sponsoring a hiring fair today and I am registered to attend. I have been doing online classes for the entirety of this degree program which was really convenient and worked well for me but now the trouble is that I'm not used to interacting with live humans much anymore. I'm really introverted and have a touch of social anxiety so an event like this is quite intimidating. It's tempting to take the edge off of that discomfort by having a drink first or promising myself a drink once I get through the event but I don't want to sabotage myself. Instead I'll go for a run this morning and come back here to post again if I get panicky during the hiring fair. IWNDWYT
70 days sober today! Stoked to take another 24 with you all.
I will not drink today.
 IWNDWYT  MOVING TOWARDS WEEK 3
Day 2 steeling myself for a rough week and IWNDWYT.
Nice to have hit a point in the days-count where frankly I don't know how many days I'm at until I post and see the badge... IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.

Happy hump day!!     IWNDWYT!!

Today is day one. I WILL NOT DRINK.
Happy Wednesday. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
If there is a day I give up on my 100 day goal it will not be today. 3%
Today I am super anxious for no proportionate reason and absolutely blowing things out of proportion in my head. But still I will not drink with you today despite what my monkey brain whispers.
Thanks for the check-in SilverCato. I agree -- genuine human connection where you're not judged for what you've done is an amazing thing and that's what I need(ed). I felt like I couldn't be honest with people about the shit that I've done -- drunk driving sleeping around explosive arguments just being a hot mess in general. ..I love this community and the fellowship I found in AA because they get it. ..Anyway today I will have double-digits again 10 days. I will not drink today. Next goal is 2 weeks.
I will not drink today!
Day 1 of joining this support group.  Tired of telling myself today will be the last day I drink a bottle of wine or buying wine drinking some and tossing the rest because I feel guilty only to turn around the next day and buy more.  TODAY is will not drink!
iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT need to stop and clean up myself.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!!!
I'm new to this sub but I've been trying on and off these past few months. Thank you for these daily checkins so that I can remind myself that I promised I wouldn't drink today. IWNDWYT
I pledge to not drink today.
IWNDWYT....Peace all
IWNDWYT!..Honestly I struggle with letting people support me. It's an ego thing I don't need somebody to encourage me or tell me they're proud. A number of things in my life have lead me to prefer dealing with things by myself at my own pace. ..I realize it's a little ridiculous it likely slows any sort of progress (drinking or otherwise)...Which is why I'm here. This kind of support I can handle. I appreciate just knowing others are in the same position and it's not impossible to change. Thank you for sharing.
Good morning from California!  IWNDWYT    Gigi
I will not drink today!
Good morning SD!..Victory last night at dinner and a play with wine and margaritas all around.  Didn't give that poison a second thought!  BOOM!..IWNDWYT!
IWND  WYT.
New here and first time reading a post like this. I needed this. Thank you stranger! IWNDWYT (:
Had a work function last night hosted by my union that was at a bar in which we were encouraged to drink. I can't believe a union would encourage its members to drink. Anyway I had a club soda and sat in a corner until it was over and was the first one to ghost while everyone stayed and got shitfaced. On a Tuesday night. ..I will not drink with you today.
Staying sober today! There's work to do!
I will not drink with you today.
I won't drink today!
Great post! I can relate to the isolation - my world got really small (as they say) towards the end of my drinking. IWNDWYT
First time posting here. I'll just go home after work and not stop at the bar.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today or tonight because our sobriety is too important.
I will not drink today!
Not today friends!  
Hey you guys! Thanks for being my main support. I'm not drinking with you all today!
&gt;I wasn't able to connect with people anymore..Never have been good at connecting Alcohol once something that I used to get over anxiety in social situations made connecting with people impossible. I am just now starting to reconnect get out. Thank you for the post! .IWNDWYT SD!
I'm not going to drink today. I want to write "I am never going to drink again!" but I need to just focus on today. Glad you guys are out there. When the urge/routine starts gripping my brain this evening I am going to remember that you guys are out there and we're all doing this together.
My badge was completely out of date so I've messaged to reset it will be two weeks without a drink on Saturday...I have been finding it alot eaiser just not talking about it and not telling anyone of my plans I was offered a vodka the other day and I simply said "no thanks" and that was the end of that...If I start telling everyone that I've quit drinking then it becomes more pressure for myself and I'm more likely to fail...Of course I will start to mention it later in the future when I trust myself...I only drank once a week but I have better things to do with my time and now it's about fighting that sesh feeling and getting my priorities straight.
IWNDWYT!
I needed this today. Not because I want to drink - this is day 16 and I really honestly don't  - but because I needed the reminder to be grateful and patient and keep my eye on the ball. ..Even without drinking some mornings are blah. It will just make the awesome ones so much more so. IWNDWYT.
Hi all!! I'm a bit late checking in today but here I am all good....and I Will Not Drink With You Today  
I will not drink with you today.
I will not be drinking today.  I have been slacking off on the check-ins lately and feel like I need to reconfirm my desire not to drink.  Somewhere around day 42 for me.
IWNDWYT!  
Sober today with all of you.
Good morning! I'm happy to commit to a good sober day - I will not drink with you today!
Checking in every day here has been a wonderful addition to my day and helps me to be mindful of my decision to stay sober. Today I am traveling south to visit my parents the first trip I will be making as someone who does not drink alcohol. I'm a bit nervous but I think it will be OK and I know they always have some la Croix lying around. IWNDWYT!
I won't drink today. I feel miserable though.
Hey--..This post is just when I needed to read. I realized the only way for me to be sober is to have a group. I've committed to myself to check in here daily in the mornings as I have found it sets a great tone for the rest of the day. I really want to do AA but also feel very conflicted because I would go all the time with my mom as a kid. So I'm starting where I can here and trying to find a therapist in earnest. ..Can I ask what is the other group you attend? Trying to find others can be so tricky! ..Thank you for this I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today!
Sleeping like crap. I will not drink today!
Won't drink today sick of waking up hungover
I will not drink today!
Day 192 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
I got really close to having a drink yesterday and breaking my longest streak in years but I didn't. Today I'll spend more time here. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
not drinking today
IWNDWYT!
No drinking for me today no matter what.
I'm not drinking today! It's my late shift day so no temptation :)
Ran my tushy off yesterday after work after I got slammed with a lot of yucky feelings late in the day and followed it up with yoga and a very healthy dinner with some dark chocolate. Stopped by a place to pick up a jug of kombucha on the way home and the friendly cashier made a joke about it being whiskey. I just laughed with him. It's not whiskey and I'm feeling my brain heal every day. Started This Naked Mind and am tackling it in one chapter every night. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT
Good morning world! 5 weeks!..IWNDWYT!
My middle kiddo turns 5 today! We had a birthday party for him at the skating rink last night. I'm 32 days off the sauce. ..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT! :)
Good morning.  IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
.
Needed to read this today. Thank you for your reflections!..At first I considered just telling my friends avoiding places they serve alcohol and committing to working out instead of drinking was all I needed. Yesterday I brought up my commitment to a friend who I typically drink with and they admitted they were considering going on the wagon as well and we got to discuss reasons and ways it impacted us...My boyfriend is interested in sobriety too but only as a way of support. As he put it drinking isn't a great passion of his and I've envied how he can have a glass of wine with dinner on the rare occasion and then be done for the night. ..While I'm grateful for his support I was incredibly excited to talk to my close friend who shared my experiences surrounding alcohol. It also reinforced how differently my brain processes alcohol compared to my boyfriend - addiction! - and why it's so important to listen to my body rather than try to compare myself...Yay community and IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you all today! 1st 10 complete on to the next 10!
IWNDWYT    
IWNDWYT
Good morning beautiful people! It is a lovely day (wasted in the office lol) and it is good to feel better than I am used to. I haven't been drinking much the last few months but as of Sunday I have decided to just stop. I can't wait to see how much better I can feel and look! IWNDWYT
Good morning day 4. Hope to check in successfully tonight. IWNDWYT
Wednesdays are a weakness for me (lighter work day on Thursdays leading me to several years of giving myself "permission" to drink more on Wed...). Made it through last Wed without a sip. Gonna make it through today also. ..IWNDWYT..Thanks so much for being here for me.
Hi everyone good morning. I'm not drinking today.
Day 13 today. Snowstorm rolling in tonight. Going to try and get a haircut and a run in  before that happens but not sure if I will accomplish both. Planning on holing up tonight and drinking tea and reading.
I was REALLY craving last night. But I stayed strong with the help of supportive family. No regrets feeling good. Day 10!!! IWNDWYT
99 problems but drinking ain't one! Iwndwy
Checking in from the mountains of western North Carolina I will not drink with you today!
Hi SD.  Thanks for all the support so far reading your stories is helpful every day. Been craving more than usual lately but i have stuff to do so i cant drink.  IWNDWYT
Off to bed then a busy day of mentor meeting meeting and maybe dinner out with friends. I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT :)..I have also isolated myself a lot or alcohol has isolated me I'm not sure.  I'm still getting up the nerve to go to AA but connecting here and being open with my friends has helped a lot so far.  I know people are rooting for me and I'm not in it alone
OK then I'm in :-)
Good morning all!!  IWNDWYT!!  Hope everyone has an amazing Wednesday!
Another busy day but IWNDWYT
Have a great Wednesday.  It's coming together for me.  I won't drink with you today.

Still feeling low and fatigued. It's getting old! But my sobriety has helped me dig myself out of a deep depression. IWNDWYT
I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.
Too much to lose at this point. I'm not drinking today
Checking in. Doing a bit worse than usual at the moment. But sober worse than usual is way better than drunk/hungover better than usual. I'll take it!!
Hi new to this subreddit and reddit in general. I'm on day 556 with no alcohol. ..I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
Day #9# Starting off great. Got up early enough to bring the office donuts and still was one of the first ones in on my team. Have a great drinkless day with me!
Day 3! IWNDWYT..Trying so hard to fill my time with other things! Much more productive lately
Day 4 for me.  IWNDWYT
Iwndwyt my peeps
It is day 0 for me. Was sober for about 6 months. Started drinking again 8 months ago and it has been getting more and more severe. I know I can't regulate and push to extremes. Now I want to get sober again and ramp up my spiritual practice while I look for a job. Being with out a place to get up for in the mornings definitely makes it harder to not have that 5th drink. I am getting older and starting to think about the real health implications of drinking 5+ drinks most days of the week but haven't been able to pull back on my own. Excited to be here with you all! Thank you for holding this space. This time I want my sobriety to be fun and joyous before it felt like I was just missing something and was a more "boring" person. Any tips tips on that?
I will not drink with you today
IWNDWYT
Seeing drinks in hot weather seems to be the only thing that's tempted me in months. Still. All it takes is to drink some water. Feeling good..just jogged for probably the longest amount of time in my life lol. Iwndwyt
Not drinking today
IWNDWYT.
Today has not been easy but I will not drink because that's not an option for me. It would ruin me. IWNDWYT
Checking in. Hanging in. Love and strength to you today.
Good afternoon. I will not be drinking today. Cheers!
It's good to see that number keep rising. IWNDWYT
Not today.
I'm in the double digits! Happy Day Ten for me and I hope all of you have a successful day &lt;3 ..I will not drink with you today.
Checking in for today. Last night I met a friend at a bar and savored my club sodas - they were actually pretty refreshing. Some good food and worthwhile conversation...Just for today I will not drink with you
This is day 54!!! I cannot believe it! I am so grateful for every single one of those days. IWNDWYT!
There's a hell of a snow storm raging here in Minnesota and all of my social activities have been cancelled no use trying drive anywhere but home... However there is  the one liquor store on the way to my house and all I want to do right now is grab a bottle so I can curl up with a glass of wine while I cook dinner and look out the window at the snow. BUT I won't do that because I know one glass will end up being five and I'll be miserable and hungover while shoveling tomorrow morning. IWNDWYT!
**Eight Nine Nine** feels fine *fine* FINE!
IWNDWYT
I fell of the sobriety train after a good week of sobriety. I know it's a story everyone on here's heard a hundred time but I told myself "fuck it you can drink in moderation!" and honestly was doing pretty well with just enjoying a beer a couple nights a week. But then last night I said to myself "fuck it you should restock and get some liquor and bitters and citrus fruits so you can make yourself some cocktails" even though I'd sworn of hard liquor even before my attempts to get sober...3 Belgians at 10%...then a couple of gin and tonics...then a couple 10% stouts to end the night. Yikes woke up feeling like death sick to my stomach and full of shame. Barely made it through classes without running to the bathroom to vomit. Not to mention I have bruises on my elbows and hips from falling down multiple times on the tile floor of my dorm room. I'm 100 bucks poorer and covered in bruises. ..I stopped taking things one day at a time stopped doing daily check-ins. I thought I could just do sobriety absentmindedly but I can't. So here's to day one again and I will not drink with you folks today.
I will not fucking drink today!!!!
Still going strong

IWNDWYT friends!
I have an interview I'm nervous about tomorrow but I will run out my feelings instead of drinking.
Guys... I don't know how I'm going to get through Game of Thrones on Sunday without a glass of wine. This show is gonna be a massive trigger for me.
Day 2 of full sobriety for me I will not drink with all of you too!
I will not drink today.
Day 1 will be my first 24 hours without a drink in as long as I can remember in about an hour.  Have been tapering for the past 5 days.  Went about 12-14/day for years to 6 8 453 drinks the past 5 days (haha day 2 you almost beat me).  Hopefully that was enough taper to minimize withdrawal.  Slept about 3 hours last night but today was easy.  From what I've read the next 2 days will be the hardest.  Wish me luck.
