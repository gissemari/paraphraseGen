Just realized I'm less than a week from 60 days. If you would have told me 6 months ago I would be capable of this I'd scoff and laugh. I watched this sub for over a year while I relapsed over and over. Pretty much every day up until #45 was unpredictable and crazy but it seems even keel and smooth sailing from here out. ..Keep with it. Don't give up no matter how many times it takes. Winners never quit and quitters never win. ..IWNDWYT

Not sure why your app differed but hey keep up the good work friend!! IWNDWYT 
The Reddit counter sometimes takes a break but it catches up eventually. Well done on however many days - the numbers keep going up and I am finding it much much easier than even a few weeks ago.
Two months is a great achievement.
