[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** Being sober has given me a better sense of humor. I got into an argument with a non-native speaker and he said something disgusting and sexual to me that was supposed to upset me but he got the slang wrong. My first impulse as a TOEFL teacher was to help him get the insult right which made me want to laugh. ( No with that idiom English speakers wouldn't use the verb  lick;' they would use the verb  suck.' )..**Struggle:** Con artists posing as IRS agents have been calling my elderly mother's phone and threatening her with arrest. It upsets me because if they call someone else who is old and doesn't have a loved one to reassure them it is only a scam this kind of call could really frighten them. ..I really hate mean people...**General:** It's almost July! July trivia: Did you know three of the first five presidents died on the 4th of July? They were John Adams Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe. And Adams and Jefferson died on the same day -- July 4 1826 which was the 50th birthday of this country..

It's nit quite Wednesday here yet but I wanted to be the first to comment!!  I will not drink with you today (which technically starts in 1 hr and 45 mins   )
That is a really sh*tty thing for people to do to the elderly. What's wrong with people?! Grr! I'm glad you're there for your mom. I love the 4th of July trivia too. :D..**Triumph:**  I'm having a great creative time up in the woods for a couple of days reading making ice cream cross-stitching painting by number and gardening. I've got one more day here before the next few weeks turn stressful so I'm really packing in the zen! ..**Struggle:** I'm peri-menopausal so am starting to feel the symptoms of mood swings and hot flashes. Work is stressful already and I don't like how these mood swings are making me feel about my business. I just got new (awesome) health insurance so I'm gonna start seeing a therapist that specializes in womenz...**General:** I'm relaying enjoying Anne LaMott's "Small Victories". I'm not that far into it but already know it's a great recommendation for /SD. It's a collection of essays in which she talks of her sobriety forgiveness joy grace etc. Really loving it. 
Happy Wednesday! Even if it's only Wednesday by a few minutes...Triumph: I'm killing a big project at work despite being a bit scatterbrained this week. In addition I've made it over a week without getting high or drunk and I didn't let the anxiety/nerves cause me to overreact to something small and kill my husband. ..Struggle: I'm super anxious. My poor husband has dealt with a lot of emotional outbursts. On top of just starting my sobriety my father was recently diagnosed with cancer and had an appointment today to prep for his radiation and chemo treatments. That made this all very real to me. ..General: Tip from an HR professional: When writing a cover letter come up with an interesting first sentence/paragraph. After the hiring manager reads "With (fill in the blank) experience and skills I would make an ideal candidate for your... vacancy" a billion times your version of it won't stand out.
Triumph: I finally saw the scale budge for the first time since mid January.  Hopefully it keeps moving!  I hit 100 days cigarette-free today!..Struggle:  I've not been feeling well for a few months now and the doctor hasn't been able to figure it out so I have to see my neurologist again.  MRI was fine so we were able to at least rule out MS tumors or stroke.  Parkinson's runs in my family and is still on the table though...General: I have 4 invitations for BBQs and celebrations for the 4th of July.  And the best part is that none of them will be focused on getting trashed.  In fact I don't think alcohol will even be present at any of them.  I'm feeling lucky that I am able to comfortably chose any of them and know my sobriety won't be threatened!
Well trying to break out of my comfort zone and what better day than a Wednesday?..Triumph(s): I can now say that I have a year of sober days under my belt. A year ago I was sent back to prison from a work release program for being drunk and in the process really let down and betrayed my employer who as of yesterday has given me another chance and is super supportive of my recovery. ..Struggle: Finding it hard to adjust to post prison life and struggling to meet people without falling back into old people places and things. ..General: Reading This Naked Mind and finding it pretty fascinating so far. Can't wait to finish it. 
Triumph: almost 6 months sober (2 weeks left~). Really getting into powerlifting more motivated than ever to hit the gym. Im in better shape than ever PBs on all lifts...Struggle: Just went from working 50% to fucking 150. Today'll be 8-7 l dont have time to hit the gym sleep and make food just stressed out. I feel like shit. 
*Triumph: I've been hired for a job I never thought I'd get with a team thats fantastic!.*Struggle: I need to maintain myself I'd usually drink to celebrate.*General: I'm feeling good for the first time in 66 days
Triumph:     Tomorrow I'll hit 500 days ;)...Struggle:     I can't believe I'm gonna say this but I've got nothin' this week!..General:     We're leaving for my first little getaway at a lakeside resort in upstate NY tomorrow (K's gift to me for 500) where we will enjoy the pool lake boating picnics morning coffee on our deck quality time with K's grown children and SO's and theme dinner nights. I haven't even thought about alcohol! Why would I want to?! Damn. Sober life? Priceless!!!!
Triumph: not really my triumph but it makes me feel triumphant that my 13-month old daughter has learned to walk. She can now make her way from room to room with short faltering steps. She kinda resembles a drunken elf...Struggle: it's nearly time to start practicums and I've got approval at two different sites but the busy season at my full-time factory job has begun. My plan depends on doing practicum hours on my days off and I'm feeling some fear that there'll be a conflict with all the OT. ..General: we are having a new house built and it's nearing completion. Carpet was just laid. Due to close in August. Going to rent out the house we live in now...None of this stuff would be happening if I were still drinking!
**Triumph:**  Starting this morning with a positive mood and a feeling of optimism after a slip from almost 4 days off the grog last night.  Yes I'm counting it as a triumph because I really do get it now...I can't have just one glass of wine.  I want the bottle.  But I'm not going to beat myself up.  I took a selfie asked for a SD badge and stopped lurking here.  I'm looking toward a bright future and I know I can do this because I want it...**Struggle:** The mind games that are already starting.  I know to ignore the part of my brain that wants a drink but it's exhausting  listening to it whine...**General:** I'm taking some time off work and  although I have to spend some of that time working on the house I'm going to spend most of the next two months working on myself doing yoga getting in shape and taking up some new pursuits...I'm happy to say I won't drink with you today! 
*Triumph*: Two seeks feels incredible. I can feel my cheekbones and I'm sleeping on a restful 10pm-6am schedule...*Struggle*: The Bar Exam is an absolute beast. It's not for another month but it's designed to wear you down. I'm averaging about 66% on multiple choice answers which feels terrible because I'm missing so many but it's actually a passing score thanks to the curve. Just gotta keep my eyes on the prize...*General*: Shaking up my fitness routine which is always interesting. 
Triumph: The smile in my star matches the one on my face :) ..Struggle: I decided today was the day to drop the cigs enough putting it off and 'just one more day-ing' it. I still have a vape so it's not even that I'm quitting nicotine altogether yet. But I keep reaching for that pack and it's not there...General: Wow that's some great trivia! I really hate the phone scammers too. I'm surprised when my phone rings if it's someone who I actually want to talk to because I get so many calls from these scammy jerks.
Beautiful day and looking forward to my new life. 
**Triumph:** Weight loss is going great and I'm so much more positive than I was before. It's a good feeling. ..**Struggle:** Things are very very tight for me financially. Not drinking helps but my next credit card payment is going to drain my bank. Hooray.... I'm also new to dating apps and not getting a lot of matches. I feel like that's common for guys but it's still a bit frustrating...**General:** [I got a tattoo!] (http://imgur.com/a/Dlxuf)
Happy Wednesday! ..Triumph: I hit one of my fitness goals this week. It seems being sober helps me with my goals imagine that!..Struggle: spending all summer with my special needs son is super stressful. That was one of the major reasons I started drinking and I'm trying to find other ways to relax other than 6 glasses of wine a night. ..General: I'm rediscovering who I am. Who I am underneath the drunk mom I've been. I remember how much I love to read create and write. I love being sober even though sometimes I feel strange without a drink in my hand. ..Not drinking with you all today!
Happy Wednesday!!!! ..Struggle: Still thinking long-term I.e. "never have another drink again"/"not even a glass of champagne at your own wedding?"/"not even a sample of wine when you're in Napa?" Etc. I know this is thinking waaaaay too far ahead and that I need to just take it one day at a time. ..Triumph: got to bed early last night and my SO and I went for a run this morning before work! Never would have been able to do that if I'd been hungover :) ..General: overall feeling better about sobriety this time around. Have been taking better care of myself and journaling extensively to track my moods and thoughts. Also want to hit up a SMART recovery meeting soon too. .
I'll give this a try.....**Triumph:**  I'm on my 10th day today (woooohooo!) and my energy is through the roof!  I've been extremely productive on projects around my house and volunteered yesterday and today after work to help a friend install a 4 board plank fence.  The manual labor is therapeutic to me (most of my time is in an office) and I've got the energy so let's do it!  I've literally ran from 5:30 am to 10 pm all week only to shower crash rinse and repeat.  I love it!..**Struggle:**  I've felt like for a while that I should be doing something else somewhere else career wise.  Damn if I know what it is or where it is.  I just feel like a change is long over due.  It's scary but I guess I know that I will at least be going through this important time without a mind clouded by alcohol or its effects.  I just pray I'm able to see what the right path is for me.  Who knows maybe with my mind clear now I'll realize that I'm right where I need to be.  Time will tell.  ..**General:**  I've been reading This Naked Mind and I really think it's making a difference.  I'm also investing a lot more in myself than I have in the past focusing on physical mental and spiritual well being.
Triumph:  I went to the doctor this morning and I've lost 10 lbs since quitting drinking. Which is incredible considering the amount of crap I shoveled into my mouth the first month or so. ..Struggle: Sleep. I struggle to fall asleep and to stay asleep and it's really getting old. ..General: A friend posted this on FB the other day and it made me giggle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kK0bq_g3M
**Triumph** a couple in this column! ..I'm closing in on my first week sober! I feel better I think I look better and everyday is getting easier...*AND* my HusBro has decided he wants to make some changes with his drinking as well! I don't have him 100% onboard yet but it's a step in the right direction!..**Struggle** I'm moving back to the United States in a few weeks I'm really going to miss where I live now. This also means a couple of weeks with old friends and family...I know "having a drink like old times" is going to be a theme...**General** It's a holiday weekend so I'm really looking forward to quality time with friends and the HusBro celebrating sober...I loved reading everyone's check ins thank you all for sharing SD!!! I won't drink with you today!
Triumph: I've gone three weeks and have not really been craving alcohol. I'm feeling more clear headed and optimistic..Struggle: Still struggling with overeating especially at night kind of justifying it by the fact that since I'm quitting drinking right now I should just focus on one thing at a time but all the late night icecream etc. is making me feel pretty crappy and keeping me awake..General: Just got a fresh haircut making nice plans for my 32nd birthday coming up soon and working on a new entrepreneurial project with a friend. 
Triumph: Work is going really well. I have super happy clients and I keep getting a lot of praise from the higher ups. This project was one of my many big motivators to quit drinking so I'm glad that my efforts are paying off...Struggle: My "little" brother (22 but 12 years younger than me) was arrested this week for supposedly beating up his pregnant girlfriend while on an alcohol and coke fueled binge. It's all he-said-she-said at this point so I don't know what to believe or how to react. He also violated his probation that was set to be up in 2 months which will be an additional charge.  He's going to be spending at least 3 weeks in jail and potentially could be facing up to 3 years. ..General: I need to remember that my family's problems are not my responsibility. I will try to help them within reason but I need to live my life and maintain a stable environment for my children.
Triumph: my hips weren't sore this morning so I enjoyed my run more than I have been enjoying them these past few weeks...Struggle: I really want to waste a large sum of money on a new watch. But it's a dumb purchase because I haven't fully funded my IRA or 401(k) for the year and because I haven't regularly worn a watch since 1997 so who even knows if it won't be a huge annoyance/distraction to have something strapped to my wrist. ..General: sobriety has made me care much less about sports than I used to. It's weird to not spend a lot of time reading up on my favorite teams and leagues so I'll have ammunition to win arguments against my friends. This new state of zen is taking some getting used to but I like it. I like it a lot. 
Triumph: I'm going to hit 90 this week I am consistently exercising for the first time in a long time...Struggle: my mom is coming to town today and for the past 10 years we've only drank together so I am at a loss for how I'll kill time with her. Also a funeral this weekend for her best friend. Need strength to get me through.
**Triumph &amp; Struggle:** Things are good. Busy but good. Juggling everything can be stressful but if that's my only issue right now... pretty nice Triumph...**July:** Where the hell did June go?
**Triumph:** The last two weeks have been a test in establishing boundaries and asserting myself. I feel like I've passed with flying colors. No lingering resentments no cruelty no demands--just simple and compassionate communication. It absolutely leveled up one of my friendships (which I'm so grateful for!) and put me in a better headspace to deal with another friend who was crossing boundaries all over the place (and feel at peace with whatever happens next). ..None of this would be possible without the support of my sponsor and the clarity of sobriety. ..**Struggle:** My doctor put me on anti-depressants and I'm still adjusting. My sleep schedule isn't quite right yet and it's frustrating. I'm trying to be kind to myself about it. ..**General:** My new couch slipcover arrives today and I am so excited! I hope it's as cute as it looked online! Eep! 
**Triumph:** I've got into the habit of playing my trombone every day which is helping me improve my standard and confidence...**Struggle:** Shitty weather is making bike rides less appealing.....**General:** July is typically the busiest month of the year work-wise for me. Hopefully this year doesn't disappoint!
T:  Lots of drinking dreams lately.   How is this a triumph?  Because when I wake up it takes me a few minutes to realize that it was a dream and I've been sober for over 500 days! !!..S:  Car troubles been going on for a week now.  Car is in the shop and they don't know what's wrong with it. ..G:  I'd always get so wasted on the day before the 4th that I'd be ridiculously hung over.  Last year was nice I went and picked berries.   That was it.  It was fine.
Triumph: I ran my marathon in 4:04. 16 minutes faster than last year when I was drinking heavily. My body feels much lighter faster and I had no injuries. I was pretty proud of myself for finishing..Struggle: I had an anxiety attack at mile 21 which really slowed me down. I could have sub 4'd (My "A" goal) but at least I finished. I learned though that my physical body can do a lot of healing in 6 months but my mental health has been taking a lot longer. Sobriety has not been easy for me I'm more angry depressed sad.... I have to remember healing the cognitive side is not as quantifiable as how fast I can run a mile. I'm still figuring out what it needs to heal. .General: Canada day is right around the corner and it's my favorite holiday! 
Triumph:  Enjoying the energy and clarity that comes  with staying alcohol free. ..Struggle: Been a little too glued to this site and blowing off some things I should be getting done -- things that wouldn't be getting done anyway if I was drinking or hungover.  . .General:  Wednesday is date night with my husband. We go to the same restaurant every week. Glad they serve Pellegrino.  I can tell our waiter is curious why I'm not taking advantage of Wine Wednesday these last few weeks. Maybe I should tell him I'm pregnant (at 54!).  
Triumph: I have a crazy amount of energy. I'm realizing my fatigue and low endurance may have been attributed to alcohol more that I'd previously thought. Workouts are so much more energized and fun...Struggle: I have anxiety about failing and also my stressful judgmental in-laws are coming into town and they trigger me...General: my husband and I painted our 100 year-old porch yesterday and it looks great....Not drinking with y'all today!
Triumph: I got laser hair removal on my armpits today. I hate shaving and I don't feel guilty about splurging since I don't spend money on booze.   .Struggle: Not feeling confident at work..General: "The Keepers" documentary series on Netflix is addicting.
Triumph: I went out tonight for a friend's moving away party and was so anxious about it beforehand because I knew everyone was going to be drinking. I HAD SO MUCH FUN! It mattered none that I didn't drink and I was just as sharp and charming as could be. I used to think I was so awkward but I really think that was the effect of alcohol on my self esteem. I even went for a run afterwards:) I feel great...Struggle: I have been dwelling on a few instances from when I was drunk where I put myself in really precarious positions sexually and getting emotional/self-blamey about it. Just so much self-reflection at once sometimes it's hard to process everything...General: I'm happy to be doing this although I look forward to when it's not all I think about. Also I love this community...50 days!!
I won't be drinking today.
Triumph: more than a month without drinking alcohol i've started to actually FEEL emotions and feel more present...Struggle: not sure what i'm doing career-wise..General: watched a really great doco called finders and keepers on netflix it was really funny and moving and sad...I will not drink with you today :)
