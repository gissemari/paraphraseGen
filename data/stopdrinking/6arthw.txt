Well here it goes. I made myself a throwaway just for this. I have been reading this sub for months now and it's finally time to hold myself accountable and post here....I'm a nurse and a mom and apparently I'm becoming an alcoholic. I started drinking when I was working night shifts because I couldn't sleep. And then it just became a habit....I have elevated liver enzymes and I'm terrified for my health. I'm also terrified I'm going to end up having to go to the hospital and see people I know- being a nurse who has worked a lot of places it seems I know everyone in all the local hospitals....My kids don't deserve a mom who is drunk. They also don't deserve a mom who dies of liver failure at a young age....I have greatly reduced my consumption over the last few weeks but I haven't been able to fully quit. So here is to my official day one!...I don't want this to be my life anymore. I feel better when I'm sober....Thanks to everyone who posts here and helps support those of us who are struggling. I'll be seeing you around! :).

You can do it!  I'm in healthcare too and I understand the shame surrounding a drinking problem. Therapy really helped me quit in the past (for about a year I was also taking baclofen) and helped me understand my drinking.   ..I have a good doc and she gave me some baclofen and I have also taken vistaril for the cravings the last 2 weeks.  It's helped a ton and I feel that I don't have to use them daily anymore.  I know meds aren't for everyone but don't be ashamed to talk to your MD.  Mine has been AWESOME.  She has known I've struggled with use/abuse of multiple substances for years and she's non-judgemental and supportive...I'm wishing you the best.  Hugs to you and I will not drink with you today.
