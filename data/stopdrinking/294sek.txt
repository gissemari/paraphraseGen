The initial pink cloud from being sober has dwindled a little bit I still feel great but I'm trying to find the next phase I think I just need to turn the TV off and read my big book I don't want this to be just another feel good notion followed by a relapse it's hard when work gets in the way sometimes I get sick of the subject of alcoholism but I need to keep going am I just being a little wingey?

I'm just putting this comment here for badge purposes
Perhaps I could use a sponsor?
Oh snap! AA have a big book Google play app actually they have loads of apps! Ok good less reading more listening I can get behind that
I don't know what wingey means :(..Talking about recovery all day every day is tiring and can really dilute what the purpose of the text and meetings and fellowship offer. ..Don't ride a pink cloud it's Icarus' wings for sober people. Start working NOW (well maybe in the morning). Read meet with your sponsor and practice these principles daily. You got it I can see it :)
I mean is pretty basic software (in typical AA fashion) but it serves it's purpose!
