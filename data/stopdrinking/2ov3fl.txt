Not sure if it has been mentioned on this sub before but this film should be watched by every person here struggling for sobriety.  From start to finish I think we can all relate to this man's journey.

It's listed in the Video archive SMG but thanks for the reminder.  I'm glad it had an impact on you.
Watching the main character kick in his own front yard was gut-wrenching. I could absolutely relate to him. A pretty surprising performance from Will Farrell.
I need something like this tonight. Renting now. Thanks for the idea.
