I'm really having difficulty balancing anxiety depression and not drinking. I can do a day or two but I've just started a new job haven't told them the situation and I'm already worried I'll fuck it up. Which led me to leave an hour early and go buy some 7.5% cider...Taking it day by day is all well and good but I don't know how to keep going...This isn't meant to trigger anyone quite the opposite. Just trying to go steady.

Whats the longest you have went?  There are certain periods that are easier to reach than others.  I know in my experience getting to that damn 72 hour mark was rough.
The first three days first week and first month were really hard for me. The things that helped: running therapy and writing in my journal every night. Also telling as many friends as I felt comfortable telling in order to keep myself accountable. You can do this - best of luck. The benefits of sobriety will be worth the difficulty of the first few days.
Thank you everyone. The longest I've managed was two and a half months. That was years ago. It's gotten worse over time and now it's just my crutch. Happy sad (mostly sad admittedly). Always an excuse. ..I'm starting therapy next week but it's a fucker. I went to some alcohol support groups but it wasn't helpful. I think I need to stop completely. Go tee total. ..That's a scary thought though. Sounds silly but I don't know life without alcohol.
On day three.
