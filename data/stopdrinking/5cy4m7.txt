Hi friends..I am new to Reddit so apologies in advance for any bad formatting et cetera...My motivation for joining (I know I know) is to find a support group. The two sentence spiel is that about one year ago I went through an incredible depressive suicidal phase decided to get help left the country I live in (Uganda) moved back to the states and enrolled in a clinic to treat all these mental health issues. I always knew it was not normal to feel as I had but this episode finally confirmed it. I'm now medicated for bipolar and I feel so much better - my bad days are still nothing compared to the cave from the past. ..Anyways I am now back to "real life" - I've returned to Uganda after spending 8 months in treatment in the states. Here in Uganda there is not the same amount of mental health support or support for alcoholism and drug addiction...So where does this fit in? I've been self-medicating for years and years. Alcohol is my true love. I cannot imagine myself without it - I've been to AA but never imagined myself as being truly sober. I can't imagine myself getting through these hard times without at least a bottle of wine a day. And then I think that's not that bad right?..Sorry this has been a long monologue! But I've gotten so much better in the past few months - for example I only drink about three or four days a week. In the past this would have been almost impossible for me. But I've been ok so far except I drink a lot of juice and tea :). My social life has also changed so I avoid triggers - which are many!..So my question to you all - how come it doesn't feel more rewarding to have sober days???..edit to add: I've tried aa/na in the states (drinking is the main problem but I have a long drug history as well and have been having cravings lately) - there is only one meeting a week here. If I relapse emotionally I know the first thing I will want is a drink and drugs will not be far behind.

I'm glad you're here and I hope we can provide you with whatever support you need!..&gt;So my question to you all - how come it doesn't feel more rewarding to have sober days???..I can't speak to you specifically but I'll answer for me...I was addicted to alcohol. It's easy forget that alcohol is a drug like any other and as such we can get addicted to it if we use it regularly. (Since I quit I've realized that the "relief" it was providing me was only a relief from withdrawals from my drug of choice.)..So what I'm saying is days off didn't feel great because I was still addicted to alcohol.
