Just feeling in a  posty  sort of mood.  I have 90 sober days under my belt after a lifetime of increasingly hard boozing.  I'm finding it increasingly hard though......and I thought it was supposed to get easier.  ..I've also struggled for a couple of years with prescription pills and since quitting the booze I've found this particular vice starting to escalate.  My triggers seem to be boredom and / or stress particularly  with regard to work.  Social anxiety and issues around self esteem also leave me aching for a drink and  in its absence I occasionally over medicate.  ..Recently I overdid it though and  whilst I might share the detail in a separate post at some point - the short version ends with me highly shaken but nevertheless alive at large and without having caused permanent damage to anyone else.  I had a truly shocking episode and  got away with it . ..The problem is that memory is a fickle thing and fades towards the good.  I'm not sure what the phenomenon is called but we remember the past with elevated though often unwarranted affection and we mentally diminish many things that were actually quite appalling.  Like  I remember the 80's with extreme fondness when actually for the most part they were crap times   Rose tinted spectacles and all that...What the trick though ? How do I remind myself of the bleakness that accompanied a 25 year drinking career? How do I dismiss ideas that being smashed was actually a pretty good part of my life ? How do I avoid that horrific misadventure with the pills fading from memory.  I'm even doing it now - why am I making a mellow drama out of the human condition ?..Thoughts of inspiration anyone ?
