I don't think a previous post made it. But I just found a pint that I know is new that I don't remember buying....wtf.. I really want to give up and die but I'm better than that... life sucks atm but I know it'll get better. I already drank today but I won't drink with you going forward.... I just feel like a piece of crap...loser...

It will be okay
You cannot post here after drinking I have already told you this on the other removed post. Continuing to post here tonight will potentially get you banned.
