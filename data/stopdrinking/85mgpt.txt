I'm going to be honest. I don't feel better. I feel the same...I have always LOVED booze. The first time I drank I absolutely could not believe how good it made me feel. I have always been a pretty cautious person and initially was scared to even have one but after the first all fear was lost and I drank until I blacked out. I woke up the next morning to discover I wasn't hungover and the first thing on my mind was how I could find another party and do this again...Second year of college rolled around and I moved into a house of people who drank...a lot. I started blacking out on a nightly basis. It wasn't emotionally driven or circumstantially driven. Happy or sad I wanted to be blacked out and once I started drinking it wasn't a decision anymore. Some primordial section of my brain would take over and I was GOING to be blacked out. I never developed hangovers (I stopped drinking at 23 so perhaps I just wasn't old enough yet). ..Then a year ago I got blacked out (just another Tuesday night!) and woke up in jail to discover that I had driven...This horrified me and I quit...Nobody will believe me but it wasn't THAT hard. It just wasn't. I just looked at alcohol and said no and didn't drink it. Of course it sucks but you get used to it and I just don't think about it 90% of the time. Everyone around me friends and court ordered therapists would say  I BET YOURE THINKING ABOUT IT 24/7  and I'd shrug and say  nah not really  and they just wouldn't believe me. One therapist wrote that I was a liar in denial and forced me to do an additional three months and so I learned to lie and say  yes yes I do but with the methods you teach me I will manage ...I didn't feel sick during the 5 or so years when I was abusing alcohol horribly. Mentally and physically...I felt exactly the same I do now. After I quit I continued to feel that way. I read all the time about how much booze fucks with your well being and how when you quit you feel this bliss. I didn't ever feel  sick and tired  as a drunk and I don't feel blissful sober. My body seems designed to drink to be honest to absorb the shock of acetylaldehyde and whatever else so efficiently that I hardly register the difference between a fifth a day and nothing at all; though yes I'm sure I was probably damaging my liver or kidneys or something. ..Honestly I feel like I had a lot of preconceived notions about alcoholism that weren't true for me. I almost TRIED to romanticize it to convince myself that it was some dark pit of despair and addiction and quitting was the hardest thing I could ever experience...Just not true...Alcoholism varies widely person to person. I truly believe we all experience it very differently. I know that very few people could comprehend how strongly I was pulled towards it but on the other hand very few could understand how it wasn't too much a struggle to put it down...I will never drink again because I could possibly kill somebody or do something else horrible. Not because of the impacts it had on me personally- I know they would have escalated eventually but it just wasn't really impacting me like you'd expect. I had good jobs I graduated college. My friends were drunks but I had them. I travelled although it's true I don't remember most of my vacations. I don't want to make it seem like I don't have problems because I do I just don't think they're that caused by or the cause of drinking. ..I just don't want to lie. I don't feel amazing or like I've had a  spiritual epiphany  or anything. I don't drink anymore and it kind of sucks but it's not this huge thing...I know that I'm obviously terrible susceptible to alcoholism trust me. I know I'm young and had I continued things likely could have gotten much worse. I am only describing to you what I have experienced...I had to go to a lot of court ordered classes and I didn't relate to most of what they said. I wanted to be a voice for the people who don't fit the mold and experience something other than the dominant narrative.

Thank you for sharing that.  I'm looking forward to your post next year to see if you feel any differently about the direction your life has headed after living another year out there!      it may feel  meh' today let's see what you do with it!  I'm betting on you enjoying it better but that's just me :)  I'm a diehard Pollyanna lol .I will not drink with you today .
Interesting perspective. You are right - it definitely affects each of us differently. I am definitely feeling the physical and mental effects of the excessive drinking much worse now I'm the wrong side of 35. But in the end its a poisons and would catch up with each of us. Sounds like you have just come to that realisation before it's too late. IWNDWYT .
When I removed the alcohol from me I was left with alcohol-less ME...That enabled me to examine where I am in life...If I am the person I want to be if my intentions manifest in actions that further my purpose...Couldn't do that when I was drinking...Now I have the capacity to be whatever I want...What do you want for yourself?
It kind of feels like to me you're saying you're not proud of yourself for quitting. Which you totally should be that's a huge accomplishment. You look at it as just sort of a bummer not something you really worked towards...Did you want to quit in the first place?
