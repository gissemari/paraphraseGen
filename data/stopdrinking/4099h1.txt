I honestly don't know what came over me. I felt like I could change my life for the better but it wasn't happening in the way I imagined. I got the flu I got in trouble at work I wasn't happy. .I believe I chose to drink long before I picked up the bottle. The idea of being sober the rest of my life is daunting although picking up again cemented the fact of why I'm making this decision. I picked up right where I left off feelings of depression worthlessness and guilt was all I felt when I drank that first bottle of wine. No more euphoria I must realize that. I struggle with honesty too so this is important to share. I have to call my sponsor now and restart. ..It's so hard but so worth it.

I'm glad you made it back. My last relapse cost me 18 years.....It looks like you've gained some valuable clarity. ..Thanks for posting.
Your a strong person calling your sponsor and returning here. I know that damned if you do damned if you don't feeling well. 
Hey I was the queen of relapsing. I'm at 617 days now  the best thing I think that happened to me is I finally gave alcohol the respect it deserves. I mean that shit OWNS me lol. Seriously one of the tools in my sobriety toolbox is that I never forget the power it has over me. Make yourself a plan you can do it! 
I think calling your sponsor is a big step. Glad your back.
