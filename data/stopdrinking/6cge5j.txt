Today is that day I relapsed last Sunday and I think the Saturday before that. Please give me some tips and encouragement. I had some bad cravings last night but managed to make it through but the cravings usually hit hardest on the seventh day or so for me. I have no idea why. I know I can do it! It's just gonna be difficult.

It is difficult but gets easier. One day at a time. Actually exciting as time clocks up 
It helped me to have a precisely focused goal. So instead of thinking about past failures focus on this moment right now. The past is irrelevant and you want to make it through today sober...Do anything you have to do not to drink today. Sleep exercise drive etc. Pass the time and focus on achieving only today's goal.
Glad you're here!..I think the world record for sobriety is 24 hours.  You've managed to exceed that multiple times!..Once I knew that I could stop for one day I knew that I just needed  tools and support...I went to meetings and got tools resources support and fellowship...I've never been happier...Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One
Is it weekends that are particularly hard? Sundays were triggers for me. I could stay away for most days of the week but for some reason I always had to get drunk on Sundays. ..Do you have support in getting sober? I couldn't do it on my own. ..
Early on I went to a lot of AA meetings. Being around other alcoholics who were not drinking helped me get through the early days especially on the weekends.
