hello everyone i'm five days deep into my sobriety journey and it's been a physical mental and emotional struggle already (putting things lightly). ..Basically I'm looking for articles/readings/materials about early sobriety and the psychological struggles and such both for myself and those close to me. Stuff about addicts brains the emotional hangover just anything. ..It would really be helpful because I am desperate for my current small support system to be able to understand what I'm dealing with. Plus I can never gain too much insight for myself...Any help/links would be appreciated. I'm mostly looking for online stuff but book recommendations would be excellent as well...Thank you all!

I would recommend Alcohol Explained by William Porter.   ..I like it because it goes into the different kinds of alcoholics.. (Binge vs Daily) and why some people can stop at one or two and others can't.  ..It was the key for me stopping and was able to explain to a lay person the physiological and psychological affects of alcohol over time....IWNDWYT
Congrats on 5 days!..I've a soft spot for Dr Robert LeFever (he's such a sweet man) and his Ted Talk ['Why Some Of Us Are Addicts'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHbuaq5h2A4) - his YouTube channel is also excellent and has videos with titles like 'Alcoholism for Beginners'... well worth a look.....For stuff about the neuroscience of addiction I'd highly recommend Dr Kevin McCauley's talks on YouTube he does a superb job of explaining addictive illness for the layman.....You might also enjoy the blog 'Mrs D Is Going Without' which documents her sobriety journey from the beginning it's brilliantly written.....Check out the [Quit Lit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) list there too (obligatory recommendation for 'Alcohol Explained' and 'This Naked Mind'!).....Hope that gives you a few ideas to explore!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;.
Congrats on 5 days!..Woody recommended some great stuff. You may also want to check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) out; be sure to scroll all the way down...You may also find these [timelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_how_long_until...) about what is happening to our body and mind in sobriety helpful...Let us know if there's anything else we can do to help :).
I've found "This Naked Mind" by Annie Grace to be a great resource.
