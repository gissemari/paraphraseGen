This time of year can be super rough for me and many others I'm sure. Seasonal depression holidays parties lots of drinking going on or talk of it. ...I'm a week shy of 5 years and it feels like some sort of invisible hump. I feel like I've been trying to make it past the five year relapse statistic this whole time. Now I'm almost there and it feels rougher than year one? The emotional want to drink and get wasted feels constant. ...I just wanted to share some of my thoughts. It's nice to get it off my chest. It's hard when no one around you understands what your brain is feeling.

Hang on! Stay strong for yourself and for all of the people like me who you inspire! What's the issue right now? Just the mental 5 year mark? Because it would seem to me from my tiny perch like you've fought all the battles in your head thousands of times. Hell I feel like I have in just this week. Lol
Just curious not judging but what is going on with your day counter?
