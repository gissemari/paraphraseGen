I am officially three weeks into the non-drinking lifestyle.  I returned from vacation yesterday afternoon and I'm happy to be home and I'm happy that I was not hungover so I could wash some clothes and go to bed and sleep well to adjust to the time difference...I mentioned in a previous post that I had re-started **This Naked Mind**.  I'm trying to go through and pick out passages that are particularly helpful for me and really think about them.  Here is one from this morning:..&gt;It's now clear that alcohol is taking more from me than it's giving.  I want to make it small and irrelevant in my life rather than allowing it more power over me...There are two points I took away from this passage:..1. Alcohol is taking more than it's giving.  If you're on this subreddit you have probably come to this conclusion at some point.  Alcohol takes memories it ruins friendships it dulls vibrant personalities and it damages organs and health.  All for what?  Just the **idea** that the effect of alcohol is fun.  The last few times that I binged I remember feeling like I was chasing a mental state that I never achieved and then I woke up feeling terrible.  There was never a moment when I felt like "here I am; this is what I was looking for; now I feel relaxed".  .2. I want to make it small and irrelevant.  This refers to the power that the alcoholic defect model and AA give to alcohol.  By saying that an alcoholic has a defect and can't drink alcohol in moderation implies that an alcoholic is missing out or enjoying a less fulfilling life than others.  This makes alcohol more powerful by making it desirable which makes each day a struggle to avoid this apparently wonderful substance that moderate drinkers can enjoy.  This simply can't be the case.  Alcohol is addictive.  There are not two types of people (moderate drinkers and alcoholics).  Everyone who consumes alcohol is somewhere along the road to alcohol dependency.  Abstaining from alcohol is not a punishment or sentence.  It is a smart healthy choice just like abstaining from tobacco.  Non-drinkers choose to avoid ingesting an addictive carcinogen.  It weakens us.  It shortens human life expectancy.  It will make you say and do things you don't want to say or do.  It makes you a different person...I'm not sure if this is helpful to anyone or not but I am finding it helpful to pause through the book and think about some of these more affective passages.  I hope everyone is having a wonderful day.

That is a great post! I am also 22 days into this attempt at not drinking. It feels so much different this time mostly because of the two passages you quoted. I love that today alcohol is  small and insignificant in my life. It is very encouraging to see others who are where I am in this challenge. Thanks for sharing it made a difference for me. 
20 days here. And I've also read This Naked Mind. Your post has things I needed to hear again. Especially on this Friday evening when I'm at home white knuckling it until I fall asleep.
