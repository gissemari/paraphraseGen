I always find these months when it first gets dark at 5 pm the most difficult. I can't seem to keep it together. Work is always the most stressful finances the most strained and personal/professional obligations the most demanding...I'm still here but my days are incorrect. I had another misstep on Friday. I know I need to go back to therapy. I know I should go to a meeting but I'm really feeling so overwhelmed by all my other obligations. I know by doing a session or meeting I'm wasting precious time that should be spent tending to other things. ..Thanks for listening. I know I need to prioritize my health first. I'm just struggling putting it to action. ..Not drinking with you today SD.

I definitely feel that same way.  On one hand the days are so extremely short and seasonal affective disorder so difficult to avoid and on the other hand my life is kind of a marathon with my kids' activities and me in school and the holidays.  My antidote?  I have to think of some ways to up my game until solstice.  I know that people generally think of Thanksgiving Christmas and NYE as the hallmark days but for me getting to the shortest day of the year is a big deal.  After that every day is a little bit longer and I love that thought.  What can you do to be proactive right now?  I'm going to think about it.
New Englander here. I have a countdown in my calendar so I know when the days will stop getting shorter! I feel you.
For me it's that I've been working so hard all year that's I'm 1/2 burnt by mid November.  Light doesn't have much to do with my day.  :)..Prioritizing health is always important.
