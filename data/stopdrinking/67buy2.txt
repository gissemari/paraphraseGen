I'm so tired.  My body is restless.  I can't sleep but I can barely stay awake.  The sickness isn't here but the check's in the mail that's for sure.  I allowed myself two shots 4 hours ago as a maintenance dose shortly after I woke up and I have an urge like I've never felt before.  The cravings are taking hold of me.  I'm sober but I don't want to be.  But I don't want to not be sober anymore...I'm really struggling.  I won't drink anymore today.  Tomorrow I'll wake up and start the game for real...I need a cigarette.

Don't take that first drink. One min one hour one whatever at a time. It gets better but you gotta let it get better. 
Hey. You can do this. I'm not drinking with you today. Take care
"I cant sleep but I can barely stay awake" man how true is that especially in detox. This resonates with me. 
I got a lot of support at meetings!
Don't give up.  I went from drinking myself stupid daily (daily for 3+ years) and being told I had an enlarged liver to 429 days sober and my poor liver has completely healed itself. ..I drank myself stupid every day because I couldn't handle withdrawal. I'm sure you've already heard this but I promise you it does get easier over time. Good luck! :)
