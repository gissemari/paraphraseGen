My drinking story is different from most others and then it is not different at all.....I grew up in a household with lots of alcohol around and I have some childhood memories of my father being intoxicated that really scarred me. I was completely abstinent without much thought until age 30. I started drinking occasionally and did't notice for the longest time that I didn't drink for the taste (let's be honest most alcohol does taste pretty vile) but for the buzz. I'm a sensitive introvert and 'not feeling' for a couple of hours felt like a true break from 'life' and it was great! I don't have stories of blackout drunk parties where I don't remember coming home feeling hungover the next day saying things I didn't mean etc. but I have come to realize that my motivation to drink is just as worrisome. While I drink more then 2-3 drinks in one setting (all it takes to make me 'not feel') I've come to realize that ANY alcohol in my life prevents my from reaching my goals. I have started connecting more spiritually and noticed that alcohol impedes any efforts of a deep relationship with oneself (how could it if it stops making you feel anything). Even though I've never been full on intoxicated every time I drink I feel guilty the next morning. I'm in my mid-forties and have seriously started to think about my life what I want to accomplish reflecting on my true 'purpose' etc. and I know alcohol will hold me back. The idea of 'never drinking again' feels as impossible as it probably does to a more heavy alcoholic. I love champagne and thinking to never enjoy a glass on a hot summer day on the patio sounds so sad. But then drinking to not be 'me' to disconnect from my true essence is so much sadder. I feel hesitant to call myself an alcoholic given my lack of full blown intoxication but I probably am addicted if I crave alcohol to stop feeling and never for the reasons that 'normal' drinkers drink (a nice glass of red wine with steak etc.). Maybe it would be helpful to step up and say 'I can't drink' and take it as seriously as it probably is. I feel so proud of myself if I don't drink and so guilty when I do drink (even if it's just sipping from my partners glass) and that is probably telling me something. I have taken longer breaks from alcohol (3+ months) but then always relapsed with a glass of wine after an especially stressful day. I have been exploring my spiritual practice journalling trying yoga running regularly eating a healthy diet etc. and the one thing that doesn't fit is alcohol. While I've come to realize this I've not been able to live it. I really want to though. IWNDWYT

Everybody's story is different.  If you think it's a problem that's all that is necessary to make a change.  Only you can decide if it's having a negative influence on your life regardless of quantity or frequency.  We're glad to have you here.  IWNDWYT  :)
&gt;The idea of 'never drinking again' feels as impossible as it probably does to a more heavy alcoholic..."Never Drinking Again"......Whoa!   Sounds heavy....  Daunting.....  BIG and even **Overwhelming!!**..That's my mind lying to me...I had the same fear.  "How can I go **forever** without **ever** having a glass of wine again!?"..Then I looked at what my mind was telling me.  .."Never" and "Forever" are constructs that exist only in my mind.  The natural world does not employ the terms "never" and "forever"....  they are inventions of humans.  .."Forever" is a mythical term.  I can't see 'forever'; I can't touch 'forever'; I can't measure 'forever'; I can't show someone else the 'forever' I'm thinking about......    I cannot "Do" or "Not Do" **anything** for Forever.   ..I'm willing to bet you can't either...When I realized that my mind was hijacking me and diverting my attention and energy to a mental construct **that does not exist** I had a good laugh at myself!..Then I did that which IS in my control:  Today I forgo just ONE little drink in ALL the drinks in the whole world -  The First Drink Today...Just ONE...Did it yesterday.  Did it a few times in a row.  Probably do it tomorrow.  But tomorrow doesn't exist either.  Only today...And that's plenty!..Whadda ya think?
You are kind of where I am though my drinking level was heavier. Alcohol is just not of any net benefit to my health nor my spiritual growth. I did not have to wait for escalation and physical addiction in order to quit.
