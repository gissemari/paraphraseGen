Giving myself the birthday gift of not drinking today.  Been struggling with binge-drinking lately when not working.  Was going to do a sober February but looking at the bigger picture makes me want to stop completely.  The bigger picture is me remembering birthdays in the past where I was in a better place with no beers cocktails or wine.  Any tips tactics methods helping words out there?  As far as not drinking today I work late into the morning and plan on making breakfast and going out for lunch before work to treat myself.  My next day off is Saturday that is the big test. Thank you!

&gt;Any tips tactics methods helping words out there?..I use good SELF-care (Sleep Exercise Laughter Food). Any one of these things gives me a lift and helps me get rid of cravings. Happy Birthday! I hope it's a great one for you.
Happy birthday! I'll celebrate with you by not drinking with you today!!
