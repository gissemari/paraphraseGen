This morning I found myself talking back to the scale : "That the best you can do? You do know I haven't drank a drop since the last time I stepped on?  Surely that's worth another pound or two?!"..As if this inanimate object owed me gratitude for my struggles.  I'm doing A LOT better but shit if I don't fall for the alcoholic brains trickery every now and then...Keep your mind strong! Nearly 3 months!!!

Congrats! I had the same convo with my scale today. 140.0 lbs. Couldn't it just be 139.9 so I can say "one thirtys" lol

Yeah my scale is also not being kind to me. Must be because of all the muscle building up...
My scale is barely budging but my clothes are looser. And that scale can kiss my sober ass for all I care!
