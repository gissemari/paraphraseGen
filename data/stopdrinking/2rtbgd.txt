December 1st of 2013 I woke up sober in detox. Little did I know that this was the start of something huge. Things are still tough but I am heading in the direction I want to be...From about 14-18 I was at least smoking pot every day and on top of that I was doing any drugs I could get my hands on minus huffing paint. I did just about every drug in the book at some point. My worst was probably my little coke and ecstasy phase...When I was about 18 I was doing some "research chemicals" at a party. Things went south and to the hospital I went. I had a minor stroke that night and refused to touch any drug ever again but that wasn't the case...My minor stroke incident sparked what would be a crippling anxiety and panic disorder that I still struggle with today. To deal with it then I started hitting the whiskey hard. I hated drinking before but this was my new cure. I spent the next couple years in a bottle of whiskey. I was either drunk or withdrawing. I became homeless broke and hopeless...Then on November 30th 2013 my grandmother found me passed out in the hallway of her apartment building in the middle of the night. She called the police and I went to detox. After 9 days in detox I completed a 30 day then a 90 day in-patient program. After that it was back to the same old homeless life well now a lot more friends let me sleep on their couches now that I'm sober (haha)...With my panic disorder and a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) I have been unable to hold a job but I needed something to do. I ended up enrolling in a cinema production program at a local college. I had always loved movies so I thought what the hell. I did a summer term for some elective credit and started the cinema production in fall. I just finished my first full-time semester and have a 4.0 GPA. I am now working (mostly unpaid) on a variety of side projects with film as well. I completely fell in love with this field and I truly thank it (and some other people) for saving my life. I found this passion in cinema and I am 403 days sober. I'm still early but at this rate and being this busy I won't have time to drink!..The homelessness still sucks so does the EDS and panic disorder but I am working actively everyday to improve on them as well as my work in school. I am also trying to raise funding for my first camera and lenses if you'd like to hear more about that otherwise AMA...I want to hear how other people found passions that saved their lives! (and sorry for typos I am a bit too tired to proof read today).

Well my passion for staying alive and staying sober is treating me quite well! I can't say I've focused on any one thing since quitting but I've rediscovered my passion for many things in life - work hanging out with friends going for a walk through a park or a bike ride by the lake. Things I took completely for granted when drinking.
