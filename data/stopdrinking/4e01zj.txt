Today was such a shit day. I had a drunk dream last night you know where you dream that you relapse and have to check the house for bottles just to make sure because it feels so real? Yeah those. I slept in and was an hour and a half late for work which would be par for the course for drunk me but this shit is not supposed to happen when i'm sober. That's the whole fucking point! I was so angry at myself and angry at the fact that I can't control my drinking and angry that bad shit happens even tho i'm sober and is it even really worth it oh my god being sober sucks...BUT THEN. I decided to check in here to see what my number was. It usually helps motivate me in times of trouble. 600 DAYS PEOPLE!! FUCK YEAH! I took a screen shot and sent it to everyone who knows and cares that i'm sober. YES! There have been a lot of shit days in that 600. A lot. But I made it through all of those. And I can make it through today. 600 BITCHES!! YEAH!
