I've been struggling with depression and an anxiety disorder for many years and alcohol was my goto escape for the last 8 years that I've been capable of buying alcohol...Two weeks ago on Thursday I realized it was my 4th day drinking that week (even though I have a steady job) so I made the decision to stop drinking altogether...I can't remember the last time I've even without a drink for two weeks in a row...I feel great! I've been walking 10-20km per day playing Pok mon GO and the amount of excess energy I have after a day of being outside has given me so much positive energy and happiness...I know two weeks maybe isn't a lot but for me this seems like a great long term decision. Thankfully all my friends and family are very supportive so I don't even have temptations because no one asks me to go drinking anymore. :)..Just wanted to share since I feel really good about myself.

Hiya! Congratulations on two weeks sobriety. Glad you are feeling the positive benefits already . I will not drink with you today and send you best wishes for your continued sobriety.
Hey! Congrats and don't sell yourself short - two weeks is huge!!!! Like you just did I too find it's helpful to share positive benefits so I can reflect back on them when I need to. Keep up the good work! 
Well done 2 weeks is like 2 years for others. ..
there was a time not so long ago when two weeks without drinking would have seemed impossible for me. you've done brilliantly well done. it keeps getting even better!
Big congrats!
Two weeks for me too! Three days was the longest I'd gone without booze in three years. 2 weeks feels amazing! Congrats! 
&gt;I know two weeks maybe isn't a lot..Actually it is. A hell of a lot. Congratulations.
