It'll be the toughest situation I'll ever put myself in. If I make it then I'm confident I won't ever relapse. I'm pretty sure I won't. Worst case scenario I feel anxious and then just bolt. That would suck but we'll see what happens. Anxiety sucks but I definitely need to face my own fears and see this through.

What's the event?  Your gonna do fine check in with us before during and after! Good luck friend
Having an exit plan (and driving to the event) has always been very helpful to me. I haven't often used it but it's been good to know I can get the f**k out immediately if I need to. ..Be sure to let us know how you went!
I go to these sorts of things early fly the flag say "hello" to everyone I need to say "hello" to; and get out at the earliest opportunity.  I don't fetishize drinking or critique any aspect of what I see.  I do my duty and leave with a smile on my face.  Good luck tonight.
Good luck to you :)
Your wedding?
