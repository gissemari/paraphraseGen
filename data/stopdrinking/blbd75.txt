And weekends are so tough. I dont struggle during the week but I get so anxious and restless on the weekends. I made it through though with some help from showers (lots of showers) ice cream and candy topo chico and la croix walking and planting plants I bought. ..How do you deal with anxiety and cravings?

I meditate for anxiety but have not had it since the first 5 days after quitting. My anxiety was wayyyy worse when I was drinking. For cravings other than ice cream and staying busy I wait 24 hours and see how I feel the next day. So far it has worked.  IWNDWYT
Basically doing what you are doing. Distracting myself. I bought a champagne flute from the Thrift Store to drink my Topo Chico in - made it feel special and seemed to help the craving. Mine are diminishing but I still have them. Just powering through as best I can. Good luck! We have to be in this for the long haul.
