Hello I too have been drinking nightly for weeks straight! (Aslong as i can remember at this point) and i'm really not proud of the fact..I plan to have a night Sober because I miss waking up with a clear mind. Will you join me?
So what can you do today/tonight to set yourself up for success? Some things that have helped me in the early days of trying to quit:..- get pjs on as soon as it gets dark/get into  I'm in for the night  mode.- eat a filling meal.- settle in on the couch with blankets and popcorn and watch a movie or show I like.- have some herbal tea then do a bedtime routine (again EARLY) and get in bed..Of course making sure no booze was in the house or accessible helped a lot...Good luck!
What made me give in to being sober from the start was thinking: I feel like shit now. Life is a struggle and I hate myself. So I give sober life an honest try. One wise man told me: youve tried with alcohol you werent happy. Give sober life a chance give it your best do the work in the 12 step program give it a year. If you still dont like it a year later alcohol will still be there. ..Worth a try. And Im hoping when I get to one year sober I will feel differently.
