Chronic relapser here. My therapist suggested trying one of these medications in addition to my current substance abuse counseling & extended outpatient. Do any of you have experience with these medications? ..Thanks :) I will not drink with you today.

IMO naltrexone is the best one. If you relapse on it it blocks the pleasure/intoxicating effects that alcohol has causing you to drink less and not enjoy it. It helped me. Antabuse is...lovely...if you relapse on it you'll throw up for 2 hours straight but you can just stop taking it and that won't happen. 
I was on Antabuse for a little while. It did help me a lot in early sobriety when I tried to get sober last time. It's quite effective if you take it because you really CAN'T drink while on it. It's incredibly unpleasant. The downside is that you can also get sick accidentally if you eat certain foods that have alcohol cooked into them so you have to be super careful. I've heard good things about naltrexone.
