Hey everybody happy Halloween for everyone keep yourselves out of trouble. ..I left rehab last December 1st and me and my wife have been struggling since. We have gone to couples therapy and that went great (around July-august). I keep getting the idea that things are going forward great. I have eliminated any influences that I can't control and have stayed sober. But she just keeps saying it's too hard for her to bring her guard down. Like we need to start over as a couple almost and I have been so busy with working and sobriety that I haven't been focusing on "us." She has come a ways but even I can still feel the wall she had built up in case she needed to leave and protect our daughter from my bad decisions. ..I guess I just need some ideas for cheap dates good ways to surprise her so she feels loved. ..Things are still hard but I appreciate this community and am loving life otherwise.

My husband wanted to stop drinking so he started before I did and told me that if I stopped for 30 days he would go to therapy with me. I'm hoping that it happens. It's a tough situation. We went for dinner the other night and had a nice time but I am smoking which I know he doesn't like. I also have been working a lot and trying to find happiness and fun without drinking. I'm at day 21 so 7 more days and I'm hoping he makes the appointment for us as promised. Amusement parks are fun which we are planning to do. We like to play crib and scrabble which are nice times together. Also walks and driving out of town for the day can be fun. I feel your struggle. Try to spend time talking or leave work early to get one on one time together. Good luck I will not drink with you tonight.
