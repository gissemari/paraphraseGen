After staying off alcohol since August I managed to drink 3 pints at the pub then not even 12 hours later I bought a bottle of Jim Beam in a moment of weakness and have now consumed most of the bottle. As a twice-before alcoholic i'm absolutely terrified of going back to withdrawals but i can't fucking control myself.  What can I do to stop my stupid fucking ass falling back into the trap? I don't want to end up in the hell of addiction again

Hey mate I'm in the same space and downed on bottle but poured the second one down the toilet.  Just get rid of it.  
You're already doing great by posting here.  I'd recommend dumping the rest of the bottle and starting sober now.  ..There is no such thing as "was an alcoholic" btw.  ..What has helped me the most besides reaching my rock bottom was the book "Alcohol Explained".  It's also on audiobook.  The first 5 chapters are posted for free on the site.  
I learned not to take the first drink. Haven't been drunk since. I couldn't do it on my own. When I lost more than I was willing to lose I ended up in an A.A. meeting. It saved my life. Good luck. IWNDWYT
