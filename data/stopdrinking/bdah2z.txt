Hi SD. I'm sorry to post like this. I love this community so much and struggle with the fact that it's hard for me to put in as much as I get out from it daily. But I have an urgent problem and I don't know who else to reach out to...I'm about 70 days sober and have been feeling really great. I come on this sub every day mostly to lurk but sometimes to post have gone to some AA meetings listen to lots of recovery podcasts and books doing tons of journaling and general "work" that feels really good and I feel lucky to be where I am...However my partner suffers from cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome which basically means he suffers from bouts of uncontrollable constant vomiting and nausea related to marijuana use. It's usually triggered by anxiety and lasts for weeks at a time. He hasn't quit smoking despite having had a few episodes of this horrendous condition...This week I had a health scare (unrelated to drinking) and had to have emergency surgery. This triggered his anxiety and now his CHS is back. My recovery from surgery has been much more painful than I expected and I can hardly move. But now he is also completely incapacitated and we have two kids to look after (elementary school age). The kids are on spring break all week and I literally can't change the cat litter or take the garbage out let alone take them anywhere fun or respond quickly if there's an emergency...I feel scared and upset and don't know where to put my feelings of resentment either (I also do sympathize with how awful he feels in the moment). I removed so much chaos from my life when I quit drinking and though it's been super hard I felt overwhelming freedom gratitude and positive reinforcement. Now chaos is all around me and I'm terrified. But I do know I will not drink today. Thank you for listening.
