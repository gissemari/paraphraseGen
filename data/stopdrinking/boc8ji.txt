I've convinced myself past a certain point in sobriety craving triggers are purely psychological.  ..I've been monitoring my own craving triggers closely and they are almost entirely social.  I never significantly crave alcohol when alone at work or when not around it...If cravings are entirely social then what's going on?  FOMO peer pressure wanting to fit in insecurity anxiety all of the above?  I do believe it's a combination of these things to varying degree depending on the social situation...If I don't want alcohol when not in social situations then any cravings are purely a reaction to social situations...This may seem obvious to others but I'm finding it rather fascinating confusing and illuminating.  I don't really want to drink I'm having feelings related to a social context and I'm struggling with how to address it in the moment.  It can manifest as a craving to drink because in the social context I'm in that's what's going on around me...That brings me to what I experienced this weekend during a very enjoyable Mother's Day weekend (in which I did not drink).  I was with family and they were drinking.  What threw me was that my cravings were higher than normal and it really annoyed me.  It interfered with my enjoyment and that frustrated me.  It put me in a negative feedback loop and I struggled (not noticeably to anyone else) to get out of it.  My wife noticed I was quieter than I might normally be...I'm still processing this but it's clear to me that when I'm around my family (my brothers) whom I used to drink with the triggers and cravings can be quite strong and frustrating...The last time I remember this was another family event.  I know this is normal and it's what sobriety looks and feels like...I just wish it didn't distract and interfere with my enjoyment of family events...But if I'm being honest it does.  It's ok.  If that's what it takes to get through an evening and not drink I'll take it...But I'm really looking for that Jedi Mind Trick level where I say "this is not the craving you're looking for"...Maybe someday...Not drinking with you.  Be well!
