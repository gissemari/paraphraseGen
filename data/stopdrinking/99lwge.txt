All I'll say is if they can be used to clean grease off car engines where most professional degreasers fail---then I gotta stop drinking the damn things...Granted thanks to day 33 and Sleeping-Bag-Gate (refer to previous post that blew up last night) I was running on pure fatherly adrenaline this morning so I immediately punished a 1L can of the stuff...Then midday... Another 350ml can...2pm??? Struggling for life. Coffee...4pm? Another coffee...7pm?? Drooling in bed but still unable to sleep as the Degreaser of the Millennium is still coursing through my veins...I'll be drinking water tomorrow I think.... Damn right whoever said you seek out sugar as a replacement for booze.....IWNDWYT

Sugar *and* caffeine! Both addictive mood-altering substances in their own right.....Mind out for the caffeine withdrawal if you're trying to stop abruptly it's headaches for days... there's r/decaf which is the caffeine equivalent of r/stopdrinking and worth poking around in.....I was drinking gallons of coffee when I got sober and it was making me a jittery anxious sleepless mess!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;..
