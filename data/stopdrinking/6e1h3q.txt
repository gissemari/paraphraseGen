Seeing a lot of new users here so I compiled a couple of comments I've made over the last day into one post about quitting and this subreddit...I own a venue that sells beer & wine so 24/7 I'm surrounded by booze. And I'm a writer and in the entertainment biz where booze is aplenty and goes kind of hand-in-hand with comedy and such.  Many (most?) people will recommend  Dry people dry places  but in my case that's clearly not an option...I quit for a diet re-boot that meant no sugar for 2 weeks which of course means no booze. I knew my drinking had gotten bad --really really bad-- so this was going to be my kick in the pants to lose weight and get my drinking under control. I'd done the diet before so it wasn't too tough. "Two weeks? Sheee-it I got this." Those past times dieting I resumed drinking as soon as the 2 weeks was up trying to stick to one or two glasses a day and not being honest with the app (An app! Not even a real person!) about my consumption...But thanks to that Big Brother 1984 fitness app I was able to look back over the years of my attempts to moderate and see that while I would be good at first it was only a matter of time I'd need to re-boot. And for what? Why?..I spent the two weeks doing a lot of reading on /SD and other sites about habit breaking & formation. I spent a LOT more time on self-reflection on past behavior embarrassing stressful and downright dangerous life-threatening moments. All of it could be attributed to my being drunk. Owning & operating my venue plus my nieces (too long to get into that) has been the tipping point for me.  ..In my heart I knew I was done. It was like I had been born with a specific amount of booze I would drink in my life and I'd reached my quota. Saying I was quitting for good seemed too hard too big too final. So when during week two of the diet I said it out loud to my husband "I think I'm done" I actually got choked up and emotional. That surprised me...Thankfully (oddly?) I had no cravings or anxiety about it really --just some minor hot flashes later some brain fog and some intense emotions. That said this subreddit has shown me that it's a day-to-day promise to make with myself and to not take sobriety for granted. I've seen posts from people with many months to many years coming back to say they'd relapsed. Sometimes just with a couple of drinks others down the hole for months or years. ..So while today is not a struggle for me (cheers to you with my decaf coffee!) tomorrow might be. I check in here every day even if I'm not actively commenting. I "outed" my real identity to a couple of /stopdrinking users for some accountability. I also pay close attention to the HALT thing which I learned here. HALT stands for Hungry Angry Lonely Tired. If I got a fleeting thought about a glass of wine I checked in with myself to see if I was any of those things. Usually I was. Or sometimes just thirsty or dehydrated and a flavored seltzer or Pellegrino did the trick...Congratulations to everyone who is on Day 1 or Day 11K+ and everyone in between. This is such a great space. I'm so glad to have "met" you. :D .

Thanks for sharing and encouraging me.  
*a day-to-day promise*..This gives me enormous hope. I can do 24 hours. And so I don't think beyond that. Thanks OP.
