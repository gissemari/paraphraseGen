**Why?**..&amp;#x200B;..23 years old. *But I can't stop drinking?*..i only wanted to try once mom i swear i don't know how it got out of hand...a 4.0 grad student 'happy' successful and bland. *But I can't stop drinking?*..undergrad wasn't easy i wrote papers shaking with sobriety and comfy with beer after beer helping it flow nicely...a suburban raised child with only one sibling all the love in the world. *But I can't stop drinking?* ..we used to watch intervention; cry laugh wonder how it could happen...sure i can blame genetics but still WHY *can't i stop drinking?*..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..I got caught the other day. Fucked up in the middle of the day. Blacked out without reason for the pain. Just an impulse made me act on it that day. While embarrassing it felt like a blessing. Got called out and decided that this was the end of it. **I made it three weeks sober**...so tell me......&amp;#x200B;..*Why today can't I stop drinking?* ..&amp;#x200B;..\#relapse #neverreallyrecovered #sponsorwanted

Why can't you stop?  Probably because it is an addictive drug and you have been abusing it.  That is kind of the nature of addiction...It helped me to learn about how alcohol really works in the body how withdrawal works etc.  Knowing your enemy makes all the difference or it did for me at least.
Relapse is a super common story and at 23...getting sober must be fucking hard. I'm 31 and thinking back to when I was 23 the signs were already there but I was blind to them. I'm not going to say I wish I had hindsight is 20/20 and all but...yr on the right path sounds like. Wish I had thought like  maybe don't go drunk to class  etc etc
