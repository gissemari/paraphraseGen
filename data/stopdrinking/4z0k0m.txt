and I still haven't had a drink! Yesterday was pretty rough (1st birthday since college spent sober had to cancel lunch with my dad due to his illness only had one friend wish me happy bday had a shitty day at work etc etc) but I still chose not to drink when I was down and now I've been officially sober for the longest period in my entire adult life. I've really only been lurking around here since I stopped but just wanted to say I've been reading everyone's posts daily and they've helped me immensely when I started to struggle. So as I raise my cup (of coffee) to you all here's to many more sober days ahead. Namaste
