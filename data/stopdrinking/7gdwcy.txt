This is a somewhat of a Hello as i hope to stay on this sub for a while and also a message to people browsing that this shit does catch up with you at some point. ..Sunday morning I was woken up by pretty intense stomach and chest pain. It got worse throughout the afternoon to the point i was sweating and couldn't stand up properly. As i was walking up stairs to go to the toilet I threw up mostly water that i'd been drinking to try hydrate myself but it was a pink colour which got be anxious. 10 minutes later I threw up again this time pure thick blood. At this point the pain in my chest and stomach was unbearable and i'd be lying if i said i wasn't scared shitless. ..My mom drove me to hospital and they said it was likely pretty bad gastritis. After admitting to them when my mother was outside that my diet was normally 1 tiny meal at lunchtime followed by alcohol till i passed out. It was obvious that it had over time abused my stomach and now was the time to pay the price...It's wednesday now and i am still struggling to keep food down and can only sip water. Just sitting here feeling guilty that all those 100's of times i've said "i'll stop tomorrow" has lead to me  personally destroying my body to this point.

That sucks! I hope you get well soon and IWNDWYT!
My Uncle had a friend who kept a bottle under his bed for when he woke up at night. He died of a bleeding stomach. Time to stop. Good wishes. 
I wish you the best and I won't drink with you today. 
Eek!..The human body has amazing powers of recuperation and can stand up to a lot of abuse until suddenly it can't.....Hope you're soon A1 again and that you'll stick around and let us know how you're doing?..Best wishes for a speedy recovery ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
The best medicine is no alcohol and time. You can and will heal. SD has been a great support for me especially the Daily Morning check-ins. One day at a time. You can do it. Wishing you the best. I will not drink with you today.
Thank you for your courage to post!..&gt; feeling guilty that all those 100's of times i've said "i'll stop tomorrow" has lead to me personally destroying my body to this point..Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

I can relate to this. I now have GERD. I am 24 and had a scope to stretch my stomach and esophagus. I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life and constant need to have scopes almost yearly because my lining is almost nearly gone. I've always paved the way for IBS. 
I too said "tomorrow." .. I hope you heal and get stronger..
Healing is on the way! You won't believe the changes your body is capable of... I won't drink with you today. Stay strong!
The last time I relapsed the next day I was shitting blood.  It scared the hell out of me.  I'm happy to report I'm fine now.
Welcome.  The body has amazing healing capabilities when it gets lots of healthy whole food.  Hope you got some good info on nutrition.  IWDWYT
Welcome. Slow and steady and your body will heal. You. An do this!
