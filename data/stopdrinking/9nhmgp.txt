Im finishing up day 5. Tip one dont drink energy drinks in the first few days of detox. My stomach lining is screaming. Ive had diarrhea the last two days. Since getting home from work I feel like utter garbage. Cant get out of bed but cant sleep either. Im able to eat but my body is only happy for a few minutes then it starts saying "no that's not what I wanted. Something else". ..Damn. This sucks. I can feel that I'm having withdrawals in my brain and my stomach is torn up. Im thirsty but swallowing water is hard. Pee is a healthy color though so I know my kidneys arent struggling. I had no idea this would feel so bad.

Sorry you're feeling so awful. Maybe try a stomach-coating remedy like Pepto Bismol? 
A drink won't help make you feel any better just do more damage. I just hit day 10 and the first 5-6 were brutal. Day 7 hit and I can feel the changes. ..Loads of water juices and Kombucha is now my best friend. You've got this and you're going to feel every day you don't drink. ..I did not and will not drink with you today. 
It will pass. IWNDWYT!
I suggest that you see a doctor.
I founds herbal tea seltzer water and many natural whole foods and snacks to be soothing in the first weeks.  Hang in there.  It'll be worth it.
