The time has come to quit drinking for good. I'm so sick of wasting my life. I'm turning 25 soon and have been drinking pretty much every day since I turned 16. The realization that I need to stop now or never dawned on me while I was fighting a hangover through the last half of my work shift. I managed to turn one beer before work into 10 beers. What a mess. ..Looking forward to posting my progress on here. It's reassuring knowing that I'm not the only one struggling with this. ..Hope everyone else is doing well :)

Well done on making a most excellent life choice. ..Keep going it gets easier.   
I think there is something in our brains that triggers after a decade of drinking like a "last chance" warning. If we don't face our problem them I think it's easy to turn into 20-30 years of alcoholism. So it's good you're tackling the problem now. I stopped after almost exactly a decade as well...So what's your plan of attack looking like? Are you going to tell your family/friends/SO? Going the AA route or is that not for you? Got some fun new hobbies lined up to replace the time and money of alcohol?
You're not alone. All of the users in this sub is just a fart in the wind compared to all the people in the world who is struggling with this sickness. Sometimes the feeling that you're not alone is strengthening...And I would like to say in the case of addiction alone is not strong..
I'm 25 I was introduced to alcohol pretty young (about 12 or 13) and by the time I was 15 I was getting plastered on the reg. I understand how difficult it is to let go of it considering you practically grew up on it. It feels like it's a part of you and your identity. But it isn't and you don't need it. It's time to find the clarity to see more of what makes you you. We can do this!
