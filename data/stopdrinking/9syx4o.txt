Waking up pre-dawn rested cozy under the covers with two dogs at my feet... and no hangover!!!  For all the struggle and irritability that comes with withdrawal these mornings make it SO worth it.

Hooray! Happiness especially in the morning is the kind of thing I get used to. Ain't it grand?..The only good thing about withdrawal is that it's temporary. Once it's gone you get to actually feeling "normal" for a change and it's astonishingly pleasant. :)
Yeah! That's one of my favorite things too.  It really brings into focus our desire and our ability to live life to the fullest and enjoy every little moment.  
That is the BEST feeling!
