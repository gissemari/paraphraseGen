And I'm really excited!  It's been a struggle the last few years trying to quit trying to cut back not knowing *what* I'm actually trying to do if my goal is to quit or just get some control (haha we know how that works out). Today is day 1 again after giving up on trying at all a few weeks ago. And I am really hyped to be heading back into sobriety. I've missed it. I miss how I feel physically during sobriety. I miss the mental and emotional improvements and the growth I experience. It's a choice I want to make not because things went bad not because I have to or even that I think I *should*. For me sobriety is **better**. Life is better sober. Appreciation and enjoyment and fulfillment is richer. ..I think today I'm just getting a real kick out of the fact that instead of the nostalgia and longing that I would have over alcohol when I've "quit" before those feelings are now directed toward sobriety and it feels wonderful. It feels like a piece of the puzzle fell into place. I'm excited to see what's down this road past where I've been before.

This seems like an excellent approach from a personal thought standpoint. That nostalgia aspect kept me drinking too much regularly for far longer than was actually fun... Now I'm pushing back toward regaining the fun via soberiety not attempting to get it back the easy-way by thinking that drinking will magically make the fun return (seemed like a good idea but failed a few hundred times for me).

Congrats on the change of attitude.  I'm in a similar boat.  Tried many times and always fell back into drinking...Can I suggest a meeting?  I was personally very skeptical since I'm pretty atheist and meetings always sounded preachy and religious to me.  I decided to embrace my new attitude about sobriety full on though and try a meeting out and it was a fantastic decision.  It didn't feel overly religious and the support and encouragement was amazing.  It gave me a whole different outlook on sobriety and made it seem a lot more achievable and a lot more enjoyable.  It really is remarkable what a difference sitting in a room with people going through the same thing as you can do.  ..Just my 2 cents.  I'm still only 24 days in this time but I'm not feeling a longing to drink or nostalgic or anything like I usually would at this point in my sobriety on previous attempts to quit.  I think the meetings helped a lot with that.  All I feel now is excitement about what I'm able to achieve as a sober person!..Good luck and stick with it!
