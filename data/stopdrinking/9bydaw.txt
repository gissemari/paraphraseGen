So I'm one week sober today. I've been eating mostly vegetables fruits drinking green tea I want to share some of the positivity and encouragement that I've been feeling. The past week **has not** been easy. Holy shit... ..This past week I feel like I've morphed into a new body that hasn't been used in a while. I've actually been on edge and thought about calling into work simply because I've felt extremely moody all week. I've also been sleeping a lot more the last few days (something I didn't do that much of when I was drinking a lot). Everyday just felt like a mountain and like I didn't truly feel like I should quit. Honestly I still don't believe that sometimes. Especially when there is peer pressure involved. I just know that what I feel and what is objectively the right thing to do can be two entirely different things. ..As all of this is happening something (simple but still) important occurred to me this past week. Not only is important to abstain from alcohol it's really important to just start being more mindful of what we put into our bodies - whatever it may be (beverage food medication environments around us). Literally everything should be considered. Mainly because I think it's really easy to blame alcohol for other underlying problems. When it's more the case that there is so much more that affects why we feel the way we do at times. ..That's important for staying clean because when you quit drinking everything may not magically get better. And that shit is so discouraging. It really makes me want to say fuck it. For me that's just something I tended to forget (and it greatly discouraged me from ever quitting drinking). I seriously want to cry like a baby when I'm driving home from work before a long weekend and I know the craving are just hanging on to me and the allure of the feeling I want to feel seducing me. Honestly it's like saying no to sex when you really want to have sex. Sorry I'm just being honest. I love drinking *that* much. ..So making multiple changes is a good thing but I don't mean for it to seem as if I'm an all-or-nothing type of person. I'm really not. But since I've stopped drinking I've realized that it's the really small steps that make the biggest changes. It's telling yourself **no** and moving on. In examining why I felt so down on myself it's actually multiple things that need working on for me in both my personal and professional life.  ..One last thing I was thinking about this past week. I think it's equally important not to deflect the addictive tendency to something else that could be potentially harmful. For me it's cannabis. I could easily have it right now but I'm choosing not to because I know that I'll abuse it the same way I do alcohol. These are the things that cross my mind everyday too. Every waking hour actually. Whether it be eating until I can't eat anymore or drinking until I'm stumbling over myself and a complete mess. ..This past week is going down as a win for me. Not just one win but multiple wins. Every time we say **no** it's a win. The cost of winning this battle is the struggle and the reward is that we are strong individuals. Overcoming something like this everyday just makes us that much more stronger to face the next...

Slam dunk post right here. Once we become aware of the effect alcohol had on our system it's a lot easier to become more aware of the other factors affecting our wellbeing - physical spiritual or mental. ..Can we reshape those parts of our self that craves release connection or a  buzz  away from booze and towards meditation service and sport? It's a yes from me.
Props to you for making it through the week! You're so right about how important it is to not replace one addiction with another..I took a week off of work to deal with my sobriety and it left me with too much time on my hands. I'm definitely not doing that again any time soon.
