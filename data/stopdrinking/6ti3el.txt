  Tldr: Swing day from getting off nightshifts normally would blackout-drink today sleep like shit and waste my days off. Instead optimistic for truly fun rejuvenating days!...---  Loooooong version :P...Got off a 12 hour night shift this morning. Last of my work week. Just woke up from short nap....  My pattern in the past has been to designate this a "zombie day" and justify drinking 8% beer or wine all day by saying "Ah you'll feel off today anyways might as well get drunk all day! It'll be fun! Then you'll be so tired by 9pm you'll sleep great and be rested to see your daughter or go explore nature tomorrow"...  Ha!  I'd get increasingly drunk do a half-ass job of some chores black out by suppertime finally crash to bed at midnight or 1am (leaving a mess in the kitchen from some greasy feast) ..... Then wake up feeling like shit and either waste a rare day off all to myself (to go hiking or paddling) or be hungover and irritable picking up my daughter and justify my starting to drink again that afternoon "so I can be in a better mood around her and be more fun and engaged"....  Fuck that noise!.  Do I feel sleep-deprived and irritable today? Yup!...  Am I ACTUALLY gonna get a good sleep tonight wake up truly rested and enjoy a challenging beautiful stun-gun hike tomorrow? Yup!...  And then I'm gonna pick my daughter up the next morning for a 2 day visit without my being hungover being the first impression she has of me. ... Without needing to start drinking that afternoon to shake hangover-cobwebs and lie to myself about what a great dad I am for only getting KINDA drunk until she's in bed and then getting blackout drunk again. "Cuz hey I've been focusing on her today I deserve a treat on my day off!"...  Then being so hungover the 2nd day of our visit that I feel irritated when she wakes me up struggle to wake up and feel deprived that I can't drink cuz I'll have to drive her home at suppertime. Would habitally intrude on quality time with her to crash for a 2 or 3 hour nap in the afternoon so "I can rest up for work tomorrow"....  What a shitty way to live that old cycle is!...  So I'm just gonna fully feel being sleep-deprived and grumpy today and use it as a pivot point. Tomorrow's gonna be a stimulating day in nature that will increase my physical robustness and ACTUALLY reduce stress. I'll ACTUALLY go for a hike not mope around feeling like death .....  And then I'll have 2 whole days with my lively beautiful hilarious curious quirky daughter (who is all that and more without ever having had a drop of alcohol) to finally start modeling to her how to exist in the world without my life revolving around alcohol...  .  Long read I know :) Heh...  Feels good just to tangibly lay out a game-plan I can be inspired by for my days off and anticipate life!... Way better than wasting today getting obliterated triggering a cascade of boring same-old-story ho-hum cycle. ...  This community's great! I've been getting alot of encouragement here the last few days reading posts. ...Thanks ~..  *edit* wall of text

Sounds like a plan!
Waking up truly rested is like finding gold at the end of a rainbow!
