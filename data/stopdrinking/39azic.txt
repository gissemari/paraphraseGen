The last few weeks I've been taking steps to do so. I've gone through phases of unhappiness before so I know what I need to do to get out of it...mostly eat healither work out get out and get some sun do things I enjoy look for support from those close to me stop drinking. Usually I'm able to do all of these except for the last. And usually it helps enough that I get out of my funk for a while. But I always inevitably go back to my old habits. I'm tired of it. I feel like I'm only barely functional and I'm scared of what might happen if I don't get control of things now. ..I am close to rock bottom but haven't hit it yet and don't want to. I want to keep the few good things i have (a decent job no debt a loving boyfriend). So yesterday I made a baby step. The last 2 weeks I've been eating healthier and working out a lot but still drinking. Last night I desperately wanted to waste the evening away by having a few drinks and just staying in my hotel room(I'm travelling for work) and just watch shows/browse the internet. Well I still wasted the evening but I managed to avoid drinking. ..I've attempted to quit before I'm hoping this time will be different...that I'll see some quick progress and gain some momentum that will keep me going but only time will tell. I've reached out to my best friend and told him I won't be drinking this weekend when I see him  hoping that will help me abstain. Now I'm posting here on my actual account and not a throw away. Next is telling my boyfriend who loves drinking but is good with moderation. I know he loves the party girl side of me but I think I have slowly revealed how unhappy it makes me so hopefully he will be supportive. ..I guess my main reason for posting here is to look for some extra motivation and one more thing to keep me accountable. So please feel free to offer any advice similar struggles or criticism.

Nothing changes if nothing changes. The intensity and effort I put into my recovery really showed. The more i did the more my cravings went away.
