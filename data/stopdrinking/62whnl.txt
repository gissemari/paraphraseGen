Yesterday was my 32nd birthday and the first one I've spent sober since I was 21. I didn't start drinking until I was almost 22 and I started because of being depressed. Every year I would go through the same routine of having dinner with family then go out drinking way too much afterwards and wake up on April 1st feeling miserable. This year I instead celebrated turning 32 with celebrating being 5 months sober. The past 5 months I have been struggling to not drink but I've found some relief in being sober on my day of birth. ..I just wanted to share this with someone because it's something very meaningful to me. I hope everyone has a nice day.

Well done and happy birthday.   It would only have got worse.  In my last years of drinking birthdays were just another day of drinking my own.  Drinking is sadness.
Happy birthday!! I'm soo jealous of your time. Keep going! Your spirits will rise. Just Don't try to come "taste" the kool-aid again like I did!! Cause you WILL be back and it's sooo much harder. Keep going! You got this!
