I couldn't find something this morning and instinctively questioned whether or not I threw it away when I was drunk.  Nope sure didn't.  I have haven't had a drink in almost three years.  The simple answer is I tossed it and just forgot.  ...The weird thing about drinking almost every day for 20 years is I constantly questioned whether it was me or the booze.  "Was I really angry at my friend last night or was it the tequila talking?"  "Am I funny when I don't drink?"  "Do I have the confidence to talk to these strangers without a beer in my hand?"  ...Being sober for a while has been a nice chance to get to know the real me.  It's not really revelatory.  I'm a nerd.  I like nerdy stuff and don't mind if people think I'm awkward.  I don't worry about being cool much these days.  I'm forgetful sometimes and can be quite a klutz.  I always thought booze was the reason I stumbled or dropped things.  Nope just clumsy.  ...Also I can be quite shy.  These days I don't obsess over it.  I used to use alcohol as a crutch for social interaction.  It worked out terribly.  I always overdid it and was more obnoxious than outgoing.  These days I overcome my shyness when I need to and if I don't then I allow myself to be shy.  Odd thing is I found I'm fairly good at mingling when I'm not slurring my speech.  ...I have to say it's nice not having the constant internal struggle.  I have a lot of things I want to accomplish my personality is adequate for the job.  It's nice to just be me.

Amazing I'm so happy for you :) can't wait to get there myself 
I also drank due to being awkward in social situations. And also when alone because I felt it reflected on me. I'm learning that I can be quite serious and not always on and fun. But that's ok. We don't all need to be clowns. .Like you I'm really enjoying interacting with people without obsessing over whether I'm slurring or repeating myself and also not worrying about whether I'm being judged for drinking too much. ..I'm looking forward to leaving that anxious part of me behind
