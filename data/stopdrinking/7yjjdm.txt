Struggling to stay sober. Spent 2 hours cleaning their dogs poop out of our shared yard. Bagged all of the poop and left it next to their trash can. Came outside this morning to find all of the bagged poop had been dumped out of the bag into our trash can.  ..What the fuck is wrong with people really wanted a drink but went for a drive instead. Still pretty angry and trying my best to stay sober through this bullshit.

Really?? My god what assholes. That sounds like a nightmare I'm so sorry. I would put raw shrimp in their curtain rods for you if I could. :-(
Buy Thai fermented squid sauce (it's really 9 month rotten squid liquidise somehow into bottle and quite cheap) and pour wherever desired (bottom of their trash can).... my god that stink is unbearable not fishy but something between horse ass and rotten  skunk..
