I just finished step 3 but still have no higher power (my sponser says I'll get there as long as I have willingness). I have been trying to find one for two years now but no matter how much I try to tell myself to believe deep down any concept of a god is just silly to me. Others in the program say that their higher power has kept them sober but in reality it is nothing more than self-will not strength from an outside entity. I want to know if there are any other atheists out there who can offer advice.

Use the humanity of AA itself as a Higher Power.  I know a few who do and it works for them.
A higher power can something as simple as an upgraded version of yourself. Basically anything that you can imagine and hold in your mind as a model is sufficient. It doesn't have to be an external man in the clouds kind of thing!
Its as **I don't understand him her them it whatever.**..This has worked for me for years in AA..Have a new puppy so it is my higher power of the moment...
You don't need belief in a higher power to get and stay sober. If anyone tells you it can only be done that way they're full of it. SMART recovery is better in that sense because they give you actual tools to help manage addiction rather than saying "the lord will make you sober." Or whatever it is they spout at AA. It's not for everyone and if it suits you great but I don't accept I'm powerless over alcohol. No thanky. 
I've always thought the higher power is yourself.  You're the one making the decision to stay sober that's an incredibly powerful move.  Have faith in yourself and have faith in your peers who are on the same journey.  ..The thing I look to to keep me sober is my job.  I do massage therapy and I feel that in order to properly serve and heal my clients I have to serve and heal myself.  Otherwise I feel like a charlatan.  ..You are your own source of power and wisdom and strength.  PM me if you ever need support and also check out the IRC chat here.  Lots of good folks at this subreddit.

My higher power is undefinable. Its not god. Or people. Its just something. Its not me. You know like dark matter. I know its out there but I don't really understand what it is.
Old AA adage=change your sponsor change your home group or change your Higher Power; just don't change your sober date...My higher power isn't about religion; it's about the idea that there is something outside myself that I can rely on 100%.  I've heard of people who use Gravity Evolution or a mermaid in the lake in Central Park.  ..If you need a spiritual experience try a movie called 'Sullivan's Travels' with Veronica Lake.
Think of the third step as a decision to follow through with the rest of the steps. If you have just finished step 3 it is time to launch into a vigorous course of action starting with a written inventory. What I suggest to people I work with is to set up an appointment with your sponsor to do your 5th step within a couple weeks. Rather than focusing on what you believe you are lacking focus on moving forward in the program. 
How do you define "god?" I found when working on step 3 that it was important to understand at the very least what god *wasn't*. In other words I traced a line around something that I couldn't understand...I came to the program an atheist. I suppose I'm still agnostic. I've had atheist friends tell me that god can't exist because there's war famine and starvation. Their definition of god requires that bad things not be allowed to happen. Other people say that god is a fraud because religion is a fraud. That's got it's own definition of god built into it too namely that god stands behind what everyone who claims to speak for god says...I really don't have any expectations for my god. I understand that the universe is a big place with a lot of moving parts and that my best shot at happiness is to find my spot in it and try to keep it tidy and well-lit. God gives me inner strength inner direction and a voice that speaks not to my self-centered way of seeing the world but to a larger truth that includes everyone and everything around me too. Do I know that there really exists such a force that fuels the universe and everything in it and which is available to me to tap into for strength and wisdom? Of course not because to any rational person that sounds ridiculous. However it might and when I adopt that attitude it makes a difference in me. So is the difference in me real? Or should I not believe in it?
I wrote this somewhere else in this sub but my idea of a high power is as follows:..I just think of all the great things in my life and realize that I'd have none of it if I was drunk. My houseplants my record collection my girlfriend my job all that fun stuff that makes my life worth living is my 'higher power'...It's not my higher power actively removing my short-comings it's my diligence to not drink and make my life better that is slowly eroding my short comings through natural (rather than Supernatural) means.
Someone in a meeting the other day said (and I'm sure this has been said to death but I'd never heard it) "if you're having trouble with God just add an o."..I liked that. ..Good is something I can get behind. Good is something I can be guided by. Good is something I can look for and believe in and feel changed by. So that's what I'm sticking with for now. 
A friend of mine who's worked the steps a few times struggled with this as well. So he found people that he believed in and had them for his higher power till he had his "spiritual awakening". At one point it was John Elway then Robert Downey Jr. The one that stuck the longest was an old man named Frank. Frank had attended the same meeting twice a week for 40 years had sponsored hundreds of people and never drank again. When ever I struggle with my high power I just think of Frank.  
I've always thought that evolution/natural selection could fit the bill as a Higher Power as something beyond ourselves which creates us and which presumably prefers and encourages organisms that don't poison themselves :-)..I'm not an atheist or a twelve-stepper but obviously have considered both and that was what I ended up concluding my Higher Power would probably be. Anyway just sharing :-)
I never had much struggle with this one but agree with yoyr sponser that willingess and "as I understand him/her/it" are a help...My HP concept lies comewhere between *the force* and the [gaia hypothesis](http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=gThe+Gaia+hypothesis&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5)
I'm an atheist. AA saved my life. I learned to stop arguing with the program and not to take things so literally. Look at these 12 steps and see if they help. .____________________________________________________________________________________________..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal. ..Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. .____________________________________________________________________________________________..&gt;my sponser says I'll get there as long as I have willingness)...In my humble opinion you are already there..
I made a decision in Step Three to turn my will and my life over to *whatever would take it.*..My conception of God is cobbled together from. . * Stranger In A Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. * Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Persig. * Principia Discordia by Malcalypse the Younger and Robert Anton Wilson..I realize that my authors are all named "Bob" so I choose to throw in a little Church Of The Subgenius for celestial spice too when needed - Man needs slack.  ..It's a great big universe out there or so they tell me and while I find it inconceivable that humans have managed to suss out the mind of God and place it in convenient book form for me to follow along I find it equally inconceivable that absolutely nothing in the universe is worthy of awe or veneration or contemplation...What is most important to me in my conception of God is that somewhere somehow there is a force outside of me that *cares* whether I suffer or not and a force within me that is capable of rendering me *useful* to those around me who I care about...It was those feelings of uselessness and self-pity (the "I don't give a fuck" and "nobody cares" mentalities) that I needed to erase and ultimately I had to reach outside myself to find them - hence the need to find a "god" of my understanding...What my 'god' has above all else is a sense of humor - and if you find the concept of a god 'silly' you can have a silly god if you wish...TL:DR - don't make a doorknob your higher power it will turn on you.
