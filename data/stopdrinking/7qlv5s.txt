Last night was a struggle since one of my good friends was in town. We had Italian food (my favorite) and he brought an EXCEPTIONAL bottle of red wine (also my favorite). But I stayed strong and had some grapefruit soda water which paired OK...I have had no desires or cravings to get drunk at all even though it's been a very difficult week. I even went out to a bar with some friends and got a tonic water. Wasn't tempted in the slightest. But MAN am I going to miss good red wine with dinner. If anything breaks me that's going to be it.

You're doing so great you won't throw that all away just for boring old wine... just remember that it's only the IDEA of wine that you like not the reality of hangovers feeling out of control and constantly worrying about keeping a buzz or how you're going to get home. iwndwyt x
