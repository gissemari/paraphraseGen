We're glad that you're here and still looking for support. We do have to remove this post as you admit drinking tonight. [From our FAQ:](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_post_only_while_sober.)..&gt; **Post only while sober.**..&gt; We recognize that many people spend months "lurking" this subreddit while drinking. You are welcome to read as much as you'd like while not sober. However for the sake of everyone here and for the sake of your own recovery please only post or comment when you're sober. "Sober" means "not currently intoxicated or under the influence in any way."
