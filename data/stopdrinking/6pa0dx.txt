I've been trying to quit for years and a couple weeks ago I started an IOP program. Went on vacation this weekend and drank mad and disappointed in myself. I took a vacation from recovery too I didn't call anyone I didn't go to a meeting it wasn't even on my mind. Well back on the horse and I let my sponsor and counselor know I'll just keep trying. Best of luck to everyone.

That's the best thing you can do right now. Keep moving forward. I saw a post recently that said "if all you can do is crawl forward start crawling." Some days we are human some days mistakes are made I know I made a lot of them before I straightened up and got my shit together. It happens and it sounds like you have the right attitude :) I won't drink with you today.
