The biggest thing I've noticed thus far is my lack of work frustrations.  I don't feel as stressed out and edgy as I did three weeks ago...I've had a couple temptations.  I quietly stopped drinking so my partner suggested that we go grab some beer the other night.  I quickly told him I'm not drinking anymore and that was that...Weekdays have never really been much of a concern for me.  I've always relapsed on weekends.  NASCAR is back now so I'm pretty pumped.  Looking forward to spending my weekends repairing / updating our properties and watching racing.
