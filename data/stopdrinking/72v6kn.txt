Today marks my second year of sobriety though part of me wants to make this some kinda status for the world to know and give me kudos. Another part of me feels a little ashamed or upset like this shouldn't be something to brag about or talk about... Only because I still have that underline feeling of "why can't I just be normal?"..Addiction is hard whether it's to drugs or alcohol or even food. It's a hard struggle to actually want to quit your coping mechanism. I spent a long time blacking out just to sleep away my personal demons. A lot of nights naked and crying over the dumbest things. Then one day I started to realize I wasn't doing anything productive I wasn't doing anything that made me happy. ..It's been 730 days since I've last drank I have had my moments of accomplishments since then. Granted I'm not fully satisfied with my life but I don't think anyone ever really is. I'm still trying to rid myself of that alcoholic mind set of all or nothing. So In this moment I am proud of myself. I may not have my life at where it should be but I'll try my best to remember the accomplishments I have made
