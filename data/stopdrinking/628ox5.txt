I am so incredibly proud of myself!  I made it to 30 days (the longest in over two years!).  This is such a feat for me.  I couldn't have done it without this community.  The best part is I have no desire to relapse still!  I've changed my whole lifestyle (eating healthy hobbies) and it's made all the difference.  Thank you!

Yay well done.
That is a big deal you should feel proud! 
I'm proud of you too!  Way to go.  I won't drink with you today.
Always cool to achieve something you hadn't done in two years!  Congratulations. 
Congratulations!  I will be there soon!
Congrats!! I could have written this myself. I havent gone this long without a drink for 2 years and the only reason why it wasnt longer than that is because I was 9 months pregnant then! It feel so good to be sober!
30 days is kick ass.  Congrats!
Well done! I'm right behind you.
Right behind you too. Longest streak in about 20 years and not much of a desire to drink. It is literally a miracle. 
Congrats!
