Today started okay but had strong urge to pick it up again while at work. After all the legal issues I'm facing I should be grateful I still have a boss who wants to keep me on the team and I am. The real life struggle started though. Realizing that nothing will be the same and my loss of license for a good while will make seeing my girlfriend and others difficult. I know she believes in me and wants to see me succeed but I really shouldn't focus so much on that. I need to stay on the road to recovery and remind myself that I still have a lot to struggle against and I need to do this for myself. But for another day I can say IWNDWYT.
