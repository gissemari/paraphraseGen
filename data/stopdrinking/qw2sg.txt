[The Head and the Heart - Lost In My Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjoA4nYBD5U&ob=av2e)..People seem to have a lot of different interpretations of this song. I dont think the song is about addiction but it does seem to reflect my own struggles as of late. And well has made me feel better not just because I like the song it just rings true in some way ... so I thought I would share.
