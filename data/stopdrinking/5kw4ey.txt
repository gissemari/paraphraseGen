This is my fifth day after a 2 year relapse.  I've been a part of SD for awhile under various names but continue to lose my passwords because I can't remember them due to drinking. I'm hoping this is the last username I'll ever need...Today I will not drink.

Proud of you. Not drinking with you today -LaughingDog-
Welcome back :).
Ha I'm the same with thinking with password and numbers.  I can barely read when it's bad.  Gl we are close in days.
Haha I can totally relate to the password thing. God knows how many times I had to reset my bank account password. The good news is that if you stay sober you will still forget passwords but you won't do it nearly as often!
I won't drink with you as well. Day five here as well. Let's do this Laughing Dog...And this is my third username I have for this subedit but the second one chronologically.
