I'm so proud of myself this is the longest I've been sober in just over a year. The first week was so hard I was so anxious but the good news is I never want to get drunk again or it would of all been for nothing. To anyone struggling it does get better I promise.

Way to go Neptune. The days just keep adding up if I let them. ..You are already into the third week!
Congrats on 16 - one day at a time - I will not drink with you today.

Awesome! 
Congrats on 15 days.  I'm proud of you too!  I won't drink with you today.
I also have 16 days sober and feel so proud of myself too.  I've had to learn about triggers and how to handle them; I've also been really tired for no particular reason.  A great help has been attending SMART meetings.  Congratulations Neptune 23456!
Congrats! You're on a great journey to a better and healthier life. I will not drink with you today.
I'm right there with ya Neptune! Let's do this! 
Awesome.  Keep going it gets so much easier.
