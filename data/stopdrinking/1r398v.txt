**Update**: I came clean to him via email and then we had a long talk last night. I cried a *lot* which was weird for me but also cathartic. I told him more than I had initially planned because he asked me questions and I didn't want to lie. But not everything. I didn't feel able to volunteer everything all at once. He said he loves me and wants to support me. ..I'll be honest it wasn't totally awesome. I could tell he was still thinking about it and processing it and he was not that comfortable with me which broke my heart a little. But I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Telling him was this huge barrier in my mind to quitting. So whatever happens I'm really glad I got it done. Thank you for your thoughts and feedback. I really really appreciate the time and patience shown to the newbies struggling with their first few weeks sober. Y'all rock!...****************************************..Possibly pertinent details: I'm early 30s he is early 40s. Dating about a year and a half. Neither of us are the greatest communicators in the world but we have a very peaceful and loving relationship. We've spent lots of time together sober and lots of time together where I've been secretly drunk. He drinks regularly but (as far as I can tell) has no problem with his relationship to alcohol....I was a closet drinker   I would have several drinks before going to his house or sneak drinks while he was out of the room. When we were at sporting events I would tell him I was going to the bathroom and get in the beer line then chug it before heading back to our seats. I sometimes carried a flask in my purse. When I went overboard I know he could tell I was drunk but he would say things like  how did you get drunk off 2 beers?  (which is what he *saw* me drink). I really think he has no idea the extent to which I drank. ...I've been feeling really good in sobriety so far but I need to tell him that I've quit   not only to explain my behavior but also because I need his support. I need to explain that I won't be drinking anymore and I feel like he deserves to know **why**. But I am terrified *terrified* of telling him about the deception I pulled. ...I figure I have a few options:..* Tell him that I am not drinking for a reason that is true but not the whole truth (e.g.  I'm not drinking because I've become dependent on it. ). My plan would be in time as I work on sobriety (and possibly work the steps haven't decided) that I would tell him the full extent of my hidden drinking. I feel like this is a somewhat cowardly way out but one that I can handle right now. ..* The other option would be to go full disclosure. Here's the thing about that. On the one hand I think it would be a huge relief to have all the cards on the table and be totally honest with him. On the other hand I'm so freaking emotional right now that I'm crying as I type this. I don't know that I could handle rejection or a fight or even a sideways look at this point. ..So all of you great people out there with more sobriety under your belt do you have any advice? Other options? I'd really appreciate it...TL;DR - Worried about revealing the full extent of my hidden drinking to my SO..

If you don't tell him the details will he still support you? Or would he feel that you were overreacting?
There's a middle ground.  Maybe tell him you want to quit; your drinking is causing you anxiety.  You'd like to explain more but you're too emotional about it right now.  Perhaps as you feel stronger you can talk more about it.  I don't think you have to either hide information or unload everything at once.  You could tell him you want to tell him everything but take it at your own pace.

Sounds like he's a great guy don't be nervous about talking to him! It doesn't have to be a full confessional either like Marjin said. just a "I don't like how alcohol affects me and I'm giving it up" is good enough for now. Welcome good luck! 
Get yourself signed up at a gym.  Start working out.  Not only will this help you quit drinking but your "health kick" can be about physical fitness which is not compatible with drinking.  Not sure if I'd actually encourage you to lie to your partner but if he sees you working out and you also mention you're not drinking he'll assume the two things go together.  And really working out will help you recover from the drink too... so win win?
I find the best way is to keep it to myself. It's just too much pressure otherwise. People will eventually start to see the difference.
I went through the exact same thing before I told my boyfriend (now husband). He surprised me by saying "yeah I was getting worried about your drinking and I was thinking about saying something" (non-confrontational Midwesterners ftw). He also immediately offered to quit drinking too in solidarity and was 100% supportive of me going to as many AA meetings as I needed to. I didn't have to tell him the extent of my secret drinking or any of the gory details because he accepted that I had a problem and was happy I was doing something about it...For me even though I was so terrified of disappointing or blindsiding him and embarrassing myself it was a really important step in making my decision real. I'd done a few stints of sobriety in secret and they never lasted. I kept it a secret because I wasn't ready to be accountable to anyone. Telling my boyfriend "I realized I have a problem with alcohol and I'm going to start going to AA to deal with it" made me feel like I was making a real commitment to unfuck my life and be a better partner to him and better human in general...And on a basic level I was so certain about needing to get sober that I was honestly willing to risk any reaction from him even him leaving me.  There was no way our relationship was going to survive my quickly worsening alcoholism anyway -- he barely drinks and was becoming too much of an impediment my drinking and I was eventually going to cheat on him or tell one lie too many or do some other horrible thing. The worst case scenario -- he freaks out and breaks up with me because I'm an alcoholic -- was going to happen anyway if I didn't get serious about sobriety. ..If your bf is already saying "how did you get so drunk off two beers" my guess is he might already know more than he lets on. If you're doing AA you should just tell him what's up! He sounds like a good guy and I think he'll be happy for you. ..Otherwise are you going to be having to tell white lies about where you are when you're at meetings or working with your sponsor? What about when you start experiencing all the big wonderful messy mind-blowing changes that come along with early sobriety wouldn't you like to share those with him or at least not have to hide them? ..
Not recovered but have been inspired by my counselor on this same action. The first question I have is are you considering/have started seeking support for the issue? ..The most important thing you can do is to to tell it honestly and from a factual perspective. What I mean by this is instead of "I drank because of X Y and Z and kept it from you because of A" you should be saying "I am realizing that my drinking is beyond my control. I realize that I am not like people who can have a drink or two in a night and be satisfied. I want you to know the truth and I will do A B and C in order to make sure it doesn't become a long term problem." ..The truth is once you provide this kind of transparency it IS beyond your control on how they personally choose to deal with it. If you have or started to reach for a solution it will help you in more ways than you can imagine. They may see the effort and understand what it really is and their love for you will significantly outweigh the negative thoughts that you are scared of. If they won't support you when you are honest and show them that you are doing something about it then that is not somebody that you want to be with. A harsh conclusion but their love for you will show itself in its raw form when all the cards are on the table. Best of luck to you. An update I'm sure will be very appreciated.
My advice? Tell him but not yet.  ..At 2 days you're still at the "say" stage. The problem with that is credibility. Frankly we don't have much at this early in our recovery. If you tell him now and backslide your credibility gets damaged even more. By adding some "do" to the "say" you strengthen your position.  ..Wait 10 days. Wait for the fog to lift. Then you can go to him and say "I've known for a while that alcohol has been a problem for me. I decided 10 days ago that I needed to put it behind me and I have been sober ever since. I didn't want to tell you in case I failed this time but now I know I can do this and I really need your support."  ..This way you are both asking for his help and sharing a triumph. In addition it gives you a target to shoot for 10 days of sobriety. It's a goal....something to focus on. As well this recovery needs to be about you I couldn't have attempted recovery for anyone but ME.  ..And in the unlikely event that you do backslide you will be right where you are now and will have lost nothing. You can tell him then.    
I was exactly like you: sneaking drinks when he was out on the porch or in the shower when out..I'd find a way to get to the bar quick to pound a shot by saying I was going to the bathroom hiding alcohol in my purse.  ..Then I started getting lazy and he started catching on to my drunk or drinking look and just knew but I'd still lie and say I took a benadryl or some other stupid lie...I flat out told him what was going on on my day one even though I was hungover shaking and vomiting secretly in the bathroom and he said he knew the whole time.  Made me feel horrible but as a part of my sobriety I promised never to lie to him again and we've never been better.  He is the best support when I need to vent or cry or send him a picture of my sober counter app with pride.  And when he says "baby I'm so proud of you!" I know he means it and I can never lie to him again.  It makes my heart swell...That's just me.  I did these things and I have to own up to them..
Working the steps gives you opportunity to address these milestones in a timely and orderly fashion. When you are ready you will feel it. First get right with yourself and your need for sobriety. Find the help you need from people who know about alcoholism.
