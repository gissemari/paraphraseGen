I haven't posted for awhile but I visit this subreddit almost everyday. I can't believe it's been six months--it seems like both shorter and longer than that at the same time. In some ways I can't even imagine the dark place I was in before I quit but I at the same time I'm very aware that I'm only one drink away from being back there. But that reality doesn't scare me like it used to and I feel really happy- even joyful. Thank you all for being a part of this amazingly supportive community. I clearly remember in my early days (this part makes it seem like yesterday) seeing the posts of three months six months one year etc and feeling envious. But you know if you are early-in and struggling that CAN be you and it WILL be you in three months six months...one day at a time <3

Congrats!! You give me strength to go for 6 months! 1 down so far :)
Congrats on 6 months! 
Great job thats awesome. i know what you mean about those first days. I used to think 3 months was out of my reach and only other people could make it that far. Agree also on the support of SD being amazing. There is nothing like being around other people 24 hours a day that understand and can identify with you. Feels so much less lonely...Keep going you are doing great !!!
6 months kicks ass..Congratulations!
Congrats on 6 months.  What is the best change in your life since being sober?  I won't drink with you today.
