Good work on this /u/embryonic_journey -- thanks for sharing the link.
Well no need to feel alone!  :-)
I heard a report on the radio today about the AUDrates for women.  The author's position is that women unreasonably label themselves as alcoholics due to the binge drinking culture in collage and carrying that behavior in to later decades.  She believes women just need to "break the habit" and they can then moderate...I nearly lost my voice screaming at the radio - I tried the moderation route and it took me a year to get back her and back to sober.  Do I wish that I could drink in moderation like a "normal" person?  Yes.  I probably always will.  But I know that doesn't work for me.
