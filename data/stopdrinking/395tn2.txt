I was sober for 8 months and decided to drink one night in celebration and haven't stopped since I have bottles hidden everywhere and no one knows about it and I feel like shit about it ..The rationalization I have is that people like me more when I am drunk after a couple of drinks I am no longer an introvert and actually speak my mind I  had a sober life and started working out and doing everything right but still remained an introvert drinking is my solution for me being me I just don't know how to do it without alcohol...This was my progress when I got sober .http://imgur.com/2HcvVPu.http://imgur.com/8QSxJzx.Now I am looking like the before again ..No one in my family knows that I have relapsed and I really do not want them to know but I just sincerely have lost all motivation to get sober. I really need some brutal honesty dont hold anything back I need the slap in the face.

Start reading books on charisma and practice talking to strangers do interesting things with your life so you have interesting things to talk about.  Be an interesting person that's interested in other people.  Don't worry about the opinions of others worry about your opinion of yourself others will see that and follow.  As far as a slap in the face goes it will only work if it comes from yourself.  
you're hiding them because you either need to hide them from someone or your hiding them from yourself imho. Either way you know what you're doing is unacceptable...&gt;people like me more when I am drunk..bullshit you think they do because your inhibitions and ability to empathise are fucked where you're drunk...&gt;after a couple of drinks I am no longer an introvert and actually speak my mind..then you need to work on yourself introversion is not cured by drinking drinking will lull you into the idea people like you while separating you from the world and then killing you...Nobody said dealing with life and dealing with yourself is easy but it is worth it.. just like your fitness regime there are no short cuts is fucking hard work. take a look at my badge im back at day 2 now because i had a drink at the weekend. the fallout from that is still happening but i'm going to rebuild and learn from it. I don't know if you are a member of any support groups but i have found them extremely useful with dealing with myself and the reasons i drank addressing the insecurities social anxiety feelings of worthlessness et al.. there are quite a few about i recommend trying a few and seeing what works for you...Make no mistake if you carry on like this its only going one way into the ground or into a pot on a shelf somewhere.
