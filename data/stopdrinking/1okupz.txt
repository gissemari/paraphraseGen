A user on this sub messaged me after I had not posted for a week and it may have kept me from a relapse. Think about that for a second A complete stronger sent me a message asking if I was ok and that they noticed I had been away from the page for a week. I'm a random user on a subreddit full of people but this person noticed. I'm withholding their username out of privacy but to them I say THANK YOU...This subreddit has been my biggest source of motivation and inspiration. I have been active since day 1 and it has gotten me to day 69. Yet 7 days ago I stopped posting.....Why? I don't know but I'm sure that it had something to do with my brain slowly justifying a way out. Something along the lines of I don't NEED to post anymore which I'm sure that would have brought me to saying I don't NEED to not drink. Maybe Maybe not. Either way I'm back and I couldn't be happier...This is the most supportive subreddit something I'm sure you've all read before but it crossed a threshold today. Today it separated itself from a subreddit to a true group that I support and am supported by. Someone broke the internet boundary and for whatever reason brought me to a personal connection with random usernames. ..I thank you all and specifically the one who messaged me. I'm a 26 year old male in the Navy I do not show my emotions often especially on such an open forum but that message hit me right in the feel and I intend to share that feeling and use it to inspire the rest of this community and to help others keep fighting their specific fight...Stay Strong Stay Sober..

Beautiful. This should serve a reminder to everyone about how much a kind word asking somebody how they are doing or going just a little bit out of our way to be nice can change somebody's life. Sure reminded me. Thanks for the post brother.
Pass this onto someone when you get a gut feeling. That's how we share our recovery with another :) You can be the next one to help someone.
Happy to hear from you again and grateful to the person who gave you the nudge. 
Great reminder.  
Great post.  Glad you're still sober.  Thank you for your service.
This is so awesome!..[A year ago I wrote this:](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ypks3/how_to_get_yourself_to_200_days_maybe_more_even/)..&gt;**Get Involved**..&gt;If you've got 1 day sober you're ready to start giving advice. If you don't have anything insightful or profound to say a simple "I feel ya man" to let someone know you understand goes a long way. I feel a certain connection with the people who started out around the same time I did. We went through the same things at the same time. We supported each other. When someone disappeared for a week we'd send PM's asking "Everything OK?" A lot of these people are having their own 200 day anniversaries right about now. I can't help but think that the sense of community here on /r/stopdrinking has something to do with that...*WTF did offtherocks just quote himself?*..Um yeah I guess so.  [That guy's arrogance knows no bounds.](http://i.imgur.com/I7qO34v.jpg) ..This is exactly what recovery is all about. I made your whole post the sidebar's "quote of the moment." I hope you don't mind.  I'm really happy for you.
So fucking beautiful. That's love.
This post made my day. Thank you anonymous friend and thank you BP for sharing this. ..THIS is the interdependency which is the glue (and higher power for me) of a support group such as this. I too find myself thinking about people that I've noted haven't been around for a few days and I wonder if everything is okay. Ive thought about PMing a time or two. Fortunately those people ended up posting so I didn't wonder anymore but next time I'm just gonna message when I wonder the first time.  I call or text people IRL that are in my groups that pop up in my head for seemingly random reasons (a few I don't even know well at all..just have their numbers from asking) and 9/10 times it was just what they needed right then. If gut instinct works IRL why not here right?
Awesome!
:) yay. 
If I would get to day one of this sub i would be so thankful
