I haven't drank for about 5 days now. I used to binge drink every other night like it was the last day on earth. Fast forward to about 15 years later I really began to see the problems that my drinking has caused me. So it has been a struggle this year to even slow my intake. I moved back in with my parents to finish my degree. My parents are huge alcoholics and in denial about their drinking. Yet I had no other place to go. Everything is fine here if you drink but when you don't you realize what a shitshow this house is. And so that is another reason I keep drinking as I was going to school. Last week I woke up swollen and out of breath. My heart felt really weird and my blood pressure was through the roof. It scared me. So I knew my party days were done. I stopped cold turkey which I know can be dangerous in itself..Yet I am surprised that I don't have the shakes or intense anxiety that I was anticipating..However I am having the worst headaches I have ever had in my life! ..We're talking nausea and constant pain in my head! From morning to night my forehead (mostly on the left side) is throbbing with pain! .Has anyone experienced this?.. I am not prone to migraines but I known this has something to do with not drinking almost every night..It kills! .Thoughts?

nobody here should be giving you medical advice.  please see a doctor.  
Withdrawal symptoms usually peak within the first  week after drinking. I drank on a similar schedule to you and had high BP headaches chest pains crazy insomnia for the first week and a half. It's gone now (I'm at day 20). Hang in there it will get better emotional and physically.
