After three weeks visiting parents to plan for my sobriety I relapsed after flying home. I stopped drinking again two days ago. ..I'm already on voluntary short-term leave from work where I've been for about 17 years...When I'm visiting my parents I have zero cravings but when I come back it's intense. My goal coming back was to get into an Intensive Outpatient Program but I didn't even make it that far. Part of my problem is that I'm alone up here with zero close friends or family...Other than being alone I'm not at all unhappy and my career is fantastic. However I'm now wondering whether moving back to my home town and being near my parents sister (and other family) plus a close friend is my best chance for sobriety...Fortunately I have another month to decide. I hope that writing this will help keep me sober for long enough to finish researching places to get treatment.

Glad you are here; you will find so much support and wisdom here.  It is really good that you are asking these questions and being so considerate with your planning for sobriety.  That planning and having the right strategy has been the difference for me so far this time around.
Welcome back we saved your seat. I hated the idea of going to rehab/detox after the first few days there and now looking back - LOVED IT. Best gift I had given myself in years. I got my mind back I understood what was going on and they gave me tools to keep the sobriety they helped me obtain...High Five
Are you familiar with HALT? Hungry angry lonely tired? All triggers. Work a plan for each instance. Working for me. Be well. I won't be drinking with you today!
