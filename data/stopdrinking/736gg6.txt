After couple of days when I felt very happy and was in good mood yesterday was different. I was overwhelmed don't really know the reason. So yesterday was the day when a new person moved into my student's house. First conversation was nice but I had thoughts about my (past) ritual called "welcome drinking". I was almost ready to propose grabbing some beers. Then when I was being alone I fantasised about alcohol. I had relapse thoughts. Today after I woke up I feel like the "evening me" was different person. I'm glad.

Thanks for sharing. Stay strong
That's the way to work through a trigger.  And the other side of it is so worth it right ?  
Well done on staying strong. I will not drink with you today!
Good on you for not falling for the con man...The pink cloud comes and goes. It's OK. Normal life is feeling up and down good and bad. Hyped and "just so." Part of things being [special](https://i.imgur.com/XcLRYOJ.jpg). ..I'm not drinking with you today
Well done for not drinking. I have the same feelings as you in terms off being two different people morning and night. It's strange hey..!?.But every morning I'm grateful I did not drink the night before 
Great victory. The cravings will come but more importantly they will go!! Congrats on 19 days - you are doing well!!! I will not drink with you today.
It sounds like you are responsible for welcoming this new addition and helping integrate him or her into your whole housing scenario which is overwhelming! Sometimes we don't even notice the emotional burdens we take on but they affect us just the same. Great job navigating through it.
