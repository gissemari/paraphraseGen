A year and four months ago my world was falling apart inside and out. I had shut myself off from the world and screwed over so many people that I had essentially no real friends. Today is my birthday and it's filled with so much love and gratidude. ..I've received so many birthday wishes from so many of the beautiful people in my life and i realized that today I have love and friendship that I didn't even know existed. If you're struggling please keep putting one foot in front of the other! Keep reaching out and getting honest with those around you because all of the hard work pain and dedication will pay off with a wonderful life oozing with gratitude and love.  ..Edit: grammar and whatnot

Wishing you a wonderful happy birthday!  The gift of sobriety makes all the gifts of love and compassion even richer.  ..I will happily celebrate your birthday by not drinking with you today!
Cheers for honesty.  If I hadn't told my SO I wouldn't have made it this far.  Accountability is key.  
Happy Birthday! 
Happy Happy Birthday and 496 days Celestrialvx!
Happy birthday!   And thanks for sharing. 
How did you go about forging new relationships? I have destroyed a lot of my friendships due to my drinking and am feeling very lonely (probably how you felt a year and four months ago)...Happy birthday! You're an inspiration :) 
Happy Birthday!
