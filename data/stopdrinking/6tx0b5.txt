Well its only day 3 and I'm learning that checking in here is just as important as reading (which is how I got here in the first place and not a moment too soon). I realize i'm not alone with all you wonderful people and while all our stories are unique they all also have common threads. I have learned to stop comparing myself to others my rock bottom isn't yours and while others certainly have it "worse" than I ever have thats just more of a reason for me to contribute and learn. ..As you can see from previous posts my struggles other than the obvious one (booze) so far has been dealing with past decisions and hurting people I care about. Luckily I haven't ruined any relationships yet but I have scared people and hurt my reputation. My new question is this: I have heard people (those who do the 12 steps which aren't for me but more power to you) say that directly apologizing for past transgressions helps. For others its been changing your behavior going forward and "apologizing through your actions." I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on these ideas. I'm not looking for one is "better" or not obviously its all individual. Right now i'm in the stage where even thinking about past drunken moments (the ones I can remember anyway) give me what I call the "shame shudders" and the idea of apologizing to some people like my parents is terrifying. Just love to hear others stories. Thanks to everyone here you are all amazing and I am humbled by ever story I see here including those of you struggling you can do it and so I can. I will not drink with you today.

In my experience I have felt it better to prove myself through actions to my wife. When I was drinking I must have told her a thousand times before how sorry I was for this and that but each time I'd mess it up again. Now even though it's only been a week she can see that I'm a changed person by my actions. She knows now that I mean it through my willingness to do things I only promised to do while I was drinking. In the last week we haven't fought and I've finally felt like a good husband and father for the first time in a long time. ..Good luck!
