Hello SD! Day one inductee here. I apologize for the wall-o-text here but this exercise has been very therapeutic for me. ..My back-story: I was a non-drinker all of my life all the way up to my 30s. I became a  social drinker  when I got married at 33. I was laid-off from my dream job back in September of 2012. I was crushed. I was depressed. I was humiliated. The future I had planned was in ruins. My own solution was to start drinking nightly to numb the emotional discomfort and calm my demons so I could sleep. I was never a day-drinker at all   which I found weird. I only drank at night. I went through several Full-time and Contracted jobs through the past 5 years looking for the  right fit  that would make me as happy as the job I had been laid-off from in 2012. I needed to find the gig that would make me happy and able to provide well for my wife and 2 boys. I felt that I was bringing my  A-Game  to whatever position I was working. The feedback said otherwise. Whether it was a loose-fit to my skillset or the fog that I felt every morning my performance was often lacking and my heart really wasn't in it. I never really felt the  fit  I was craving either. I had become hollow empty   a shell of the person I *thought* I was...At the peak of my consumption I would come home from work with a  *gee that was a rough day*  attitude and pour myself 5-6 ounces of whiskey and mix it with ginger ale cola or whatever was handy. I'd then pour **ANOTHER** 5-6 ounces of whiskey before bedtime and drink that straight on the rocks (didn't want the extra liquid to keep me up all night going to the bathroom 3-4 times). This was the pattern whether it was a weekday or weekend. Day in. Day out. For 5 years...Fast-forward to about 6 months ago. I found this sub and realized that the one thing I had not changed about myself or my habits since being laid-off was my drinking. I decided then that I needed to quit. I lurked in this sub constantly for an approach that resonated with me. I found that the HAMS method really spoke to my thought process and sounded like a more logical safe approach. At my age the risk of experiencing withdrawal was enough of a concern to consider tapering. The first thing I did was calculate exactly how much I was consuming every day. I was shocked. I did the math again   same answer. There was NO way I was drinking **10-12 ounces a DAY**! Really?! Nuh-uh! What-the-actual-hell?! Shit. With the help of the success stories in this sub I started mentally visualizing myself as a non-drinker. I started thinking about how good I would feel about myself without alcohol clouding my perception. I started thinking about how much clearer I would be able to think in the mornings (again). How much more productive I would be at my job. How much money I would save! ..My next step was to cut back and eliminate the first-round of drinks I had every day. I decided to replace the first 5-6 ounces of whiskey I had been having every day with 2 beers. Additionally I pushed the time I began consuming alcohol to past 9:00 in the evening. As easy as that sounds I still experienced some withdrawal: sugar cravings headaches lethargy etc. I stayed the course and maintained this pattern until I knew I was ready to pick a day to  start stopping . A couple of months ago I landed a great gig. I was really excited about this new start. I used that energy to help me pick a date to start stopping: January 1st. Yeah it seemed trite. Yeah it seemed clich . In my mind it was a date. A date I needed. My date. ..I knew from my calculations that I was consuming 2 beers and 4 1.5-oz shots of whiskey per night. On January 1st I consumed 2 beers and 3 1.5-oz shots. The next night: 2 beers and 2 shots and so on. At this point I viewed the alcohol as  medicine  that was helping me reach my goal of not needing it any longer. I repeated the pattern until I hit the night where I was consuming 2 beers and 1 shot. I repeated that pattern a second night because I felt like I needed just one night to level-out. The next night I drank NO hard alcohol for the first day in over 5 years. The next 2 nights I drank 2 beers then one. Finally last night was the first night I have not consumed **ANY** alcohol in over 5 years. I'm not going to lie it hasn't been easy. The cravings are still pretty strong. Kudzu supplements have helped calm them tremendously. I know I still have a **LONG** way to go. As most folks on here I'm taking things one day at a time. I am prepared for good days   and will relish those. I'm prepared for bad days but I have a supportive SO and an excellent vision in my mind of who I really want to be. If my story helps **ONE** person take the step toward sobriety I will be humbly grateful. I have been SO inspired by the success stories (and relapses/resets) shared here. The support I've obtained here is immeasurable. MY purpose in sharing is to get this out to you my brethren &amp; sisters in sobriety that you have another soldier in this battle. I will not drink with you today...

Welcome welcome! Thanks for sharing. I'll stay sober with you today :)
A man with a plan!  Good luck to you and keep us posted!
Welcome.  Courage to you on your journey ahead.
Right on brother. Well written and inspiring post. You got this. I got this. We got this. I will not drink with you today. *Feels good to type/say that!!
I'm starting tapering today for the same reasons you mentioned.  I normally drink hard liquor but don't trust myself to taper w/ it.  I bought a 12 pack of beer that I don't particularly care for &amp; am drinking 1 every 1.5 hours.  Tomorrow I'm shooting for 1 every 3 hours. (I drank considerably more than you though).  I can't wait to get to 24 hours sober you're a motivation! .
