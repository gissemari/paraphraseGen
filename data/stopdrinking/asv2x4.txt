Hi SD-  ...It's been a real struggle to keep my newly found sobriety to myself feeling like a dark secret that had slowly been coming between us and he could sense something was off.  ...It was well received no questions or accusations.  Just "ok thank you!"  ...When do the stress levels go down?  I have a lot of stress and anxiety and I'm coping how I can.    ...&amp;#x200B;

I'm in the same boat. Just curious what did you say to him? I'm struggling to find the right words. Last night he came home from our favorite bottle shop with several high gravity beers for us and I had to make myself go to bed at like 7:30 pm to avoid it. I want him to be more cognizant but don't know how.
