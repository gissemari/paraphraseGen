We're from all walks of life.  ..We come here and read about other people's lives struggles setbacks successes joys sorrows...it's all here. And we leave knowing something more about ourselves and others. ..This place is fertilizer for compassion.  ...A quick note on my recent thoughts and interactions:..When I'm asked how long I've gone without drinking I say that it's been "(xamount) days".  ..Not "a few weeks". .Not "a couple of months". ..I say it with certainty. ..Some stop there while others ask how I'm feeling. I like having a door open to discuss with frankness how the effects of being sober contrast greatly with the effects of living "functionally". It reinforces the foundation of my discipline. ..I know eventually the discussion of my drinking will become a thing of the past. I'll be the former drinker the non drinker. But for now I am in infancy. My tool box is sparse. And I'm having to hand carve my tools. ..I just finished a new tool. Saying "No" without wavering. My fianc  asked if we should pick up wine or beer for Thanksgiving guests who *might* be stopping by(mostly neighbors coming by for a slice of pie). I said "No".  All but one guest who will be attending the entirety of our dinner is a person who does not drink(at least four of us are alcoholics). I have built this fortress for my first sober Thanksgiving. I'm so thankful it includes the people I love most and who have supported me. ..I'm really thankful for everyone here. Thank you from the bottom to the top of my heart. .
