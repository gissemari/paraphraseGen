It's to the point it's reoccuring. I'm In a social setting and I find myself having the first drink and in my mind I hear myself say .."I guess I haven't changed and I'm doing this again it won't be so bad if I just have one."..I'd understand if I was struggling in my daily sobriety but I feel I'm doing great and keeping busy and hit meeting daily. I haven't felt in danger of drinking since February.  ..The thought of me slipping in my dreams freaks me out because I have no control there and I seem to just go with it.

Have you guys tried meditation before bed? 
Drinking dreams go away; especially if you are working a recovery program and filling you thinking with sober ideas notions plans and ambitions.
