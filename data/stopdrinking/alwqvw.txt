Had a struggle with being stressed out when I left work.  Out of habit I automatically took this one route home that I always take so that I can stop by the liquor store.  Before I got there I called a friend that I made last night at my 1st ever AA meeting and had him talk to me until I got home... It's a pretty big personal victory for me because I realize I haven't developed any methods of coping with stress while sober. I was already making  excuses and selling myself lies to justify it in my head. I really really wanted to break. I'm still not even sure why I called my friend and stead but I know that tomorrow morning I will be glad I did.

Nice work!
That's huge. Getting to talk to someone from AA is great. If no one pick up phone then get on here. We listen. Alcohol tricks us. A few days or weeks go by and drinking alcohol seems fine again. Like   hey it's okay it's just a few. Lots of people have a few.  But that's a lie. Because it hasn't been that way for us for years. We know and remind each other. IWNDWYT. 
Once you get the new coping strategies in place it will be easier to turn to those. Best of luck!
I make three years on Sunday. It IS doable. ..Take it moment by moment. Don't have a drink right now. Keep telling yourself that. 
Way to go! Stay strong friend.  
thats the best thing we can do is  ring somone or distract our self from the urge to drink i find walking until im really tired then sleeping it off helps. keeping some soft drinks too i skull them down of a hot cup of tea takes that thirst away! good job on day three im on day five and i feel so much better than on day 1-4. IWNDWYT friend! :)
