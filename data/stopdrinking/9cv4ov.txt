After a really long period of relapse I had a few good days and then one of my friends came to visit from out of town. She parties and has for years and seems to keep it together well but I do not. I just realized that I cannot live like that because it only leads to forgotten nights anxiety and feeling like hell.   ...I have started to take an inventory of all the bad things I have done while drinking started to actually consider what habits I need to setup to be able to make it long term. The longest I have been able to get to this year is 6 and a half months and I want to make it longer now. All I can say is that I won't drink today but I will not just be focused on today but on the habits that can keep me going long term.

Identifying triggers was huge to me.  It was easier to stop them before they started.  By the time I was drooling for a beer it was basically too late.   Great job on identifying that and I won't drink with you today!
Comparing my insides (thoughts and feelings) to another's outsides (a portion of their day's actions) will always lead me to disappointment in myself.  I don't know their struggles or how hungover they might feel after drinking.  I only know how it makes me feel = cumulatively worse and worse.  So I've stopped drinking to make my insides and outside a better place to be.
