Hey SD felt compelled to post something on here. This will be long I apologize in advance. Huge thanks to /u/SpiritWolfie for making an effort to troubleshoot with me on a previous post. It was because of them that I came back here every night....So this month has had it's up and downs with lots of previous triggers. I knew this going into it and in fact was the reason I wanted to start my journey when I did. Here were a few of my trigger points some unforeseen and some expected....**Triggers:**...* *March Madness:* I'm a big sports fan and typically I love to have a beer or scotch when I'm watching. These games usually go all day so in the past it's given me a solid excuse to start drinking at 12pm and not stop until it's all over....* *School:* I'm wrapping up my term at school so that means test/projects/papers. Traditionally after finishing a paper (or having one to calm myself to write it) I would partake in drinking. Usually I would work hard on all my stuff and then binge after I was done as if to say: "Hey you deserve this". Not this time....* *Relationship/Friendship isolation:* The girl I was romantically linked to and I had a major blowout I chose to go non-contact and it's been really hard for me to cope. In conjunction with that I don't have many friends (ie: none) living here in the same province with me so alcohol has always been an escape. I decided to try to talk more to my classmates instead. It's still extremely lonely and I think I'll be reaching out for some professional help instead of turning to the bottle...* *Miscarriage:* My sister was pregnant and I was so very excited to be an uncle. We all thought she was in the clear past 20 weeks but turns out she was not. It's been hard to try to comfort her and her partner (who's a big drinker so every time I was there he was pounding the beers) and juggle all my other internal struggles. I was tempted once but I thought better of it...**Areas of improvement:** While I have chosen not to drink and have been successful that doesn't mean I've been perfect. I just want to jot out some things I would like to improve upon and see how I feel once I reach other milestones in my sobriety. ...* *Anxiety/Sleep/Depression (?):* I've struggled with anxiety and sleep pretty much my whole life. It's been a major reason why I turned to booze to begin with. Hopefully seeing someone will provide me with some healthier skills or at least someone to talk to who can provide me with some medication....* *Socialization:* I've read a lot of people discuss Sober people Sober places. For me this has been very difficult because my main group of "friends" are my bartenders. I never got wasted there (albeit have indulged a little too much) so I've never really associated it with drinking -- more so socialization. I decided that to keep me from being so isolated I would go and drink coffee and chat. This worked really well for me I didn't feel so anxious or isolated. I did have a craving for a beer the first time I was there for a class meeting (my classmate didn't even finish his beer and I cringed as that would've been unacceptable for the previous me to do and I likely would've pounded it back myself) but subsequently never had a craving for anything outside conversation. I know people will disagree with me on this one but I know myself and isolation is worse for my sobriety than being around alcohol. My house is not dry and I haven't even thought about having one myself. EDIT: Rephrase. I have thought about it I wish I could have a beer and watch a movie or sporting event but never went and opened the fridge and grabbed one and put it back type deal. It was more so a daydream...* *Other addictions:* I chew tobacco which is obviously not a good habit to possess. I've been chewing for about 12 years now and I'm going to try to quit that soon. I know I'm physically addicted to it a lot more than say alcohol so I want to be fully entrenched in my sobriety before I begin that quest. I also noticed that I've been drinking a lot of coffee and I didn't realize this was a necessarily a bad thing until I read some people's post about it. I don't drink 10+ cups but easily could have 6 in a day (on average 2). It's something to be mindful of...Well thanks for reading this post and I appreciate the support/stories/outlooks that everyone has provided me over the last 30 days. I don't post too much nor will I likely do so in the future but I just wanted to say thanks SD.

Congratulations on 30 days!
Thank you for sharing this it's great to see you getting through challenges and identifying areas you want to work on...I'm lucky that depression did not return for me when I got sober and my sleep settled down naturally once the withdrawals faded. I found anxiety didn't go away for me when I got sober so after several months I discussed options with my doctor. I tried therapy (CBT) in the first in stance and responded really well to it.  I'm much less anxious now overall and better able to cope when I do get anxious. CBT also helped develop my coping skills - alchol was a faulty coping mechanism so I've been developing healthier ways of coping in my sobriety...I worked to remove alcohol from my reward system so broke associations I had that activity+alcohol being a winning formula - instead I focus just on enjoying the activity in its own right and often it's better because I'm fully present for it. 
Congrats on 30 days! Well done for you to be there for your sister and her partner. That is such a horrible situation. I'm not sure how to comfort someone in their position. Im still working on the loneliness aspect of sober people/ dry places.i don't have much help to offer. I'm glad you're here. Xo
