I was doing so well. I had a big relapse this weekend. I had stayed completely dry for a week and then went about three weeks of having a beer here and there with friends but staying sober. I was feeling proud of my moderation like I got to be how I was before the bingeing started...Lots of stress and the high of getting a new job offer this Friday and I had a few hard liquor drinks. I need to remind myself that it doesn't matter how many it takes me to get drunk having  just one  is enough if it puts me in that downward spiral. I just kept it going. Woke up with a hangover. Hair of the dog to function. Kept going because the bottle was almost empty. Drank at dinner to celebrate and keep the buzz until bed. ..Woke up in the middle of the night and stayed up with insomnia the awful sweating and blood pumping feeling and high anxiety chest pain. ..This is not worth it. The high of sobriety is so much better. Committing myself to checking posts here at least once a day as I face down a difficult week with lots of temptation. ..I will not drink with you today...
