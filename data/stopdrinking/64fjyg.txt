Who you do your 4th step with is your choice.  Personally I hear warning bells when I hear about sponsors who requires it to be done with them. I even had my first sponsor written in my 4th step resentments.  He ghosted me when we were half way through my fifth step step so we never made it that far :p.  I listened to someone at a meeting tell of how their sponsor went back out after the sponsee did the fifth step and spilled all his secrets.  This is obviouly a worst case scenario but also a reason why I believe it should be someone you choose carefully carefully.  I would not trust a sponsor who has demonstrated that they have loose lips.  They would also not be my sponsor much longer if there did share anything I shared in confidence.  I'm a recovered Catholic but still chose to do both of my step 5s with ordained preists who had sworn vows on the silence regarding confessions.  Sorry to hear this.  Hope are doing ok.  People make mistakes but I use caution when trusting people with my secrets.
Yeah that's a bit weird. Is it possible your sponsor was encouraging your friends to reach out to you because he/she knew you were struggling and missing meetings? Or are you getting a different kind of vibe? Was it a good intentions bad outcome type of thing? Either way I'd let your sponsor know how you feel. If you get weird vibes I might look for a new one. 
In my opinion it's time to get a new sponsor.  I had a sponsor steal from me once - fired her on the spot.  Best decision I've ever made.  I've been with my new sponsor for 4.5 years and I love and trust her..Do what feels right for you.  Good luck!
As a very private person this would be a total deal breaker for me
