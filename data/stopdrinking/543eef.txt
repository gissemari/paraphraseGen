----------immediate responses--------

When I first started this journey I had nightly drinking dreams. I usually have vivid dreams so I know how scary drinking dreams can be I would regularly wake up thinking that I was hungover. It was always a relief to find out that it was just a dream. However slowly those dreams turned into ones where I would refuse drink. It was like my mind was slowly catching up to my changed thinking. I haven't relapsed yet from those drinking dreams as I have come to understand them as part of my recovery and affirm my commitment each morning not to consume alcohol. I won't drink with you today.  
Not for me. I dream of all sorts of things. I used to dream of flying and I've never done that in real life either :)..I believe that relapse is always an avoidable choice for me.
Ive had several relapse dreams in the last couple months and im still sober :) they scared me but i just decided to take each day as it came and commit to being sober. Wish i had a more exciting response but it hasnt proved to be any kind of premonition.
I dreamt last night that I was at the bar and ordered a beer without thinking. My first thought in my dream was that I was going to have to reset my badge and tell you guys I had to start over. I was thankful to wake up and see it was all a dream! It did scare me when I started to think about it but I've made my decision. I will not drink with you today!
For me it was actually about validating my sobriety. I would drink in dreams and wake up and feel relief that I didn't drink.
Regular prolific sobriety poster u/coolcrosby made this fantastic post about just this. ..[What do dreams mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
It seemed so real and I was sort of drinking because I thought it was expected .i did n't want a drink
