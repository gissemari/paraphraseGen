I am on day 6 being sober. Other than a few nights of disrupted sleep I feel great. My self confidence is coming back and I am not hating myself. I've actually had a few moments of happiness and joy.  I don't want to sound negative but this seems too good to be true. I'm not struggling half as much as I expected. I'm grateful for that.

just keep doing what youre doing.
Hey that's really great! In hindsight I think I made things a lot harder on myself mentally than they had to be. I hope you can keep the good feelings and run with it :) And remember we're here if that ax ever does fall.
I felt better right away too.  I recall that day 8 was one of the most pleasant days in years.  The challenge for me was to not go for a month (my standard length of quitting for years) and then forget why I quit in the first place leading me back to drinking.  I had to stay really vigilant and remember that consequences seemed inevitable if I kept drinking the way I had been.  Stopdrinking has made all the difference in the world this time.  Keeps me focused on what I would otherwise neglect and forget.
One day at a time! Put one foot forward and then the next. I got into a funk the last week or so but it seems to be lifting. Just like life is for most people-- there are good days and bad days. The difference is that we can't self-medicate on those bad days. glad you're here!
