Drinking has become my hobby my friend my life. I've always had tough times in life but in high school and in my 20's  I had interests hobbies and reasons to wake up excited. I'm 37 now and I feel so disinterested in life. I push myself to find things to do but it seems like I'm just doing it to do it. How do I get excited about life again and leave booze behind me?

I probably was an alcoholic when I drank my 1st bottle of Bones Farm when I was 16.  And I was a heavy drinking alcoholic until 177 days ago when I stopped for the 1st time. My current hobby avocation and life is to remain sober. I will wait for real hobbies new friends  &amp; a good life until some where down the road when I feel I have enough sobriety to do so. I wake up happy for 1 reason: to see my badge pick up another day.  This is toughest thing I have ever done in my life. I wish you well as you struggle like I did for so long. 1 hour &amp; 10 minutes until I can be at day 178.
Depression and other mental illnesses are masked as alcoholism.   See a doctor.
The bad news is you have to start a new life.  The good news is that you get to create whatever kind of life you want!  But getting healthy is job one.   I needed to see a medical professional and get therapy in addition to going to AA.  The first couple of years I was sober I decided to say yes to every activity I could.  I had no idea what people did besides drink.  I was shocked to see a Friendly Ice Cream restaurant PACKED on a Saturday night.  I literally had no idea people who didn't drink would be out.  I didn't even own a coffee pot when I got sober.i figured out a lot of stuff about myself.  I love art and love todraw and paint and sketch.  Also I completely suck at it and thats ok.  Turns out i don't like rollercoasters sober but I did go bungee jumping and it was exhilarating!  I like to bake but also love nonfiction.  I like to sing and go to tacky roadside attractions and petting zoos.  Bowling naw....  I changed careers and even started a small business.  Also there have been seasons of depression where I had to back up and just take care of myself to become upright again.  I did become the Mother I wanted to be.  All this is an overview of what I did your mileage will vary...  ..I got sober at 34; there is plenty of time to let yourself blossom.  I wish you peace.
I think if you leave the booze behind first then you'll get excited about life again. It can often drag you down in ways you don't even realize. Best of luck to you!
34 here and in a similar boat. ..To be honest the only time I've seriously noticed a huge change in my motivation was when I started eating super healthy and began exercising. I know it's clich  and when people usually talk about diet they're selling something but I simply speaking from personal experience. I read this book called **Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body's Most Underrated Organ** by Giulia Enders and was intrigued. The point is I had a shitload more energy when I was on this regimen. It was like someone turned the lights on in my mind also and I could actually think clearly. ..Another thing to do is to ask yourself what's really on your mind and clarify why it is that you feel that way. Chances are there are some really good books out there-whether it has to do with personal issues that you faced growing up or coping with alcohol addiction. Personally I have always heard excellent reviews of **This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol: Find Freedom Rediscover Happiness &amp; Change Your Life** by Annie Grace.  I typically veer towards philosophical-related texts because I think my addiction has a lot to do with my view on life and meaninglessness. There's another book called **The Sixth Battle of Acedia: Meaninglessness - a Mid-Life Opportunity** by Pavel Somov that I really like too. I keep going back to this book and find a lot of guidance from it as well. ..I'm not sure if this has helped or not but please do keep an open mind throughout your journey and just remember you can choose your own path or choose a completely different path. It's up to you. Take care.
