*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one  thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what  happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)  and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and  feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long  time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious  decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be  hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet  only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the  right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) we're not ready to give up...**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next  24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a  pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you  do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek  advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in  your own thread...This post goes up at:..- US Night/Early Morning.- Europe Morning.- Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...------..Good morning everyone!..Earlier this week we discussed Day 1 - and so many of you folks shared your tips on how to get through. Today I'm finding myself looking even further back to when I was still drinking and still suffering. I was spending most of my days in an anxious haze and many of my mornings in a groggy nauseous state. Back then I didn't even realise how many of my problems were caused by my drinking...I expected when I quit to spend less time on my weekends hungover and that was about it. But now I'm sober I'm also far less anxious my digestive issues cleared right up and whilst I don't exactly leap out of bed (sadly stopping drinking didn't make me a morning person) I'm much clearer-headed in everything I do...So my question to you all today - what were the unexpected benefits you saw from not drinking?..To everyone who's out there struggling through it - keep going. **I** **W**ill **N**ot **D**rink **W**ith **Y**ou **T**oday!
----------immediate responses--------

Just after 11pm here end of day 5 going on day 6! Went to my first ever A.A. meeting tonight and I'm already looking forward to the next. Felt SO overwhelmingly welcomed and comfortable after I was there. Hope everyone has had a great day/night. IWNDWYT
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
IWNDWYT...I will however enjoy this delicious cold-brew coffee from my new cold-brew coffee maker.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
Day #7 I will not drink today!
It's raining outside my window mother nature's own spring cleaning. I'm pleased to celebrate 15 years sober today and humbled by the overwhelming response on my giddy check-in yesterday. You guys...!..&gt; Back then I didn't even realise how many of my problems were caused by my drinking..My experience exactly! And I didn't even drink *that* much right...! Well I will certainly not drink with you today!
Nope not today poison ..IWNDWYT
No booze today!
Good morning! So many benefits in sobriety. The most important ones to me are freedom and the peace of mind. I will not drink with you today! Have a good day sober friends.
IWNDWYT.  The beginning is always today  Mary Shelley
So this is it.  It's going to be 4 days if I make it not if when I make it.  It will be my longest time not drinking 4 days straight in as long as I can remember.  ..Seriously I can't believe I can't think back until a time I have not had a drink for 4 days in a row....could it really be 5 10 15 years???      WOW..IWNDWYT
Hello friends I will not drink with you today and I will remain vigilant  
IWNDWYT
Birds flying high.You know how I feel.Sun in the sky.You know how I feel.Breeze driftin' on by.You know how I feel.It's a new dawn.It's a new day.It's a new life.For me.And I'm feeling good....No drinking today
Day 1 again. IWNDWYT
Good morning /r/stopdrinking! I hope you're having a grand Thursday wherever you are! I'm having a nice morning sitting peacefully and enjoying a coffee before work. One thing about sobriety I never expected - but still treasure after all this time - was these moments. Mornings. Actually enjoying them as the start of a whole day instead of simply the start of my latest hangover. It's still a good feeling after all these months and days!..Have the best day my friends - IWNDWYT!
Count me in :)
Everyday without drinking is a blessing so IWNDWYT friends  
No drinking with you today
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
This will be day 3. I can do this! I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today   
I will not drink with all you lovely folks today!!!!
Good morning fellow sobernauts. I hope everyone is doing well. As per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
Good morning everyone...I'm on day 4 after a couple of relapses last week. The first was to celebrate my birthday and the second was to numb the guilt and anxiety that it brought. I cannot begin to explain how horrific the hangovers were. I felt sick to my stomach. I wasted 2 beautiful sunny days in bed. No amount of paracetamol would take my headache away!..Today I am back on track and determined to clock up some sober time so I can start to show people that I am serious in really wanting this.
Unexpected benefits: the amazing sleep I am getting loss of weight even though I am eating insane amounts of sugar connecting better with people day-to-day more productive - just about everything because I was obviously in denial or oblivious to the breadth of negative impacts from alcohol (besides the obvious hangovers blackout and headaches!). IWNDWYT lovely people.
I'm not drinking with you today. :)
Sober and more sober today
Just a lot more time for other things - A lot! ..No drinking here!
Hey hey! I will not drink with you today!!
I'm not drinking today!
We don't eat that any more!  Today looks like a good day for it  
Day 11. IWNDWYT!
Checking in. Tired but sober  
  IWNDWYT
I will join you and not pick up that first drink today.   
Feeling a bit unbalanced but I will not drink today.
Today I'm not drinking.
Had a whole hour of sleep which was just a vivid dream where I drove over someone with a car. Stayed awake so I can get to work for the first time in weeks. My eyes are red it looked like I cried. People here are so tired of my shit. I can't do this anymore but I don't know what else to do either. I just needed to say this somewhere I am so lost. iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today!
Another day - another drink left languishing somewhere out in the world because I did not pick it up. that one drink I've been steadfastly ignoring for many many days now is gathering dust and cobwebs and mould and all manner of grossery [heh heh I made a new word "grossery"]. ICKFEST! So no booze today none tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either :)
Iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today!
13 months today! IWNDWYT
Day 40 IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT  
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
Good Morning! IWNDWYT  
I will not be drinking today
I will not drink with you today.
Not Today.
Well I got the grass mowed. It took me awhile even with modifications and today I'm paying dearly for the effort. The lawn will be a lot smaller this year. Just the front of course and a sizable swath beyond the deck. I told my dear Knitwit that I'm leaving the majority of the yard to go wild as a nature preserve and that is the truth. But she knows another truth. I'm glad she didn't say so out loud because it's bad enough for me to admit it to myself...Right now it's 46F/8C on my patch supposedly rising to 62F/17C which in awhile will be warm enough for me to enjoy my not drinking poison outdoors. So I've got that going for me.
Day #3! Off to decide the fate of a young man as a juror. Has been a rough few days sober sitting through some graphic testimonies. I definitely wanted to drink after court the past few days. Today I will not drink with you.
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT
Sugar cravings? I feel like I can't stop myself from raiding my kids' leftover Easter baskets... right around the same time I would usually pour myself my first glass of red... compensating? Well no chocolate hangovers at least- and it's almost gone! IWNDWYT
Will not drink today.
Hi SD friends! It's almost Friday! ..Have a great one and IWNDWYT  
Unexpected benefit of not drinking  all the time I had to do anything at all besides drink! Alcohol and hangover nursing were my hobbies and once they were gone I could read books like I was a kid again go on hikes make food and address projects I'd been putting off for years...Now I have a baby so much less free time but that could also have never happened if I wasn't sober. ..I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you today. Three days and feeling sober strong  focused and determined.
I will not drink today.
One day down.  I have tried quiting many times.  It always surprises me how difficult it is to fall asleep the first 2 to 5 days.  Yesterday I began new I only slept maybe 2 hours but feel more rested than if I would have gone to sleep at 8pm drunk and woke up at 6am.  I'm looking forward to when I can proudly say no I don't drink at all.  I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with you all today.
won't drink today
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today.   Gonna break double digits on my streak.   Feeling grateful and glad to be alive.
I will stay free from alcohol today. ..Have a wonderful day everyone.
Good Morning SD I will not drink w/you today.
Hope everyone has a great day! I will not drink today no matter what happens!
I will not drink with you today!
I enjoy the focus not drinking brings. At work I'm able to solve problems a lot better (although I still manage to screw up now and then)
Fell off the wagon for a few weeks after 3 and something months sober. Not getting into this again. Back at day 1 &amp; glad to be.
I haven't been at this long (but still proud of my 5 days!) however I am already enjoying re-learning which parts of me are just my personality and which parts of me were coming from the alcohol. Last night I couldn't figure out where I put my bag when I got home. And it was such a relief to me that even sober I could totally forget something like that. It's nice to not feel paranoid that everything I do is because of the alcohol and wonder who is noticing...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT!
Good morning! Definitely the best unexpected benefit was dramatically better sleep. Didn't happen right away but by the end of the first month I was sleeping 6.5-7 solid amazingly restful hours a night! ..Cold today again and snowed last night. Only a dusting stuck but FFS Mother Nature! Still am excited about today. Besides it being a day of community giving at my workplace it is also the birthday of [the best dog in the world](https://imgur.com/mJCKKPQ) who is getting a walk regardless of the cold this morning and then a birthday cookie! IWNDWYT.
Another day sober!! .And I'm also trying to take a few week break from caffeine .I will not drink with you guys today!!!
Today is going to be stressful as fuck. I have more work than I can keep up with and today will be back to back meetings (ugh). But I will not drink with you all today.
Iwndwyt
Gonna get back on the wagon of self improvement. It's gonna go well. I'm still half asleep so it's hard to feel motivated but discipline is what I need not motivation. I'm going to start checking in daily again. See how it goes. I will not drink with you today.
Happy Thursday kids!  I will not drink with you today!..I used to claim I drank so I could sleep but I sleep so much better since I've stopped.  Better yet I don't wake up in a panic attack with my heart pounding.
One of the many benefits of not drinking; being able to decipher between normal anxiety that is a consequence of normal life stress (graduating child large family gatherings home remodeling projects) vs. the extreme generalized anxiety and intrusive thoughts that comes from drinking/hangovers. IWNDWYT   
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!
Not drinking = freedom for me.  Drinking is all consuming: getting drunk recovering from getting drunk then getting drunk all over again.  It certainly is a grim way to live.  Thankfully IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today.
Glorious sober morning soberniks! May our day be free of traps triggers and temptations!  Vigilance comrades! IWNDWYT
Things are going pretty good right now. I wouldn't want to mess that up with a bender...IWNDWYT.
Not drinking today!
IWNDWYT
I am not drinking today!
Alas sobriety also did not turn me into a morning person u/BoneConsultancy but it made my body and mind calm AF. ..Turns out the real me (sober me) isn't as impatient or angry as drinking me thought I was. Turns out the real me was also in a lot of pain that wasn't addressed when smothered by alcohol. Nearly 4 months into sobriety I've been able to not only address the pain but even deal with it! Who knew all those problems were lying under the surface and I actually held the solutions?! Wacky what happens when you're not persistently self-sabotaging yourself eh?..&amp;#x200B;..Anywho I'm just checkin in to say I will not drink with you today &lt;3
I will not drink today!
Today is 265 for me.  So just 100 days to go until 1 year of sobriety.  ..I remember how bloody hard the first 100 days were - sometimes surviving minute by minute - and it seem like an impossible goal.  Now Im counting 100 down to my 1 year badge and it seems infinitely achievable.  Yes there are days when I have cravings but I just have to think about how much better I feel and my thinking brain has no interest in picking up that bottle.  ..So - for those of you who are at the beginning of the journey - hang in there.  It is doable it gets easier and easier with time and getting your life back is SO worth the effort.  ..IWND  WYT
Congratulations Homer. Sober on ! 
I will not drink today!
For me one of the surprising benefits of not drinking has been reclaiming head space that used to be cluttered with thoughts about alcohol: when can I get my next drink how am I going to hide it do I have enough at home or do I have to buy more after work will I be able to find a store that will sell to me without my ID (for the at least half the time during the past several years my husband has held onto my ID credit cards etc. to prevent me from purchasing) etc. etc. etc. Sometimes the preoccupation with acquiring and consuming alcohol didn't leave much room for anything else. I'm starting to really enjoy having the mental space and energy to think about more interesting things...IWNDWYT
Knowing that the real test starts today. I am used to not drinking during the week but starting Thursday I start having a couple of beetles then on Friday my self destructive routine starts.I know I will get through this weekend. IWNDWYT
Second week of May and it's snowing again!!! But nope not gonna drink today.
Going to watch a rerun of Matrix on a big screen later looking forward to it! I have taken the red pill. I Will Not Drink With You Today
I will not drink today!
Iwndwyt   
BOOOOOOOOM I GOT THIS!!!!!..WE GOT THIS!!!!!'
IWNDWYT. Closing in on 3 months!
IWNDWYT!
Day #4 - IWNDWYT
#50 days sober here and I will not drink with you today!
I have experienced a lot of the ones most people do - better sleep improvement in digestive issues less anxiety and depression a new positive outlook saving money etc. However one of the VERY unexpected and random benefits I noticed was much better handwriting. It was something I just noticed one day that my handwriting is much neater and nicer looking. Small little thing I didn't mention it to anyone. But about a week or so later my husband said he noticed the same thing (we quit drinking together). So that's an n=2. .Anybody else experience this?.IWNDWYT!!  
Sleep is amazingly good. Clear head more energy feeling alive for the first time in years...The list of improvements since I became sober is increasingly long and positive. One doesn't realize how much alcohol gradually takes the living out of life. ..Here's to a sober today. I will not drink with you fine folks today!!
I will not drink with you today.
Good morning/day all I don't think I've been sober long enough yet to discover any unexpected benefits. Hopefully one day I'll get there. One day at a time. ..IWNDWYT
Yeszzzz... iwndwyt
Good morning from California!  98 days by golly!  Can't believe it.  I owe so much to this beautiful community.  Husband's birthday today so we're heading to Disneyland for a few hours this afternoon.  Good people of SD IWNDWYT    Gigi
Day 2 today! Yesterday was hard and I had just about resigned myself to going back to drinking again today but after an okay night's sleep and looking at all these benefits I could get if I stick with it I'm sticking with it for at least one more day! I will not drink today. I'll think about tomorrow when it comes.
Very tired today but glad to be back on the path of sobriety drinking is truly not worth it.
Good morning SD!..Oh the morning anxiety stomach issues foggy headed issues! I am so happy to have those behind me but ya know why mornings really sucked for me?  Because I *AM* a morning person and I had to literally sit with that hangover!  I could never sleep through it even if I didn't work I was always up by 6:30am and just miserable.  I don't even want to remember the many mornings I had to be at work by 5...those were terrible terrible days.  ..Up and at 'em today and off to watch the grand-toddler &lt;3  So happy for the all the differences in my life without alcohol...Stay strong friends!
I will not drink today
NOT TODAY!..IWNDWYT
[removed]
IWNDWYT!
Day six again. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today!
Day 5!
I made it to my first meeting last night thanks in no small part to some really good advice on this sub.  Day 2 and counting.
Thank you for sharing. An unexpected benefit would b that I seem to have grown some proverbial lady balls. I am much more open and up-front with people now than I ever was when I was drinking. I take less BS and though I still struggle with emotional regulation I am actually able to handle my emotions now. In the past I would drink literally any time an uncomfortable emotion came up. I didn't think I'd survive without booze but here I am...IWNDWYT!
Me today: no drugs no smoking no drinking no kidding.
I won't drink.  Not today.  And that makes me happy.
I will not drink today.  Triple 7's!!!
I will not drink with you today. My brain fog is lifting feeling a little raw a little vulnerable but that's okay! Starting to sleep better. Keepin' it going. Happy Thursday!
iwndwyt
Only one thing to do today: don't take the first drink.
IWND  WYT.
I will not drink with you today
SOBER BOWEL MOVEMENTS!!!! They also meant I didn't actually have IBS as I had diagnosed myself with. And much less Anxiety. Still have the occasional Panic Attack but it's not because The Husband used my car to go to the store &amp; I had 3 little boxes of wine under the back seat. It's about normal shit... ***IWNDWYT!!!** It's gonna rain heavily today starting about noon. I'm scanning recipes to find something new gooey &amp; cozy to make us for dinner!
Good morning everyone! Today I begin Day 5 sober and will end the day sober! My unexpected benefit? Funny how that question is asked only a few hours after I noticed one! I'm notorious for being a terribly cranky person when awoken unexpectedly especially after a night a heavy drinking. Having a toddler that sometimes does JUST that has often awakened a side of me I'm not proud of. I'd usually just go out for a cigarette before even grabbing him in attempts to calm myself down and not be so frustrated. It seems he tends to want to wake up suddenly on nights where I'm sleeping very well. His timing is just impeccable am I right? ;) ...I was sleeping phenomenally last night and he begins to cry at about 2 am. I woke up begrudgingly of course but not angry. I wasn't upset cranky or hungover just.... tired that's it. No need to calm myself down even... just crept to his room changed him and cuddled him after the nightmare that I assume he had. ...I'm not drinking anymore for me and my health but also very much for him. Sober me is the best me. Sober mom is his best mom. IWNDWYT!!!
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.  ..Definitely more patient with my kid and pets after quitting drinking.
I always thought I was sunburned or just a red person. Turns out it was inflammation from drinking ie rosacea. Now that I'm working on stopping it is like normal colored. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
Thanks for posting! The first  unexpected benefit I realized was a renewed desire to learn and try new things. I'm finding new podcasts books and magazines about topics I'd never normally find interesting AND I'm retaining the information. I'm picking up new hobbies too!..Like many of you I never related my mental and physical issues to my drinking. ..IWNDWYT
Good morning BC and everyone! An unexpected benefit of sobriety is time. I never realized how much of my day was spent getting over hangovers evaluating my current booze stock planning for obtaining more hiding it hiding my drinking getting buzzed and then drunk etc. Hours and hours... I wasted so many but no more...IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today
I realized that much of my anxiety was caused by drinking since my symptoms became way less severe since I have stopped! Many ordinary tasks that I avoided for years suddenly weren't so intimidating so I was able to take care of a large number of long-neglected things in my first month of sobriety. IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink today!!!
This is not an unexpected benefit but it has been a sorely missed one: a great nights sleep. I love the feeling of being cozy in my bed and waking up refreshed and calm; the total opposite of how you wake up hungover. ...Time to enjoy a beautiful day 3 victory coffee which I would not be able to enjoy if I was hugging the toilet. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!   
Yesterday a severe storm came through while I was gone. Trees are down surrounding us. I had to walk home. As far as I know no one was killed. .It is surreal as we went through this 2 years ago almost to the day. This time seems much worse. So today I'll be cleaning up yard debris and helping my neighbors clean up theirs. IWNDWYT!
Yesterday evening/night I was really craving some alcohol but I made it through it. I don't want to ruin all the progress I've made. Just gotta take it one day at a time. I wont drink today.
Day 4 IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT..I do not miss waking up sooooooo thirsty at 3am. I no longer even need to keep water next to my bed! Also....I totally smell better and sweat a lot less. I now love wearing my sweaters around the house in the evenings and getting cozy under the blankets at night.
I will not drink with you today  
Day 3. IWNDWYT
Day 6 Not Today
IWNDWYT
Day two here   IWNDWYT!!!
Weird times ahead that alcohol will make unbearable. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
I honestly can't believe I made it through yesterday I was at work and the urge to go home and have  just one  (it's never just one) drink was super strong.  But instead I went out of my way to walk to a supermarket that has my favorite snack and bought it for myself which meant an extra 20 minutes of walking and a treat when I got home :) It felt great and I can't wait to do it again today. IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
It's been really easy staying away from alcohol. Other bad habits? Not so much. But at least I'm sober. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Iwndwyt
Unexpected benefit for me: more patience with my husband! I thought I was a patient person but well maybe not so much! Anyway I'm less likely to get irritable over stupid stuff...I pledge: IWNDWYT
Can truly say I've not had the urge to drink these past 15 days. .I think this time I really disgusted myself enough to flick the switch in my brain. .Fuck yes!! IWNDWYT!!
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today
Morning SD! I will not drink with you today. Some unexpected bennies from not drinking are: Sleep drinking just ruined my sleep in ways I did not even begin to see since stopping I have a normal sleep schedule again. I am not so worn down. I don't feel "old". .Time I can't believe how much time I lost to drinking! I was useless drunk and useless hungover and useless waiting to drink. Suddenly my days are so much more manageable. It is like a crazy life hack. Hope ya'll have a great day SD!
I won't drink today no matter what happens!
I will not drink today.
Fell off the wagon hard on Monday for no good reason. Here I am back on day 3 back in the single digits. I will not drink with you today.
Unexpected benefits: better poops! Social situations are possible sober as going alone to shop or eat in front of people (I got a lot less scared especially after trying a couple times) Im having fun sober I can enjoy things sober some even more now its nearly impossible to lie to myself and ignore things: both benefit and a bad thing (scary and uncomfortable) but makes me take decisions for the better...Today Im officially never forced to go to my workplace anymore!  Which Ive realised I never really was. Somehow it felt like it. My boss actually got happy when I told her Ive made other plans amd until then we dont know and thats OK right now. Got some books about phsyciology and old folklores and traditions as Im considering to study either psychology and archeology. Feels good! Feels great! Im happy excited proud and weirdly calm and not feeling like drinking in this change. But even if the panic kicks in and I would feel like it I will NOT drink today.
LETS FUCKIN DO THIS!!! NO ALCOHOL TODAY BABY!!! LETS GOOOO!!!!!
IWNDWYT
How much happier I am first of all. I didn't even realize I was unhappy until I got sober. Looking back now though I can clearly see that. I was also surprised by how much more confident and social I am. I got so used to relying on alcohol in social situations that I couldn't fathom the thought of socializing without it. Which is so silly looking back at it because almost every time I drank my way trough a social interaction I'd wake up the next morning cringing thinking  oh my god why the hell did I say that??   The other thing that really surprised me is how much more enjoyment I get out of life. I was definitely somebody who not only drank to mask bad feelings but also to  improve  already good experiences. I realize now that I was never actually improving them. I was either making them worse or best case scenario making it so I could barely even remember the good times in my life. My life is much more full too. The old me would be too drunk by the time dinner was over to really do much of anything. I'd end up just poking my phone or watching tv until falling asleep. Now I have so much more energy and mental capacity for not only my hobbies but also things that need to get done. For all these reasons and more I'm very pleased to say IWNDWYT!!!!
IWNDWYT!  
Had a friend in town who I used to live to guzzle wine with and we went and had dinner. It was maybe weird for two seconds when she ordered a glass and I stuck with water but I had such a great time really being present and reconnecting with her and this morning I had a touch of sugar hangover from inhaling some cannoli but no regrets over missing a glass of wine. This was a big accomplishment for me because I had been agonizing over maybe just having one and planning and then I wondered why was I putting myself through the torture of trying to quantify an unknown outcome versus going with a choice that I know will have a positive outcome. IWNDWYT
Not today
I'm on day 4 feeling better.  You know I remember when Uber came out.  I was so pumped!  Why?  So i could go out and drink MORE and have a driver. Sad but true.  Lol.  IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you all today!
I will not drink with you today. Have a great everyone! :)
I will not drink with you today.
I'm all in!
IWNDWYT
Happy Thursday! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
Good morning sober world!..IWNDWYT
Iwndwyt
Not today
 
IWNDWYT
Good morning.  IWNDWYT
I am having an utter crap week but drinking would only make it crappier. ..Thank you for being here. ..IWNDWYT
There were a lot of unexpected benefits that I noticed as tine went on. ..For one I found a huge group of people that are genuine friends. They ask how I am and they truly care. The love and acceptance is real and we can share on such deep levels. ..I didn't expect that at all. I had never had friends I could truly rely on. Now I do. ..I could go on and on with other things but I'm just going to stick to that one today. ..I will not drink with you today!
Been a few tough days lately I most definitely will not drink with you today
Getting my free time back /u/BoneConsultancy.  By the end I was spending almost every free second planning sneaking and indulging my drinking and using.  My life revolved around it...Within my first few days of sobriety I noticed how much more time I had available to me and that was one of the major compelling reasons for me to stick with not drinking.  So many other amazing gifts have come with sobriety (and some hard work) now but free time was one of the freebies that really caught my attention...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I won't drink with you all today. Feel you on the anxiety. Still having some but it's definitely worse when I've got booze in my system from the night before.
No drinks today!
Big party at work today with special alcoholic drinks as the big event.  They sound awful so that's another plus!  I will enjoy myself much more with a sparkling water and lime.
Good morning kind funny and caring SD community! We're due for a record-setting 80' sunny day here in Seattle which is weird but welcome. ..I think the benefit I notice most and expected least is that I'm a far mellower kinder and more patient person when I'm alcohol free. More resilient. And maybe because of that I like myself much better. I'm "only" just starting week 3 (although I'm feeling pretty chuffed about that) and I'm still waiting for my sleep to improve but I feel less bloated my eyes are brighter and my default is smiling rather than grimacing my way through the day. So grateful for sobriety and for you all. Having SD as a resource is making this time quitting a completely different experience and I feel much more empowered to stop drinking for good! IWNDWYT!!
Great post thank you. An unexpected benefit for me is increased happiness. I mean more than I expected. I realize now that I was mildly depressed even after I first got  sober and felt better. It's like I couldn't tell I was depressed until I got out of it...The healing and growing continues!..I will not drink with you today!
On day two today. Even after one day off my mind is in such a better place. Heading to the therapist today to chat about the continued fight to better myself. Looking forward to day three. IWNDWYT.
some days are waaay harder but won't drink today
Calling it 2.5 months today - I haven't been counting the days. It is this sub that made me decide to stay off the bottle rather than try drinking again. ..I don't crave the alcohol - although from time to time I would want a beer. After a hard week at work - I would certainly enjoy it. Last week my colleagues even tempted me very heavily (not on purpose). We did happy hour after work - and I settled for an iced tea. I got some questions but I just said: "I'm not drinking for a while."..Business travel also remains hard. I was hosting customers this week and buying them very good steak. I would've loved nothing better than a glass of Malbec with the steak and a nice glass of scotch afterwards - but I stayed off it...I always drank moderately as I knew I have an addictive personality. Not drinking is easier and harder at the same time. I would certainly like a beer or a scotch from time to time - but not having one is easier to keep myself in check. ..I will not drink with you today!
I'm definitely more present for my kids now that I'm not drink!  I will not drink with you today. Peace
Every day I dont drink it gets easier to keep it up iwndwyt

Day 42. Had an interview this morning. I think it went pretty well. Always hard to say. I thought I bombed the interview for the job I currently have so who knows. I'm just glad it's over now and I'll find out one way or the other soon...Gotta work the side gig tonight so gonna be tired tomorrow but that's ok. Will feel good to make some money.
1 year klaxon!..IWNDWYT
Day 221 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT  
Day 4 for me. I went to AA for the first time. What an amazing experience.  I was buzzing afterwards.  It was a morning meeting and I went straight to work after. People noticed I was in a much better mood.  I even smiled at strangers in the street.  If I can keep my mood up and I can keep away from this addiction then I am sure my whole world can be transformed.  ..Another benefit will be no wasted weekends dealing with hangovers.
This is day one for me (again). I have quit numerous times the longest being about 1.5 years. First time posting here. I am hoping posting here will add some accountability. I will not drink with you today.
Each day things get a bit better.  Not to say there's no stress or hardships.  It's more like knowing there will always be some unexpected stress/hardships in life &amp; knowing I can sustain myself better through tough days when I'm completely sober.  I have to keep my spiritual self fueled up daily...IWNDWYT
Went to the community college today. Past me left present me in a bit of a pickle as far as my GPA (and life) goes. It took me seven years to get back but today I went in and sorted everything out attended a mandatory re entry class since I was put on academic probation. I survived. I did it. I've been putting this off for 7 years because I was afraid to see how bad I screwed up. I did screw up a lot but it's fixable. Being sober has helped me realize that if I do one thing at a time take things step by step I can do almost anything I put my mind to. I might be uncomfortable. I might be self conscious and feel silly or too old but that current discomfort will pale in comparison to the future benefits. ..I wouldn't even have gone back into the school in the first place if I was still drinking. Absolutely no way I would have done this. So thank you all. You have helped me stop drinking and helped me to build up the motivation to fix my past mistakes and start working towards a better future for myself (and hopefully others)...IWNDWYT.

Hello folks I will not be drinking with you today!!  Stay Strong
I won't drink today!
I'm on Day 2 for about the 5th time in last two months since finding this sub I feel like at least I'm aware now I have a problem no more excuses. ..I'm looking forward to starting a new job Monday with different hours  away from a lot of the social aspects that get me in bad positions where I can't stop and binge. I'm feeling pretty confident I can make it until Monday booze free.
I will not drink today
I will not drink with you today.
4 days and 16 hours sober - looking forward to the next 400 days. IWNDWYT!!!
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today!   .It's only been a few days for me but already my mysterious digestive issues are cleared up.  No pain no bloating (still fat - LOL) no running to the bathroom with diarrhea (gross I know). I always blamed these symptoms on something else. Guess it really was a simple as giving up the alcohol.
IWNDWYT!
Not drinking! Haven't drank! Will not drink!
Hi everyone I just wanted to introduce myself.  I am starting day 2 today.
I will not drink today.
Day 6. Slowy getting the feeling of being back on track! IWNDWYT
This is the longest I've been sober in a couple years. I've finally decided to completely abstain instead of failing at moderation. I've been enjoying sleeping better and being more social. Drinking and being hungover pushed me to isolate myself for a long time and it's time to heal from all the damage. I feel optimistic about my future and thankful I found this Reddit.
Day 38. The longest I've gone in many many years. IWNDWYT
Argh. Today is a tough one. Cross country flight in first class after a stressful few days. Turning down the free champagne and wine is feeling tougher than usual. But IWNDWYT
Hi SD.  Going on 50 somethingish days sober now.   My battle to get out of the hospitality industry seems to have failed as I don't have any more time or options left for job hunting.  I'm very bummed about that as it means I will be in a partying atmosphere with friends that know how much I used to drink.  I'm resolute on not drinking my first week as I wait for my therapist to get back from vacation.  For now I'm not in that environment so IWNDWYT
not drinking today
Hit 100 days and 16 days cigarette free but I'm having a terrible day mentally.
I will not drink today!
Drinking was like a layer on top of everything for me. So much thinking around should I shouldn't I have another every night. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
Not going to drink with any of you today!
I'm only on my 2nd day but I went to my first meeting in 3 years. It helped a lot. I had several people come up and introduce themselves afterward. I'm so grateful the the community here and the AA community are so outgoing about helping people who need it. I will not drink today. Thank you everyone.
I will not drink today.
Last night was hard. I found myself bored out of my mind with nothing to do. Kids were already asleep after I came home from College after work so that was nice. However I had nothing to preoccupy myself with. My attention after work was once dedicated to getting as drunk as possible but now there is nothing. I gotta find something; it was too late to go to the gym and too late to wail on my guitar. uuuuuuuuugh. Here's to another day fellow future teetotallers!..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT.
A weird revelation... I used to drink JD and coke and yet when I had it the other day I hated it. I really lost the taste for it. I haven't drunk today and I will not drink tomorrow.  
Work events. Always tough not to drink but if you'll be here I'll be here... IWNDWYT
Hello SD.  I had a lovely visit with my MIL while husband was/is at sea.  I don't think I would have said that if I were still drinking.  I am so happy that I do not actually loathe spending time with in-laws it was a lot stress and alcohol-related issues. I had the energy to look for the positives not take things personally realize a lot of what is said is not really serious and best of all to cheerfully lay down my boundaries and stick with them.  Just like I didn't drink with my in-laws this week I will not drink with you today.  All the best.
Day 2. I did not drink today. 23:14 here. Time to spend a few hours trying to fall asleep. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in!
I'm way late and am actually heading home from work soon...but wanted to check in to say that I won't be drinking with you all today!
Cried this morning because not using alcohol to cope is overwhelming. Instead I treated myself to Cajun seasoned pizza rolls. .IWNDWYT
Somebody offered me a drink. No thank you that is my ex wife. We were in love before but now we can't ever be again.
Afternoon SD IWNDWYT
The springtime seems more beautiful! IWNDWYT
 
I will not drink with you today.
I've never thrown up from a hangover.  Until today.  No more nonsense I'm definitely not drinking with you today
I have not and will not drink with you today!
It's been awhile. IWNDWYT.

Day 3 I owed my partner a handle of tequila from last week so I bought it for her and left and let her hide it. But then I also bought her some beer I really like...okay I bought me some beer I really like. It took a lot of effort but I gave that to her also. I was thinking I could drink again tonight and then just go back to quitting tomorrow but then I remembered every day without a hangover is good and whichever night I decided to drink would result in a broken tomorrow...Looking forward to CrossFit tomorrow. I will not drink with you tonight.
I did not drink today!!! Big accomplishment for me since my husband was away.
HOLY HELL. I cannot believe I DIDNT drink tonight! I was about to open the one craft beer that was saved for me after I put my child to bed. My fiance and I ended up getting into an argument before I had the chance to crack it. Any other night in my anger I would've chugged mine his and some of his liquor. Instead I chose NOT to drink BECAUSE I was upset and emotional and I knew that would make everything worse. Instead we talked made up and now I'm enjoying a taco salad before bed. That is huge for me! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT (today tonight and with all hope tomorrow  )
No drinks
I will not drink with you today. Thank you for taking me across the finish line college graduation tomorrow. I can't believe it.
I did not drink today. .Surfing this sub Reddit and I just realized there is an agnostic AA meeting ON MY BLOCK. I've been wanting to check out some sort of meeting but I'm honestly scared.
Not drinking!
