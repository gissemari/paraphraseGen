Trying to train my body and brain to to wait out those obsessive thoughts about alcohol. They take hold of me and it is all I can think about. If I can just get through to the evil voice in my head and say "SHUT the F up!" When it says to me "go ahead you deserve it. It will help quiet down your head and let you get through the day" or "how do you expect to never drink again..that is so depressing."..Came home from yoga calm and relaxed and immediately walked into the chaos that is a house with kids.  The evil voice began. I struggled to quiet it. I finally busied myself and got through it. Ugh I look forward to that voice being euthanized. ..Off the topic but as this issue was mentioned in another post recently..I cannot pass that stupid robot test on the first try. Not doing wonders for my self-esteem! Ha!!

Hang in there!  I know the feeling when the kids are going crazy.  What is the robot test?
I've heard that mindfulness is a good technique for dealing with those voices. Maybe look into the process? I'd give you a breakdown but I'm not much of an authority and wouldn't want to make a mistake/give some bad advice. ..Just my 2 cents! ..PS: Damn that CAPTCHA robot test.
