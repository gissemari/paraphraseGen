With all that has happened this week is surprising I didn't cave! But I made it through the week and my second Friday night...I even went out to eat last night with my bff and meet her (much younger go her!) bf! Strange thing is tho...... Her bf is in recovery from prescription drug use and I could FEEL his depression.  He's been sober several months. I think he's on the wrong antidepressants. ..But it raised a question...... Is getting clean easier for someone that WANTS it rather than for someone is kind of forced into it because of an eye opening accident or court ordered rehab etc?..I'm scared he's going to relapse and its going to really hurt my bff.... She had no experience with alcohol or drugs or ppl that do. We are long time friends but she's never hung out with me while I was drinking.... I've always kept her away from it physically and would stick to phone calls when I drank...Sorry for long ramble... Trying to occupy myself with things other than my own problems!

You can only fix you and be a good support to your friend...Congratulations on two Fridays! Two whole weekends coming up!
Well I believe that a new relationship in the first year of sobriety is a no-no. Is your friend in recovery?..I went to Alanon to learn to cope with the others in my life in a way that I can take care of me. You might take her to a meeting it is very helpful. 
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that you've typically taken a caretaker role in your life. I do this ALL THE TIME. I'm realizing now it's another  addiction  I've used   co-dependency   to deal with my own problems by ignoring them. ..You can only help yourself in your recovery. And I think people have to find their own way to it. You're a good friend.
