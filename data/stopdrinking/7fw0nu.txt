I went on a date Friday evening with someone who traveled quite a long distance to visit me for a romantic night out of dinner and some drinks. I ended up blackout drunk. I really like this guy and wanted to make a good impression on our second date which I had been looking forward to all week and yet in my giddy haze I didn't even notice my world blurring and eventually going blank. He had to take me back home and put me in bed as I rambled incoherently and stumbled about. I have no memory of that last hour and things are patchy before it. The experience was both embarrassing and frightening. It feels like a tipping point. ...Going from normal drinking with friends to consistently being the drunkest guy in a group happened so gradually that I never noticed something was amiss. Now I'm in my late 20s and that's very much the case. Recently I've been receiving worrying little comments from friends and family nothing too critical but comments nonetheless. "Wow you're really plowing through those beers dude." "Man you were completely gone." "Do you remember what you were saying last night?"...I'm not a daily drinker and I've used this fact to shield myself from honest self-reflection. I tend to stay sober Monday through Friday have one big night out getting hammered on the weekend then start the slow recovery process. I say "slow" because with age it's become increasingly difficult and miserable. My hangover day is a total write-off (bad food Netflix in bed generally excusing myself  from the world) but the day after is always somehow worse; I feel a deep emptiness flashes of anxiety and then a clouded head that takes yet another day to dissipate. If I go out boozing on a Friday night I'm not normal again until Tuesday at the earliest. I'm essentially wasting half my week half my life at an age when people are finding partners advancing careers embracing hobbies developing skills building futures. I'm just burning time. What's more the drinking isn't even fun anymore. There's none of that euphoric glow and easy conversation it used to bring. Now I tend to feel scattered loud annoying impatient a bit on edge the whole time and it just propels that night's binging further. This whole thing is spiralling.  ...It's a scary realization that you've lost control. I'm also increasingly embarrassed and ashamed by the culmination of years of poor decisions ranging in scale from small interactions to large life choices. I never before connected them all but there is such a clear pattern that it makes me cringe I didn't call it out before. Alcohol is the greatest variable disrupting my life emotionally mentally professionally physically my reputation and (self) respect in terms of productivity self-actualization direction and goals accomplishments quite literally everything.  ...And please don't get me wrong: I know there are people here with more severe alcohol habits at a greater danger to themselves and others with greater mountains to climb ahead. I don't mean to diminish that. But my peculiar form of alcoholism has become unbearable in its own quiet way. I know there must be others out there like this.  . ..Thanks for listening from my own little corner of this struggle we all share.   ...I will not drink with you today.   .

I was a daily drinker but usually not wasted drunk.  I can still relate to your story very slowly over time I needed more and more.  I will not drink with you today!
 The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to break. 
Thank you for your courage to post!  ..&gt; scary realization that you've lost control..Reminds me of when it became clear to me that I could no longer live with alcohol or without it. That turned out to be one of the best moments of my life even though it felt like one of the worst at the time. I pushed me toward making a decision that saved my life stopping drinking...Here are some of my favorite stopdrinking searches to click and one for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?

Your post spoke to me deeply.  I used to feel that way too when I was a drinker.  I will not drink with you today my friend!
You can do this. I made a list of my reasons for stopping and read it every day and that along with the fact that I quit before things got completely out of hand made it relatively easy to not drink. ..And life is so much better in ways expected and unexpected. Best wishes to you!  
I relate to this so much. For me the descent was so gradual that I didn't notice either. You can check my history for my post if you like but I justified my behavior the same way you describe: I don't drink daily and I don't drink in the mornings so I don't have a problem right?..Eventually it just becomes too much. I'm so glad I looked back with honest eyes and saw that alcohol was the common element in so much of my misfortune and it was time to stop making excuses for it. You don't have to be a full-blown alcoholic to have a drinking problem and it's always better to stop before it gets to that point...You're very lucky your night ended as innocently as it did. Happy to have you here. I will not drink with you today :)
This post really resonated with me; it took another decade for things to progress to the point where I was ready to stop drinking. I also found that the day after my hangover was even worse with The Fear and The Shame closing in - I'd be too braindead on a hangover day to remember anything but the day after was when I'd start remembering all the stupid shit I said/did...I will not drink with you today!
The progression of drink is a mystic thing that grabs you so slowly the mind is trapped into thinking it's okay to drink again..Then the misery sets in you know it's becoming a problem but continue to put poison in our bodies. ..That's great you realize it's becoming a problem for you IWNDWYTD!    
You just described my drinking habit for the last 8 years. I didnt realise how much it actually affected me up until like 1 year ago. And with age these binges gets harder and harder to recover from. I have never considered my drinking a REAL problem but i see now that being hungover for 2-3 days per week is actually  quite a lot of time. And even if i am not drinking on week days i am always thinking about the weekend binge and/or regretting the last weekend binge..Thanks for posting! 
.&gt;I know there are people here with more severe alcohol habits at a greater danger to themselves and others with greater mountains to climb ahead. **I don't mean to diminish that.**..Nobody here is ever going to judge you because your problem isn't serious enough.  Honestly I was in a similar state when I first posted here. I was aware that I had a problem and it was affecting my life but to an outside observer things looked basically fine. Internally though I was seriously struggling. ..I feel grateful that I took steps when I did. A lot of people around here weren't so lucky...I'm glad to have you here with us and I will not drink with you today.
Your drinking and feelings after are so similar to mine. The anxiety was almost unbearable. 
I will not drink with you today. ..I've been there right where you are. I actually dialed back my drinking quite a bit after many realizations that I had gotten pretty damn sloppy. This didn't stop me from getting drunk regularly but I told myself things were better since I wasn't blacking out once or twice a month...I realized though that while I wasn't blacking out like I used to that my alcohol intake was still higher than could possibly be healthy. Spending time here is one of the best things I've ever done. The longer I've been away from alcohol the more I realize how much it was taking away from my life. ..Here's a quote I saved a while back that I look at often:."Functioning alcoholism isn't a type it's a stage.. we all are functional until we can no longer function."
Eventually you'll find a reason to drink on the days you don't. I started off this way get drunk Friday and Saturday but then there's that Thursday night thing okay I'll just have some beers. Well Sunday is for sleeping and drinking Gatorade but a few bloody marries at breakfast won't hurt right. Well fuck now it's Monday and I've got to function for work eventually figure out drinking in the morning (I was lucky in that much of my work is consulting from my own office or house) was a good way to feel normal again. ..I don't want to give medical device but it sounds like you're going through alchohal withdraw which is incredibly dangerous. However I think there is evidence that people who have a consistent history of going through withdrawal eventually having worse and worse symptoms. I think the term for it is kindiling. Most people who have DTs which have like a double digit mortality rate if you aren't treated have had previous withdrawls. ..Again it's different for everyone and it doesn't sound like you're using alcohol on a daily basis to the point where it controls everything you do but not even to get the good feeling and have more fun eventually it changes from needing to drink at all social things to just drink to feel normal. ..There's a bunch of treatment options for the actual withdrawal side of things sometimes just increase in fluid and vitamin (alcoholics typically are low on B vitimians and one of the D's but I forget which one they gave me when I detoxed years ago) sometimes your GP will just give you a few day course of a drug to help with the anxiety and insomnia usually benzos. From there you've got various treatment options at specific rehab facilities for me personally after having really bad withdrawal my GP referred me to an outpatient rehab program where I can back in every day for a week to get my vitals checked along with some consultations/counciling. At the very least go into an urgent care and tell them what's up let them run some blood work. Biggest thing I got from it was how much damage it does to your brain and body I'll admit part of me thought the detox program was just an easy way for me to get through a couple weeks not needing to drink during the day but I could still casually drink at social events but eventually you realize that you've got no control over your drinking and I can say from experience after being sober for long periods thinking I'd have a couple drinks one night that all those old habits and urges start coming back and you're thinking about the next drink and it just snowballs. ..I saw in a lower reply you said you're actions while drinking have had impacts on your family and sounds like you want to stop but please see a doctor if not just to check on your health. Constant withdrawals even if treated can have long term damage afterwards. .
I think it's brilliant that you've already realised you want something different and better for yourself.  My drinking steadily escalated from the level and age you're at now to the point where by my late thirties it was daily copious wildly inappropriate and causing me such misery I didn't know what to do with myself...Stopping by that time was really hard but I had no idea it'd be the best thing I ever did! You don't have to  wait for it to get worse than this   my life is truly better without it.  Sorry if I sound evangelical but I wouldn't have believed myself so I'm a bit passionate on the subject. ..Happy to be not drinking with you today.  Welcome!..
Alcoholism is a progressive disease. My spiral downward lasted 20 years. I was always really "good at drinking" (i.e. no fights no DUIs always kept in control). It wasn't until booze started impacting my physical health that I realized it was time to quit...and by that time I was thoroughly addicted.  It's a great that you are able to see it for what it is without hitting rock bottom so to speak. Life is so much better without it. Get yourself a badge and join the club!
The slide is so subtle that whole societies have succumbed unawares. 
I relate a lot.  .  .I rarely drank on weekdays but I gradually found that I didn't even have weekends at all anymore - just one drunken blur between friday and monday every weekend lost.  .  .And although I rarely drank on weekdays the weekdays that I would drink became "drive home from work. stop at liquor store. drink. pass out. wake up &amp; go to work."  .  .Back in the day I'd drink a couple beers over time only slightly altering my mood while I watched movies or played games or socialized with friends. It was easy to just drink enough to switch things up but not so much that I would become drunk and incapable of continuing to pay attention to whatever activity I was doing. Eventually the drink really did become the main event and the other things that I tried to do while drinking fell so far in priority that I could hardly be said to have been doing them at all. Like drinking while playing games until I fell asleep on the keyboard. Or watching multiple episodes of a show in a row without remembering a single event of the plot.    .  .I've only been sober for a little while but it feels like I have so much more actual usable free time now. I actually beat games that I play. I don't drag my friends down when we're playing together. I actually remember all the films I watch and can discuss them articulately again.
Are you me? Or did I write this post while black out drunk... Thank you for sharing this. 
It creeped up on me I used to drink a few and go to bed then it got more and more then I needed the blackouts to sleep or I'd go out and buy more booze. Now 102 sober days later I sit back and feel ashamed and upset I never saw it coming but that's the beauty of it I guess it's a sneaky thing.
Thank you for being so vulnerable sharing this. I can essentially copy/paste to explain what was happening to me right before I quit. If I was honest with myself I realized every single thing in my life would have improved stopping drinking and I realized it would have also been impossible to get into proper routines with hobbies getting career back on track starting a business I always wanted and coming out of crappy rship patterns. As for self-actualisation? As a self development reading psychology brain science nerd I knew if I didn't stop I would have a life full of regrets as the girl that never was never realized even a semblance of her best version. I couldn't live with it anymore. It was reading stories like yours it became painfully clear each year it got a bit worse. I didn't notice either. How could we it took 20 years for me to ever even have the thought to stop for good. It's still doesn't even feel like a real decision. Keep coming here this place is the most supportive community ever. Have a read of Annie Grace "this Naked Mind" or watch her vids on YouTube if u just have a few minutes. The journey is rough but it's so worth it. You made the first step keeping yourself accountable by being this transparent. I will not drink with you today! 
I'm in the same boat. I wish I could be back at the point where I could have a few drinks not get wasted and not have to deal with a hangover the next day. I don't even remember when that was...Good luck!
Big kudos to you for this kind of self-inventory at such a young age as your decision to stop will pay big dividends over the coming years. My drinking pattern was similar to yours at that age and it morphed into greater frequency (although fewer binge sessions) over the next 25 years. So just over a year ago I finally came to the conclusions you've outlined above and haven't looked back since. Best decision I ever made.
Jesus that really hit home. Thank you for writing this. I really feel like I've thrown so much of my life away doing exactly as you describe especially the hangovers &amp; all the accompanying feelings the days after. I was drinking during the week getting blackout drunk 2-3 days a week &amp; in a constant state of hungover or trying to get drunk again to avoid those feelings which only exacerbated the problem. ..I'm 38. How much could I have accomplished in my life w/o alcohol? How much more fulfilling could my life be? I'll never know because I've wasted precious time on this planet well being wasted. I've been drinking since I was 16 &amp; I'm  basically at the end of a 3-year bender &amp; I'm just fucking tired of it all. ..IWNDWYT ..
