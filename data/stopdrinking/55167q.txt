Happy thankful Thursday!..This is my first so the thing i am thankful most today is this sub and the SD community.  The Last 3 days could have been a rollercoaster of anxiety and emotion had it not been for the advice and struggles of everyone here in the same/similar position as me. It hasn't been easy but the wonderful insight from you inspiring people have kept me going. I am thankful to be 3 days healthier than i have been in a long while. And i am thankful to see the next day play out filled with positivity. ..Thank You all. 
I am so thankful for my struggle. I moved to London (Brit here 'ello there guvner)  after living abroad for three years and I hated it. I hated that my boyfriend still lived abroad I hated the commute I hated my job and guess what I did to compensate? I drank! A lot. I stayed out with strangers I would wake up in fits of panic I would berate myself for days. ..I had a breakdown it was pretty bad I would shake with anxiety I would cry at random intervals. So I changed tack - I decided to make a big leap I would quit my job move back to my hometown (which is super mega cheap place to live but still a fun city) and start going freelance. My boyfriend is coming too!..I went to therapy I quit drinking relapsed and quit again. I am nearing my month sober! I feel incredibly confident in what I am about to embark on I feel clear headed and excited. I am moving on Saturday - wish me luck. ..I am so grateful for that struggle for it pointing out clear as day that I had a problem with alcohol. I needed to quit. I needed to start living the life I wanted. I am thankful for the struggle!..My depression has pretty much gone my anxiety is manageable I am having fun and no more anxiety ridden hangover nightmares. Fuck yeah...(I am also INSANELY thankful for my supportive boyfriend who forgave me for some shitty drunk behaviour has stayed almost entirely sober with me and my friends who are totally on board with me not drinking! They are da bomb.)..OVER AND OUT.
Yesterday I acknowledged two years of sobriety. I am grateful that I have tools and techniques to maintain it. I am grateful for AA this forum and sober friends. Today's a great day. I know that every day can be too. 
Thank you for this. I really needed to read it today. I'm really struggling with a concussion right now and reading this gives me hope that in this struggle I will find my strength. 
I am thankful to have found this community. Between my family you guys and the wonderful people at my meetings I am sure I can do this. ..I am also thankful for the amazing two children I have been blessed with. Not losing them is what will keep me going! 
I am so thankful for this sub! I've learned so many things here that have helped me through my struggles and give me the confidence to take on whatever life throws my way. It's also thanks to SD that I've achieved a sobriety goal 2 and half years in the making this week. Thank you all!
Today I am thankful for mornings without hangovers so I can get through work without sweating or feeling sick to my stomach. I am also grateful for my husband who quit drinking with me and supports me in every way. 
I'm thankful I decided to go on this journey...In the early days I realised I needed to change my response to negative situations because my relief from life was no longer there...I'm thankful because I've learned new techniques I can use to deal with life which has increased my confidence across all areas of my life.
I'm thankful for my loving wife and family.  I never knew true happiness till I had someone to share everything in my world with. I'm thankful I made what I hope is the right decision and 86 days in I see nothing wrong with it yet.

I grateful for this move to the ugliest place on earth where the air smells only worse than the water...I tried to cope by staying doused in vodka and I'm grateful I'm still alive to give this place a chance...I'm away from my overbearing family for the first time in my life. I never moved from the NYC-metro area. This is an amazing opportunity to start anew. Just me and my husband. ..I'm so grateful I found my own power within myself. That I'm finding out how to define myself outside of the people and places that already had a definition of me...I'm grateful for sobriety and for all of you good people here who listen to me and are kind enough to share your journey...I am in awe today of it all really. 
I'm thankful I have another chance to stay sober. 
I'm extremely thankful that I finally told myself "this is enough let's reach out for help." Best decision I have ever made. Taking it one day at a time and loving the richness and fullfillment I'm able to now achieve each and every day. This SD forum is the best. 
I am thankful to be alive and sober today...I am thankful for connections. I isolated a lot as my drinking increased. I haven't repaired all those friendships that I neglected. I have found new friends in sobriety. I am very thankful for all my friends.
I am thankful for this community. Who knew a little number next to my name would motivate me and a bunch of (extremely kind wonderful) internet strangers are keeping me accountable and have been encouraging me. I am thankful for a full night's rest and mornings without shame and hangovers. I am thankful for clarity which has helped me find freelance work. I am thankful for yoga which has been my "meeting" and has kept me calm and centered. I am thankful for my boyfriend who I feel like I'm falling in love with all over again.
I'm grateful for every person in my life who has rejected me dumped me or told me I'm not good enough. the experiences hurt at the time but they've been necessary catalysts for growth. in those dark and lonely moments I've discovered parts of myself that I never would have known in a perfect rosy world. by knowing first-hand that I can handle severe pain and loss I'm less afraid to take big risks that propel me to great places.
I am thankful that I know I have a problem. If I was unaware of my difficult relationship with alcohol and continued the way I was living for another 20 years I would have created a life with scorched earth trailing behind me. I am not perfect and I fail more often than I succeed with regards to controlling my urges. But I am aware of the situation and am always battling to improve it which hopefully means I won't waste the rest of my life drinking and ruining important relationships.
Today I'm thankful that even after almost 10 years of dangerous drinking I still have so much. I have a job a house a boyfriend a car a savings account no criminal record. Now that I've decided to stop drinking I can learn to enjoy all these privileges I've taken for granted.
I am thankful for my support and being cognizant of my own Paralyzing Doubt and actions I take to chip away at it and stay present. 
I am thankful that I know what I must do to be healthy. I am thankful that my wife agreed to see a councilor with me. I am thankful that even though I came close to losing everything that I might have a chance to earn it back 
I am thankful that I was sober and organised to send my son his birthday presents and card and that he is a beautifulhappy 7 year old.I am grateful to have a fantastic man in my life that has supported me for 5 years and has stopped drinking with me...I can't wait to marry him..I am thankful I am getting my debts organisedsaved a little money and will be taking my ex to court for access to see my son in the new year...I am thankful to myself for staying sober for 23 days.
I'm thankful I didn't ruin my life beyond repair. Could have. Made it harder than it needs to be. But somehow still have loving supportive people in it who want me to survive and thrive and are helping me do so. Thankful that my job and business may still be fixable. Thankful that now I know even if I stumble I'm totally capable of facing the challenges with a clear mind and a healthy body. Thankful that even after such a short time of total sobriety I can already feel a huge difference. Thankful that it's raining right now. Thankful that I'm still here.
I'm thankful for the blind luck of stumbling upon this sub and all of its members. Thank you all for convincing me to better myself and put things into perspective. Thank you for the support the advice the stories the motivation. 
I'm thankful that the morning after I slid around my bathroom floor finger painting with merlot vomit I hopped on r/fitness to look for posts about how alcohol consumption negatively affects workouts. I figured if anything would get me to stop it would be reading about physiological consequences. I found this sub mentioned on r/fitness and my life changed for the infinitely better from that day.
I'm thankful that you posted this. On point!
Hello thankful Thursday! I am so very thankful for this site and everyone here - your stories and posts inspire me on a daily basis and make me feel less alone. ..I am thankful for my incredible family for seeing the good in me always for the mind clearing hikes I had this summer for the hot yoga that has helped me sweat out the toxins and for the strength that helps me keep my chin up.  I am starting to see glimpses of my young -before alcohol self :)
I'm thankful that i don't have to drink tonight on top of everything else going on. 
I am thankful that in my 18 years of drunken lunacy I never physically injured hurt or killed anyone. I am thankful that whenever I inadvertently physically hurt myself that it was never life threatening. I am sorry it took so long for me to realize my way of life was far from normal but I am thankful that this new way of life has me feeling and thinking better than I have in a long long time.   I am thankful that even though my wife and best friend and best human I ever met was stolen from me by the universe and unfairly and unexpectedly passed away a year and a half ago at the age of 36 and is not physically here with me on Earth any longer that she still guides me in spirit every day I wake up. That is not something I could have been thankful for as I let my depressjon get worse and worse through alcohol abuse. 
I am thankful for yet another chance at getting this right I got to go back to rehab and now I am IOP. The IOP I am trying to get my attitude right about going but I know someone is dying to get into treatment somewhere so I am thankful I am able to. Also I am thankful Saturday is 30 days.
