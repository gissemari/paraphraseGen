When this no drinking thing started I had expected to relapse by the holidays. If anything I was expecting to relapse after the first 30 days to be honest...Even though the first 30 days came and went I grew more and more apprehensive about Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas. It was almost this subconscious desire to relapse. ..It was this internal critic which was encouraging me to drink during the holidays because I 'deserved' it for abstaining for so long. Or that this critic didn't think I had it in me to say no to a drink during and after these holiday dinners. ..Lo and behold and I don't want to get ahead of myself here but I managed to restrain myself and still be sober here on this board at 72 days. I hope I have the strength to stay sober during New Years. I need to continue proving this internal critic of mine wrong...Thanks for reading and I will not drink with you today.

I doubted myself most of the way too but look we're still here! Let's keep it going! I won't drink with you today. 
Hey it's pretty amazing what you've done.  I know it is said a lot that "one day at a time" but I am finding that it really applies to everything in my life.  Getting ahead of what I can do today gives me anxiety.
