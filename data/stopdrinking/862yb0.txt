I am on Day 3. I am snowed in with work pressures weighing on me - trying to work virtually- my loud and demanding teenage children and my husband on phone conferences for work in our living room. The house is a mess. I so want to knock myself out with alcohol just to get through this day...I know I will feel worse if I do that - I'm white knuckling it through and it's so hard I'm barely remembering to breathe. Drinking at home to escape is what I've done for years. I'm struggling. I. Will. Not. Drink. Today.

Hang in there.  The first week is the toughest and then the cravings often are much less.  If you stay  strong it will get better.  Good luck to you!
Stay with it. It's day 3 so your nerves are still raw. Try to remember that alcohol is a major cause of anxiety not a solution to it and as you get some sober time under your belt the family and work drama won't bother you as much. ..Sobriety won't magically fix all your problems but you'll start feeling better if you keep the booze out of your life. Really. 
I am right there with you - kids on spring break working from home and it's too cold to get them outside for long. I white knuckled through a lot of yesterday and I'm so glad I did today. I'm way more patient and present than I would have been if I relented. I'm taking it one thing at a time and I'm not drinking with you today.
I hear ya! Work at home got the husband in the middle of a huge project with phone calls coming literally every 15 minutes and his stress level through the roof. I just woke one teen up and assigned a chore list. Kinda got that "looking forward to 4:00 p.m." feeling going on. But being annoyed with them isn't worth poisoning myself over. IWNDWYT
