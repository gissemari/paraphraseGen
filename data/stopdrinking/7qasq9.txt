I know I don't come here very often but I do lurk.  I posted in here 3 months ago struggling with the fact that I wasn't losing weight and was having tons of stress and wanted to break...Well I'm happy to say that the cravings passed.  I'm losing weight  and been walking a lot which also helps with the stress...Thanks to all here :)..I'll not drink with you today!
