Hey everyone..I was wondering if anyone has ever heard of something similar? I also am in no way trying to encourage this as a form of alcohol cessation lol because I regret my suicide attempt 100%...Very briefly I've struggled with alcohol for awhile it worsening over these last 2 years. I was a bad binge drinker and it became worse when I started to binge drink 3-4 times a week even before going to work. I knew it was a problem and then attempted to stop but relapsed quite a few times. I relapsed after a 2 month stint of sobriety and felt hopeless. Then I attempted suicide. My body didn't handle it well and ended up throwing up the meds and I struggled through my overdose. I'm still currently suffering some side effects of the medication like memory impairment some balance and gait problems and general nausea but I am still going to work (aside from missing a day nobody is aware that I attempted suicide). The weird thing is that it has been 1.5 weeks and I have had no desire to drink at all. I'm actually grossed out by the thought of drinking. Has anyone heard of anything like this before? Again I am NOT trying to promote this because if I could go back and redo it I would NOT attempt suicide (not worth it because my body is very unhappy and my parents are devastated. I can't fix the emotional pain I brought them and I regret it 100%) ..Just wondering. Thanks you guys and IWNDWYT.

I'm glad you survived OP. I unfortunately can't answer your question (no personal experience with anything like that) but I just wanted you to know you are heard and valued and I hope you continue to heal!
Many years ago I had a similar situation. Binge drinking sometimes before work or social engagements. Then Months of sobriety (although not clean. Abusing Benzo psych meds and dxm). Relapsed. Cut my neck with a knife but couldn't bring myself to cut deep. Ended up in the psych ward overnight and quitting that job. Surprisingly that is not the low point of my journey which occurred with dui and broke near homelessness a few years later in 2011. Although struggling with drinking still things turned around in many other ways. You can get through this and if I can help you at all it's not worth drinking and you aren't alone in suffering from self harm thoughts. You are doing the right thing now. Is there anything more you think you should do - reaching out seeing someone for help? I don't know just asking
