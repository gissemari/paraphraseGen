I'm 81 days clean. That started with mom getting a restraining order going to jail couch hopping and 28 days in rehab. As I'm loading my bags from rehab into the trunk I saw a bottle of gin in the side netting area where mom keeps the cloth grocery bags etc. .She had just completed a 28 day VA rehab relapsed immediately spent a week back at the VA (psych unit) and came home to drop the restraining order and pick me up. .I didn't say anything about the bottle i found. I didn't want a fight my first night home and went to a meeting. .I need to be home to save money to move out but I see she is clearly still suffering. It is a really fucking terrible situation. I can't call her out because without her I'm homeless. .I'm trying to do this right. I can empathize with her but I never thought my mom would be this kind of desperate alcoholic. .Any input would be appreciated. Thanks..(I will delete this post in a day or so for the sake of anonymity.)

In the interest of immediate response /r/AlAnon might be a good place for support in dealing with your mother...For you--do you feel like being around your mother is a risk for you to drink? Because if it is I'd suggest that your first priority is to yourself and your safety even if that means getting out of there now. Do you have any options that you can create? Sober supportive friends with a couch or spare bed?..This sounds very tough. When you say you're trying to do it right I believe you. 
I'm sorry to hear that about your mom sethdavis1. It would be nice thing to have support at home and to be able to support her but if that's not in the cards you gotta take care of yourself. Maybe looking into a sober living house might be a good idea in your situation. Your local AA meetings would be a good place to look into those or if your rehab was a local lone you could ask them what some options are. All of the people in both of those places want nothing more than to see you succeed on your sober path you've started out on and will help you in any way they can. ..As sunjim mentioned you're a "double winner" (you and a loved one are both addicts) so AlAnon would be a good resource for you as well. ..My very best to you as you maneuver your way along this road.  You can do it!
