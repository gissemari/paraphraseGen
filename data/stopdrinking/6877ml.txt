I was out last night at a bar for a good friend and mentor's retirement. I had a lot of fun good conversations and lots of ginger ale. I was aware of the beer and shots going around but didn't feel like I was missing out. Or that I was having to consciously avoid it...That's my new normal...The summer I stopped drinking there were three upcoming events--a wedding and two work conferences--I was worried about. It took a lot of strategizing and effort to get through those events sober. The first retirement party I went to sober wasn't fun. It was a struggle. I've now been through four conferences three retirements and two weddings...It gets easier...Folks here assured me that it would get easier. If I could just get through the first few days the first few weeks the first months... That hope was important. That hope was motivating. That idea was something I clung to tightly in early sobriety. It took time over a year in my case but it DID get easier...Stick with it.

Thanks for the hopeful words! Glad you've gotten so comfortable in your sobriety I am excited to hopefully get there! 
Thank you so much for this. I needed to read it tonight. I won't drink with you!
How much time do you have? I'm almost a month and struggling like crazy on this nice Friday night.
Nailed it!
Enjoyed the post. That hope was motivating to me too. The idea that sobriety won't always be a struggle and that the benefits are real and lasting kept me going to find that point.
