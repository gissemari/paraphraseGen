For the past 7 months this is the longest time I have been without drinking. ..Probably the most liberating thing that happened around day 6-7 is the end of that endless cycle of thinking about drinking. Still at 5 days I was **constantly** thinking of 'just quitting this piece of shit sobriety I wanna get drunk'. Then something happened it actually seized to circle around in my head. It was so liberating. I wasn't focused on getting drunk. ..At 16 days it feels like I'm in a completely different world. The first 5 were spent in a dark place.. All I knew is that I had relapsed maybe 25 times this past year trying to quit for longer than a week and I always came back to drinking. In my mind I couldn't go further than just today because if I did I saw myself relapsing and feeling so fucking sorry for myself. I had to fight for *just today* or just *right now*...I have used pot as a tool to curb the strongest cravings towards alcohol. Also it's been a good self-reflection tool. One night I had a clear realisation how *insane* my "drink 8 beers to numb yourself" way of responding really was. But: I can see that I still have a tendency to want to escape the current life situation because I'm still lacking some tools to deal with everyday life. Pot can be an easy way out of those situations and honestly I don't want to use it every day to get away from negative feelings. It can be there for a special occasion and as a tool to growth. Pot certainly isn't for everyone if anyone feels they shouldn't do it I would never recommend that person to do it....I'm glad I haven't been drinking that's the main thing. The next step for me is to just learn to deal with life as it is raw and to the point...If you feel like I did in those first x days.. Keep going. It gets so much better. You will not stay in the hamster wheel of thinking of drinking. For some it may take longer for some maybe less. I did the pledge here everyday read posts. This subreddit is invaluable. During the first week I ate a lot of processed junk just to keep me from relapsing but since then I've been eating a whole foods plant based diet. I feel amazing right now.....

16 days is a long time without a drink...Sounds like you're at grips with using marijuana. My experience is that I found a hard drink the best cure for cotton mouth. I ended up putting all drugs and alcohol up.
It's good to hear that you're progressing well.  You're obviously on the right track and I especially like your approach of incremental changes and tweaks (such as with your diet and weed usage).   Keep it up!
