TLDR : Reached my initial 90 days goal need something new to keep going..Today marks that 3 month period. It all started as a challenge to myself after reading some of the post here. This subreddit gave the initial push I desperately needed to get started on the sober journey and for this I am graceful to all of you...At first I wanted to just do better than my previous dry period record (about 30 days) but I quickly realised that if I wanted to succeed and not go back to square one as usual I needed to commit a lot more.  So I did. I convinced my brain that this was a for ever change yes still taking the one day at a time trick but still a long period commitment. To be honest it was (and is) hard but also immensely rewarding. Particularly the first weeks you get the 'I am getting back on my feet' glow. Things starts to get easier and you can see direct benefits of sobriety (time money social and work achievement...) . But then it kinda fades away as you enter that new routine and maintaining become your new challenge. ..I think this sub is really helpful to get started but maybe less to maintain. My real life recovery group is not helping either. I can't relate to anyone over there as they all hit the bottom low of alcoholism before getting things under control. I know this group is not fitted for me but it is the only one available I have no idea if I will go back next week. I failed to make any meaning full connections. I am missing the mentoring and the friendship aspect of all of this. ..What I have learned. Cravings are real but can be managed. Things get easier and easier and suddenly harder for no reason but the more you go the more you fill you can do this (reading all the relapse stories here helps me keep my guard up). Family and friends have been more than cooperative and if it is not the case for you you should think about changing that environment as much as possible. I actually feel like I have been key for some people to realise that it is a problem for them as well (at least this is what my wife says).  The fact that I came make a difference in others life is greatly satisfying. ..So here I stand. 3 month ago my life was under control (family job money...) but I knew I had to do something before it wasn't. Half a bottle of whiskey every night is not something my body could handle for ever and I knew I could only spiralled down from there. Now what ?  Well I don't want to go back that is for sure. I need to rejuvenate my motivations. I need something to keep pushing to my next goal (maybe I need to define that next goal first). I am thinking about opening/joining a group where I could relate more to people I guess there is online option for that right ?..For all of you who have years behind them I admire your persistence. For all of you who are in week 1 I feel for you and envy you at the same time. For all of you who are thinking of taking this sober first step don't delay it is worth it.

Congratulations on 90 days. Yeah now what is a great question.  You mention a recovery group not sure if you are going to AA or not but AA has multiple groups and meetings in the more populated areas.  Another meeting might be a better fit.  Best to you.  Keep seeking solutions. They will come.
