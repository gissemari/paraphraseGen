I'm not sure why... as I sit here struggling with my own drinking issues I couldn't help but read this and think "Hey that's me... and I know I am a high functioning alcoholic but does this woman?" Or I am projecting my own issues onto the author? I used to sympathize with women like this I AM one of these women/moms. But last night as I'm struggling with coming to terms with my own alcohol addiction for the first time and reading this I was kinda sick reading it. More sick because of all the approving comments in the Facebook feed. I mean I read that one of the classic signs of a high functioning alcoholic is to believe that you deserve a "reward" daily. Every single day. And the author openly admits of this feeling yet proudly boasts that she could stop any time she wants to. What gives? I don't want to come off like I'm on some high horse because believe me I rode into this little club on what little shreds of dignity and self respect I still have left. Does anyone else feel like as they try and stop their drinking they are bombarded by cultural messages telling them that it's OK?..http://www.babble.com/parenting/i-could-live-without-wine-but-i-really-dont-want-to/?cmp=elp|none|natural|huffpo|2015-03-05||could-parent-wine

Yea that author seems deluded
It is my observation that most "high functioning" drinkers that "could stop anytime they want" never seem to want to.
I read this last night and was very irritated. Now I used to APPLAUD articles like this bc they made me feel better about my choices.  ..The comments on FB were interesting; lots of people who clearly don't drink but don't have a problem were pretty horrified by the amounts described in the article.  
Didn't the last heavy drinking mommy blogger finally come out as a full blown alcoholic a few years ago? 
I used to enjoy events where dads were carrying toddlers in one hand and icy cold 24oz beers in the other or thought kids' birthday parties were times for kegs. Those were just events where I didn't have to hide ALL my drinking though...It took a while but being fully present and sober with my kids is SO much better and more fun than the rosy buzz I strived for but often missed.
