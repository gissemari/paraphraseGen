I reset my badge from 423 to 8 days.  I had slips (singular days here and there) over the past 12 months but I never felt that I had to reset. However I had a 10 day relapse over the holiday break and felt I needed to hold myself accountable - and that feels good.  Too bad I have to start again but I have learned so much which makes it ok.

Like they say that badge is for you.  Every time I have reset it has been for the best for me.  I might be telling myself oh it's not that important and then as soon as I reset I am in a better place.  IWNDWYT
I'm right there with you it's always better to be honest with yourself.  I'm on day for and I will not drink with you today.
I'm with you. Badge reset brings up mixed emotions.
