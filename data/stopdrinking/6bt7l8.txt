The demon's whisper caught my ear some weeks ago.  "moderation". The insidious thought swept its way across my synapses and before long I was back to drinking every weekend then every day then too much every day and then yesterday I did what I had promised to never do again. I have to stop again.  I have to get control of my life.  I need to go to AA.  fuck.

OK then. At least you know what you need to do to pull yourself out the abyss. It sounds like this is not the first time. So use what you know works and get to it. Here's the thing about AA. They do not just show up when you need them. "Knock knock It's AA!" You gotta go get them. They will help you. They will light the path and get you on your way. AA saved my life back in 2013 and helped me recover from a nasty relapse last year. Good luck to you!
