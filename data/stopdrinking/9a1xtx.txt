This is a common line read here over and over and over. I just read it referring to a relapse. I honestly don't think I have ever said that to myself. Think about it we like to get fucked up!! That's what alcohol is all about. I like that feeling after 5 or 6 good strong drinks and I want more much more. If you say "just one drink" to yourself really ask yourself what you liked about drinking is one drink gonna do it? IWNDWYT

One drink is my ticket back to the nightmare.  I won't be drinking it today!
I have realized for me the madness starts with 1 drink. IWNDWYTD! 
I know back to my beginnings I quickly figured that just one drink was a waste of 1 oz of valuable booze. Better to not drink at all... unless I was going to have several at a minimum.  .
I had that **thought** when a friend left me a nice can of beer after a small bday party for my wife earlier in the month..  It took a bit for me to "*reason*" with it that night.  ...It's still in the fridge.  I see it once in a while.  It sees me. It reminds me..I'll save it for a friend/host gift or beer can chicken and a BBQ sauce.  ...I **WANT** this.  And another day..Cheers eh
One is too many and a hundred isn't enough...So glad to be on the other side of it.  So far..   IWNDWYT
I remember a music festival I went to a couple of months ago. I said I would only have one alcoholic drink and then stick to Diet Coke. I didn't just have one drink I had three or four and I went and got more on my way home. Think I still had some left the day after so I naturally had to get some more to ensure I got to my goal of being drunk...IWNDWYT!
I don't think I ever had "just one". 
The only time I ever reliably had one drink was in the early days of my marriage when I had just one drink when we went out to eat. By the end it was always at least two strong drinks. It was never just one drink at home.
Just one?  Never for me.  I have studied normies extensively.  They have from 1-3 drinks at the most.  Me stop there?  Gotta be kidding me.  
Very true... Its just never enough IWNDWYT
I don't see the point of one drink. If I can't get fucked up I'd rather use the calories for ice cream!
