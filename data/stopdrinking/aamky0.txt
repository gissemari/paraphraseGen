I'm new here to SD but not new to this desire to stop drinking. I just haven't been able to accomplish this goal in the 4 years I have been struggling with trying to remain sober. I don't want to give up but it seems I get a week or 2 of sobriety sometimes a whole month then I go and drink one night. I always get right back on the wagon the next day. Until another week or 3 has gone by then I fall off for a night. Has anyone else dealt with this type of merry go round successfully? And if so I could really use your advice and insight into how you finally kicked the bottle for good.

Yes.  I tried quit for 2.5 years and couldn't manage more than a handful of days...Then I came to Stop Drinking.  My first day of posting was at day 17. I've been sober since. This community made the difference for me.  My advice would be that finding sober community and going there regularly can help.  This might be Stop Drinking AA SMART or whatever works.  It made the difference for me! Good luck! I'm rooting for you. IWNDWYT 
I think this is a common pattern. It was for me. I found that checking in here and reading other people's posts really helped. Also there are lots of online resources. I think AA and Smart recovery both have meetings but I am not sure how that works. I like podcasts too. I listen to Recovery Elevator. You can get all their episodes free on their website  which also offers some other resources. Also This Naked Mind has a free 30 day challenge online. You can sign up and get daily messages. Journaling can be helpful too. Finding support and tools to deal with situation has been key for me. Best wishes. I will not drink with you today :)
