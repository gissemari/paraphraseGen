Today is my six-year-anniversary. I wanted to put my story out here in the hope that it will help to inspire others. ..I started drinking when I was thirteen. I believe that I was alcoholic from the time I took my first drink. I LOVED alcohol. I loved the way it made me feel and think. I was the person I always wanted to be. I was funny smart confident and cool. People loved me and I loved them. It was like warm liquid sunshine flowing into my body. That first time I drank way too much and ended up being arrested and as a result of the party I threw having my parent's house get trashed. The thought that  Maybe I shouldn't drink  NEVER crossed my mind. I just resolved to do it  right  next time...I am not going to spend a lot of time on a long drunk-a-log. Alcohol and drugs slowly became the main focus of my life. I could not imagine doing anything if not at least slightly intoxicated (ideally highly intoxicated). Drinking worked for a long time. It got me friends girlfriends and promotions. It made me into the person I thought I wanted to be. Then it changed gears on me and much to my amazement I could not get it to work for me again. It took me years of trying to actually realize that...From 2006 to 2010 I struggled to control my drinking. I tried Naltrexone Anabuse meditation a five day voluntary stint in rehab a five day involuntary stint in a mental institution and several overnights in the local ER. I lost two jobs most of my friends and several girlfriends. I became severely depressed and began drinking for days at a time. Morning drinks were necessary to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Mostly I lost myself. I became a complete piece of shit. Stole from my parents lied to everybody and became trapped inside myself paralyzed by dread and incapable of change. ..So I tried to kill myself cause why the fuck not? The next day I went down to my parent's house with my wrists bandaged (I did it myself I did not call anyone or anything like that) and drank. I decided that day would be the day I found myself again. I would get back that old desire to win and damn it I would be somebody! What instead happened is that I drank all day and never got drunk and never passed out. I remember every moment of that day...The next day February 2 2010 is my sobriety date. I woke up feeling like death. In retrospect I really should have gone to a doctor but I was too ashamed. I did start going to a therapist who after about five minutes of meeting with me strongly suggested I go to AA. I fucking HATED AA. I had already tried it and I drank again ergo the program did not work and I was wasting my time going. It was full of old people and nobody like me. .BUT I had to look at my life and realize that whatever I was doing was not working. I was on the verge of losing another job had no friends my blood pressure was off the charts I was vomiting all the time but I got this right? My life is still manageable right? WRONG. It took me a long time to get to the place where I could realize that. So I started going to meetings. I hated them at first full of a bunch of self-righteous blowhards that were trying to convert me to Christianity! Then I started actually listening to people and talking before and after and I found that my ideas were all wrong. Nobody wanted to convert me most people were just like me. Just trying to figure out their lives not drink and be happy while doing it...This is getting long so I will sum up. Today six years later EVERYTHING is different and without exception better. On the material side I have a car that runs a job that values me and a condo that does not suck. On the emotional side I have a loving wife a nine-month-old daughter who is the light of my life and friends/family who love me. I don't hate myself today. I can talk about a higher power helping me to stay sober without irony or bitterness. I wake up and go to sleep with no regrets. I am honestly truly happy something that drinking NEVER gave me. AA literally saved my life so I feel like I owe it a Wookie-style life debt. I love it it is not a chore it is a gift. I am a logical kind of guy so I will end with this:..Going to meetings + Working the Steps = Happy Life..TLDR: Sobriety kicks fucking ass..

Haha your start in AA sounds awfully familiar... ..Congratulations on six years! What would you say is the biggest thing you will do today to keep you sober? 
Great post - thank you and congrats!  I agree that when my brain finally shuts up and listens I hear what I need.  This post should be added to Sunday Solutions imo.
Nice congrats!  ..I used to stare down at the tables in AA bc every time someone mentioned God or Higher Power I would roll my eyes and think about how fucking stupid everyone in the room was.  But as time passed I realized that these "fucking stupid people" seemed to be able to handle their mental and emotional shit way better than I could.  So I listened more...Ya know I don't really love tortilla chips but I do love quesadillas.  So I still go to Mexican restaurants. I don't have to eat the chips just cause they're on the table.  I can get my quesadilla and be perfectly happy.  :)
Congrats! Thanks for laying your past out and your shiny now.
For a long post it was a very compelling read. Thanks.
A big **BRAVO** for six years /u/Thornkale. Thanks for this inspirational post. Your contributions to the recovery subreddits make a difference. Hearing about your journey gives hope to others. 
Congrats on 6 years. ..It is funny how people think that they are unique and different when they first get sober only to find out they are all the same. ..Your story is pretty close to mine and I love hearing other stories as it keeps me remembering what it could be like again unless I follow the path...Thanks for sharing your story and Congrats
# YEAH!!!!
Congrats on six years! Yours is a powerful story!
This is powerful and really inspiring thank you for sharing. What's your higher power if I may ask? I'm still new in AA but my higher power is fellowship/togetherness/basically the group itself. I have a strong tendency to self-isolate and try to do everything on my own but I can't quit drinking on my own. The group makes that possible for me...I'm an atheist and still struggling with some of the other members' God-talk. But so far the group is meaningful and powerful enough for me to stick around especially because I feel like I'm out of other options.
amazing job! congrats. Look forward to being there myself one day.
Wow. Thanks. This gives me hope.

Awesome Job! 
*"What instead happened is that I drank all day and never got drunk and never passed out. I remember every moment of that day."*..I don't know why but that made me incredibly sad and gave me the chills at the same time. 
Daughters are awesome.  Got two of them. Oldest in high school. Damn time flies. Enjoy that family.  You sound like a lucky guy.
You sure did inspire someone. I'm here once again after my latest binge. I've been on the treacherous cycle of an alcoholic. Binge drinking deciding I need to get sober start feeling good again Binge myself back to oblivion. I had it going for 2 months there when I had met a girl. She was very goal oriented and I wanted to be clean to impress her. We went on a date. We were talking everyday and I really started to like her. Then I lost her ( not due to drinking for once). I've been drinking ever since. I've been trying to quit without any support system..You've inspired me to just get off my ass and go to meetings.
Damn your story hit home! Congrats on six years! I hope to be there myself in due time
Congratulations!!! Thank you so much for sharing.
Thanks for posting this! I'm new here just trying to get started being sober and your story gives me a big lift.
