So my badge is wrong now because I have to reset again. However I made it 6 days before relapsing. I know this doesnt seem like a HUGE accomplishment but it was a very big deal for me. I've never made it that long before and despite having to start over I know that I can push further. I don't feel like I'm as much of a failure and I know there's always the opportunity to try again (which I did and I didn't drink today). I think really looking at it as a day by day thing has really helped. I know that I can't even have one sip as it always leads to benders that can last for days. But even just taking it minute by minute: if I can make it past this minute where I'm craving alcohol I'll be okay...Side note: if you've had experience with SMART can you give me a little background on how meetings work? I got on the website but it didn't really give me the info I was looking for. Do we need the workbook or is that not necessary? I've been to and continue to go to AA but it can't hurt to know what other things are out there.

At the start even little bits of progress can be huge victories. Great work and keep going in the right direction.
SMART meetings are lead by a facilitator who discusses topics related to compulsive behaviours like alcoholism. I got the books and they're really really good - definitely worth a read...AA has been a huge help for me but it didn't do much until I got a good sponsor and worked the steps. Warming a seat at a meeting isn't "working the program" - that's the fellowship part. Working the steps is the program.
