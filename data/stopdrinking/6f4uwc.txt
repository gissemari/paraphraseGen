So I try to quit off and on mainly for weight loss and money savings reasons decided to try to go all of June without a drink and have so far been successful. Tonight's been rough. I'm in a long stretch of workdays and tonight's usually my traditional night where I can drink more because I get off early and don't have to go in until later tomorrow. .All day at work was fine kept thinking how smooth this was gonna be. As soon as I left BAM! craving some drinks hard. I tried just taking a nap went for a long drive after walked around a few stores not helping. I decided I'd grab just one 6 pack for the night but the store was out of the specific one I wanted so I took that as a sign and left. Still craving a drink bad but I feel like I'm somehow just making it harder on my self by constantly thinking about it. ..I told my friend I was giving up alcohol he jokingly said I wouldn't make it past the 8th sucks to be struggling this early. I have a family party tomorrow and I'm planning on telling a couple people about my goal that's really the only thing keeping me going tonight. I feel like I'm just stalling myself until it's too late to drink and I have to go to bed. ..Sorry for the rambling just wanted to type this out and get some of the frustration off my chest

Hang in there you can do it. Before you know it you'll be in bed and going to sleep sober. You'll definitely thank yourself in the morning. 
Often going to bed is the answer.
Early days...forget about one ***day*** at a time sometimes they were about one-***minute***-at-a-time and if I was lucky one-***hour***-at-a-time.  [The Baby Steps] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) helped a lot during this time too..
I was in your shoes on Friday. It felt like time just slowed down and I had way too much of it on my hands. I went to a cafe for some people watching and everyone around me is drinking beer and talking about how they plan to drink into the night. At that point I just ran straight home. I made it through the evening and was extremely thankful in the morning. My main problem was that I had no productive/creative plans to keep my mind occupied. 
milkshake. it really fucking helped me in the beginning when those physical cravings really hit. like walking home after work and all i could hear was those two voices arguing in my head "have a drink" "no i'm not gonna have a drink" and so on and i could feel my skin literally itching for alcohol. i would stop just stop in a diner/fast food place and get a big old milkshake and that would kill the craving. try it! :-)
Can you make a plan?  How about writing up a list of the pros and cons of drinking?  What are you going to get from sobriety?  I'm keeping a lot of LaCroix around.  Smart Recovery has a workbook on amazon or their site I paid $15.  It is all about strategies to stop any kind of addiction.  I won't drink with you tonight.
I am currently in the same space. I haven't had a drink in 6 weeks and it's mostly due to a big move to San Diego at the end of this month I have to save money for and I've been on a massive health kick and have been losing a lot of weight. But tonight there's finally good weather and I am craving an ice cold beer right now. I really do love the taste of beer and I miss it and I really don't know if I should break my streak. especially since I look and feel rested and I am lucky to not have things like alcoholic recovery forcing me sober. It's mainly just a personal choice but idk if even one beer will ruin the hard work I've done so far.
