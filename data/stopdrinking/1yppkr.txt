I stopped drinking January first I remember that being the last drink I had. I had quit before that but had a sip of the bubbly at a party on the new year. Not really my quit date coincidence really not a resolution. I haven't been counting the days but take it one day at a time. I wanted to share you guys something that I found I really enjoy and never took the time to do before. Being sober and not hungover I found I really like breakfast. I can't explain the joy I feel from waking up early to the sun coming up warm cup of coffee slowly going over what things I have accomplished the week before what I plan on accomplishing. No clouded thoughts just one solitary voice my own; crisp clear and my own. There is a simple satisfaction in that it is simple not confusing or complex. Also cooking a nice breakfast is great and something I've never been fond of before. I can say to those of you struggling keep your hope strength and mind; it is all a gift and you have the power to keep it...[Thought I'd share](http://i.imgur.com/ZtzAOj7.jpg)

Congrats /u/PandaCasserole on your forward progress.
Congrats! That breakfast sure looks good. 
I agree! I love mornings now that I've quit drinking. Today I slept in and while it's technically early afternoon I have already applied to two jobs and am planning my week. Productivity is great =]
I always loved coffee on the porch bright and early when the world is  quieter.  I guess that depends on where you live.  That is a quality breakfast if I've ever seen one.  Thanks for sharing!
