This is deliberately vague to protect the innocent...&amp;#x200B;..A friend and coworker opened up today about their sibling. A bright person who had a great career. Lots of travel had everything kind of deal. A sibling they are obviously very fond of...They are currently in hospital with liver failure. Lots of fluid retention (liters drained through their chest swollen stomach ect). They are in the last stages of this terrible disease. ..Their sibling is not that old approaching 50 but not going to make the milestone. There was a scare awhile back that could have been enough had it been used to change the current situation. After a month long stay in hospital that was their excuse to go on a massive bender not actually take stock of the reality of the situation. A year later the price of that decision is now going to be paid in full...The toll its taking on my friend is plain to see the hurt the upset ect. Since I am in recovery I feel guilty I cannot rationalize it but its there. It has hit home with me quite hard. I'm the same age and was heading in the same direction. It could be me in that situation if not this year maybe the next. I am lucky that I had the opportunity to quit and I seized it. ..Sometimes its good to remember that this community saves lives. Everyone on here has a struggle everyone is fighting a battle with real consequences. Each day is a victory that is earned hard...&amp;#x200B;..Stay Strong &amp; be there for each other. Its good work that is done on this sub. IWNDWYTD.

Thank you so much for sharing. I needed to hear this today
I'm sorry that your friend is dealing with this. Alcoholics can do horrible things while drinking but many of us are otherwise lovely intelligent and kind people. There's no personality traits or accomplishments that can protect a person against alcoholism and plenty of people drink themselves to death who have an otherwise great life. It's a baffling and powerful condition. IWNDWYT
