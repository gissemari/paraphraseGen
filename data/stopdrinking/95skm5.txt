I feel like this is going to be long but I am trying my best! My fianc  has been I guess what you'd call a moderate but everyday drinker for years. Used to be every day after work he would come home and drink 1/2 to a bottle (5th) of vodka with sprite. When we started dating we had several talks about it. After a long time of denying it was an issue he finally said it was. He cut down. Instead of drink 7-8 strong drinks he'd drink 3-4. In the past few months he's switched over to wine. Now he only drinks vodka when out - not just daily. He usually drinks about a bottle of wine a night. ..I was gone for a year for residency and when I came back and began living with him a few weeks ago he realized drinking a bottle of wine a night is still problematic for him. I think it took him seeing me live without it or on certain nights drinking it with him to realize this isn't what he wanted anymore. He also wants to be healthy and realizes this is keeping him back. The problem is he is still really ambivalent about it. It's his routine to drink after work. I bought la croix and juice kombucha and some other random drink. I feel like replacing it might help? I just know there will be a lot of internal struggle happening soon and I would like anyone's advice about how I can be supportive. ..For context I do drink. Sometimes a lot and sometimes not at all. It's never been an issue for me. I'm obviously not going to drink when he doesn't especially at home. I understand addiction from a medical and psychological perspective (bc of my field) but that isn't what he needs from me. It also sometimes creates this weird dynamic between us where he wants to stop partly because of our relationship even though I've never told him he has to but he gets snappy or even slightly resentful at me when he's irritable. It doesn't happen a lot but I never exactly know how to deal with it. ..I have no idea if I make sense here. Basically how can I help? What would you like your partner to do or not do or say or not say in a similar situation? How can I help someone through something I only understand intellectually but don't feel?

You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group for people who love an alcoholic and they will be better able to give you support. Or you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues...
