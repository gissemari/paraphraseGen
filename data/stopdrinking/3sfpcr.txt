I had been doing so well. Constantly reminding myself of my goals everything that i'd been working towards. Sure it was a struggle at first..but lately had been getting easier. I was at dinner when the temptation started. The smells everyone else was taking part and I felt left out. I kept telling myself to be strong on my resolve......But then the onslaught of mexican food began. I've been living in India where good mexican is unheard of. But my god these nachos looked so delicious the burrito was perfectly made and oh the enchilada sauce. I couldnt take it anymore!!!! I had been doing so well on my diet; counting calories working out religiously even fitting into my old 29 waist jeans. But I caved and ate everything! I couldn't help myself. It was so delicious...Oh well tomorrow is a new day. Tomorrow i'll go for a nice long run and try and work off my excess intake. But for now gluttony is ok with me and should be alot easier since there weren't any additional calories from drinking. Oh yea people were drinking alot along with the meal. But honestly I was so focused on trying not to eat my own weight in cheese that I didn't even realize that the temptation to drink wasn't really an issue. ..Have a happy healthy and sober Wednesday everyone. And Happy Diwali to my fellow brown sobernauts. ..TL;DR: Ate my weight in mexican food. Messed up my diet but didn't have a single sip of alcohol.
