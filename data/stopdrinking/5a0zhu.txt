I relapsed yesterday after getting dumped by a girl I was really into (I'm not effed up while writing this) and my anxiety is through the roof right now. Has anyone else gone through this stuff while trying to salvage their sobriety? I've tried reaching out to people in my AA program but I think they might have a 6th sense about relapses because no one has returned my phone calls. ..I might go into outpatient rehab in the coming weeks spoke with my therapist today. I know this isn't the most coherent post but it's probably just a function of my anxiety. If anyone has any advice or could maybe relate it would be really appreciated. I'm less worried about the relationship ending than I am about the relapse. ..For some context I'm a 24 year old man. ..Thank you

I had to end a relationship because I could not stay sober if it continued. I needed to focus on building a relationship with myself in early sobriety. Some of your anxiety may be a component of alcohol withdrawal. ..Getting more support with an outpatient program is a wonderful idea. I learned a great deal...Worrying is a waste of energy. Stay sober today and you're a winner!
You have my empathy. I had a great relationship with the man of my dreams and it ended. Because of my drinking. I went on a long binge. When I realized that I will never be able to have a healthy relationship with a good person if I don`t stop drinking I checked myself into rehab for 3 months. ..I definitely think you should try the outpatient rehab. You`re still young and can prevent a lot of emotional and physical damage to your body. ..I though AA was supposed to support you - especially if you relapsed? That sounds like some weird people if they don`t help you when you a struggling. ..I hope it works out for you and that you get the help you need.
