Relapsed and threw up on a bus full of people i know. They wouldn't stop to let me out. Had over 20 drinks including the vodka in the drink i showed up with. Reaffirmed me wanting to stop drinking though!

Welcome back!  Public vomiting isn't fun but it is survivable.  I didn't make it to the bathroom in time at my school's annual fundraising dinner and then I didn't open the window in time on the way home...What's your plan going forward?  I'm grateful that digestive predicability is a huge benefit of continuous sobriety.  Best to you.
Yikes is right Helenkeller... yu got it. Iv been there many moons ago and then again not so very many moons ago.  ...... yu are not alone in this.  .and IWNDWYT!
