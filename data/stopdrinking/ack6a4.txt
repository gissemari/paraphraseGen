I'm in the process of entering inpatient detox and then an inpatient 30 day program. I've been an alcoholic since I was in high school and it took me this long to realize I will only continue to have a 100% failure rate with relationships and will continue too.  I've quit multiple times and this is the worst relapse of my life. I'm coming down from a three day binge fest that has me terrified of quitting in a facility that doesn't specialize in it. ..The only thing that has me nervous is I still have to wait a week for a bed and the thoughts of continuing this binge just have me in anxiety tremors I think it's also because I'm trying to quit pot now. . .And to the girl I was seeing said I was in love with during a blacked out New Year's Eve; if you ever read this way to look out for yourself and bail. You saved my life.
