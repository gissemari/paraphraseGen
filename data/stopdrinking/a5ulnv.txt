I've quit hundreds of times and typically relapsed after 2-3 weeks.  A month ago I got some terrible news about someone very close to me and somehow had the foresight for once to know if I dove into a bottle I probably wouldn't come back this time.  Quitting feels different this time and I feel fantastic (which seems to be normal for people not sick from booze all the time).  I've lost 10lbs so far have the motivation to go to the gym 4-5 days a week eat better and even feel smarter.  I like it here and I'll be damned if anyone including myself is dragging me back.  Thanks for letting me share.  IWNDWYT.
