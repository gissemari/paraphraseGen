The first time I quit I told my mom I was done with alcohol. Alcohol has been the route of a lot of problems in my family including my parents divorce. She was 100% on board and even said she would quit with me. We both started playing around with moderation at the same time. When I got back on the wagon she supported me but didn't hop on the same way she did the first time. ..Yesterday I got a phone call from her and she said  I drank too much yesterday I feel like shit and I'm ready to call it quits with you again. I'm so glad we have each other and can share this. ..This phone call is probably what kept me from drinking at a friends birthday last night. It is so incredibly important to have support and people in your corner who understand the struggle. So appreciative of her and these boards today. ..Happy Sunday everyone! Hope you all had a wonderful sober weekend and if not I hope it's at least a great sober Sunday! :)

I wish with my whole heart that my mom was like your. But she's not...and yet I get such vicarious joy from this post   !!
I've found that trying to quit with people I know is harder. I've had friends and dam say they're quitting too but then buckle and disappoint themselves. It starts a feedback loop in my head of "well so and so started so why not"..I'm not trying to say no support is better though! I've gotten closer with people I've met who are also going through it strangers and of course SD has been a big help. 
Wow! That sounds like a great support system.
I'm glad you have that support system. I've always been told to keep people around that into bettering you and themselves. Somehow I always just end up with toxic people around me. Stay the path!
