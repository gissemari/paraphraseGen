51 full days sober since my last drink on April Fools' Day. ..86 recovery meetings...2 long weekends. ..1/2 century...0 drinks. ..I'm just feeling grateful and I want to say thank you to you all for the support. I had tea last night with the person I am working the steps with and I was able to speak honestly about some struggles and triumphs I'm running across. I wouldn't have that opportunity if it wasn't for you all.

I might just have to play those in the lottery ;)
