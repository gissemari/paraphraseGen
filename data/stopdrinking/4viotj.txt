You're human. Humans make mistakes. I'm proud to be here with you.
Glad you're back. Thanks for the post.
Welcome back! To me the most important thing I could do following a relapse was rededicate myself to sobriety and do something different. For me that usually meant adding a support. Because like a lot of us I thought I was different and I could do this all on my own. I'm not saying that some people aren't like that. But I couldn't do it on my own...I also learn to track back early warning signs of a relapse. For me those were sneaky thoughts that started planning to drink long before it was really planted in my brain. Once I was aware of these beginning thoughts I was able to do something about it. I talked to my old sponsor I shared it with my therapist I wrote on here...Best wishes! And I'm glad you posted!
