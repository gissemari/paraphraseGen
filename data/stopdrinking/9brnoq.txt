I struggled to just keep my mind off the thought of drinking. Making lists in my head about the pro's and con's. .Just kept telling myself that I can't allow myself to contemplate it cause it's always ALWAYS gonna end up with me and a bottle. I was especially struggling with the thought that it's ridiculous that I can't allow myself to think about certain stuff but just had to do it. Mindlessly. Like some sort of religion. And I think religion is the plague of man. .Anyway I powered through just stuffed my face with nachos until I was too full and tired to drink and went to bed early..Today I'm glad I made that decision as always. .Last exam tomorrow. Hope I don't fall off the wagon after..IWNDWYT.

 wishing you luck buddy  iwndwyt.
Good luck on your exam. ..I find it easier to focus on just today. It's difficult to worry about a day in the future but I can stay sober for today and then repeat that tomorrow.
