Dear friends.Can someone once again tell me what it really is?.I tried to check the past posts but still confused. .Also wikipedia is not accessible in my country...I'd appreciate your help because I suspect I experience this effect after several relapses

Hey Parmex - congrats on 8 days!...Kindling is real and it gets worse every time we try to stop drinking...I pulled [this info about kindling](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-1/25-34.pdf) from our FAQ's - and it's from NIH not Wikipedia per your request ;)...
[Here's a pretty good explanation.](https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-kindling-effect-of-addiction/) To put it simply: the Kindling Effect is when acute withdrawal symptoms and post-acute withdrawal symptoms will become worse and worse the more you relapse...therefore causing it to be more difficult to quit after each time you relapse. Fear of the Kindling Effect is definitely something I keep in mind in order to stay on the path of sobriety.
