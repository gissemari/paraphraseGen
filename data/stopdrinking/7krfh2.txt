Its nearly 6 in the morning and I can't sleep been working odd hours and called in Ill today as I've got a fluey thing. Shitty thoughts and loneliness combined with a messed up sleep schedule illness and the lack of sunlight with the weather have been really getting to me...At the same I have a lot more perspective than last year. I have choice. I know myself better and I'm more aware of things that get me down what things I can do to make myself feel better and slightly more about what I want from life. That also includes what I don't want which has been hard...To anyone reading this who thinks they might have a problem or has recently got involved here - it gets easier. Everything gets easier. That doesn't mean life isn't hard...Even though I'm struggling mentally this time last year I had the same problems and it was nearly killing me on a daily basis because my coping method was alcohol. It just made me feel worse in every way. I couldn't deal with anything. Now I can deal with some of those things not all of them. But I can choose which ones make a plan and get shit done...Things I worried about which I don't care about anymore:..I won't be fun - I'm way more alert and on point with jokes way more energy at parties and with friends and I don't have a massive anxiety about when the current drink will end and where the next one is and will it make me feel better and oh god I need to be the level of drunk that person is or they don't need as much as me I need to do some shots. Like fuck do I need something that slows me down to make me enjoy things more...I won't sleep - Overall I actually get to sleep a little easier and feel more rested. Still a big issue but always has been...I won't be able to cope when I just HAVE to get drunk to deal with a big issue - Suddenly there are a lot less big issues / excuses for me to use so I don't have to deal with things. Sometimes I feel very bad about something very bad and I just go through the feeling. Sometimes it takes a few hours or a few days. It used to take months or years or never really get addressed...The biggest thing is I feel like my brain is operating at 100%. Sometimes that leads to me feeling like what I'm doing in life is boring. That's also very likely to be true so I'm working on changing it. I get to work on my life the way I want it to be...Anyway you're all awesome this community is great and I read most days. If you're a lurker like me say hi. If you're new say hi or post something yourself and people are really helpful and open. You might find someone in a similar situation who can give some good advice. It might help try it..
