Once every month or so I dream that I've started drinking again.  The decision to drink is always casual and non-dramatic but then I have to come here and reset my badge which is where all the stress comes from like I'm disappointing the people in this community.  Your opinions must mean a lot to me...I know you guys would help even if I did relapse...thank you for being so supportive!

year later i still get relapse dreams.  i pay them no attention.  
These dreams are crazy! I'd read of people having them and brushed them off but now I've had them twice in 2 nights. ..Glad it was just a dream! Whew! 
Oh yeah.  Just had one the other night.  They're good reminders to stay vigilant.
I read on the FAQ where a scientist speculates that these dreams are our sleeping mind trying to remind us how much we want to stay sober. I feel better about these dreams since I read that. 
The relapse dream. I am left feeling guilty for hours; about something that never happened! Sure beats drinking though. .
I had one last night too. Normally (my whole life not just since I began drinking) I almost never remember my dreams but this one was vivid. I could actually feel the disgusting hotness of chugging liquor mid-bender. I woke up in a bit of a panic and for the first few seconds I thought I actually *was* mid-bender vaguely remembering the blackout of the previous day. Then I realized - hey I don't feel like complete shit right now! That's right - I'm getting sober. What a relief that was.
