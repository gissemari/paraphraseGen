I relapsed after almost exactly that amount of time as well. Let's both stay sober today. Good luck to you!
What do you mean you were not sober and not drinking?..How did you relapse? I ask because the stories help (us) others to keep our guard up...Welcome back!
Welcome back!  Do you have a plan for what you're going to do differently?
What a terrific insight. There is a difference!
&gt;I realize that even though I was not drinking I was not sober...Powerful words!  Welcome back and good luck moving forward.
How were you not sober? Were you taking other drugs?.
