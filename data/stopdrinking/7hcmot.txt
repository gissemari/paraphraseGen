Had to start my counter over and I need to hear about withdrawal. I've experienced hangovers a ton but I've been throwing up for days and I've never had a hangover like this. I had a three day bender as a relapse and I honestly don't know how much I drank. Am I just sick or is this alcohol withdraw? Advice?..Also I appreciate all of you. You've changed my life (despite my relapse).

Its everything. Alcohol is a poison and its proven fact. Once it made me that sick i was vomiting my scull felt like its goiing to blow up my liver was sore and heart pumping.. then i had a panic attack and felt like im dying.. it will go away eventually but remember that its a poison and it gives u a fake happiness. So stay away from  it if u cant stop on one glass/shot.. i never can. Always ended up drunk and sick. .Im not drinking tonight. Yay!! Drink heaps of water! 
See the doctor if u throwing up more then 2 days..
