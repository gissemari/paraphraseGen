Hello SD!..&amp;#x200B;..I am 1 year and 27 days sober and it feels pretty great. Back when I used to drink I loved going out alone specifically to concerts/shows and the movie theater. Since I've stopped drinking I've bought multiple tickets to music shows I would have loved to have gone to but chickened out each time. The reason being mostly fear of relapsing but also things in my personal life were/are very distracting as well...&amp;#x200B;..I really regret not going to those shows and have recently purchased tickets to 2 upcoming shows (within the next several months) and I look forward to pushing myself to go. Within the past day or so I discovered a comedian I really like is going to be performing at a venue 1.5hrs away from me cheap tickets and the show is only in a couple of weeks! A big part of me thinks I should really put myself out there and go but I have to be honest I'm not sure going to a comedy show alone will be viewed similarly as going to the movies or a concert alone. ..&amp;#x200B;..I did check out the reviews and website of the venue and I'm fairly certain there is no beverage requirement so I don't have to worry about that but I just think I'll feel odd or sad sitting in a seat alone either with an empty chair next to me or groups on either side of me. Driving myself out there to see a comedy show would be a huge accomplishment for me and I think would really affect my mental health in a positive way - but I have these fears...&amp;#x200B;..Does anyone else share these fears or has anyone been in a similar situation?..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT

I have been to a comedy show alone.  I go a lot of places alone when I travel for work and it feels a bit weird but I don't have much choice in those situations.  No one there knows I am in town for work though so maybe people think I am odd but I know and I am comfortable with it...If they do have a drink requirement it is usually more of a spending minimum.  Like I can get two appetizers instead of two drinks or I can just give them $20 and say you drink the drinks...And once everyone is seated all eyes are on stage so it just takes being strong that first 10-15 minutes while people are finding seats.
I'd go for it.. if the seats are unassigned as they usually are with comedy shows you could arrive early and tell the host that you'll be sitting for 1.. and even if there are beverage minimums it doesn't mean you need to order an alcoholic beverage.  .With the time you have sober it may just be a little mental preparation for you to move forward...Hope this helps..
