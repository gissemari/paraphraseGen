It's been a week since I quit the beer and I am profusely sweating throughout the night. It's quite bad it wakes me up in the night. My temperature is normal but the bed is soaking. I haven't suffered with any other withdrawal symptoms apart from general difficulty sleeping which has gone now. Any idea on how long this usually lasts? I feel worse for my partner. Poor woman.

I feel like mine went on for a week / week and a half. I didn't really realize it was from not drinking til like the last day. Hopefully last night was your last day. 
Mine were about a week to 1.5 weeks as well. To me it actually felt good to me like I could feel toxins leaving the body. 
Had them Friday and Saturday but not last night. I will not drink with you. Hugs!
About a week or so. Don't worry...they'll go away. Your body is trying to heal.
Nasty feeling isn't it? I had them again last night and I'm currently on day five. A day or two more I'd say from (too much) experience.
I'm right there with ya. My last drink was Friday night woke up Sunday night drenched in sweat woke up last night sweating although not as bad as the first night. 
Yes I had this at the beginning. It lasted quite a while....months....but it did pass. I hear you it's mighty unpleasant...On the plus side if you're a guy you now have an idea when hot flashes feel like when a woman goes through menopause.
I had night sweats so bad. Lasted a while for me though. I'd say I had them for about 6 months. Every night for a solid 3. Then it tapered.
