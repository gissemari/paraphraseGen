I've lurked on here for a long time not feeling like I needed to share my struggle or journey but here I am back at Day 1. My mother and grandmother were both serious alcoholics (grandmother died of cirrhosis and I wouldn't wish that level of suffering on anyone).  I run a successful company and I'm also a mother to a wonderful teenager.  But I'm drinking vodka sodas like water for work conferences dinners soccer practice.  I'm done.   My hangover today is brutal and I have to somehow attend my daughters charity league event.   Starting AA this week taking off work and figuring this shit out.  IWNDWT.

Great decision! You can do it and will never regret it! IWNDWYT
My life got so much easier to manage when I stopped drinking. I had to learn to live with difficult emotions but everything else got easier. Good luck to you and congratulations on making your health a priority even taking time off work to do so.
Welcome back :)...I like your plan. Please remember to take good care of *you* too.

Awesome! Good job - great decision!
