I just finished my last final of my undergraduate career and I got hit with this wave of unexpected emotions. Not sure why but I started to feel super overwhelmed and really want to go buy some booze right now. This is the farthest I've made it without drinking so far and I want to keep that up...IWNDWYT

Wait 24 hours and see how you feel. Re visit your feelings then. It is probably just the release of all the stress hormones fthat were built up getting through the final. That can make you feel like that. IWNDWYT
I was on an emotional roller coaster for a good 9 months to a year before my brain got back to a somewhat normal emotional level.  And there were definitely times along the way that I wanted to self medicate with booze but now that I've gotten to a more stable place I'm really glad I didn't give in.  Life is just easier now...&amp;#x200B;..I relied on exercise (cycling/hiking) and distractions like food and Netflix a lot in those trying times.
I finished my undergraduate program in 2016.  It can be intensely emotional.  First off congratulations.  You finished a huge accomplishment.  Reward yourself.  Instead of spending that money on booze get a nice dinner or even just order a pizza.  If there's something you've wanted for a little while chug a water and buy that toy.  You've earned it.  IWNDWYT
Play that forward- how will you feel after you drank? What will you think? Would you tell your best friend mom partner dad that you drank with pride or shame? How will you feel about starting over with sobriety? How will you feel if you are hungover? What emotions  will you have when you wake up after you drink?..Questions like that always set me straight.
Hang in there kiddo. IWNDWYT
