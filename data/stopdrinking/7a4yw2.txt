Read that yesterday and thought it so adequately described my struggle for sobriety I've been really bad at being both sober and drunk I can only pick one to try to be good at up until think point I've been trying to "get good at drinking" but like one of the stories in the big book describes that when I control my drinking I can't enjoy it and when I enjoy my drinking I can't control It. Im paraphrasing but it was something along those lines. Congrats to everyone who stayed sober yesterday and to everyone who made the pledge today. IWNDWYT!!!

Great insight!
I was so good at drinking that I was okay with being bad at life. Sad. I really didn't value myself on any level at that point. I hope that you know how important you are. Thank you for being here and participating in this strong and beautiful community. I won't drink with you today.

I'm really bad at drinking. I love this post thank you.
God I was so bad at drinking. Always...It would be like if I was still thirty years later playing the violin as poorly as I did when my teacher suggested to my mother I might be partially deaf and just like *still hoping* that concert career will someday pan out. Fingers crossed! &lt;neighbors call police again for noise disturbance&gt;..IWNDWT!!!

True enough.  I like it.
