It's hard to stay sober and on the right path when you're hit with a strong sense of not giving an eff. We found out some not wonderful news at my wife's doctors appointment yesterday and we just got back into town and neither of us give a crap about anything right now. Really struggling to not buy a bottle and just drink the pain away. I know it'll come back. I know it'll be worse. Yet I still want to. Being sober is exhausting in certain ways and exhilarating in others.

I'm sorry you two are in a rough tough place.  Like you said alcohol won't fix it. It'll make it worse. I read a good piece on the Fuckits once and it came down to no matter what the fuckit happens to be the only person getting fucked is me.  IWNDWYT
Just not drinking was not enough for me.  I found a solution to the fuck-its in AA.
I try to remember to HALT and let whatever is causing that feeling to subside.  Also chug a large glass of water so I'm physically full for a bit.
If you drink today you will wake up with the same problems tomorrow...plus a hangover.
