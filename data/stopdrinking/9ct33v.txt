So I continually have a little success with quitting I get to about 2 weeks and then fall right on my damn face.   Part of it is that I will still smoke weed and for me to beat this I have to quit EVERYTHING.  I'm so over relapsing and false starts.  It cost me a relationship but luckily I have a successful company and a loving family.    Glad to have found a community on Reddit like this.  Back to day one IWNDWYT

I see people on here a lot who smoke weed as part of their recovery and I say power to 'em. Certainly the lesser evil from what I can tell. But I can't do it. A couple years ago I tried smoking weed in an attempt to cut back the drinking and it made me very depressed. It made me want/need a drink more than ever! So yeah if it's not working for you then good for you accepting it. IWNDWYT.
We're happy to have you! IWNDWYT
