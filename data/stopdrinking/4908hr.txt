I'm so sorry. Cravings and urges will become weaker and less frequent  but only if we DON'T feed them. You can do this! !!
Just gotta hang in there brother as you know from the past it ain't easy but it will get better. We've got your back!
You can do it! Think of how great you will feel in the morning if you don't give in! 
My fifth day too and it was waaaay rough but I did it! Hanging in there with you!
Try and think about or even write down every reason while you would rather have a life without alcohol. Write down why it is that you're craving alcohol. Is it because it's the weekend and you would always drink on the weekends? What if you went on a hike or just went on a long walk while listening to music to snap you out of your funk and release some natural endorphin's instead? ..Hang in there pal.
