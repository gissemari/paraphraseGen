Hey everyone..I had this day circled on the calendar for a bit - since today is 30 days without alcohol - and the longest I've gone since I started drinking. I'm pretty excited about that. However a few shitty things kind of happened today. We found out today looks like my wife might get laid off from her job through no fault of her own - which really sucks. We can make ends meet on my income - but it'll be really tight for a while if that ends up happening. And then she also got some bad news health-wise about a family member - which kind of put things in perspective. I know in the end things will either work out or they wont - and either way its a lot of stuff that I can't control. I'm just thankful that staying sober puts me in the best position to help support my wife and family through this stuff. Anyways I just needed to vent a little bit. Even though life isn't all sunshine and rainbows - I'm thankful to be sober today.

Glad you're sober.!  Sending positive thoughts!
Best to you and your wife.  Congrats on your first 30 days!
Silver lining is with you not drinking you'll have more money to help through this rough patch. Hope it doesn't last long!
Wishing you and your family the best in a difficult time. IWNDWYT 
I think of sobriety not as like a sacrafice or a buckling down.  I think if it as a gift mostly to myself im no longer punishing my body and mental stability with a toxin.  But its turned into a gift to everyone else as well. My famiky even my co workers.  Im more present and less irratable.  Im not nursing a hangover or listening in that remived drunk eyed way.  ..So remeber what yoy are doing for yourself and for your wife.  Its subtle bit very real.
Hang in there! Things will pass and get better. Just remember that drinking will only inhibit your ability to get through these tough times.
