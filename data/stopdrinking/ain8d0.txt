Hi my name is Austin and 5 months ago I relapsed when I heard the news my mother has stage 4 breast cancer. After a week of using ending in an arrest and losing my job I realized I had to get back on the wagon and fight for my sobriety again. I had 3 years before the relapse and felt so ashamed over it I was withdrawing myself from my family. Anyway I have 5 months sober which hasn't been easy with my mom in and out of the hospital and not knowing what is going to happen. She's all I have for a parent my dad has never been around so the thought of losing her is heart breaking. I wrote this song about my relapse and what I've been going through since it happened. I found another job and worked my butt off my new boss never asked about my past when he hired me. He found out about my arrest at an AA meeting and fired me for it without even giving me a chance to explain it was a horrible feeling. I was using the money to pay my rent and help my mother who is struggling with all of her medical bills. Anyway please check out my song and let me know what you think about it. I hope it helps those who can relate to being judged for your past when you're doing everything you can to better yourself thanks Austin...https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qZcsbdzsVzE
