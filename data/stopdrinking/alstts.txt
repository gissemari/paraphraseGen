I've been under work related stress lately and I'm thinking it could be the weather as well but I'm really wanting to start drinking again.  I haven't had but very little issues with fighting the urge for a very long time now.  I was thinking that I was in a really good state.  Now its come back.  I want to drink.  I'm trying to play it forward to remind myself how miserable I'll be if I go back to it.  I feel that I won't drink but I'm thinking about it a lot.

Go for more walks (unless in the Midwest of the US) try not to stay alone for too long
When I get stressed out.  My thoughts often go to what my brain remembers worked before.  I know it's just an automatic thing. It will probably take me along time to retrain it.
Draw on your base of 283 days sober and move back to the good state you mention.  I had 1 of my biggest urges to drink in 12 weeks while I was at the gym this morning doing sit-ups.  I have no clue why but I needed a drink then.  It passed.
