Your favourite thing is get the kids off to school on your day off from work... crack that bottle of wine... have a nap watch some Netflix ie:shameless series's  hell now Frank is an alcoholic and they are one messed up family! Ha I'm not remotely like them! Or am I??? Everyday I drink my self to sleep! God forbid my son want a drive somewhere.. My famous line  I'm exhausted from working 12 hours.. but really I just want to drink because that's how I quiet my mind.. It's a dark place.. looking around at all the house workyard workrepairs that need to be done..but damn I'm tired and I raise two kids on my own. My excuse! They always come before me. Food and nice clothes they are always in need. For me that's how I justify buying booze...that's all I need! Today is day 2 for me and this is  a sample of.my struggle

Congrats on day 2!..I applaud you for all that you do - I can't imagine raising 2 children on my own...Good on you for getting sober and reaching out! Please remember to take care of YOU too my dear...You're giving your children such a beautiful gift - I bet they appreciate your sobriety more than you'll ever know ;). Keep going!
Oh I feel you. ..I wasn't a drunk because wine doesn't count right? ..Until I was up to two bottles a day and blacking out just like Frank.
I hear that. I have quit a whole bunch of times and have just decided to do dry March. But what I really realized before was that I started drinking really heavily because it felt like I was treating myself since I spent the rest of my damn life taking care of other people's needs. Wine was my way of taking care of me. But  a very bad way! I'm still working on finding new ways the most successful at getting me off booze is candy but that is not a long term solution.... I wish you good luck and I will not drink with you today!
