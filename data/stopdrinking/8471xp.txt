For a number of years I have struggled with drinking. It progressed from a couple sixpacks a week to 1/3 of a bottle of rum a day to at times I would drink close to an entire bottle of rum in a day. Somewhere in there I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes which I always slacked off in taking the meds for. I knew I was drinking far too much that it was dangerous with diabetes but always I found an excuse to continue drinking. I went to the doctor and he sent me for blood tests. My liver enzymes were at 300 or so. Far too high. Still I struggled and often failed to moderate my drinking. I set a badge here some time back. That didn't last long. Fast forward to today. Wake up call...I went to a local clinic with arrythmia. Now I've had arrythmia all my life but this was pretty much constant. I was freaking out. Still am. The doctor told me to go to Emergency. Right now. Today. First time I've been to the hospital in 25 years...The blood tests came back. My liver enzymes are approaching 500. My blood sugars are three times what they should be. I'm wearing a heart monitor for the ongoing heart issues...I have to stop drinking. I have no choice. If I continue drinking it WILL kill me...IWNDWYT.

I am glad you are at the ER with a monitor. I myself am detoxing and am scared out of my mind. Hang in there.
Hey darmog! Great job on seeking medical assistance...[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3xckfo/how_did_you_get_through_the_first_few_days/) a great starting point...I had to stop drinking also it was killing me. If I didn't go to the hospital and detox I probably wouldn't be here writing this...If there's anything we can do to help let us know. Please keep us posted! :).
