sigh. this is the end of my second relapse this year. my longest stretch was like four months. i felt great...alcohol is so sinister for me. it starts with one. maybe i'm alone and just want to take the edge off. sometimes i just want to go out with friends...what always ends up happening is i wake up days or weeks later sick and shaking. i haven't slept well for days. everything i excrement looks and smells like my insides are suffering. i've spent the last number of nights alone usually crying trying to pretend i'm sober when my best friend texts me...i came clean with my sponsor and my therapist. i had only just started going to AA before i relapsed and hid away from the world so i haven't started the steps yet...the last time i got sober i wanted it. i felt ready. i was scared...this time i'm just tired. i'm so tired. i don't even know if i want to stop. but i'm so so tired...another day another meeting in the books. take care of yourselves today my friends.
