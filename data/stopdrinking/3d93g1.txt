I am struggling so much with this horrible feeling of guilt remorse and fear over what I did.  I just went on a five day bender and this is the first day that I have not had a drink since.  And during those five days I was just absolutely mean and horrible to my girlfriend my father and another friend.  My mom also knows about it...And since yesterday since I stopped drinking I have just been so paralyzed by the magnitude of my actions that I can't focus on anything other than the guilt and also the fear.  See my dad has never tolerated my drinking and his response to it this time is even more worrisome because this time I was so mean to him.  Now I am just terrified of hearing back from him because I am certain he wants to disown me...I know I need to talk to him and apologize but I also know his response will be aggressive and vicious because that is the type of person he is.  ..So now I don't know what to do.  I know I will start going to AA meetings and commit to sobriety but I don't know how to resolve this fear and guilt because I am too afraid to talk to my dad and once again hear his hostility and anger.  And what can I even say when I have made this mistake so many times in the past that he isn't going to believe for a second any promise I make to change...

Do you live with your father?
When I was ready to do something about my problems - I did it - no fanfair no big apologies....  that's the thing though - people who love us just want to see us get better if your truly committed SHOW that with your ACTIONS don't worry about talking to your Dad or girlfriend - you can do that later when you've shown them your commitment to get better.
I don't know the rules / steps of AA...but if this were me...I'd get my own shit together first...then I'd talk to my Dad...but I'd make sure I had my act together and was firmly on the path to recovery first. Good luck!
Alcoholic apologies mean nothing; I have to change my behavior. Given proper behavior and time good feelings will replace the bad ones (so I am told.)
I typically suggest that you can try one of two things:..1.  Leave him a note - write a letter - telling him you were awful and are starting AA.  Can we please table all serious discussions about 'this incident' for at least 30 days. ..2.  Let it go 'for now' and wait until an appropriate time to discuss - hopefully when you have a little more sanity to bring to the table. ..&gt; **I know I will start going to AA meetings and commit to sobriety**..Ok... sound like a great place to start...&gt; **I don't know how to resolve this fear and guilt** ..There's a step for that and for TODAY - maybe worry about getting yourself stable.  The working on the guilt and shame  stuff comes soon enough.  TRUST ME!     ..&gt;**And what can I even say when I have made this mistake so many times in the past that he isn't going to believe for a second any promise I make to change..**..Yes... see it's not 'old behavior' if we keep doing it.  ..When trust and respect is lost it usually takes more than a fight foxhole prayer and promise to get it back.  ;) ..I created decades of chaos and wreckage. .It took several years of continuous sobriety AND being honest productive and responsible to get my family's trust and respect back. ..For ME... once I made the commitment to change - and actually DID what I said I was going to do... everything got a whole lot better. ..Good luck sweetie.  Sending my hugs and support.  .

With all the clarity and wisdom of my six days sober (lol) let me offer you some Tom Petty: waiting is the hardest part. You can atone for the guilt but the only way to prove that you're serious about sobriety and you're going to stick with it this time is to do the time. ..I keep wanting to text or email my (separated) husband and say "ok I've been sober 6 days now is this what you meant by getting myself together??" I know it's not. You know you can promise to go to AA and stay sober forever all you want but the only way to prove it is to do the time.
