Alcoholism has opened my eyes to a great deal of powerful insights that have been gradually releasing me from an internal and unseen struggle. I have come back to the light and am beginning to remember myself. I've been studying the Gnostic Gospels and my mind has been rapidly getting blown open over and over. This verse absolutely struck me hard when I read it:.."The Chief Ruler though forced the humans to drink.            From waters of forgetfulness.            So that they might not know their true place of origin. .The children (of Seth) remained in this condition for a while.In order that when the Spirit descends from the holy realms.The Spirit can raise up the children and heal them from all defects.And thus restore complete holiness to the fullness of God."..So much spiritual revelation exists within those texts. I dont feel that I would ever understand them had I not tripped into the evil dark hole of selfishness and ignorance to appreciate being lifted out by the Light of God. I used to absolutely despise these concepts and struggled since pubesence to defy them. I can pinpoint almost the exact moment I completely turned my back on God because of the message getting obliterated throughout history by greedy selfish ignorant fools. I used to be one. I can now appreciate my journey toward the light...Godspeed to us all.
