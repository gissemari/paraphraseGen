Hi Family hope that everyone reading this is having an awesome Sunday. For a guy like me who has worked the steps in the past and had been around for a few years before relapsing and struggling to get back it had been tough for me to find someone who would be a good fit. ..I met a gentleman last week who really moved me with what he said how he said it and the way he carried himself at the meeting. He said  This walk in recovery and with the twelve steps has not been a process of adding things where there were vacancies it has been a process of removing things from the roots that never I never needed in the first place . ..That really spoke to me one of the issues I've had coming back into the rooms (totally selfish and ego based) is that I felt like I already knew the steps the work and what to do. But as an wise old timer said to me a while back  Well Son just because you know the recipe to a cake that doesn't mean you have a cake now does it?  ..Anyway always love and appreciate this community and thank you all for helping me stay clean and sober today.
