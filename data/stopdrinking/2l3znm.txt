Just one but that light bulb has to really want to change!..What's your favorite recovery/sobriety joke?..This is my first time posting here but I have been lurking for quite awhile.  I am 23 years old.  My last drink was April 8th and my life is a million times better already.  Just wanted to say hello and thank you for being such a wonderful community.  Thinking about all of you especially those who are struggling - don't give up.  I may not have much time under my belt but I know you can do it and I am here for you.

How many alanons does it take to change a lightbulb?..Thirteen: one to change it and twelve to tell him how he's doing it wrong.
