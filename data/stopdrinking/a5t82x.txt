Without you guys I would have never made it to 40 days. It's not a huge milestone in my journey but it feels great. Thank you all for helping me through the struggles this far and thank you all for commending me on my triumphs...I'm ready for 60 days but before I can do that I'm just going to focus on not drinking today. To all those thinking of getting sober or are into very very early sobriety I just want you to know life does get better. It can be tough at times with curveballs our subconscious or life throws at us but every moment we maintain our sobriety our mind and body get a little stronger which paves the pathway to a happy/way more manageable future...It's all about baby steps. Don't worry about what you did in the past don't worry about what's going to happen in the future think about now.  I will not drink with you today please join me...      ..Oh and here's what I have to say to alcohol:..

Hey there person with adorable name. 40 days!! Yes!! It's a feat alright. For me that was when the voice in my head silenced. Which also means that's how long  one  drink lasts! Good going there! IWNDWYT
