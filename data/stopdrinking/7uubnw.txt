A milestone I never thought I'd accomplish. 1 year of being sober. 1 year since my last hangover. 1 year since my last regret...It has been a tough time. I live in a country where binge drinking is the social norm and people who don't drink are often given the side-eye. A lot of friendships have dwindled and recently I lost one of my best friends because I didn't want to be around him while he's drunk anymore (he's an alcoholic)...It's all for the greater good I believe and I look forward to how the rest of my sober life treats me...To those struggling you can push through it. You'll love yourself for it later on.

Congratulations. Huge milestone you should be very proud of. ..Happy weekend!
WoooHooooOooo Turbo! ..I will not drink with y'all today 
Well done doesn't seem enough of an acknowledgement! That's a fear I have - losing friends especially one that has a pattern of binge drinking as we don't get to see each other that often . ..I'd love to reach a year - 33 days on an I'm proud of self so a year must feel amazing!
