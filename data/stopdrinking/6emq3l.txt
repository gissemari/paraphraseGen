I'm sitting here on a pissy day and I struggle with social anxiety which is the main reason for my drinking I stuttered and stood at the till in a daze and they asked if I was okay incredibly embarrassing I'm going to try and stay strong and wait for my bus home whereas before after that slight stumble I would be looking a pint of courage more like pint of piss

You're stronger than you think! Thank you for posting here instead of grabbing a drink. If you can commit to not drinking today so can I - I'll join you in a cup of coffee!
I understand the awkward feeling. I suffer from anxiety and some days just ordering something at a coffee shop a battle. Most of the time I get through it and no one notices my discomfort. When I would order a beer like this then make a fool of myself after the 5th or 8th I would my mortified the next day. It's just not worth it. Won't be drinking with you today. 
I know the pain of social anxiety.  I really do.  But as I've grown older I've learned not to run from it.  I can accept looking like a total weirdo in public because I am one.  I'd rather be seen for how I really feel on the inside than for the sad and utterly transparent attempt to circumvent it.
Maybe a counselor could help with some exercises to get past the anxiety?  I won't drink with you today.
