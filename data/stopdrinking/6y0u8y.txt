Today is day 133 of sobriety.  It's a lovely day in Massachusetts USA and I'm reflecting on all of the good stuff I've done sober in the last 4+ months:..- First sober weekend in I don't know how long.- Music festival - 2 days of Boston Calling.- Date nights.- First AA meeting.- First Refuge Recovery meeting.- Wedding.- Two week beach vacation .- Ran my first half marathon.- Training for my second half.- Worked completely sober increased productivity.- Cookouts.- 4th of July party.- Long weekends like Labor Day..If you're just starting your journey keep going!  It gets better and easier as time goes on.  I relapsed more times than I can count before I got here which is the longest I've been sober.  One day at a time sobernauts!!.

My first NDV: staying out late dancing and still being able to get up for work feeling 100% with it. ..Congrats on all of your successes. IWNDWYT. 
Wow these are some impressive NDVs and so inspiring for someone like me who is just getting started (for the 4637282th time). Congrats on all of these accomplishments and here's to many more! I won't drink with you today. 
NDV?
