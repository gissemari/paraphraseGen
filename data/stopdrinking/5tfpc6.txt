Perceptions can really change. Sobriety helped me see that life can really be what you make of it....I never thought I would find "drunk life" boring.I never thought I would stop looking for "depth" in every second of my existance (turns out relaxing is an ok thing to do! I know right?).I never thought I would start accepting my flaws as "ok".I never thought I would spend friday at home ALONE and not feel like shit about it.I never thought I would stop thinking I know best what everyone should do..And etc.....So many parts of me I thought were REAL INNER ME are here no more. So many ideas I had on people and society in general also evaporated. I just find it so interesting and surprising that my perception on reality as I know it can change in such drastic ways... And I can already see that there's still a lot more to go in terms of accepting myself and everyone else as we are theres still a lot to learn to grow to love. But man am I happy I started walking this path. ..I was so hurt so alone so sad. You can truly feel alone in the crowd but it doesn't have to be this way. I am happy to be less right now - less social less strict less limited in may ways and habbits. I always thought that I need to control myself all the time - who wouldn't drink if they felt this way? ..This has been long coming for me. Thanks everyone who are here I read religiously for a year and a half now. I had ups and downs managed to start moderating at the end of the summer decided to become a teetoler 34 days ago. Life still kicks me in the nuts at least daily but somehow all is different... I found hope and dreams on the other side. Don't give up if you are thinking about it it can and WILL be better. Talk with people - it helped me the most. Be it in AA therapy or your family. If you talk loud enough sooner or later someone who shares your struggle will appear misery likes company and you can always help each other. I didn't do it alone either :)..take care and much love .-lluviadesol

I really like your post. I found being sober very good. I loved being hangover free and feeling like a good person. But I found it boring. I would be in bed for 7.30 every evening cause if I wasnt drinking there was no point being up. I would read and check out this sub on my phone and I would feel amazing in the morning but would always feel like I was missing something and playing a game until I could drink again normally...Realising now a very simple fact that I need to start living. There is more to life than sitting infant of a tv/laptop drinking beer and talking shite. But I've been doing it for so long I need to re programme myself...Thanks for the great advice. Means a whole lot to me right now.
Man do I appreciate you insights.  I'm giving myself all of 2017 to slowly make the changes to figure out who I am without alcohol in the equation.  Good luck on your journey of discovery.
