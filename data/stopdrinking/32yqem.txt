Hey all.Thought I'd stop in and drop an update. I'm working my way through day 5 started feeling better around day 2-3. It took awhile after the binge last weekend. My sponsor gave me some good advice when he is starting to feel a bit off he reads a chapter from the big book. Specifically the personal stories in the back...I read window of opportunity last night. It was pretty good but my girlfriend needed to vent about work so I couldn't pay as much attention as I would have liked. It was a quick chapter so I'll try again tonight...I'm feeling mostly back to normal here on day 5 so this is where my work begins. It's easier for me to not drink when I feel like death. I'm trying to form some healthy habits to help deal with my obsessive thoughts. They are not here now but too many relapses have said they will be back. ..I'm not drinking today and I'm making plans to help me not drink this weekend. ..Thanks for being here SD.
