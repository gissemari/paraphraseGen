I can't keep going on like this. I have told myself countless times that I am going to quit drinking/drugging and once I get 3 or 4 days into it I choose to forget the reason I wanted to stop altogether and proceed to get extremely fucked up...I don't drink every day but when I do drink it almost always results in a blackout. I act like such a fool every time I get drunk I am embarrassed to even look people in the eye that I saw the night of. Didn't have any booze yesterday and am not going to have any today. Think I'll go to a meeting tonight. I have quit for 11 months before but it's been over a year since I started drinking again. ..One thing I struggle with is feeling the need for a release. I go a few days without drinking or doing drugs and I really crave some sort of release. I plan on getting back into working out because I think that helps a bit but I need to develop some new hobbies that don't involve partying. Also I smoke cigarettes which makes the working out thing difficult but I am not too worried about the cigs now I think the drinking/drugging poses a much greater problem to my health right now. Anyone with any suggestions please feel free to send them my way. ..Anyways I'll hopefully be posting again down the road with a much higher badge number. I've enjoyed following this sub for a while helped me through some difficult times in sobriety when I was off the drinking and I know it will help me again this time around.

Take the time to sit down and write a list of the reasons you are making this choice today. Write down how you feel right now. Stick that in a place where it is accessible in case you feel like drinking so you have an easy reminder of where it takes you.
