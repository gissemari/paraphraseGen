I did very well for some time but then started failing again. I was looking for that 'thing' that was going to motivate me to start again...Today I got a call from one of my oldest friends. He has been struggling but has been keeping it to himself and pushing me away when i try to help. Today he called and said he has had enough. I told him 'me too'. We are both on it together and we both are going to be supporting each other and using this site...If anyone knows how to get your counter reset I would appreciate some advice. I have tried several times and the app just keeps counting up.....I will not drink today. And I won't drink with my friend either...

Check out the side bar (on the web not on the app). Good luck...You're starting over but not really because you've already done this before.
