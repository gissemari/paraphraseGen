Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Motivational..**"Help others achieve their dreams and you will achieve yours." - [Les Brown](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/lesbrown382877.html#CO6zZPoUuW0rT7cg.99)**..*What I get from it:*  I've been dealing with this rough spot in my sobriety for a little while.  I have been [struggling](http://jp8.r0tt.com/l_8f4620e0-f78d-11e1-b3c7-edb239e00008.jpg) and wrapped up in it and only focusing on myself and kind of being a bit of a mess.  Ya know what finally snapped me out of it?  Getting out of my own head and [doing things for other people.](http://www.verybestquotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Helping-Others-Quotes-No-one-is-useless-in-this-world-who-lightens-the-burdens-of-another..jpg)  Today instead of wallowing about my own problems I asked a few friends how they were.  I knew a colleague was struggling with something and offered to help.  I read my kid some extra books and helped him with some drawings and letters even though it was way past bedtime.  ..Guess who's not thinking about her own problems anymore?  [It's amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkyqRP8S93Y) what a little hand holding with others will do for the mind and the soul.  :)..Have an awesome day all!

Hey /u/ketojam you have been really supportive of me and I have wanted to say thank you in a direct and personal way for it but I really am not good at reddit so I will post it here!  Thanks for all you do for me and all of us at SD as a moderator and a poster.  Sorry to hear you are struggling and having a rough spot and if there is anything we can do I bet there are 100 of us who owe you a boost!  ..PS- I signed up for another big race to keep myself from starting to hibernate for the winter.  Heading to the Kennedy Space Center in November for a triathlon.  Let me know if any of your peeps are going!  
This is just what I needed to hear. Thank you so much x
Reading this quote reminded me of a fortune cookie I got last Sunday night.  It said "Your simple kindness today will be rewarded multiple times."  And it was totally true for me on that particular day!  It really is quite amazing how helping and being kind to others can make a huge difference in one's own attitude.  Even a smile to a stranger or a simple "hello" can make a huge difference.  I try to bring the positive vibes wherever I go and no matter how much of a challenging day it has been because without a doubt it helps keep me sober and levelheaded.
Hey /u/Ketojam - great quote.  I think this is something I have noticed as a result of joining this sub. ..I think about my problem more than ever because I write about it or read about others 12+ times a day when I check in here...It's a bit of a double edged sword.  I need to check in here less and go to some real world meetings or volunteer somewhere  or maybe I don't - this could be why I'm feeling good at the moment.  I am keeping the focus very definitely on my sobriety even if it consumes me a bit too much at times. ..I dunno but I think I understand how you feel about the being 'wrapped up'.  Keep fighting the good fight! 
Wonderful work TODAY KJ!  
Thank you
Hey! I'm sorry that you are going through a rough spot. For what it's worth I love reading your quotes on here - every time I open your posts they *really* speak to me and help me step back and improve my perspective/attitude/mood. ..I don't always post but please bear on mind that you have been helping this internet stranger on the daily with your amazing quotes!
Keto totally know what you mean about those rough spots. I've been in a little bit of one myself. I find that in addition to trying to talk to other people about their lives or help another person re-honing in on my meditation practice has been really beneficial...Last night I sat there for 10-12 minutes and just had waves and waves of **painful** anxiety wash over me. I find that if I take some time each day to feel some feelings everything is much better though. Hope you move out of this rough patch soon.
Happy Thursday!
