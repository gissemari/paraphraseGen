Grace. I have been given such grace by the Spirit of the Universe. I took my bipolar meds ( non controlled baby no judgment I just got to surrender to everything this time) I took them late today and I believe this is what caused some mania but alas I did not drink. I bought a chocolate cake and shared it with my roommates at sober living. Being pointed in the direction of an amazing sober living program has changed my entire life. I have a new life in AA and all I had to do was change everything. ..It works...IWNDWYT    ..I drank from age 12-24 and this has been a struggle for so long took 3 years of hell to get me into long term treatment. I was granted a scholarship. I am so grateful. God did this not me. ..AA thank you.....I love you Bill

Congratulations on two months! It does feel like grace like an amazing gift has been given. I will not drink with you today. 
You did it... God has your back but you make the decisions everyday to do what you need to be sober and healthy. That is all you. It is an incredible amount of effort and dedication. .So please don't discount your effort and work! ..When we start taking steps to help ourself then God can step in and help us along. But we have to put that effort in first and ya have! Bravo!
