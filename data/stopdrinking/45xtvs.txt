I've been doing pretty well so far 18 days!  Today...I'm struggling.  My employees have been super negative from the moment we walked in and the bickering is driving me crazy.  Also it's snowing pretty heavily so I am worried about getting home.  So I'm working my way through a fairly major anxiety attack...and I'm out of medicine.  I recognize that the faint cravings I'm having are from the anxiety and that drinking absolutely will make it worse but there's still that small voice saying "maybe it will help this time".  Ugh.  I'm not going to drink but that voice is really getting on my nerves.  Anyway thanks for reading my venting.

I understand. The urges will pass with time. Look at them like cars on the highway... Wave at them acknowledge them and see them for what they are.... feelings... but you don't need to react to them. Again they will pass if you let them.  Good luck. You can do this!!
Hello and thank you for posting. As /u/Agrateful123 said you can have cravings without drinking. Eating something sweet helped me in early sobriety. ..&gt; There is nothing so bad that drinking won't make it worse. 
Change as much of your normal routine as possible for me doing the same old thing seemed to lead to the same old boozing.
Thanks.  I'm home now had to give myself able talk before going into 7-11 for cigarettes but I'm feeling better and just glad I got through.  :-)
