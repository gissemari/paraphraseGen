At the age of 18 I decided to "take a break" from college and move out on my own.  At the time I worked 60-65 hours/week so there was always cash left over after the bills were paid.  That extra money turned into vast quantities of fancy liquor and high quality marijuana.  ..The freedom of living on my own unleashed the party animal in me.  I started getting high & drunk on the regular.  Smoked a ton of weed but rarely got belligerent-blackout drunk. I had ~4 shots a day: I never felt like I NEEDED booze.  It was just a source of entertainment.  ..At the age of 20 I moved back to my parents house.  They don't like weed so I had to put an end to my toking.  I started using synthetic marijuana but ultimately getting drunk became my daily "escape".  ..I considered what I knew about booze: 1) It's socially acceptable 2) The media doesn't portray it as harmful 3) I don't get much of a hangover 4) My parents are cool with it.  It seemed like a great resolution.  Boy was I wrong...I'm 23 now. I've been sober no more than 10 days out of the past two years.  For 3 months now I've been drinking the equivalent of a half-fifth (375mL) every day.  I knew something was wrong when I started craving a drink on the way home from work.  This has been my daily routine for a while; go to school/work get home turn on laptop take a shot or two.  Gradually that "shot or two" turned into three then to four then I quit counting...My relationship with alcohol has progressed to the next level.  After each shot goes down the bottle sits beside me begging me to pour just one more.  ."All that stands in between you and bliss is this last shot" it says.  IT LIES...My social life has deteriorated.  Every day is a blur and my mind is constantly in a haze.  I don't enjoy doing anything anymore.  I'm struggling at work and school.  I quit working out and my physique has been withering away.  ..I can't possibly conjure up an argument that could justify what I'm doing to myself. Screw it...I'm DONE.  4 days sober and many more to come.
