Happy Friday SD! So I'm right at the point where I have relapsed the past 2 attempts at quitting drinking (around days 20-22). I am determined to get through to 30 days. Tomorrow my boyfriend/ex (we've been on the fence lately) and I are taking a trip without our son to visit friends an hour away. He's bringing several bottles of his specialty brewed Liquor that he makes and our friends are looking forward to a rare childless night with us. Problem is- I'm terrified. I don't want to drink I feel like a nut for having so much anxiety about this short trip. I've already told dude that I'm not drinking and that I'll drive separately so I don't have to stay all night but now I feel like I'm a lame weirdo for wanting to leave early and taking two cars on such a longish trip. One of my biggest issues with drinking is that I was majorly isolating myself from everyone so I'd really like to get out and be social but I feel so weird about it! Thanks for letting me vent!

I completely relate --- but staying sober is more important than whether peeps approve of the methods I use...I wish you good luck
It will be awkward at first.. But once the drinks start flowing and you see how your friends change from fun to annoying should give you extra motivation not to drink. Take a telescope or something lol
Maybe driving your own car and going home will help keep you accountable to not drink! You enjoy your childless night off too! I will not drink with you !
