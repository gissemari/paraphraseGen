You're a victim of nothing. Victims in my experience rarely get better.
We all have stupidity inside us. Fortunately we also have wisdom in there too. Hang in there buddy.
But what happened?
Sorry to her about your setback but at least your not drinking over it. A sponsor has been such blessing for me. Working the step cn be somewhat a pain in the ass but the end result is bitchin good luck finding  sponsor
You're not stupid. Alcohol is "cunning baffling powerful".  Sounds as though you needed more research to be convinced. ..Let this what I'll call *arm-wrestling-with-alcohol-incident* be part of your recovery journey. You're realizing it's a no-win situation. Breaking up is hard to do!  ..Glad you're back. Take care of yourself. 
Knowing what you know about yourself and alcoholism if you pick up a drink again you do so as a volunteer not a victim.
