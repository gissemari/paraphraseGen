Getting close to 50 days (36M binge drink 2 days a week). I've hit my wall. No desire to drink. And by that I mean ANYTHING. I used to drink soooo much water. I would finish a half gallon a day at the very least now I'm struggling. I even have a few lingering muscle cramps my doctor suggested was from dehydration. Didn't see this coming. Trying to drink a lot of soda water makes it harder because it initially fills me up and I can't chug it. Struggle on.

I have the same problem. I drink SO much water but I still randomly get foot/leg cramps. I don't know how much more I can possibly drink lol.
I find that if I drink some water with added electrolytes  I don't cramp up and helps me stay hydrated.
Try some herbal iced tea or amino acids or electrolytes you can add to water. 
Thanks everybody. I'll give those tips a shot.
