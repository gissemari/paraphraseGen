I've decided it might be a decent thing to give it another try who knows. Even though AA did nothing for me this entire 7 months of seriously trying sobriety and even though I never went even in the past 47 days I know AA can help. ..We all do our separate paths of sobriety and whatever works works. For me I am so terrified of ever relapsing into my old way of life I would go to AA every day if I knew it was the key to never drinking again. Alas I figured out that wasn't the key. The key for me was deciding every day not to drink to focusing on building healthy relationships with people helping people and staying away from alcohol. And AA actually did nothing there. Nobody talked to me or cared about me even after going there for months. ..But I feel like trying it one more time couldn't hurt and I really respect those that love AA. It's great for some for sure. It's just hard for me I'm only 24 and those old people just look at me like they're jealous or something...Anyways I'm still sober! Hopefully it goes well.

Sounds like a plan.       .Let us know how it went.
Today I went for the first time in a year and a half! I'm looking forward to going back. Might even get a sponsor and work the steps this time. Fist bump!
I went back yesterday after over a year an a half! High five :)
