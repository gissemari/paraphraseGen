Today I woke up with an ex on my mind. Also there was construction in my building -- really loud and it will go on for some months. These things threw me off and I wasn't able to pray/meditate before leaving the house. Perhaps that led to me crying later and taking a nap. I was extremely tired (again). Somehow I also felt the gravity of getting sober... and what a burden relapsing had been. It was sinking in. I realized I hadn't really cried for over 30 days...In the evening a friend got upset with me. Now I find myself in bed crying... I feel so bad about myself.  But there are some things I can feel good about right now: not wanting to drink being able to post here and I can talk all this over with my sponsor tomorrow...Thanks for listening.

Being sober doesn't mean that tough life things won't happen. It does mean though that you can take things on with a clear mind and make well thought out decisions and say what you mean with words that you choose. ..You have a whole group of supporters here. You will get through this. And doing so sober will be rewarding and end in a much better outcome. Stay strong and I will not drink with you today.
