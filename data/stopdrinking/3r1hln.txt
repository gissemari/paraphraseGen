So I have to set my badge back. I relapsed. Got too ahead of myself and binged on Thursday Night. Drank a whole fifth of vodka. Acted wild. Was a dick to my sister and her boyfriend and woke up my mom. Was up at 4:30 a.m. throwing trashcans at my back door. What a huge reminder of why I really need to commit to this. I guess all I can do is keep it moving and I guess go to meetings. I was doing so good now I am depressed again.
