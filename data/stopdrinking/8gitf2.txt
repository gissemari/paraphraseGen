I've only been lurking on this sub for a little while but every day I see the same outdated concepts thrown around with little push back...*"I relapsed [____ days/months/years]* wasted*!"*..Umm what exactly was wasted?? Every single day off alcohol is one less day of damage to your mind your body and your relationships. Besides every attempt strengthens your resilience and teaches you how to do better moving forward...Tell me if these thoughts sound familiar to you:..[ ] "I am guilty I messed up.".[ ] "I am unworthy. I deserve this. I don't deserve good things.".[ ] "I am bad. I deserve to be punished. Bad things *should* happen to me."..People that struggle with substance abuse often deal with masochistic/self-defeating personalities. Learning to **forgive yourself** and practice **self-compassion** is crucial to recovery and breaking the cycle!..The worst part about the threads I am referring to is that the comment sections are FILLED with people all too eager to jump in on the abuse - "You f'd up do better". NOT HELPFUL! Quit projecting!..I know I'm pushing the boundaries of the community guidelines a little by doing a call-out thread like this but I had to get this off my chest. I want to contribute in a positive way to this community but I also feel like I need to call out harmful viewpoints when I see them...Wishing you all a Well Wednesday.Riley

I must not read the same comments you read. 
&gt;Quit projecting!..Your post violates our "Speak from the 'I'" rule and has been removed. From the posting guidelines in the sidebar:..&gt;We ask that you refrain from speaking in the imperative. That means don't tell others what they *should* or *must* do. It's better to phrase your advice in terms of your own story talking about what worked for you...It also violates the rule "Don't critique other members' comments" also from the sidebar:..&gt;It is not appropriate to reply to a commenter to tell him or her that you dislike their style. Doing so creates a hostile environment that makes many feel unwelcome...&gt;As long as a comment is within the bounds of the subreddit rules a member is free to leave that comment without being attacked for doing so. Remember: Your way is not the only way.
