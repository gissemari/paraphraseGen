Hi..I'm struggling to identify a couple of triggers I know I've had problems with in the past. I feel what I am identifying them as is too big or broad to be able to address...For example I know sometimes at 3pm when I'm sitting at my desk at work I will just get up and walk to bar around the corner. I don't even know how I justify it or what happened. Especially after being so determined that morning that I won't drink that day. Now I'm afraid of sitting at my desk at 3pm...Is there any advise to help get to the bottom of it?

Urge surfing helped me through many a craving. And for this particular situation I don't know where you work but do you have to always be at your desk? Maybe go to the break room and get a coffee instead or something. Many people struggle with stopping by a liquor store on the way home and it can help to take a different route sort of thing. Best wishes.
I used to start drinking at 3pm and end when i went to bed. Triggers me every time I see the clock and that time is near
Are you getting hungry at that point time? Hunger sets of cravings.  I keep good snacks with me.  
Maybe it's too early or this response isn't practical but for me I've realized that a huge way to deal with my triggers has been to actually recognize and identify the emotion that I am having. Among other things I drank to escape from emotions. So it is new for me to actually recognize when I am experiencing uncomfortable feelings. Rather than try to run away from it I've started recognizing it and identifying what it is I'm feeling. No matter what the feeling is I try to let myself experience it initially. After I acknowledge it and just sit with it inevitably it seems to fade on its own.
3-4 pm is a big trigger time for me too. I realized that even though I don't feel hungry - it was hunger that was triggering cravings.
