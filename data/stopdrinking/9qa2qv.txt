I'm a 22 year old guy struggling to stop drinking. I come from a family of alcoholics and addiction runs in my family pretty wildly. I grew up watching alcohol destroy my parents marriage and ruin both my brother and sister's lives. Thankfully now my family is sober but not after some serious internal conflicts. Having seen alcohol do serious damage I was very adamant that I wasn't going to drink. ..Flash forward to me being 18 and going to college I was pressured pretty heavily by friends to drink and I started doing it occasionally with friends. It never really was an issue until I studied abroad in France when I was 20. While I was there I lived with a host family that was the complete opposite of me and it was tough. I was having serious culture shock and the language barrier was tough to over come. I started turning to staying in my room and drinking and playing video games. I had a girlfriend at the time who I would talk to a lot but I would never tell her that I would drink by myself. The lonelier I felt in France the more I drank and  fail  to tell my girlfriend about it. ..When I came home I spent the summer in my parents place and began the nasty habit of playing video games and drinking at night. I would do this at least once a week and never told any one about it even the online friends I would play video games with. This was the first time I really started feeling like I should drink/ really enjoyed it. I usually kept it to once a week but sometimes I would do it more when I had free nights. I always justified it as  oh I had a long week  or  I earned this for working hard.  I never drank on week nights or when I knew I had to get stuff done that next day. I always told myself and others that I'm not gonna end up like my sister (who has had serval issues with alcoholism and going in and out of rehab). I used the comparison to my sister (who drank like every night) to justify that I didn't have a problem but looking at it now I certainly did even back then. ..Anyway for a bit I kept it pretty contained and I even went a good long stretch without doing it much because I moved in with my girlfriend and she didn't drink much so I didn't feel pressure to. Unfortunately things between us started to get really tough and I started drinking a bottle of wine and would lose myself in video games once a week and would hide this from my girlfriend. Eventually we split and that hit me really hard and ever since that happened about 7 months ago I've been binge drinking at least once a week and hiding it from my parents and friends. At one point I finally gained the courage to tell my friend about my issue and he responded with  that's not an issue you're only doing it like once a week. It's totally normal to do that.  This didn't help at all and honestly made me justify what I was doing and really question if I did have an issue. ..Flash forward to now where I'm a college grad living in his parents' basement working part time retail and having no luck finding a job. I just got back from visiting the friend who's still in college I told about my issue and we basically spent the whole weekend drunk. I'm sick of feeling like shit every morning after I drink and I need to make a change. I've been trying to keep busy with other activities like working out or playing piano but I go about 3-4 days great and the slip back into the habit and get drunk and play video games. I want to make a change but I'm struggling so hard to do so. Multiple times I've said this will be the last time and I get rid of what ever alcohol I have and I feel so good about stopping but then I get an impulse out of the blue that says I should drink tonight and I act on it. It's like all of my positive talk about not drinking goes out the window and I focus on getting the alcohol (which I buy in secrecy and hide from my parents because I don't want them to find out about it.) I feel like shit and it's been an expensive habit to keep up but I found this subreddit and started reading all the stories on it and it's been pretty enlightening. I'm not good at reaching out in person so I'm using this outlet to share my struggle. Anyone have any advise to stay sober?

I got all the help I could find starting with a therapist. I went to detox rehab outpatient treatment and AA. I saw a doctor and psychiatrist and continued with counseling. ..Staying sober was too difficult to tackle on my own. Besides I had no clue how to build a sober happy life. I have one today and wish the same for you. Sobriety is easier and more fun with help.
