When I first stumbled across SD via The Guardian article just after another New Year's Day where I yet again failed to act on my own idea I wanted to stop being such a lush I didn't really know how long I wanted to stop for. ..I had the vague idea it might be just a re-set of my habits perhaps take a few weeks off the sauce and then only drink at dinner parties or on Fridays or... etc. *rolls eyes*..Fact is I've been aware most of my life that booze is a multi-generational problem in my family. I was married to a violent drunk [who I very rarely drank with] for a decade. I had in my late teens and the first two years of my 20s discovered I didn't have a "stop" switch after a couple of drinks and trashed my liver quite badly. But I conveniently forgot all that for about the past five years. ..The first week or two of abstaining was not easy and I've truly felt like throwing things a few times and really WANTED the blur of a bottle of wine to calm me down. I've been drinking so much mineral water I am surprised I haven't turned into a spa...But I've stuck with it and learned so much from being here. It's not just me doesn't have the "stop" switch. It's not just me has found moderation is not really a "thing" for my biochemistry. It's not just me thinks about rewarding/comforting/entertaining myself with "just one glass" and then plays it forward in the light of ruthless self-honesty and recognises "just one" actually means the whole bottle maybe two. ..The honesty bravery and openness of the stories people have shared about the struggle have really brought home to me that even though "never" and "forever" and "always" are scary words with the emotional force of an angry charging hippo {NOOOOOO!!! Not the HIPPO!!!!} they are probably words I actually need to get my head around and embrace {pat the nice hippo Whoopie...} because the alternative is to be right back where I was 28 days ago eventually. And probably quicker than I got there last time. *shudder* ..I have done "never" and "forever" and "always" before - giving up pot seven years ago cold turkey after an 18-year habit. Walking out from the violence of my marriage shortly after and never contemplating going back [the counsellors told me that generally domestic violence victims take on average SEVEN attempts of go/return/go/return/etc to finally leave the relationship. They are also the lucky ones that live long enough to leave.]..So I can do "never" "forever" and "always". I can make a housepet of that hippo. I just needed to decide that I'm worth it. That life is worth it. That the future is worth being bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for...Thank you everyone for this moon cycle of sobriety you've all helped me to have. Like I said when I started this yarn I didn't know how long I was going to stop drinking for but now I feel pretty gung-ho about committing to many more moons to come of not drinking with y'all...In the collection of affirmations I hung this past week above my desk is one that says "what would you do if you knew you could not fail?" ..My answer right now is *raises her mineral water and lime* stick with this. Tame that hippo...I have had a collection of songs running in my head helping me along too. Amazing Grace is one that has seen me through a lot of tough times and also resonates with that feeling of the universe collaborating in positive change. I do believe that we all experience the gift of grace when we most need it. It's not necessarily a God thing so much as a force of blessing and goodness and unconditional love that just creeps into our spirits and whispers "it's going to be OK. You're going to be OK."..There's a lot of beautiful versions - the Sinead O'Connor version Soweto Gospel Choir [and live it is ah-mazing to see/hear!] Celtic Woman's version [especially with the bagpipes!] but this one -  by the late Dr G Yunupingu singing in Yolngu with Paul Kelly singing in English - this is pure 100% proof inspiration for this part of my journey..  .[*cultural protocol warning- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons need to know this clip contains images and voice of deceased persons.
