It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** A few days ago I saw a documentary made by a lovely woman about her sister's suicide. The filmmaker had sixteen years of sobriety but she was so upset about her sister's suicide (even though it had happened years before) that she relapsed. She actually filmed herself ordering and drinking that first drink (a double vodka) at an upscale eatery and soon after in the documentary her beautiful slender face got that unmistakable drinker's bloat that mine used to have. It was triggering and upsetting and the film has really haunted me...**Triumph:** The month of May means the true start of summer to me and also represents second chances. Last week I had my quitting drinking anniversary and this week I had my quitting smoking anniversary twenty years (and one week) apart. (Quitting smoking seemed harder for me physically but quitting drinking was harder psychologically. Do those of you who have done both agree?)..**General:** A friend of mine recently taught me a trick she calls  shopping at home.  It's when she decides she needs something (such as new clothes) but instead of getting out her credit card and going to Macy's she looks into the depths of her closet and nine times out of ten she finds a piece of clothing that she had forgotten she owned. I have started shopping at home too and I love it particularly because when I really dig deep into closets and drawers I find things that I bought while drunk and had completely forgotten about and now have a chance to use and enjoy..

Struggle: insomnia day 3 no drinking after a fall...Triumph: had a fun time at an open bar at a work party and didn't drink..General: took an over the counter sleep aid and still not sleeping. Last time I quit I could be around alcohol without any cravings and never really had cravings but I did have physical withdrawl symptoms when I quit (the insomnia and some bad stuff) so I thought I wasn't a true addict. I took one sip after a bad day after about 6 weeks off the sauce and went on a 5 day bender. Yep I'm an alcoholic. This time I won't slip. And this time I'll be subscribed to r/stopdrinking so... I guess you guys got another SDer.... not sure if that's really a positive thing to say but hey at least I'm taking care of it. 
Struggle: I'm wide awake because my husband is sleeping on the couch and was having awful withdrawals; and I'm worried about him. ..Triumph: I turned down free drinks at brunch and out with friends all afternoon. FREE. I LOVE FREE STUFF. Didn't drink. ..General: It's my birthday and today I will not drink. :) First sober birthday in six years. 
**Struggle**: It's a constant effort to stay pain-free and my posture gains are slow. I wish I had a magical body transformation like some others on here but I keep telling myself to be patient and keep putting in the work and that I have had impressive transformations in other areas of my life since quitting. ..**Triumph**: Since I have gained stability through being sober and having a great job I find myself having the capacity to find enjoyment and feel excitement over the possibilities in life for the first time in a very long time. Being an adult is finally fun in some ways! I can live life how I want -- now it's all up to me to make those dreams and ideas reality. ..**General**: Becoming who I want to be one day at a time...and I NEVER could have done it if I hadn't taken a stab at dry January on a whim then kept it going. When I used to quit I would always be waiting to be cured so I could drink again in moderation. Now I know I can't moderate and truly hope I never drink again. 
Struggle: I am currently attending aa meeting once a week but am hesitant to get a sponser. I want to make a good choice but also sense a need to make a timely decision. Perhaps I will meet someone at this weeks meeting? (You don't have to like your sponser although I feel it would be advantageous if I did). Could be over thinking it.....Triumph: I had a little bit of a rough day emotionally but the thought of drinking never crossed my mind. I was even offered an expensive glass of whisky but I declined. ..General: I quit smoking about 20 days after I stopped drinking. I feel like it actually helped with the stopping drinking... I'm thinking it might be because they're both tend to lead to each other... When I used them anyway. IWNDWYT!  
@sfgirlmary I'd very much agree about your statement regarding quitting smoking vs drinking!..Struggle: I've been going to meetings and doing other sobriety-related work. I've been struggling to figure out how these components work together and which parts of them I need as part of my recovery program. Also getting off the sugar kick I started when I quit drinking...Triumph:  I had been feeling kinda "meh" about my AA meeting and went to a different one tonight (a young people's meeting). I was really glad I went I felt a lot more connected to what was going on there with people being closer to my age. I'm glad I put in the effort to go to different meetings to see which fit as I think being involved in the AA community could do a lot of good for me...General: Nothing to report just cruising along right now feeling like I have some general purpose in life at least for the meantime. Things are good : ) So very grateful for everybody in SD &amp; AA these are truly amazing places.
\*\*Struggle\*\*: That ever\-deceptive machinating conniving demon is speaking from inside me again telling me it isn't worth it; telling me \*I'm\* not worth it. I'm on the dawn of my third day and still struggling to keep meals down after a 4 day bender and I'm filled with so much remorse for the things I did... for everything I've done... that the urge to say "fuck it" and drink anyway is there...\*\*Triumph\*\*: I think I've finally met my bottom and I think it could have been a lot worse. I'm \*alive\* and for that I'm thankful...\*\*General\*\*: Like a lot of other posters here I'm struggling with sleep. I think I've had a total of around 8  \- 10 hours in 72 and I'm feeling it. When I'm alone with my thoughts the anxiety and remorse takes over in addition to still having the shakes and tapering down. Despite that though I'm happy and hopeful... and extremely thankful for SD. IWNDWYT.
**Triumph:**  Happy Quit Smoking Anniversary to you Mary!!  That's so wonderful.  My triumph is 2 weeks cigarette free.  I've quit so many times but I feel like I can really do this.  I will not smoke or drink today no matter what.  Smoking has really been much harder for me to ditch.  In the past I'd relapse when I drank.  More recently I'd start smoking at a party and justify it by saying to myself "at least you're not drinking. You should be able to be bad a little bit." **Stupid Addict Thought Shutup**!  I've learned a lot thought and I *will* be victorious!..**Struggle:**  Medical bills are bringing me down.  I felt pretty good about getting my health all checked out after putting off a few issues for years.  Good news is I'm not dying of anything presently bad news is it still costs a lot of money to hear good news.  Ha..
Hello Everyone..Checking in for day 8 of sobriety. Feeling 1000% percent better than this time one week ago. ..Struggle: The damage I did to my relationship during a severe blackout 8 days ago. I am still trying to pick up the considerable number of broken pieces. I fear it may be too late. Time will tell. I have made a commitment to sort my drinking problem out and I will not stray from this path regardless of the outcome of my relationship problems...Triumph: My general mood and sense of mental clarity have markedly improved. I am going for my first 5km run in a long time tonight. I am feeling positive about the future and my decision to make a change. Finding SD is also a triumph in itself. Until now I have never even used Reddit...General: Overdraft bank charges are fucked up. I found out today I have incurred 400 dollars in overdraft fees I was unaware of. An account I have not been using was 20 dollars overdrawn and the daily fees have built up to almost 400. Ironically the bank's slogan is :"We are right with you". Sure they are to bleed you dry! Be very careful of overdraft fees/charges folks...Good luck to all I will not be drinking with you today.
Congrats on your Quit Smoking Anniversary u/sfgirlmary!!!..**Struggle:**    SO is dealing with lots of stress at work and his abnormal EKG and bloodwork has us working hard to stay calm and get him healthier. ..**Triumph:**    I've done a ton of research on lowering cholesterol/sodium/sugar/fat and it's surprisingly pretty easy when going by diet. My meat-and-potatoes-SO has now evolved into a beans/edamame/oatmeal/salmon/veggies guy! I'm finding it interesting and fun to cook this way...**General:**    Friday is our 1 Year Anniversary. Looking back I'm so happy that I waited the rule-of-thumb-"wait 1 year in sobriety before dating" standard. Getting into a relationship *without even knowing MYSELF sober* may not have worked out so well. Be patient your prince/princess will come ;).
Struggle: Small niggling thoughts of drinking. No real pressure but it's annoying...Triumph: Haven't given in to any of them and shut the thoughts down as quick as they come...General: Things in my life are going very well at the moment and I don't need to have a drink to fuck that up. Rehearsing for a play which could lead to bigger things taking it a day at a time. Work sucks though. Job hunting next week.
Hello everyone. I attend my first A.A. meeting(s) today. I went to two because I knew if I didn't get to one immediately I'd find a reason not to go. At the encouragement of people there I then attend one in my area this evening. I'm now unable to sleep (I didn't know this was normal!) which is crazy because I'm so proud of myself but also very scared when I heard so many have relapsed. But it was shocking and amazing to hear that so many people think like me. Have had the exact same conversations with themselves re their drinking. I'm a binge drinker so it's not a daily thing. I think that scares me because I know I can go months without and then I think I'm okay to drink  normally  even though I don't even know what that is because so many people I know drink an excessive amount but they also know when to stop which I have never learned. I'm now learning there is no cure for this. I just must manage it by staying away from drinking completely. I just wanted to say hi to you all and tell you reading your posts is extremely helpful. Thank you. 
I have seen that documentary too u/sfgirlmary! Cried like a tired baby! That one scene in the bar broke my heart for her. I have had way too much suicide in my life. There is another great one call The Bridge done about The Golden Gate Bridge suicides over just one year. The film maker set up cameras on the bridge 24 hours a day for that year. It's very bleak and intense yet riveting. One of my older brothers was talked down off that bridge 30 years ago by a complete stranger. That brother completed suicide in October of 2014. Pill though and liquor no bridge in Sedona high enough as he had left SF. Coming up on July 10th is the 1 year anniversary of my good friend Susan Ahern's suicide off The Coronado Bay Bridge. I lived 6 blocks from this bridge for a very long time. It is the #3 Suicide Bridge in this country. Susan had gotten her 7 year chip that morning at our Coronado Women's Meeting. I wasn't there. Susan thought she had no other way out of her very bad marriage and obligations to her personal heritage imposed on her by her elderly parents. It's been terrible. I cannot imagine her despair. The guy behind her in traffic told her asshole husband that Susan opened her car door went to the very short barrier climbed on and jumped without *any* hesitation at all. He said by the time he realized what she was doing she was gone. She was a beautful person. Obviously I still miss her. OK enough gloom this morning. The Bridge is available on Netflix and I think YouTube. Bye
Struggle: Honestly my job is a constant struggle. It actually is not what I should be doing. But my wife's not working so I have no choice. Cannot even consider a move right now. Just need to accept this and soldier on...Triumph: 42 days sober!.....'nuff said!..General: Wishing everyone a great day....IWNDWYT

Struggle: My newborn hasn't been gaining weight so we're having to now supplement with formula... It's expensive (we have money no worries - We'd just rather spend it on better things) and mom is upset about her breastmilk production... I've also got the address stress of it being the end of the year at school (which means a ton of marking and paperwork) as well as the busiest time of year for the walking tour company that I manage...  .  .Triumph: I haven't had a drink in 45 days... That's almost half of the run that I had the year before year from Oct 2016 - February 2017 (110 or so) and I feel better suited now to not drinking than I did then (thanks in large part to the love and support I find in this sub)... I've also got the most amazing little girl and a beautiful wife and I have yet to miss a deadline for either job (somehow).  .  .General: Stress and feeling like shit has traditionally been my trigger... I figure that if I'm stressed a few drinks will help me unwind... Or that if I feel like shit anyway I may as well drink and have a proper reason for it. We're taking things one day at a time though and if you can make a promise not to drink with me today I can keep my promise not to drink with you... July is coming and with that some Summer downtime (and hopefully a bigger happier baby!)
Good morning u/sfgirlmary! Great post. I have quit both smoking and drinking and drinking was way way harder for me in every way. My circumstances of when I quit smoking were so unique that I always feel I can't even offer advice to others trying to quit because what happened to me can't be replicated (it involves moving to another state 2000 miles away which I was doing for work but happened to coincide with quitting!)...**Struggle** Returned to work yesterday and it appears the woman they offered the job I was also trying to get is taking a different job. So they've resumed the interview process. I'm not even good enough to be Plan B. I cried and sulked so much a few weeks ago over my job bullshit though that I found it fairly easy not to get too upset about it. I'm certainly not happy about it though...**Triumph** I take at least one short solo road trip a year. These are not usually big drinking things for me but certainly drinking has been a a part of them that would go without saying for a long time now. The dinner options would be carefully planned for places with fancy craft cocktails or house-brewed IPAs or that sort of thing. This time I didn't even look at reviews online or anything and in fact mostly stuck to cheese and crackers and such in my hotel room or picnic areas to save money and avoid temptation. But I really wasn't even tempted. Damn near zero desire to drink. I would not have believed such a thing possible 4 months ago. Freedom baby yeah!!!..**General:** Had talk with BF last night that I've been thinking about for a while. Told him his GF drinking buddy is gone forever and asked if that was OK with him. He said yes whatever's best for me as long as I don't get into trying to change him. I said that's fine but you have to know I'll always be thinking that what's best for you is to quit entirely (he's truly cut down a lot these past 4 months but still). 
**Triumph:** I joined a climbing mentorship program. Basically it's a group of six climbers at all different experience levels who get together a few times during the summer to touch base with each other concerning our goals learn about different climbing resources and opportunities and \(possibly\) meet some new climbing buddies/partners!..**Struggle:** I joined a couple dating apps in the past week and I forgot how addicting they can be how much anxiety they cause and how frustrating they are for guys. That being said I have a date set for this coming weekend!..**General:** I went on vacation last week and my sister was really considerate about my decision to not drink when coming up with plans. I'm glad she's on my side!
**Struggle:** A failed root canal and two split molars ended with having to remove both. Surprisingly it hurt at an existential level; my body falling apart giving up on me growing old way before time. Plus wasted pain and money. Sigh...**Triumph:** Our previous insurance agency called to get us back. Wether we change or not we re about to save a considerable amount on equal or better terms. It even turns out that I might be eligible for cashing out a monthly health insurance on myself. Not much but every drop helps!..**General:** The garden is in full summer bloom! So far spring has been better than most summers. We even planted the sunflowers the kid brought home form his kindergarden gardening project under the kitchen window. It ll be exiting to see if they make it...u/sfgirlmary yes that s my experience too. And two years after I quit smoking I never ever craved it again. Guess not drinking won t be exactly the same duh.
**Struggle:** My not drinking was exposed at work and the whole thing is really bothering me. It's not something I put out there but apparently one of the very few people who does know mentioned it to someone else in conversation. This person decided to say something at the end of our weekly staff meeting last week in front of everybody including my manager. In my true awkward style I avoided the conversation by running away (although I legit had another meeting to get to). One person who I've had boundary issues with before practically chased me down the hall pumping me for more information on this revelation. All I really said was yeah I haven't had a drink in almost two years now and then I went into my other meeting. I have so many feelings over this but I'm really mostly mad that it didn't happen on my terms. ..**Triumph:** I'm trying to find something positive about the above situation and I guess I'm kind of relieved that it's out there now. I have absolutely no intention of answering personal questions from people just being nosy or trying to get the dirt on me but so far it hasn't come up again. And if anything it's strengthened my resolve that I don't drink and I'm damn proud of that. If anybody doesn't like it they can fuck right off. ..**General:** Happy quit smoking-versary Mary! I've struggled a lot to quit smoking and while I haven't had a cigarette in over a year now I do still vape nicotine. I once went 2 years off nicotine all together and all it took was one sneaky cigarette to eventually pull me back in. 
Struggle: I am substituting sugar for alcohol. So far no weight gain but......Triumph: Celebrating 55 days sober!.General : My therapist still wants me to do AA.  I have not convinced her that r/stopdrinking is my AA.  My struggles are real!  
Struggle: Anxiety has returned. So I need to listen to my body and observe my monkey brain and figure out how to calm my mind. All my problems are first\-world problems. Need to breathe slow down lighten up laugh. I can handle this. ..Triumph: My productivity is up and I am also learning to prioritize relaxation. My plan for how to spend my time today/tonight matches my priorities pretty well: Work out for health support kids big\-rock career stuff some music\-making this evening. Homemaking gets short shrift as usual but at least I paid bills last night. ..General: Shopping at home \- I love it! Will definitely try it. Could work in pantry or freezer too. 
**Triumph:** Yesterday a friend ask about my mental state. "I'm OK" was my honest answer. It's true. I could be a lot better-happier more rested more productive. But I could and have been a lot worse...**Struggle:** At times it's easy to focus on the gap between where I am and how I'm coping and where I would like to be I my idealized world. If I do then I become "not OK" quite quickly...**General:** Recommend me some music. I'm stuck in a rut and need something new.
Struggle: Work is going through a major transition period lots of long stressful days.  Sometimes I miss being able to look forward to a beer at the end of the grind...Triumph: I've gotten back into fitness in a big way.  Using that to blow off steam at the end of the day and it keeps me from drinking since lifting weights is way harder with a buzz going.  I'm in the best shape of my life right now and loving it...General: Looking forward to hitting the 1 month mark.  Haven't been sober anywhere near this long already since before I had my first drink at 14.  I know it's one day at a time so I'm trying to stay grounded in that.  I'm finally enjoying spending quality time with my kids first thing every morning instead of dumping them in front of the TV so I can nurse my latest hangover.  I always wanted to be a better father to my kids than mine was to me and I'm starting to think that maybe I actually will be.  Feels really good.
Not drinking today.  Dinner with friends and I will say no thanks if I get offered anything. 
Struggle:  A whole lot of changes are hitting me at once. After a long period of being single I've met someone really great. We are trying to not rush things but it's hard not to for both of us. The thing we have seems to have a mind of its own. This is all wonderful but it is a HUGE change for me. I feel like something is ending and there is always something bittersweet and even sad about that. On top of that I was hit with a couple very stressful issues this week things coming back to haunt me from my broken past. I have been putting myself not BACK together but really together for the first time. But there are some problems that have lingered that I have to figure out how to solve. And frankly I don't want to face them. Which is another problem an internal problem I realize. ...Triumph:   I really have not been tempted to drink at all through this. Even six months sober I can't imagine not being sorely tempted if not caving completely in a couple moments I've had in the past week. The girl I'm dating drinks and I told her I'm fine with that. But there's literally been an open bottle of wine in my kitchen the last two nights and I never came close to having some or even really thought about it.   My brain has rewired itself. It simply does not see a glass of wine as an answer to stress. Nor does it say to me this dinner date is going great but I bet if I had some wine with her it would be even better. ...General:  It really is crazy how much change can happen at once. I am definitely beginning (or being swept up by) a transition of some sort. It had to happen at some point. 
**Struggle:** My mom isn't doing so hot. She broke her back in October and since then has been housebound. Since then she's had cement put in to try and help but it didn't work. She's had full on surgery scheduled but has been unable to complete it due to other complications like a gall bladder infection and liver abscess. She is barely eating and I feel terrible that I can't be around more to help. I've been feeling terribly dizzy lately; 8+ hours a day of diziness headaches and naseau I feel boatsick all day. I went to see the doctor yesterday and he thinks it's either high blood pressure or a problem with my inner ear. Going back on my bystolic to see if it clears up and if not heading to ENT next week...**Triumph:** I went to see her this weekend my dad says that's the best she has seen her in a long time. We ordered chinese and she ate more than he's seen in months. She even was able to stand and wash the dishes over the course of a few hours. In the past 2 weeks I have gone for walks on nice days (it's been raining for a week straight so I have to make sure that I get back to it once it clears up) and semi-repaired the herman miller chair which I've had sitting in the corner of my apartment for 2 years...**General:** I've always been a cautious saver I have a good chunk of change sitting in my bank account "just in case." I've been doing some window shopping on upgrading some of my belongings. I want to switch my shitty futon for a real couch invest in a low-budget sound system for my TV (I hate flatscreens with the speakers on the back I'm constantly changing volumes between action shootouts and whispering dialogue and it's probably all getting sent through the wall to my neighbors) and maybe swap out some computer parts. I'm waiting on my lease renewal to go through which is taking an unsettlingly long time. I submitted my intent to renew 2 months out from the end of my lease but haven't gotten a confirmation yet if they decide they don't want me renewing I'll have a month to find a new place to stay.
Struggle: figuring out how to turn down free drinks at work. I've never overdrank at work but always accepted a drink. People questioned whether I was pregnant. Ugh. ..Triumph: I am speaking at a conference with over 200 people today. I woke up no hangover no worry of looking disheveled or needing to shower the smell of alcohol away. Just getting into public speaking is enough of a learning curve no need for the added anxiety of a hangover. Putting myself on a path of personal and professional success!! 
Happy Hump Day y'all - and congratulations on the nonsmokeaversary /u/sfgirlmary !!! I also reckon shopping at home is the best. I have issues with object constancy [that date right back to childhood] so I literally forget the existence of most of my clothes if they are in the wardrobe my chest of drawers or stored away between seasons. I am continually delighted when I do bother to look in either place instead of just wearing stuff that is either in my easy-to-reach clothes cupboard or clean laundry pile and I rediscover all these fab items I forgot I owned! This week it was my absolute favourite blue wool cardigan got rediscovered plus a pair of really good slip-on winter shoes. :)..
Struggle: As I explained yesterday ongoing stress from my complex almost caused me to break my sobriety yesterday...Triumph: Thanks to this sub I recognized the anxiety for what it was and attended my first AA meeting. It calmed me down and the leader gave me a copy of the Big Book. He showed me in the book a section about overcoming resentment. I'm still not sure it's for me longterm but yesterday it's exactly what I needed. I came home calm. I did not drink...General: Tomorrow is Day 21 and while some days have been a struggle my life now is so much better than 3 weeks ago. Waking up each morning sober is a gift. Today's motivation from my app was just what I need to hear to remain vigilant and mindful. "Sobriety is never owned; it's rented. And rent is due every day."..Here's to keeping my rent current today. Thank for the support y'all. 
Struggle: still reeling from a recent breakup (dated 3 years) that definitely had some degree to do with bad decisions I made while drinking. ..Triumph: deciding to finally put an end to all this drinking madness yesterday. I look forward to what the future holds. ..General: I get to volunteer at my kids field day today and I won't be hungover doing it. Suppose that falls into Triumph too :)
Struggle: everything.Triumph: had a good chat with Mom last night. Was completely honest about everything going on in my life. It felt good to get a few things off my chest. I think I'm going to find a counselor today..And I'm not going to drink today
Struggle: Day 2 I know my husband sees how i'm faring and the first thing he'll want to do is buy me a drink tomorrow when he gets paid. I'm so scared I won't be able to refuse it. ..Triumph: Had coffee this morning and played with my little girl. Watching her laugh and smile reminded me of how much I want to be here for the rest of her life that I have to be better to accomplish that. ..General: I can't wait for GOT all the shows I'm watching lately suck. .I'm very appreciative of this sub I need this so much and reading about others who are also recovering is beyond helpful. One day at a time...
[removed]
**S:**  I've got ants in my kitchen.  I've been processing honey so my kitchen is a total mess and the honey is attracting ants...**T:**  I sold my hives so I've got a little extra cash and things have been tight lately. ..**G:** Listening to James Brown on my cell phone and I'm thinking this might sound really good on vinyl.
Triumph: Finally (finally) decided to go to an inpatient partial program to treat depression/anxiety issues...Struggle: I want the results but I don't want to put in the hard work.  ..General: Been following through with pop-up free exercise class on Wednesday morning and a running club Tuesday night.  Been going to both for the last 3 weeks and plan on going until the winter.
Struggle: figuring out what to do with my job situation. Started a new job and hated it. Incredibly stressed. Last couple weeks it's been better. Ride it out or keep looking for new gigs?..Triumph: admitted I need to quit drinking not temporarily stop. I feel great so far!..General: I'm trying to grow grass on empty lawn patches. No idea what I'm doing but I'm driven to fix it!
struggle: same old loving and missing the wrong person...triumph: diet and exercising my butt off...general: my anxiety has been better which is a relief. work is still stressful. i am grateful i am in the mindset to exercise and treat my body right. now i just gotta treat my heart better.
Struggle: I'm traveling to my old town next week and thinking about contacting a friend or two to make amends. It's stressful and scary...Triumph: Went out to trivia night with my friends on Monday abstained from alcohol all night AND gave away my free bar tab that we got when we won!..General: I have started journaling and find it helpful...though I would like to be more regular about it.
Struggle: I assume others have this issue how do you handle feeling like you don't "really" have a problem because it's nothing like person X? For me it's like hey I didn't drive drunk or anything I would just get drunk every night at home and go to sleep so what's  the harm...Triumph - Finally had a real breakthrough in counseling. Also have gotten up at 6am 2 days in a row to workout again for the first time in awhile...General - Turning off my flair bc the days aren't right now and I don't want to change it again until I can hit 60 days.
Keep up the work you guys you're all doing great!!..Day 14 for me..Struggle - the other half is in rehab. Has been gone 14 days. Living alone whilst working 70+ hours a week to pay bills and having to look after myself whilst withdrawing and look after the house and garden. I'm full on shattered. The drive for wine was there in full force but I've resisted and intend to do so until I make the decision to go to bed.... SOBER...Triumph - woke up early thanks to ongoing insomnia used my time wisely.... cooked dinner (yes this morning ha ha) for myself my mom and sister (they liked it). Did some yoga and all before work. Faced work feeling fresh and productive I've made work lunches for the next 2 days and now have my feet up reading your guys accounts of your day :-)..General - the other half has 14 days left to go in rehab. I'm excited and scared in equal measures about what our sober futures hold together .IWNDWYT
*Struggle:* I'm really struggling with my anxiety over my medical read out post blood test. All of my panel etc. was great with the exception of AST/ALT. I've spent way too much time on google rabbit holes trying to self diagnose problems with no good results. I've seen a doctor nurse practitioner and an ER and still can't shake it. Going to a follow up tomorrow. Really hoping I can walk away from there feeling better. Trying to schedule a psychiatric appointment has not been easy...*Triumph:* Even with all that anxiety I haven't picked up a drink. Not the most original but I'm feeling really great about this. Have been to spin class 3 of the last four days. Heading to one shortly...*General:* My La Croix consumption is teetering on the absurd at this point. These empties are easier to throw out though. .
**Struggle:**  I am so tired from a bad night's sleep and a 5 AM run.  And seriously lacking the desire to be productive on work.  Hence hanging with y'all today...**Triumph:**  I'm not tired from a hangover!  I can still train a new employee and be in a good mood.  And I'm looking forward to the 10K I have diligently trained for with my GF on Monday.  Life is full of ups and downs but booze is no longer putting me in my own way...**General:**  I am the opposite - as a woman I am shockingly short on owning clothing.  My GF is much more male-leaning in her clothing choices but she is a clotheshorse and much more conscious about her appearance than me.  I've got long blonde hair that I have to remember to brush before I go to work and I throw on something that doesn't look too wrinkled or mismatched before I go to work as a manager.  It's not that I have low self-esteem but this stuff is so unimportant to me.  Funny.  I went from high heels and mini skirts as a teenager to loose clothes no makeup and forgetting to shave as responsible adult.
This person in university made a couple of suggestions of us hanging out. This hasn't happened in years. I have this warm feeling in my stomach and feel like I am worth something. Being sober and having attention disorder can make you isolated but I just feel so happy that I can connect with somebody. You know how we sometimes feel as if the current situation is permanent? Things are bad today therefore things have always been bad and will always be? I think I have deluded myself into thinking I'm incapable of friendships or relationships for so long. This person sort of pulled the foundations of these ridiculous thoughts and I just feel so incredibly thankful for it.
Almost a month for me   first time posting on this sub after lurking for half of a year. I think it's longer than a month but I'm not counting right now. Still trying to process how to celebrate without alcohol. I heavily drank for a year and a half I feel like I just woke up from an awful nightmare. I'm 21/F in Chicagoland if anyone needs a sober friend in the 312. ..Does the sleeping get better? This has really thrown a wrench into my sleep (staying up until 5AM getting up at 8AM feeling shitty until I nap) but the emotional and other physical (my hair was falling out.) effects are too good to go back. IWNDWYT 
wow. i am going to look into that documentary
Struggle: I'm halfway through Day 4 now but I'm finding my attention wandering easily and I'm struggling to focus on work.  .Triump: I'm on Day 4 and I 'feel' like I'm through the worst of the withdrawals now but I'm sure they'll pop up here and there.  .General: I woke up with a kink in my neck so bad I had trouble sleeping and can barely move it yikes. 
Struggle: Ive been unmotivated to do anything lately and can only really manage to go to work tend to my garden and lay around all day maybe playing videogames but more often doing literally nothing...Truimph: I didnt end up stealing any of my dad's tequila while taking care of their cat thanks to the support I've found on here. So a huge thank you to everyone at r/stopdrinking because i was very close to nabbing that shit a couple days ago...General: Im downloading Metroid Samus Returns and its taking really long to finish up.
S: Trying to get sober (again. Though since I started drinking in my early 20's I haven't ever had much time sober) and I have a lot of guilt over that feeling that I've wasted so much time. I went to an AA meeting today and introduced myself as a newcomer. No one talked to me after the meeting and I felt lonely and insecure. I managed shortly after to realize that at least the insecure feelings were not warranted. I've decided to also give up (at least for now) things like TV phone games Twitter consuming tons of news and other useless internet stuff because I think they're closely tied with my drinking behavior in that they distract me from feeling anything. I also feel they isolate me from others and deepen the feelings of loneliness. Congrats to the people who've quit smoking. I need to too but no way am I going to try to tackle that yet. Anyway all that being said I struggle with not knowing how to occupy my time or my mind. As I'm writing this I'm realizing how fearful I am of being bored/sitting with my thoughts..T: I'm not jonesing for a drink right now. I also feel good about finding this Reddit section. This is the first time I've posted on Reddit (at least that I remember? I'm an alcoholic after all. I assume there's some way to see my own previous posts?) Anyway thank you to the previous posters especially the ones with only a handful of days. I felt a sense of relief from just general anxiety from reading other posts that I didn't expect to feel coming in here. Thanks..G: I graduated with my master's degree ten years ago to the day. I think that's part of the reason I've felt an urgency to quit drinking set in.
