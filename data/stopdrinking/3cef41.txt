My boyfriend relapsed on his 9 month sober anniversary three weeks ago. I found him dying and got him to the ER in time. It was incredibly scary seeing someone I love so dearly surrounded by doctors trying to start his heart thinking there was no way he'd pull through.  The following week was the hardest I've had in sobriety- he went back out and continued to use. I was anxious terrified sad and craving hard. It took everything in me to stay sober and thank god for the supportive people in my life who helped me stay sane. He has since entered a reputable treatment facility and is doing well. I have been continuing to struggle fighting the urge to take over everything to find some sense of control in my life. However I did not drink over it. I have 15 months in a week. For that I'm grateful but dealing with real life sober is proving to be a challenge. ..I just found this subreddit today and I'm brand new to reddit so thanks for hearing me out..

Wow that is intense. So glad you did not relapse as well. This is a very supportive group. Do you have an external support system?
