Long vent/share ahead... (tl;dr: thanks SD for helping me stay strong. it's still hard though)..My SO is in a wedding out-of-town and so for the first time I've flown to another place without drinking on the plane--I used to drink to be okay with the idea with dying in a plane crash. Honestly I probably just wanted an excuse--I'm afraid of flying but I made my peace this time sober. Now I'm alone with our baby at the hotel. My wife is at the bachelorette party. For the first time I don't have a hotel fridge full of beer. I used to use vacations as an excuse to drink all day but I don't want to have to quit again...I want to stay sober today and so on. I feel cliche because a few drunken weeks after becoming a father I started to feel afraid for my kid. I felt aware of how I just 'hold it together'. How would he learn to live with me clearly taking every chance to escape? I felt myself pushing reality away and losing love. So about 61 days ago I took a break to check myself...Being sober has been less social for me but at least I'm around the house for the baby. I've been partying some nights with ice cream and I LOVE seltzer. I stocked my hotel fridge last night--even got some mexican coke to drink mmm that sugar. It's like a beer but I don't want to drink 10 more. (I realized a while ago that giving up soda was really just bs when I switched to beer and drank all those sugary IPAs--drunk high horse much?)..My friends have been understanding mostly. I haven't elaborated much on my commitment to sobriety beyond saying I want to get back in touch with life before drinking. I've alluded to giving it up forever and they have been kind and cool about it. I dont really think about the scale of 'forever' mostly. Each day I wake up aware of the same problem so I don't drink...Being here I think the next step is to really give therapy another try. I'm happy that I am sober but I'm very often not happy. I don't really miss drinking per se. I definitely wish I felt like a normal drinker and could do that but it just seems like those days have come and gone or never were. At one point it became a problem and it's like a broken mirror I can't put back together...What I've 'learned' so far is that I seem to often be angry and I don't know how to be idle without alcohol. My SO always said she wished I could relax--I always feel like I need to be doing something. Now that I don't think about drinking I often think about work. My job has been tough the last year or 2. I'm engaged in (or sometimes haunted by) the technical problems I have to face. I'm a programmer. Each day there are more and more bugs and development to do but my company is understaffed and it's really insurmountable. I don't always know how to even be productive or make incremental progress. Hey like sobriety in general!..I feel weak and scatterred. A lot of days I just want to get home and go to sleep. Escape into rest. I'm often angry and sad. ..I try not to think about the wasted opportunities but it happens. I also can't help but think about lost love but I think that's actually just clinging to lost youth. My SO is closer and better to me than any past lover. Some days I tell her how many days I've been sober and she acts proud...I think I'm probably clinically depressed :/ I feel warm and loving toward my wife and kid most of the time but sometimes I just wish it were over. I have micro fantasies about me dying some honorable accidental death. I want us to be happy but the struggle/dukkha of life has got me down. The only path I'm on now is one of trying to be sober and trying to be good to my wife and kid. I try to remember to be mindful but sometimes I really don't want to be...Conversely sometimes I'm very happy and silly. I love to make people laugh and that's invigorating...I don't know what's wrong exactly but I'm working on it. Some days it's nothing other days it's everything. If you got this far thanks for reading. And again thanks to this sub for being something to read and relate to. I'm here every day these days but mostly quiet. Good luck to you all...EDIT: edited tldr at top.

Thanks for this cool post.  Good luck stay happy and silly.
Thank you for sharing. I enjoyed reading it. When I saw:..&gt; What I've 'learned' so far is that I seem to often be angry and I don't know how to be idle without alcohol. My SO always said she wished I could relax--I always feel like I need to be doing something...I was going to suggest meditation as that has helped me a lot with those same feelings. Then I noticed the Buddhist keywords in your post (dukkha mindful) - do you meditate?..&gt; Being here I think the next step is to really give therapy another try...Please do this. As someone who doesn't know you some of the things you wrote made me concerned about your safety. .
