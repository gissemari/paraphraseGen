He put me on Naltrexone Monday after my relapse on Sunday night. (Which I told on myself to the IOP facilitator and the group.) This shit is working like a charm not sure if its just the placebo affect or it is actually working... Either way I have been sober since Sunday and looking forward to being sober today! There has been a few side effects which the doc says is normal. I feel better than I have in years!!!!.Excited for what the future holds for myself but not looking to far into the future. One Day One Hour One Minute at a time for me..My next IOP session is tonight right after work until 9pm. I used to  dread going to these things but now I honestly look forward to them!..And today is Turkey Thursday (see what I did there) Every Thursday I am making myself a turkey sammich :)....Sorry for rambling....TLDR: Got Naltrexone sober since Sundays relapse. Feeling Great. Turkey Thursday!

Placebo effect fucking rules. Your post looks upbeat and positive...For me taking action in my life making choices that fit with my values and being empowered have changed my whole world.
Legend! Whatever works and is safe is good.
