Hi All..It's been a miserable winter (weather wise) and I find myself financially able to go away this winter. I'm dying for some sunshine and a nice relaxing beach. The problem here is that I can't find anyone to go with. I've called a couple of the websites that sell these all inclusive vacations and asked about their knowledge of A.A. meetings on site (even mentioned that it might be called a "Friends of Bill W. meeting") and one of the people mentioned that in 10 years of working there he had never been asked that question...I'm really struggling with what to do. I want to go away for a week and get out of this weather but I honestly don't know if I could safely be there alone. ..Thank you all for listening.

You can always just find a non inclusive resort or an Airbnb apartment and furnish your own groceries. I'm sure there are meetings in many resort towns...build the vacation around your needs not around what inclusive resorts offer. 
We have been using Vacation Rental By Owner (VRBO) with great success.  There are others.  Depending where you go you can locate local meetings ahead of time.  Enjoy!
Search for "spas" instead of "resorts."  Many of them are all-inclusive and health-oriented.  They might have what you are looking for.  
If you google Sober Vacations you'll find several companies that specialize in this! They have all-inclusive options that plan your days with activities dinners and meetings. In addition the others in attendance are sober as well so you may leave with some great friends too...I only know this because I too am looking for a sober vacation. I was looking at yoga and healthy eating retreats but also stumbled upon these other companies as well. Have a great time!
