I seem to struggle with moderation in every facet of life. If there's a button that makes me feel good when I press it I will just keep pressing it until it doesn't work any more. I can't moderate caffeine I can't moderate sweets and snacks I can't even moderate dieting. For example when dieting I find myself having consumed 1/3 of the "bare minimum" or calories feeling fine and then being like oh shit actually what I am doing is unhealthy and I'm failing to moderate my weight loss...Those of you who encounter similar problems with moderation of non-drug things and have fully or partially conquered this personality quirk how did you do it? What skills did you practice what perspectives helped you change your approach to this? I don't want to moderate alcohol I am 1000% happy with being sober from that but I don't want sobriety from unhealthy food relaxation or love all of which feel good and all of which I seem to take to extremes. And I want a fucking waffle sometimes. ..Any and all rambles appreciated. Love y'all &lt;3

I did read a very helpful book called  Why diets make us fat  by Sandra Aamodt that laid out a rationale and method for  mindful eating.  Maybe would be helpful for you. Best wishes!
