So I've seen a lot of new people join just in the short amount of time that I joined this sub. A lot of us struggle within the first couple of weeks. I was thinking of making this post in hopes to help out others more and see What others do for coping. What are some of your own personal coping skills when it comes to avoiding alcohol. Maybe people who read the responses can gain some new skill to try out that works for them. For me I go to the gym great stress releiver.

Dropping a few things that helped or that are helping me out..  .* Stopped going to parties and events where there's booze involved. Saying "NO!" is not a crime. Used the *playing the tape forward* technique to back me up. I rarely go to parties now..* To ease with the anxiety I move my body. And by moving I mean move until I'm exhausted. Exercise..* I have had deep underlying agression. Boxing does wonders for me. It's exhausting to a level where I just sit on the mat at the gym puking into a bucket and feeling like crying my emotions out. Trainer comes in and comforts me saying I've been doing great. Mind's at ease afterwards. Never knew..* **Play the tape forward** when the cravings kick in. This one is a really helpful one.  .* Never do nothing I take my time for myself and only myself.  .* No matter how deep the emotion sits drinking won't ever cut it. It took some time for my brain to adjust - and it's not done yet and possibly won't ever be. Leaving the pink cloud was a lightbulb moment. This is the time when I started working on underlying problems.
Boxing until you cry and puke. Same result as drinking but a billion times better for you!..I am the biggest advocate of exercise and boxing in particular. ..
* Running. I have always done this though. ..*  Having something soothing to drink. For me this is tea. ..*  Ice cream or a treat of some sort. I treat myself now WAY more than I ever have.  ..*  I've recently been playing the tape forward. It works to look at the what if or what will be. .
