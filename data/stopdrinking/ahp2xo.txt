I see a lot of posts from people struggling on Day 17.  That was how far I made it on my first real quit attempt.  Now I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety and emotions and I am realizing that it is right around that same 2-3 week mark...Is there a reason that this stretch feels so challenging?  I'm riding it out but it just made me wonder.
