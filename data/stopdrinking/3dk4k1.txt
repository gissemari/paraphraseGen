Typing this with about two typos per line from lithium tremors don't mind me. ..I just wanted to point out/educate that getting sober sometimes dovetails in with dealing with the "real" problems. For me this was bipolar 1 mood swings + GAD + depression. _Thanks mom and dad_. Things may suck once you're sober but it may be a thing that can be fixed: the first 20 or so times I quit and relapsed certainly weren't helped by the anxiety and depression. Diagnosing these was impossible while I was drinking - just too many common symptoms. ..So hang tough bipolar drinkers. Mood stabilizers and antidepressants are out there some of them will work. You'll need some patience - I got delayed by a year-long manic/psychotic episode and over-cautious doctors but I got here. .(Lamictal lithium and seroquel FYI)
