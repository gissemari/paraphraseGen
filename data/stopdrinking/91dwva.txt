My partner of ten years married for 6 wrote a long letter to me today to say he wants to end our relationship. Even though it has been rough for a long time I am devastated because I thought perhaps we could give it some time &amp; revisit it once we've been apart a bit &amp; worked on ourselves. He says 10 years is enough time to have given it but I feel like 10 years is a big part of why I'm not ready to give up. A quarter of my life with him. I love him beyond belief. I will not drink...I regret so deeply that over the past year I managed to quit a couple of times for a couple of weeks &amp; how he supported me &amp; I can still hear the pride in his voice for me. I was alone in NY without any immediate support &amp; really struggling with anxiety &amp; depression &amp; I failed. I resumed drinking &amp; made some enormous &amp; harmful mistakes when I visited him that I guess will never be forgiven. It is terrible to not be forgiven. I feel damned...Some of us get to thinking we can moderate &amp; I just want to say don't throw your life &amp; everything you love away for that 1 drink that you know in your heart won't be 1 drink. I would do anything anything to change what I've done.

What were the mistakes you made when you visited him?
forgive yourself... alcohol is the devil we suffer under
  I'm taking this moment to feel the deep sadness of my own regrets.  I'm sorry friend.  Let's carry forward sober and make good things in this environment we are creating for each other.  I'm with you I won't drink with you today.  
I'm so sorry you are going through this. Thank you for posting; I needed to hear this.
I can really relate to what you say about investing a long time in a relationship and not wanting that to have been a waste of time. But it wasn't. You grew you learned something about yourself that you will take into the next phase of your life. Cliche but true. I'm sorry for your pain and IWNDWYT.
