Car recently broke down which has made going to local meetings near impossible. Struggling today and it's a lifesaver to have you all to lean on. I will not drink with you today. Thank you so much.

Sorry about the car!!!  Life can be tough/unfair sometimes!  Good luck with everything! IWNDWYT!
That's a bummer! I think there are some I liken meetings and forums for AA too if that's what u need. Thanks for being here with us! 
If you find a way to get to a meeting may I suggest getting some phone numbers?  Talking with a friend from AA on the telephone has been really helpful for me from time to time.  Keep going back. It works. IWNDWYT. 
Hang in there!!  Great job for reaching out by posting.  You got this!
