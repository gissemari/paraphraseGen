I am really struggling to forgive myself for the awful and embarrassing things I've done while drunk. I keep replaying things over in my mind to no end and I simply can't remember all the details. I constantly beat myself up about it. All I know is I've done and said terrible things that I cannot take back. I feel a lot of shame because of it and don't know how to forgive myself and move past it.  Some days I just want to crawl in a hole and not face the world. Any suggestions?

I've been there. It's hard to forgive yourself especially when you're laying in bed all day and night with it rerunning through your head...I try to do something good for myself when I'm in that mind space. Go for a walk take myself out for ice cream sometimes I just sit at my desk and breathe. Sometimes doing that stuff is hard for me but I do feel better once I force myself to do it. Even if it's just a tinier bit better better than if I let the negative thoughts control me. That's a victory.
Brene Brown says  Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love.   If someone I knew had struggled with addiction and was trying to make positive changes I would be forgiving.  We often are hardest on ourselves.  This quote reminds me to try to be kind to myself...I'm sending positive thoughts your way!
I've been there. It's important to remember time heals all wounds. The further away from the incident the better you will feel. We can't do anything to change our past actions the only thing we can do is control our future actions. No one is perfect is the world and we've all made mistakes!
I've been going through the same and just want to say thank you for posting.
Thanks so much!
