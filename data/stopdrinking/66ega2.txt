I had a lovely chat with my SO. I mentioned how much I appreciate not having alcohol in the house and mentioned how I only seem to get cravings during the couple of hours after work when I used to have my first drink...Then I mentioned that I lost most of my cravings during the year-13 months I didn't drink a few years ago. Spouse said "You quit drinking for more than a year? When?"..Sobernauts my spouse of 18 years *didn't remember* a year of sobriety I did about 4 years ago. On the one hand I guess it's a good sign; if my drinking had caused him major distress he'd likely remember the year I didn't drink. But geez. That year is a huge part of my motivation now: it was difficult and triumphant and I want that feeling back...I reminded him of a couple of major events that year and he remembered my quitting but hadn't realized how long it lasted. He asked "Did I drink during that year?" When I said that he had he said "Wow that must have been really hard for you." Uh...yeah...So I'm kind of flummoxed/irritated that my initial journey of recovery and healing didn't remain on his radar. I must have internalized all that struggle more than I thought. On the other hand it's typical of his optimistic outlook on life where everything is almost always good...But it's made me realize that I might want to post here a bit more often. He's supportive but since he doesn't struggle with alcohol like I do he probably can't understand what's going on in my mind..

Your last sentence pretty much sums it up. In my recovery journey I'm on my own when it comes to really relating my experiences with those who haven't been through the tremendous struggle that alcohol presented for me. That includes my husband. He's supportive and proud of me but will never truly understand it all--I hope he never has to. And that's all right. There are *many* who completely understand and really we aren't hard to find :) I let my husband do his thing I'm grateful for his support. When I get peeved about his minimizing things that are kind of big deals for me I try to remember that there are many whose SO's can be a roadblock to recovery. ..Glad you're here. I've found a lot of support here--daily--sometimes just by coming and reading other times getting some kudos for getting over tough hurdles. 
Your post is so interesting - your SO has no problems with alcohol and does not notice yours.  I want to be like your SO :)  But unfortunately I can't.  I realize that 1 drink is never just 1 drink.  And it's been so hard making 7 days but it's a victory.  Every day is a victory - well done on 23 days.
Leave it to a normie to not understand how *monumental* "not drinking" is! I deal with it all the time too. When I want accolades and congratulations and parades for my sober achievements I'm usually met with a confused stare. How completely inconsiderate!..Once the outrage and self-pity fades (admittedly that's not always as quick as it should be...) I realize it's usually a good opportunity to not take myself so damn seriously. And a great reminder that even though those close to me benefit from it my sobriety is for **me** at the end of the day.
I quit 10 days ago in the midst of bronchitis.  My SO serioously asked me to cut back nearly a year ago and since that time I got worse.  I was an at home binge drinker often starting in the morning hoping to sleep  it off before he got home.  Needless to say I was not all that successful.  ..Just this morning he commented on how nice it was that I was not drinking and when he came home we could have real conversations that I would remember.  Little does he know just HOW BAD my drinking was.  He never saw the multiple vodka bottles being sneaked into the trash each week.  And I am not about to tell him. And I don't think he really wants to know. So as supportive he is this is **my private battle**.  His beer and red wine are in the house but I have no cravings for them.  (Thank goodness!)  He has had his occasional drink in front of me and I don't seem to care at the moment.  Perhaps it is because I have been sick in another way...Regardless I think your last sentence sums it up:.&gt;He's supportive but since he doesn't struggle with alcohol like I do he probably can't understand what's going on in my mind...Maybe he is not the one you need to turn to.  He probably can't understand and perhaps does not want to.  And maybe that's okay.
