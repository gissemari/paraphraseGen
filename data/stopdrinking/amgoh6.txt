Probably the longest I've gone without drinking in 15 years.  Long post but I'm feeling good.  Long time lurker and your posts (along with reading This Naked Mind as often suggested) made me realize that I needed to do something about my problem.  I've known that I have a problem for many years but have never had the courage to do anything about it...I was drinking almost a fifth of whiskey or 15 beers a night toward the end.  I was/am worried about withdrawal and was/am ready to go to a professional if I started struggling.  But I haven't had a single symptom- pretty much the opposite actually. I have been able to sleep much better than before even night 1 (I smoke pot so that helps). I used to get the sweats at night and haven't had them since stopping.  I am less irritable and talk to people at work more. I have less anxiety because I feel in control for the first time in a long time - I am going to repair my life hour by hour instead of lying in bed drunk or hungover.  Things might stay the same but at least they won't keep getting worse. Maybe it's just a honeymoon and I get hit hard later on but I'm going to remain optimistic.  Also I live in a large city very close to several detoxes and hospitals.  I am ready to go seek help at any moment.  Withdrawal is no joke - don't think my experience is how yours will be.  Get help if you think you need it...I've killed time during the week rewatching some tv series I like but would always watch drunk (Shameless True Detective S1)- I cant believe how much I don't remember from hours of episodes that I've already  seen'.  I've also been playing some online video games - amazing how much better I am with some full motor skills.  Long term plan is to get into some fitness - doing some spin classes and lifting on my own to get into some base shape and then some group classes like CrossFit long term to get in with a healthier crowd not centered around drinking.  I'm in the lottery for the NYC Marathon and really hope luck strikes and I get in.  I made it last year via lottery (always dreamed of running it) and kept telling myself I'd quit drinking tomorrow and start training.  I never quit.  I never started training.  I never ran the marathon...I really have no urge or cravings to drink at the moment.  I've accepted that it's not for me.  I'm enjoying not being in constant need to find a bottle make a drink or to nurse a hangover.  I am feeling the benefits of being more productive.  My head already feels clearer...I am now cleaning my apartment - it is amazing how much filth drunk me accepted.  I probably have $20 worth of empties just scattered everywhere. Shameful.  I am also unpacking boxes from my move.  I've lived here 12 months.  Drunk me wasted a year.  I just renewed the lease - Sober me won't waste another hour...IWNDWYT....
