Walking home I was so tempted to go to the brew pub. All I wanted was an iced tea and a chat and I'm reasonably certain I'd have stuck to that. But I know that it'd be tempting fate. So I decided to go to the frozen yogurt shop instead. It wasn't a great substitute but it was a better choice and I'm proud of myself. Also opted out of a work event tonight that has an open bar. I'd love to go and I have some friends who are attending and won't be drinking. But again why tempt myself? ..I also found a sober buddy for Halloween! Halloween is pretty much the biggest party weekend of the year for my friends. Lots are in the local Rocky Horror shadow cast and the weekend before is their chance to blow off steam and get trashed. I've always been a fan of these parties but I am not planning to drink this year. A friend who often chooses not to drink anyway has offered to stay sober with me. I'm really glad to know I won't be the only sober person there. ..Good luck & stay strong to anyone struggling today. We can all so this!
