I'm sorry to hear that mate. Do you have any plans for next time? You mentioned you have 10 beers behind you at this moment. Please only participate here when you're sober. You're welcome to read and post  /reply when you're feeling better &lt;3
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when sober. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
If you lack real-life support try coming here. Browse the sub comment here and there...There's also a community chat channel where there are people 24/7 live. Just click the relevant link (check the sidebar on the web or on mobile go to the sub's front page hit the 3 dots in the top and select *community information*)..You can start stopping right away and don't drink the rest of the day. 41 days sober + 3 days not = still better than 44 days not sober...Also I find the book "This Naked Mind" *tremendously* helpful. You can buy it online or get a digital version for free from the sidebar (on the web; on mobile on the sub's front page hit the 3 dots at the top and select community information)
It's ok it happens. What matters is you now recognize it. Might be an idea to find an AA meeting near you
