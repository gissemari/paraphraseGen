I should note that I had gone 6 months without drinking or smoking prior to a couple of relapses in the late fall/winter of 2014. However three weeks back on track and I've been out on a date with someone who guessed that I didn't drink based off of my skin and overall healthy presence. The benefits are worth it. Trust and believe.
