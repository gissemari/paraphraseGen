Hey y'all...I recently let go of my sponsor.  To be honest - it was a huge relief and I've been much happier since we split.   After 6 months of good teachings / sponsorship; I noticed that at a certain point they started to get pushy/controlling/impatient around a certain step.  The pushy energy around 'their way' and completing things on 'their timeline' caused me to feel quite annoyed by them which eventually led me to break up with them.  Their pushiness began to feel like a nagging parent; one who wants me to adapt and model *their* vision instead of being myself and mold my *own* vision. ..**QUESTION 1:** **Has the above scenerio ever happened to you?  If so what did you learn?**..The issue was: my sponsor wanted me to have a "spiritual ritual" *their way every day.*  Their suggestion didnt resonate with me.  I enjoy my ritual better as it made more sense to me my beliefs and my schedule. ..**QUESTION 2: Do you have a spiritual ritual? If so how often do you practice it? (If you'd like to share your ritual with other SD'ers feel free.)**..In the rooms of AA - I know there is a stigma about newbies needing to be re-programmed because of their resistant and egoic thinking.  However having been in the program for a while know - I can tell the difference between a new alcoholic who runs completely on ego and selfish thinking/behaviours...and one who is sober done the work and has made massive changes in their thinking/behaviour.  At almost 9 months sober...my sponsor would tell me non-stop that my alcoholic brain is permanently there and that I will constantly have to battle with alcoholic thinking.)  I am not sure how I feel about this theory. ..**QUESTION 3: What are your thoughts on this theory?  Can we break the patterns of alcoholic thinking/behaviours? Does not the big book state that we can "*****Recover from a hopeless state of mind and body?"*** ..I understand that ppl can relapse after 1 5 or even 10 years. (relapse is part of my story but I have genuinely learned from it.)  However I do believe that some people's alcoholic 'thinking' *CAN* change. '  Pain trauma and negative hopeless thoughts used to run my life now it no longer does.  I do believe new patterns of thinking/behaving can be created so that old patterns are never returned to.  **What is your experience?  Can alcoholics truly build a new way of life?  Or have some AA'ers taken it too far to say "We are totally screwed - because alcoholics at one point or another will default to old negetive thoughts and behaviours."**  ..Sometimes I feel like some sponsors like to label thought as 'you are sick sick forever! Even if you no longer drink.' ..I think there are extreme cases where a person can go through divorce lose their job etc and feel hopeless and resort back to drinking again as an old way to cope and forget they are alcoholic.  This happens often.  But if you have a solid program in place and support then you lessen the chances of resorting to old coping mechanisms.  Personally I don't believe our thinking is forever egoic and sick. That an alcoholic can legit build new thought patterns and coping tools.  That way when shit does hit the fan they know what to do. Also not all hopeless thinking is from alcoholism. It can be from a childhood trigger.  Non-alcoholics have triggers too! or negative thought patterns.  ..**What are your thoughts on Alcoholic thinking?  Can alcoholic thinking disintegrate over time with work &amp; complete abstinence?**..**Pro's and Con's about sponsorship?**..Thanks all!

Disclaimer: I'm an idiot.Q1: Yes and no. I left a sponser for the opposite reason unreachable due to their work but have heard and seen bad sponsorship and sponsies who just take back their own will. I still do that everyday...Q2: My sponser said "pray everyday and call me everyday cause that's what worked for me." I liked it because the freedom that allowed hail Satan..Q3: I don't think of it as just alcohol my first week sober I ordered a pizza and ate half got sick thought that was dumb. My second week sober I did it again. I have a problem with MORE. If left alone I can justify all my bullshit that I want..I like sponsorship and hate it because I have to tell on myself and be honest with someone about feelings and shit that I hate. But I'm also helping another alcoholic every time I give my sponsor a call.

I am agnostic - have been in AA for a very long time and yes some people have strong opinions on the "right"way to do it...There are wrong ways but no one right way.  And yes we can (and need to) change radically. in order to stay sober and be happy about it.  This change is multi leveled and ongoing...AND one of the changes that may be necessary is listening to people who think differently.  Turns out "Being right all the time" was a serious character flaw of mine - one which made quitting drinking much harder than it had to be.   My prejudices against those with faith had to go too - they have taught me much - though I still am not jesusized.

**Question 1**..I've fired a sponsor for that shit before. I had just moved cities. Had 2 years sober and she was contently telling me that I was going to relapse because I didn't pray every day "hit my knees" didn't do a nightly written inventory and didn't call her every day. ..I kinda told her to STFU that I had 2 years and felt pretty good about my sobriety so what I was doing before was obviously working...She took the opertunity to tell me if I did things her way I wouldn't have an eating disorder...&amp;nbsp;..**Question 2**..Not much of a ritual but every day for an hour I just walk. Sometimes i think about the program but usually i just turn off my brain and just walk. ..It doesn't matter how hot it is or if it's pouring rain...&amp;nbsp;..**Question 3**..Why the fuck would I do this if I didn't *recover* ?   why would anyone?..&amp;nbsp;..**Next question**..I feel like my "alcoholic thinking" has g gotten way better the more I incorporate the program in my life. I consider that I vital part of recovery...The end goal is to be in fit spiritual condition to be of maximum serive. (Imo) ..That is what I consider recovery...I can't be of service to anyone if I'm using...&amp;nbsp;..**Question about sponsorship**..Pros: got me sober keeps me sober..Cons: some sponsors are crazy and some people are pushy and forget they are your sponsor not your baby sitter or your therapist.

The bad things about sponsors is their not required to have any official training or adhere to a specific doctrine...The good thing is they're free.  ...It's a relationship you can enter into or leave at anytime.  Like a lot of the program you have to decide if you're doing it for the right reasons.  I would say a good rule of thumb is you should have another ready before you part with the first one.  You can even couch the change in language like "You've helped me a lot.  Now I want to see if I can learn about "this" from "this person."  I recently had to switch from my first sponsor to my second.  This was what I did and everything seemed to work fine.  ...Yes I have a ritual.  It's pretty funny because an outsider would probably call me an atheist  I don't adhere to any religion and my concept of a God is pretty loose ( basically synonymous with the universe ).  Regardless I pray every morning and every night.  I read my little daily meditation book.  ...I think it's highly likely that no one hears my prayers!!  ..So what?  I'm not really doing it because I think it's how you communicate with some supernatural celestial being.  I'm doing it to put my mind in the right place to center my intentions.  I usually say the same things like "Thank you for keeping me sober yesterday.  Please keep me sober today."  I mixed and matched phrases until I came up with something that felt right.  The ritual alone seems to help me.  If someone's actually keeping track then I see it as a bonus.  ...Sorry this got long but you're last question really get's to me!  ...I hate the "you're sick forever" thing!  I don't thing it's a good way to go about life with an image of yourself as a "diseased person" incapable of ever being cured.  ...I do get the point.  People who harp on this point are warning others about relapse.  I do think that I will never be able to drink in moderation.  I don't think that I became like that because I was always like that.  I never drank in a controlled way.  I think for the rest of my life me and alcohol will not mix.  ...I think of it like having a peanut allergy.  I don't spend my life obsessed with the fact I can never eat peanuts again ( he's a peanutholic!! )  I also don't plan on imbibing any of the substance that will trigger my allergy and kill me...Relapses are not required!!  An old timer in my meetings like 50+ years sober always says that.  He calls himself one of the "white chip wonders."   I don't have any problem following that model.  I know that I do that one day at a time.  ...Thanks for your questions.  Writing this has really helped me today!  Congratulations on your 266 days!!!  You Rock!!!
Wow thank you for this set of questions! I just went to my first meeting yesterday and have been wondering the exact same things even down to wondering what a 'ritual' would be. Responses are really helpful so far.
I've been following your posts.  Your sponsor was showing you the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. which includes reading the book and working the steps.  We've answered questions about a power greater than ourselves prayer and sponsorship before.  ..r/stopdrinking isn't AA. If you want to ask questions outside of your local fellowship consider posting at r/alcoholicanonymous.  If you want to do the program of AA then work the steps as laid out in the book.  If you want to work your own program or a different program then go ahead..
