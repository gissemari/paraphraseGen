Still in AA starting to live my new life also. Going to 5-6 meetings a week. I have a daily morning daily reflections meeting. Instead of forcasting my relapse date as i have done in the past... I am looking forward to daily reflections on 1.1.15 to start back on step\tradition 1. Iam in the market for a sponsor qnd my take on a temp to help me d3cide on a full time one.

This is solid progress /u/goinginsanes and a good plan too.
Great job! Sounds like you have a good plan in place. Best of luck with the sponsor search!
Great plan. I  recently got a sponsor and it has just added to my relief from this disease. Keep up the good work.
