* There are two types of seeds in the mind: those that create anger fear frustration jealousy hatred and those that create love compassion equanimity and joy." \~* Amit Ray..I am struggling tonight with feeling angry toward someone even though my anger really is unjustified and I know it.  Learning to feel my feels and then transform my (negative) feelings is one of my biggest challenges but so much better with sobriety.

You and me both!  .So I found [the emotional guidance scale](https://goo.gl/images/deZPWb) online today.  To see what was going on energetically- emotionally and realized how far down my bad energy went towards this person.  Wow.  I was watching uplifting info on how to deal with this issue all day slept almost all Saturday.. and getting revved up with positive new thoughts for when I go back into the fray tomorrow.  And the fact is I feel pretty good today.  The other day Friday at work I was fairly drowning in my angst.  ..On a positive note like MeMyMoMonkeys post in the check-in today we can raise up our emotional vibration when we're down the scale with good stuff.  I'm pretty far down there so I needed lots of good stuff to bump back up higher- at which point I likely won't feel bothered by the persons actions any more.  Like at this moment.  I feel no ill will or anger.  Tomorrow I will keep aware to keep my vibration up and protect it now that I see how it goes up or down through phases.  .The scale gives me a map to find where I want to be.  Cool hey?!  I've got my fingers crossed and my tool belt on!..Lots of love possibilitarian!!!  .IWNDWYT ..
Great quote - thank you
Anger is a real tough one for me.  If something seems unfair or I perceive someone as not seeing things correctly I can get all worked up.  I get mad up about having to clean up after other people or else live in clutter and filth.  I lashed out a bit tonight about it and was fuming for about 1/2 hour after until I could realize it wasn't constructive and change focus at least. I am better at communicating my feelings about it but I am dumbfounded when communicating them isn't enough to enact change. HAHA.  I'm trying to get over this. I am great at planting good seeds until I get upset and then it's all weeds.  Much work to do there I'm afraid.
Anger is like alcohol in the false promise that we will get out of ourselves and feel better for it. As if there is some winning by it. "Get it out! You'll feel better!" they say. But is just has a tougher side to me when the anger subsides. Not worth it.
