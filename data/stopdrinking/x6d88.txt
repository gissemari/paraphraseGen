... And I'm feeling great. I honestly just shook the depression of my last relapse off yesterday. It's just so crazy how unhappy drinking makes me and yet here I am at only seven days. Well I'm here to stay one way or another I just hope my willpower holds out! Here's to hoping this one-week turns quickly into two!

One week is frekin awesome!! I can't wait until I can (very hopefully) say that. ..That said you could now turn 1 into 2 into 4 8 16 32 64... 
I know what you are saying you don't know how bad you feel until you feel good. I notice finally shaking the depression at around a week myself. Seven days of feeling like crap for one night of drinking not a very good trade.
