I've never considered myself an alcoholic. I don't stress out about alcohol when I can't get it and I can go days between drinks without much of a problem...But what I do have is a **very unhealthy relationship** with alcohol. When I drink I drink to get drunk. After the first beer impulse control goes out the window. I drink primarily by myself and don't stop until I'm in a mild stupor. I'll sometimes wake up the next day hung over and pour my remaining booze down the drain only to buy another six-pack the next day...Over the years I have seen my irresponsible dependence on alcohol for self-medicating stress and for alleviating boredom to worsen and have realized that it's time to cut the cord...Could I learn to have discipline to drink moderately? *Maybe*. Would the struggle be worthwhile? Not in my mind. The constant mental effort of attempting to control my habit is just no longer worth the "reward" of an occasional slight buzz. I don't want to stress over whether I should have a drink today and how many. I'd rather eliminate those intrusive considerations entirely and instead simply think "**I won't drink today**."..You don't have to be an alcoholic to quit drinking!.

that's amazingly evolved for someone who isn't an alcoholic. great thinking-wish more people saw it that way..and hey why should someone wait until it *does* become a problem? might as well cut it out when the going's good and you're not truly addicted
I was a lot like you and quit for the exact same reasons unfortunately for me I am an alcoholic.
One of my friends who just hit two years sober said something when he first started attending AA that I will never forget: "I saw the future of my life with alcohol and drugs versus being sober and the decision was pretty much a no-brainer."..And you know what? He's absolutely right. His life has improved tremendously. He's inspired me to take this thing seriously. He's a lot younger than I am and you strike me as someone who is relatively young and just wants to have good priorities in life.
You totally summed up my relationship with alcohol.  If you're anything like me no one even probably knows or thinks it's a problem.  Good on you and good luck! 
That's largely where I am as well.  I binge. I have zero problem NOT drinking. But as soon as I start I'm looking to get drunk and the only reason I don't every time is because the part of me that doesn't want another embarrassing night wins out. Barely.   ..It takes all my effort and concentration while drinking to fight to a *draw *. It's just not worth the effort. 
Truth.  Better to stop now than pickle yourself.  I was you about 5 years ago.  Then it slowly turned into dependence.  I'm glad you recognize and  acknowledge the signs.  Many (most?) don't and if they do they won't admit it.  
My counselor explained to me something that should have been obvious to me and is pretty obvious to you it seems. When we have to work really hard to do something or start putting all of these rules and guides in place for that activity then it is likely a problem. Great post!

This is why I have stopped - I couldn't regulate my drinking so it's easier to be sober

This resonates with me big time! Thanks for sharing!
This post and yall's comments make me so happy! I've been sober and attending AA for 4 months today. My "bottom" wasn't this uncontrollable chaos of losing everything but realizing one night after a binge that I would gain nothing by going down the path I was going. I could go days without drinks but once I started there was no stopping until I was passed out. This sub has been so amazing in my recovery m but this post is my truth. 
This is me! Now almost two years sober and going strong. Good luck!
Are you my twin? It us really true what you said about the mental effort of moderate drinking. Constantly trying to figure out how much you should be drinking and not allowing yourself to get to the drunken stupor state that you enjoy. It's just not worth it. Having a clear mind that doesn't have to think about alcohol is a reward in itself. Less internal struggle and more freedom. 
Exactly what I keep telling everyone. The fact that I never "hit rock bottom" or drank every day does not diminish the fact that I "need" to drink :)
Thank you for posting this! I really needed to read this as I'm exactly the same. I'm a binger and the binges have been taking their toll for too long on my life and mental health. I don't want to drink again. For now for today I will not drink with you! ..Sending all my good energies to everyone on this forum for a healthy sober productive day. You people are the best. 
I'm not sure that 'alcoholic' is a helpful label to anyone.. I've sat in AA and said the fateful words many times... And at the time I believed myself to be 'alcoholic'.. Nowadays my life looks different too... Much like your narrative I don't crap myself or wake up in strange places anymore but alcohol does control my thinking.. I too can go days and days and not be bothered by not having a beer but when I do.. I never have one.. Personally I just know alcohol is a highly addictive drug and for many people like us all on SD it's power has got to us to a point we know the only way to find relief is to cut that motherfu@ er out!! I believe we are all capable of being 'alcoholic'.. It just depends what you understand by that word. I won't drink with you today - isn't it a relief not to have to make your mind up about that later?! It sure is me!
Kind of like me except when I start I struggle to stop the next day or the day after. Usually it's when my body really tells me off I need 24 hours or so off but then I feel fine and crave more. ..It's definitely important to learn to moderate our intake but I'd say it would take at least a year of abstaining before my body and mind forget the addiction and stop associating it with comfort and pleasure which is generally why we can't stop at one. 
Hey that's like me! Someone here introduced me to the idea of "problem drinker* which is what I refer to myself as now. I can go days without a drink no problem but long duration like weeks? Much harder to do. And then when I do drink I get wicked drunk and incredible hang overs. Over the long span of time I've realized how that kind of *problem drinking* has affected my life in ways that I want to change. 
Agreed! I know plenty of people who quit drinking just because they find it easier to maintain their weight without alcohol or they don't like how it makes them drowsy.  :) 
I had a conversation a couple of years ago with a business associate who defines herself as an recovering alcoholic. She had got to the stage of drinking all the time before she stopped. ..We were talking about her addiction and drink in general for a while. I told her about my drinking patterns and that I was going to have a month off. She ended the conversation by saying to me "Bad you're not an alcoholic". ..I think what she meant is that I wasn't physically dependent in the way she had been. However by that stage I knew the constant mental gymnastics over my consumption levels once I did start weren't healthy...What I've learned here a couple of years later is that it's moderation I struggle with because the thoughts undo any of the perceived relaxation benefits a couple of drinks is supposed to bring...I won't drink today either as I feel much calmer now I've left it alone for a while.
I am glad to see you here posting this right now. I see a lot of myself in this post maybe some six months or 12 months ago or so. For me for the longest time it was "only" problem drinking even though at that time I didn't consider it even that just you know drinking a bit on the heavy side. Then slowly it started to spiral more and more out of control. I didn't realize that this was happening. Then I went on a 7-day bender had my first withdrawals as opposed to hangovers and had to seek medical help for handling the detox. Never thought I'd be there...That finally made me realize that yes I have a drinking problem and if I don't do anything about it there's only one way this will end: eventually I will drink everything I have. It's always progressive nobody starts at the rock bottom. Being an "alcoholic" is a difficult line to draw and in a way for myself I do like to think that it is a blurry boundary if only to make it easier for me right now but if you have *it* and don't do anything about *it* then sooner or later *it* is going to become alcoholism by any standards. So yeah definitely no need to be an alcoholic to quit drinking. The earlier you catch yourself having a problem and the earlier you start to do something to that problem the less damage you have to fix...I won't be drinking with you today.
Same here I never had a chemical dependence on alcohol I often went days or a week or two without it but I couldn't drink responsibly and that's why I needed to quit.
Great post so true.
I can relate to what you said a lot. I wasn't the type of person who drank everyday and ended up lieing in the gutter but whenever I do drink I cannot control my intake in the slightest. I usually end up out for more than 24 hours making poor decisions such as doing drugs and smoking on top of my alcohol binge which makes it even more dangerous. I consider myself an intelligent person with a drive to better my life but for what ever reason I find it almost impossible to "know my limits" or control my intake....so it's either keep it up or stop it altogether. 
absolutely relate to this.. I am afraid this is how spiraling down starts so why not kill it in the bud eh.. good luck ! 
Good on you OP. I'm the same way. Better to eliminate the relationship rather than spend time trying to navigate a very complicated and destructive relationship to alcohol.
Well said. Felt like I could have written that myself. Labels can get in the way of our thinking and can become an excuse..."I'm not an alcoholic because I've never missed work because of drinking" etc. "So I don't need to quit." .. My relationship with alcohol was getting very troublesome indeed so I decided to break up. We're not seeing each other anymore although sometimes he's at parties and it gets awkward but I've managed to avoid him so far. The longer we're apart the easier it gets.
I can relate. My problem was hardly ever extreme and nobody would know. But after 2 weeks of being sober I would get drunk 3-4 nights week for 2 weeks and I would be insanely depressed and lonely. Id stop and feel better for a while but then id just say well why not just drink some beer or wine?then I get nothing done and my life just resets to being an anxious lonely loser. Alcohol gives me nothing but 3-4 hours of relief from life and I induldge in setimental memories of the old days. Then it's a week of misery. Fuck that. 
I'm in no way an alcoholic but I have stopped drinking as well..
This is what I do. Increasingly if it's in a social situation I almost always black out...I'm sick of having my subconscious on display and feeling like I deserve to die.
In the same boat--I can easily go all week and just drink one night on the weekend but when I drink I drink to get wasted/drunk. My entire family does the same exact thing and I don't want to get stuck in the same rut I see them in. 
I've said it before and I'll say it again the idea of alcoholism and whether or not someone is an alcoholic is a massive red herring.  If alcohol makes your life worse on a regular basis you can and should quit drinking it's that simple.
*A rose by any other name...* ..While what you say is true I think we do ourselves a disservice if we avoid a label because it has a stigma attached...I comment a link to the following post quite a bit because it is powerful writing and it changed my life when I found it. It definitely belongs here in this thread:.[For those struggling with the label alcoholic...](.https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/)
THIS WAS TOTALLY ME!
This was me with booze and cigarettes!
Wow you just described me. I would always say that because I can refrain from alcohol and it doesn't bother me much that I don't have a problem but I do. One or two beers and I'm fine. Three or four? Now there's no stopping. I'm coming to the realization that I need to stop. However I am struggling with some denial and finding it hard to imagine life and social situations without drinking. 
"Over the years I have seen my irresponsible dependence on alcohol for self-medicating stress and for alleviating boredom to worsen and have realized that it's time to cut the cord."..That would sum me up. People have asked how I quit and when I say I just stopped they look at me like I'm some sort of crazy person. I'm glad I stopped because I've discovered that I enjoy my life more without booze. It only took like 30 years to figure out but I'm a slow learner...plus I was drunk o few nights out of the week.  .Good work OP and good luck.
I can relate exactly to what you're saying. I'll copy something that I've posted before because it helped me to recognize my habits and fix them and maybe it can help others. .... I can offer some more personal experience. For me one of the most important realizations that I had which helped me was to realize that I can't be one of those "1 or 2 drinks" people. I spent SO much time thinking that the "healthiest" option was to be the type of person who would have a drink or two and then stop (and I definitely still think that is a healthy way to live for some people). Yet over and over again I would start off with those intentions only to find myself drinking 10+ drinks. ..I tried to really analyze my habits and thought patterns. What was leading to this behavior? What I noticed was that repeatedly I would go through the following thought/behavioral pattern: ..1.I've been "good" (working out eating well etc) for a few days. I deserve to have a drink just to relax and kind of celebrate my good habits. After all it's healthy behavior to have just a drink or two. If I have just a drink and then stop then I can prove to myself that my drinking behavior is healthy. ..2.During the 1st drink I am thinking about the 2nd drink. Sure I can have just one more. Only one more. ..3.During the 2nd drink I am thinking about the 3rd drink. Sure I can have just one more. Only one more. ..4.During the 3rd drink I am thinking about the 10th drink and what food I will eat when I get there. How many beers do I have left in the fridge? Only 7? Better go get more before I get too drunk to drive. Fuck it I guess this is going to be one of "those nights". Oh well might as well do it big and I'll get back to being good tomorrow. ..I cannot tell you how many times this exact pattern repeated itself for me. But for some reason it took a long time for me to finally recognize the pattern. I realized that I actually didn't enjoy having "1 or 2 drinks" because if I actually did stop after 1 or 2 drinks I felt on edge because I was trying REALLY hard not to have more. This made the experience unenjoyable. So I realized that there was no amount of alcohol that I actually enjoyed in a healthy way. It was either "a couple drinks and feel uncomfortable and on edge" or "10+ drinks and I sincerely regret it". ..So that was the key for me. Personally I find drinking zero drinks to be very easy to do. Drinking 1-2 drinks is VERY hard and unenjoyable and drinking more than that has all of the many problems that I listed. When I started to look at it that way it became extremely obvious that I needed to just cut it out all together. ..Hope this helps. If you're serious about quitting you should probably also talk to someone close to you about it. Actually vocalizing your thoughts to a real-life person is a lot better than just thinking those thoughts to yourself over and over.
Words of wisdome right there bud. 
I'm not an alcoholic but I drink because of severe joint pain (it beats oxycontin) and massive anxiety stemming from an endless court case (some people have the free time and money to simply try to destroy your life when you've moved beyond them.) If I go a few days without I have no withdrawal symptoms but the sleep deprivation builds up and my work performance suffers. If the court bullshit ever ends I can probably just get by with motrin but the dread and hopelessness that I live with because of it WILL keep me up all night every night.
Yes! I got a lot of "but you're not a drunk!" or "what was your rock bottom?" the first time I quit. I consider myself in the problem drinking category and am definitely prone to binging and wanted to rid myself of having to think and stress about drinking but I do think there's a big difference between that and hiding bottles/morning drinking etc. Many people assume that the only reason to avoid booze is if you have a crippling addiction. Why is it that if someone quits some other unhealthy drug or cigarettes nobody questions it or asks why they don't just do it on the weekends? It shows how entrenched alcohol is in our society. 
Bravo! Love this characterisation and the action you have taken. Now for all of us to 'make it stick'... one day at a time is the key. I believe I can get to the point where I don't drink today without having to tell myself **"I won't drink today"**. That is a bit too much to expect at 17 days (my physical self is still getting used to an alcohol-free existence) but I did quit for 6 months a few years back and I am sure many of the days in that 6 months alcohol did not even enter my mind. Can't really remember why I started again... one of my dumber decisions..
Well said.  I have always liked the saying that I read here that says "It is easier to keep a lion in a cage than a lion on a leash".   Moderating just takes too damn much energy. Simply saying no to drinking is much easier. Have a great day.  
I won't drink today with you - it doesn't matter about labels - the point is alcohol has been negatively impacting on my decision-making for years.  Time to stop!
This is real wisdom right here! Thank you for sharing I love seeing posts like this! Keep it up.
Perfectly said! I feel the same way. Learning to drink in moderation seems more difficult than quitting and a waste of effort time money.
