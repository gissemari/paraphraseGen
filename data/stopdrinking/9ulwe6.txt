Never posted before but offered advice as a novice to people on here.  I'm on day 36 today.  ..I was definitely not physically addicted but had an unhealthy-interest in alcohol.   Work stops me from drinking every day but on my days off I started drinking at 4pm and usually had around 6-7 large  beers medium strength.  Waking up loathing myself full of guilt.  If for any reason I couldn't have a drink I was the proverbial bear with the sore head.  I am fortunate I can have up to 20 days off a month so end up drinking much more than someone on a 9-5 work pattern.  I only don't drink when I do 24 hr shifts...I am really enjoying the benefits of not drinking but missing it and feeling sort of empty.  This has come and gone over the past 5 weeks...Apart from you good people I've nobody to talk to and feel I really need to be amongst people on the same journey for support and to share stories.  My colleagues know I'm not drinking but don't know how bad my drinking was...I met a chap from AA a great bloke who gave me some advice and said come to a meeting.  The thing is I am not religious never could be and it seems as though  without God in my life AA is not an option.  I would like to go just to share my thoughts with fellow strugglers but I've heard AA is like a cult with an hierarchy of long term abstainers.  I couldn't belong to any group that doesn't treat all as equal.  ..This gent I met is such a great bloke I want to share the fact I have  stopped but worried he'll push AA.  What's your thoughts please good people?

Take what works and leave the rest... I'm a hardcore atheist but have no problem with the idea of going to AA and not listening to the god stuff. I've gone before and didn't feel it was a cult although there will always be some people who preach...be it veganism or crossfit. I have my gripes with lack of scientific methodology AA is built on but the research on peer support and community seems clear. I think you should consider going maybe having support can only help and AA is an accesible easy way to find a community of people who struggle with exactly the same things.  
My experience is that AA is for people who absolutely hit rock bottom. There was nothing else...And God picked them up. They had to go outside of themselves to find help - and God was there...It's a deeply personal and deeply stories experience that only they understand...Unless you've been there - that is - called out for God at that moment in your life you will not understand it...What I respect is that this 'God' is God for them. No definite religion no sort of categories God is God...But because the experience is so powerful - powerful enough to change their lives forever - God becomes real for them...If you do not know God or cannot go to God for help it can be difficult sorting in AA...Trying AA means being in such a deep place that you are willing to give God a chance.
Thank you for your advice really appreciated.   
Its a god as we understand him. I also have 30 plus days. I choose to have a higher power. I hear what i need to hear in a meeting and leave the rest. Just keep coming and dont pick up that first drink or drug. If u dont then a chemical reaction can not take place and u will not be powerless over it. 
Hey thanks!  Appreciate your comments!  
AA is marginally of the disease model but is decidedly on a sin model. They don't say sin but character defects and self centeredness instead...This works for some people but not for others...Individual meetings and members can be very controlling and have a pretty enforced 'group think' going on. If you express a dissenting opinion you might be told you are killing people or that your best thinking got you here or that you have self will run riot going on...However some meetings and members tend to be pretty tolerant and understand that individual variations in recovery programs are acceptable and even positive...Also meetings vary a lot on how religious they are both in tone and format. Also you'll find groups that are pretty egalitarian without treating years sober as making anyone an authority. There are some they that do treat years sober like it gives rank and authority.
Hey Banjo I too work 24 hour shifts. I've got a pretty good idea what you do...I've got a very close buddy in the same line of work that is quick to let me know he is six and a half years sober. He loves AA. He's been going the whole time and still makes weekly meetings. ..I caught all kinds of hell when I told him I fell off the wagon again last Friday.  I've never been to a meeting and in his loving gonna put a foot where I don't want it kinda way is quick to remind me.   ..Needless to say I'm seriously considering it. ..I don't know if anything I said helps in anyway I just saw your schedule and felt compelled to speak up. ..Good luck buddy. I will not drink with you today. 
Hey buddy thanks for your help and advice.  Great to know there's people prepared to take time to reply and offer opinions and help.  I think I will go to AA and give it a go.  Just feel I need a chance to talk one to one with people in the same boat!  Keep strong friend!!    
Not an AA-goer myself this place is my support group and it works for me... If AA isn't your cup of tea try SMART/Refuge Recovery/LifeRing or one of the alternatives... ..It's perfectly possible to recover without even a hint of religion and it's also the case that the 'Higher Power' of AA *isn't* a judeo-christian Angry Sky Fairy (unless you want it to be) so don't base your judgement on a popular misconception.....You might like to give [Recovery by Russell Brand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhG_h8gUcjU) a read/listen it's a really interesting take on his 12-step journey.....I also found the book 'Alcohol Explained' and the book/YouTube 'This Naked Mind' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself..Best of luck with whatever you decide to do!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Hey thanks Woody.  Really appreciate your comments and I will look into all the alternative you suggest!  So glad I have people like you on here who take time out to respond!  Thank you!  
I'm an atheist and AA saved my life. I've now learn from and let go of resentments and fears accept I am always growing focus my attention and actions on my responsibilities and be of service to my family and community...There is no hierarchy.  AA's  bylaws  are the 12 traditions.  There are no leaders only trusted servants.  Anyone can be of service in AA at anytime.  Welcoming people to a meeting making coffee putting away chairs.  That's a bulk of the work right there...Aa.org is the official website.  Happy to answer any questions.
Well thank you so much for your reply.  It's great to know people are kind enough to send responses like this.  Really appreciated.  Thank you!  
Loads of replies that I truly appreciate.  Kind people lots of useful information.  I am going to contact the gent I was talking to and I am going to go to a meeting following all the comments.  Definitely worth a try.  It's a real help to be part of this community!  Thank you! 
AA is not religious and it is not a cult. There are AA meetings for atheists and agnostics. No one forces you to do anything in AA. Look for a discussion group...AA is based on attraction. People come because it is helpful. No one is interested in pushing AA. You met one person and you are passing judgment on an entore fellowship that is all over the world. 
Not passing judgment on anyone.  Just asking questions.  I have heard good and bad stories about AA and thought I would ask this community for opinions.  Luckily I have had a broad level of responses all respectful and suggesting I should try it if it works.  Thank you for your reply.
 ..## The process takes up to 30 days. Do it honestly and with abandonment. Or don't. It's a choice to participate in the process...**First and foremost** the AA literature suggests you diagnose yourself by experimenting with controlled drinking. Try it more than once. Then try to stop for a considerable period of time...The alcoholic dilemma is not one of **quitting drinking** (We will learn that Alcohol has very little to do with the actual disease we call Alcoholism). **The problem for any Real Alcoholic is staying stopped**!..The **12 steps mirror a 6000 year old process** to inner peace serenity and purpose. AA has no monopoly on the process. It just so happens that this process works to help alcoholics remain sober and grow spiritually. That is all. Nothing more...The 12 Steps simply help one awaken from a slumber and see the world rightly. Through these new lenses our old responses to life cease to serve a purpose and we realize were were wrong about most everything (I realized I was). We learn that fear in its many forms ruled our lives and since alcohol melts fear it was a convenient solution to the fear problem...The **12 Promises on page 83-84 are consequences** of an unveiling of our true selves an awakening to our true spirit and with that new lenses through which we now view the world and mankind. That is all...nothing more...The outcome of the 12 steps is serenity a calm mind warm heart and a level of "awakeness" that was unattainable while drinking. The "need" to drink dissolves...If the following outcomes appeal to you then walk through the 12 steps with someone who has experienced these promises and *recovered from* and *awakened from* their previous state of being. The process takes up to 30 days and the practices of meditation and prayer last a lifetime. Simple. :-)..(The questions after each promise are to be used as a gut check on my current state of being.)..**Promise 1** *We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. (Do I?)*..**Promise 2** *We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. (Do I?)*..**Promise 3** *We will comprehend the word serenity. (Do I?)*..**Promise 4** *We will know peace. (Do I?)*..**Promise 5** *No matter how far down the scale we have gone we will see how our experience can benefit others. (Do I?)*..**Promise 6** *That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. (Has it?)*..**Promise 7** *We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. (Have I?)*..**Promise 8** *Self-seeking will slip away. (Has it?)*..**Promise 9** *Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. (Has it?)*..**Promise 10** *Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. (Has it?)*..**Promise 11** *We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us. (Do I?)*..**Promise 12** *We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves. (Do I?)*..Source: [https://12step.org/references/commonly-used/the-promises/](https://12step.org/references/commonly-used/the-promises/)
