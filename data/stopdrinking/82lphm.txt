It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I may be developing a hearing problem. As just one part of my delightful assortment of medical issues I was born with a chromosomal disorder. My doctor says that people with this disorder often develop hearing problems later in life...**Triumph:** Recently I was stuck at a dinner party with an awful blowhard friend of the family an opinionated old fart who has said offensive things to me in the past. (Years ago he said that the reason I was hit by a drunk driver when I was on my motorcycle was that all female motorcyclists eventually get into accidents.)..On this recent occasion I was trapped next to him and he started to say something and I couldn't really hear him. I was about to ask him to repeat himself and then I thought wait a minute. What am I doing? So I just sat there and smiled while he blabbed on and on about God knows what. I could see that his mouth was moving but I couldn't hear a word of it. What a relief...**General:**  There's no sense in doing a lot of barking if you don't really have anything to say.    Snoopy.

Not quite Wednesday here for me but....**Struggle:** Trying to figure out how I can ask my boss for Fridays off. I feel like some days I have very little to do and draw out things so I don't look like I am wasting time when that is precisely what I am doing...**Triumph:** My rock climbing. This probably will mean very little to most people on this subreddit but I've started to consistently climb 5.11a and 5.11b. My goal last year when I started was to be able to climb a 5.10d passed that goal and it hasn't been a full year yet. I'm really happy to achieve a physical goal that I've set for myself.
lol I love yours this week u/sfgirlmary
**Struggle:** I ve returned to my old job two days a week after a long sick leave and during the three first weeks I got three notifications questioning my capability to do that job. I ve spoken to the boss and explained the (to me) nonsensical matters and he knows me very well so everything is fine but during the process I realized that the one doing the reporting is the one who has been filling in for me. If I return he s out. Fucker. But I understand his position despite his jerk-like tendencies. He and I will work together for eight hours tonight. Time to muster all the saintlike patience there is...**Triumph:** On Monday I finished editing a magazine which then went to print. The feeling seeing it all come together in the end was amazing - I was asked to do it and to redefine and redesign everything so I did and so far *everyone* has been stoked about it. Unreal!..**General:** There are deer tracks in the snow crossing my kids tracks. Seeing things like that makes me happy.
Just playing some video games drinking some crisp refreshing water.
I will not drink with you today!
Struggle: One of my family members decided they didn't want to live anymore. They're thankfully still with us but it has opened a lot of old wounds which is always interesting...Triumph: Day number one of not drinking. I'm going to take every day as a win and for once I'm feeling really positive about quitting for good. Today is also the first time I've ever admitted to anyone that I have a problem and it feels freeing 
**Triumph:** Having an article published in a trade magazine...**Struggle:** The boiler packing in during the current cold-snap leaving us with no heating or hot water.....**General:** If anybody is looking for an old copy of Osteopath Weekly I have back issues...
!struggle!: 
Struggle: Finally got the nerve to change job. I'm looking for something new but finding it is a tonne of work...Triumph: Managed to eat healthy all week so far..General: Life is okay. Only 3 weeks until I get a break from the usual chaos!
**Struggle:** I've got subliminal depression kicking in...sort of like seasonal but it has been really nice lately. I'm not quite sure what is going on I just know that I'm not enjoying a lot of things lately and it's dragging me down not having a hobby. Seems like everything I'm interested in costs a fair amount of money and I just want to do it because I'm spending money on things...if that makes sense...**Triumph:** I've really been on a roll at work lately. Seems like I continue to move up in my leadership's eyes and I'm getting nominated for awards a lot. That's a huge thing for me coming from a bit of a blue collar background and now working in a professional industry as a data analyst. Just yesterday I built a new dashboard that should keep folks informed and it is something I love doing as a career...**General:**  You know you're an alcoholic when you misplace things   like a decade.     Paul Williams
I love the story about not being able to hear the obnoxious family member. Way to find the positive. ..Struggle: I am putting an employee on a performance plan for the first time. I really like them as a person they just aren't doing well at the job (for over the past year and a half). I know it's necessary but I am not looking forward to it. ..Triumph: I have exercised a couple of times this week and eaten better. Something I wasn't doing very much of when I was drinking all the time. 
Not today Satan. Day 3!
Now that's what I call a silver lining!..My struggle is pretty much the complete opposite of yours:..Apparently I have uncommonly good/sensitive hearing and it's more like a curse than a superpower - noisy neighbours seem twice as loud to me shouty family members are often physically painful to be around etc. ..I would honestly trade it in for a bit of peace and quiet since it doesn't seem to be useful in any way!..As for a triumph I'd have to say it's just that I can generally feel my outlook and attitude improving for the better. Staying sober gives me purpose as well as self-esteem. I'm not letting negative people get to me as much as I did before..
I feel for you with the hearing [I am very deaf on one side] - but seeing that blessing is a FIST PUMP yay you! moment  :) .Struggle: after the passing of my friend's Mom that I used to cook for the other week last Friday I got news another dear friend lost her mother that day. This morning one of my dearest oldest and closest friends lost a brother - he was the older brother we all had a bit of a crush on in highschool only around 51 lost a battle with cancer. That's three deaths in three weeks. And I have another funeral to go to on Monday. Brings up a lot of unresolved grief from losses in my own immediate family over the years. Tempting to numb out a bit..Triumph: have not numbed out - I am being present for every moment good or bad or simply existed through in my life..General: discovered some powerful magic words to beat the craving tonight when I was doing the supermarket shopping at a place where there is a bottleshop right next door that was always part of my Wednesday "I have driven for an hour to get Kiddo somewhere and I will drive for an hour to get us back home I deserve a couple of bottles of nice wine as a reward" - the magic words are: Gorgonzola Havarti Raclette Fresh Chevre with Dill Castello Blue and Enchilada. Yup. I am all prepared to eat ALL THE CHEESE for days [and enchiladas for my late supper] :).
Struggle:  A beautiful little girl passed away after a lengthy battle with Cancer.  This has made me SO depressed and just overall down thinking of what her friends and family are going through.  .Triumph:  My daughters cancer is in full remission and is doing amazing.  My other daughter is a happy little sprite.  My parents and husband are so supportive and happy.  .IWNDWYT
Struggle: I need a hobby to occupy my mind in the evening and none of my go to's are interesting me right now. Instead I've been constantly looking up healthy recipes while watching shows on the food channel with delicious looking things I'll never eat. I can see an unhealthy parallel in this to when I first quit drinking and I simultaneously obsessed about drinking and not drinking. It's good to make healthy changes but the mental obsession tends to only make things harder on me. ..Triumph: I don't generally take care of any of the finances or bill paying in our household. I contribute to it with my paycheck but I have a bad track record of paying things on time. The other day I got an email notice that one of the cars registration was coming up and my first thought was 'well it's just a first notice I have plenty of time to take care of this'. Then I was going to forward it to my husband to take care of. Then I said F that I can take care of this right now and it will be done with. And I did. I don't know why I've always put things off like this in the past it's like a weird mental thing I think but I certainly am capable of being responsible...General: It's been so bright out on my drive in I can actually see! I'm enjoying it while I can before daylight savings makes me drive in the dark again for a while :) 
Struggle: My tolerance for bull shit is super short since I stopped drinking. I'm getting into dumb arguments with my room mate. My fuse is super short at the moment. .Triumph: I'm moving through the training program at my job with an error rate that is comparable to employees who have been here for years.   .General: I'm feeling (physically) fantastic. 
**Struggle** It's still hard to save money I like to buy things..**Triumph** I feel pretty in control of my life .**General** Celebrating 2 months today! :) And I like what snoopy said.
**Triumph:** Lately I've been feeling really sexy. I'm not at my goal weight yet but I feel much more attractive than I have in recent memory. It's nice you know?..**Struggle:** I need to go on a date soon. I'm lonely...**General:** In the next few weeks I'm adopting a cat! Beyond picking up some toys scratching post and other amenities I need to decide if I want to rename her. She's only a year old so I think it's possible but I'm not sure if it's the right thing for the cat. 
**Triumph:**    I'm in the process of orientation for the new job...**Struggle:**    As extraordinarily fascinating as this stuff is damn...it's complex as hell. I'm starting to recite case studies in my sleep...**General:**    Nor'easter's: STOP ALREADY. We've had enough!..Shout out to our u/sfgirlmary for hosting WUW every week and for all that she does for us and our family here :). Thanks Mary!
Struggle:  Still dealing with my daughter's new phase of acting like a spoiled teenager at age ten. Even the toddler years were easy with her - this is the first time ever that I've felt overwhelmed and like I might be doing things all wrong. Worse I've had a bad habit throughout my life (mostly when I was younger) of letting people talk to me in an abusive way and walk all over me. (I often would not even realize it until someone else pointed it out.) I really don't want my daughter to be one of those people. ...Triumph: I'm not going to let her. ..Also vacation is almost here and I think I need it. Lol
**Triumph:** I harvested much black bamboo and soaked it in my bathtub for eight hours (sorry roommate) and then shaped it into a hive-like trellis for climbing vines or possibly a tomatillo. It took me fucking forever and was pure joy. I think it came out really well!!..**Struggle:** I need discipline and I don't want to be disciplined. I think I want to find some such thing as natural discipline like I'm afraid to "do discipline wrong." I have no idea what I'm even saying.  ..**General:** My cat doesn't like my new neighbor's cat and it's kind of making things difficult and the drama made me think that if you opened a cat hotel you could call it Meowrose Place. 
**T:**  Found a free music program that I can make music with.  I've been messing around with that a lot and it's distracting me from my studies...**S:**  Studies are grinding me down.  I'm just not feeling it at all.  I've got an exam tomorrow and haven't done any of the readings so yeah...  ..**G:**  My Dad said I need to learn to relax.  Honestly I really don't know how to do that w/out drugs or alcohol.
Struggle:  FOCUS.  Even thought I am much more clearheaded while sober I'm finding that I have a hard time focusing.  It's weird because my brain is much more active but I still feel unmotivated and scattered.  I'm really going to bear down today and try to stay on task...Triumph:  Two weeks!  This is huge!  I feel pretty good am losing weight and have my very first only-for-me vacation (and first trip overseas) coming up in about a month.  Instead of feeling down about what I'm not accomplishing maybe I should think about what I have - paid off all of my cc debt in the past few years and saved enough for this vacation.  Yay me. ..General:  "You don't get over an addiction by stopping using.  You recover by creating a new life where it is easier not to use.  If you don't create a new life then all the factors that brought you to your addiction will catch up again." 
Struggle: Having a hard time keeping my apartment tidy. I've definitely let it go to the point where it's going to be a big project to clean up and get back to looking nice. I don't really have the energy to tackle it all at once but I know I won't have much time in the next week or so...Triumph: Almost at 60 days! I was in a situation where I was offered drinks yesterday and I could hear the "Oooh just one maybe" for just a second before laughing to myself about how silly an idea that was. So I politely declined and went to bed sober last night and feel great. I could also see in my friends the physical effects of drinking beer almost every day...ruddy complexion and looking bloated in the face and belly...maybe that seems rude but I just felt kind of sad because I know I've been there...General: even though I'm tired and feeling lazy I'm okay. I'm not beating myself up.
**Struggle:** I've been trying to catch up on sleep that I desperately need.  I seem to always have an excuse to stay up later than I actually want to and I need to discipline myself to go to bed.  This might help with some of the irritability I've been experiencing as well...**Triumph:** Although my face is still numb I got through a visit with my dentist that ended in a cavity filling session.  I'm trying very hard not to bite the inside of my mouth!..**General:** Yoga can be fun and challenging no matter who you are!  I highly recommend giving it a try!
Struggle: I am on a break with my partner as of yesterday. I'm having a rough time dealing with it...Truimph: I am fortunate enough to have a place to stay for now with supportive friends by my side...General: Time to dive in to some serious reading today.
**Triumph:** Went to a big arena concert for the first time in years. Had a blast and the music was better than I expected. My wife got a tiny glass of wine. For the same price I got a bottomless cup of fancy soda. Made sure to get my money's worth!..**Struggle:** Two big deadlines are looming at work. The wave is building and building. I think in surfing it's called a "closeout."..**General:** u/sfgirlmary your dinner party experience is how my dad got through many years of life with his wife :\
Struggle: my job. It's a thing I should be use to disappointing me by now. ..Triumph: I did a bunch of productive things on Monday which have bleed over into yesterday and today. I got my letter from the IRS and got a budget together for this week so I can pay them by Friday.  I also made up a budget to try out from here on out. Money stuff is something I have no idea about and am looking forward to actually figuring out now. I have put forward 2 money saving goals for my self. One would be for a new tattoo and the other would be a trip to Mlb spring training next year in AZ. ..Money stress has been a big trigger in the past and I am really proud of my self for doing something about it and  not just saying fuck it and going to the woods and sneak drinking like I have in the past. ..General: I can tell the seasons are changing. It is light out when I get out of work now. Feels good to see the sun again. 
What day is it? Sober wed lol IWNDWYT!
Struggle: Working 4 future weekends in a row to avoid trying to find something to do on the weekends. I live in a drinking town and it just seems easier this way for now..Triumph: 1st month is coming to an end this weekend!..General:I am finally getting sleep back in order maybe kinda feel like I may be going to bed too early and trying to catch up on years of lost sleep. I read that people who are generally depressed may sleep more than others but I dont really have much else to do at the moment.
Struggle: So I reached a year of not drinking but now I've got this nagging feeling of "what next?" While I don't really feel like picking up a bottle I kind of feel almost like I did when I first quit - it's hard to explain. ..Triumph: Over the weekend my SO and I went to one of those tree obstacle parks. We had so much fun even though it was kind of scary and very physically demanding. Before I quit I would have never even considered doing something like that...General: Cooking some ostrich fillets for dinner tonight - haven't had it before so I'm hoping it's good.
I have a contract work with a Korean company. Yesterday they were boozing at the compound and gave me a call. I told them "no cannot join you". ..Today was weird; the guys were all distant. I mean Koreans are always a bit reserved but today they were acting really weird. Finally one has told me that it was very rude not to join in them! "Their drinking culture requires it and it was the basis of team building". I told him I don't give rat's ass about it since I am an alcoholic and cannot drink. And the guy says "Everyone of us alcoholic that's why you have to drink with us" I have literally been left speechless before this logic!!    
Struggle: I just got back from vacation so feeling pretty struggle free..Triumph: I survived my first all-inclusive alcohol free!.General: Dogs are wonderful. 
struggle: anxiety has been a b lately. but lots going on so i am being patient and accepting...triumph: 177 days sober is a triumph. i have been tested pretty hard lately. it has not been easy...general: i am moving in a few weeks and i am beginning to start getting stuff in order. i know moving sucks but i am really going to try to make it not such AS much. :)
Struggle: I start a new job Monday and I'm nervous I'm not qualified. ..Triumph: Made it to 7 days sober today. ..General: Gonna get another storm today.
Triumph: I acknowledged alcohol was causing problems in my life. Almost on a hangover whim I decided to quit. Told a good friend who has been super supportive. I'm traveling for work and have been eating good food and enjoying all the extra energy I have. I still won't say  alcoholic ... bleh. But I know it wasn't helping me with anything. I feel clear headed and my adhd meds are working way better...Struggle: weather is getting warmer. I live on patios with a beer in the summer. That's when it hits me. But now that I've decided abstinence is the way for me (for now... I hope to get to a comfortable moderation level some day) it's been way easier...General: I'm about to buy a house I got a new position at work and they love me I'm trying to fart. I'm just going to leave that auto correct- I was saying I'm trying to get my side biz straight. Life is good. It's hard as fuck. But I'm a lucky individual.
Good for you handling the dinner party. Super hard to be in that situation... and I'd be thinking damn I need a beer. Stay strong!
Struggle: my DUI court date keeps getting continued. I know my lawyer is doing it to get all the evidence he needs to help get it reduced but I'm just ready to see how this whole thing ends up so I can stop worrying about it. ..Triumph: I went to my second AA meeting this morning. The people there are really nice and I really enjoy going. I'm about to start looking for a sponsor and working the steps. ..General: I'm about to make myself a nice steak dinner with a baked potato and some asparagus. I finally got back on my cooking game and I'm enjoying all the delicious meals I've been making myself. ..Keep on keepin' on sobernauts. IWNDWYT 
Fuck drinking. Remind me why not to drink please
Struggle: I have not yet told my husband that I stopped drinking for good. So many times in the past I have said I wanted to quit and never followed through with it so I fear he wouldn't take me seriously. He drinks a lot and I have actually been doing ok. But tonight was so tough. I almost grabbed his drink. ..Triumph: I am at 48 days!! I am breaking the chain of alcoholism in my family. I told my daughter I quit and she is happy for me.  I hope I can remain a strong sober example for her...General:  How about this snow storm here in New England!
**Struggle:** Missed out on a big promotion I was really confident about. I was definitely qualified but I'm not sure who they'll end up making an offer to. Definitely an outside hire as I was the only internal applicant...**Triumph:** I didn't drink after work the day I found out. Wouldn't seem like much to most but I suppose if anyone would be empathetic they'd be here...**General:** Slept much more soundly last night after having an hours-long anxiety attack trying to fall asleep on night one.
Struggle: Dealing with anxiety issues since stopping. From what I've read here and online this sounds like a common issue and I look forward to my brain rewiring itself without the alcohol crutch. In the meantime: meditation exercise and work...Triumph: Every new day without a drink. That's all I need...General: I've read so many great posts on here with some excellent quotes and I might try collecting them in one place. Some truly insightful people on here. Thank you all. IWNDWYT.
**Triumph:**  Days are getting longer and I got to ride my bike to work twice this week!  ..**Struggle:**  Candy.  ..**General:** *crickets*
Struggle: Went to a work celebration dinner tonight and it's my first social outing around alcohol. Constant thoughts of drinking since it was all around me. Then the champagne toast came.....Triumph: I didn't drink a drop all night!!! Toasted that glass of champagne then happily took a nice deep sip of my ice cold seltzer. Was invited to go out to a bar afterwards. Old me would've been all over that but then end up fucking up and getting fucked up. Nope. ..General: I think I'm over the habit of drinking since I'm near 2 months but being surrounded by it in a jovial setting was a bit testing. I'm so happy I passed.  Every time I think about how many days I've piled up I get a sly little smile.
