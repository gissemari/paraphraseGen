I am struggling to stay on track right now.   I have had week-long stints with avoiding alcohol but I keep caving to my cravings.   As a teacher the end of the school year is strenuous aggravating and all-encompassing.   I keep telling myself that I will get back on track when the year is over.... but I hate the idea of postponing a better more sane version of myself.   Any tips from teachers for not drinking the stress away?   I could really use some help here..... I will not drink with you today!!! Thanks in advance.

Wellll... I'm also a teacher (15 years' worth) and have done it drunk and sober and I must tell you that all the stress is actually exacerbated by drinking. I understand why you want to wait and all because it is also stressful to quit drinking but... I had been sober for five years when I hopped off the wagon about two and a half years ago. Long story short I had an experience in February that scared me straight and I haven't drunk since. I was in the middle of doing my National Board renewal coming into our busiest and most stressful music season (I am also a gigging musician) but I got sober anyway. No time is good and every time is good depending on how you look at it. If you are sober today I say keep at it. I bring a can of soda to school with me and snacks for the drive home to keep me from driving by the store for booze. You can do it!
