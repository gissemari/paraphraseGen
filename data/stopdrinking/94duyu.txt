Day 3 and I'm not gona lie tonight was a struggle. Other half was drinking and was doing her best to get me to join in BUT I was strong and did not cave.  I'm very proud of myself!! I know I'll feel awesome in the morning and I'm grateful for all of those calories I haven't drank! .Hope you've all had a lovely evening.
