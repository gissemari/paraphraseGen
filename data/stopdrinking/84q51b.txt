Welp I posted here ALMOST a month ago about my boyfriend and I wanting to stop drinking starting by not drinking for a month to give ourselves a small goal to get us going. After a few struggles the first week or so we were doing great. Then our anniversary came around this past Saturday and we decided to go out for sushi and ONE drink to celebrate. One turned into two. Two turned into a bottle on the way home and continued for 3 days and several more bottles. I missed a few days of work because I completely forgot to eat or drink water during those few days of us getting drunk and left a hangover from hell that lasted multiple days. I'm finally starting to not feel sick anymore but I'm angry at myself for going nuts. Even my boyfriend was telling me to eat but I was so drunk that I insisted I didn't need it. Now I've gotten into (more) stupid drunk arguments with my boyfriend (caused by both of us) gotten myself sick as hell spent way more money than I should have my next paycheck will be smaller than I need and I'll have to budget like hell till I get another full paycheck. I can't believe I got so dumb and let ONE drink get so out of control...Edit: spelling

well im the same way personally ive come to the realization that im just not the kind of person that can reliably have "just one" ..so im out to quit altogether 
It's that first drink. That's what it does.
Don't let this stop you - you were doing well before so just get back on track. Stay strong and remember you managed a month so you can do it again and then keep going. You now know you cant just have one. Best of luck.
