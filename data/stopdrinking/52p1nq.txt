I can't believe it's been 5 days. But today was a real struggle. My best friend and I are taking an evening class together. Before class she was told me she had a bad past few days and wanted to get a drink after class. I told her that my SO and I had dinner plans. She said she was going to drink anyways even if it was by herself. I know that meant that she really needed to talk so I said I'd hang out with her for a bit but I wasn't going to drink. She said okay that's fine. I haven't told her about me quitting mainly because at this point I'm taking it one day at a time and I still feel overwhelmed in saying I'm going to stop forever. ..We went to the bar and I got my soda and she got her beer. I really wanted a beer. I could smell her beer. It was insane. But I managed to not drink and she told me what was going on. We each had our drinks and I went to meet my SO. But I was in a really bad mood. I wanted a beer but I knew I shouldn't. It would just lead to me drinking the night away. That internal fight just made me so mad. When I got home I was going to walk my dog but I couldn't find my other shoe. And I broke down. Like I cried. But it wasn't because I couldn't find my shoe. It was that I wanted booze. I'm mad that it has this strong of a hold on me. Now I'm scared that I'm going to lose control again. I made it through today but I feel like I'm losing willpower. I'm also wondering when is a good time to tell my friends about my decision to be sober.

Willpower is like a muscle. Yes you can only push it so far before it fails. BUT you can also train it to become stronger...This does become easier. There are good days and bad days for us all. ..I don't know if there is a good "once size fits all" answer to the question of when to tell people. I myself tend to tell the people I think it will benefit me to tell (close friends significant other friends I know struggle themselves) but some I don't (casual friends ones that won't ever really notice a difference)...IMO it is KIND OF like weight loss. If you tell everyone that you are 2 days sober people might completely freak out. "OH MY GOD?!? What happened? IS THIS FOREVER????" But if you wait a few months people might just go "Huh. You stopped drinking? Cool." ..Just my 2 cents.
After 7 years I sometimes still want a beer...but now it's just a fleeting feeling that passes quickly. I remember where you're at and it sucks...but it can be done. ..Just don't drink today. If that time frame is too much then don't drink for an hour. You'll go nuts thinking "I can never drink again? NEVER?" but an hour is ok isn't it? Just keep doing that...Remember you're not mourning the loss of a friend here you're celebrating the death of a tyrant.
