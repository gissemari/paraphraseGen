My story is so much like many other first week posts I've seen. ..Here's what **1 week** of sobriety gave me:..* true connection with my husband.* true and present interaction with my four year old--presence and playfulness.* mental clarity .* **EXERCISE**.* **SLEEP**.* healthy appetite.* minimal anxiety.* **ZERO shame and guilt**.* My clothes fit better.* I have energy--even if my sleep the night before wasn't perfect.* I can look in the mirror and actually see myself without looking away in disgust ..I feel like a new person. I feel like the me I was before I started drinking. It's incredible. I feel like I'm 10 years younger. I am truly shocked...at just how good I feel...I couldn't have made it this week without guided meditation 1-2x a day (first thing in the morning and just before bed--try the Calm app if you're having trouble falling asleep or struggling with anxiety)...Cardio saved me! All it took was one day at the gym to get that endorphin rush and I was hooked on exercise again. Exercise has a lot to offer when you're not hungover...it became something I looked forward.  ..I drank a ton of seltzer water and herbal tea. ..Healthy snacks in my purse were huge for when I felt hungry. I was grateful for an appetite and happy to be eating healthy food instead of junk. ..A solid routine was clutch for me. It helped me take things one day at a time...and even an hour or a half hour at a time in some cases. ..My first 24 hours was a challenge. I didn't want to drink but I was anxious weepy and the guilt and shame came crashing down on me quickly that first day. Someone in another post mentioned that sobriety caused them to confront the issues that drove them to addiction in the first place. That has also been true for me this week. Instead of numbing and/or resisting pain/suffering with regard to relationships and situations...I have been dealing with them one-by-one. Some I've already been able to process and let go of. Which is remarkable...since I've been drinking for years to suppress the pain and dealing with issues head on was something I could do within a week due to the gift and clarity of sobriety. ..This past week changed my life. It's different than it's ever been before. I think something got through this time in a way it never had before when I said I consciously wanted to quit but my subconscious wasn't on board yet. I am clinging closely to how good I feel. How rewarding this has been. How empowered I've become--in just 1 week! I have gained things this past week that alcohol never delivered on and never could. I will not soon forget. I have experienced **TRUE FREEDOM** this week and I am so grateful that I came to sobriety by choice with so much life left to live and enjoy and so early in my life. I'm 33 and have been struggling since I was 21. Some issues that were plaguing me then were plaguing me still up until this past week and one-by-one I've started to finally confront them. My husband knows that I have struggled with alcohol in the past before we met and a couple of times since we got married (9 years ago) but I have been drinking very heavily in secret nearly every day for about 2.5 years and he has no idea just how bad it was. ..Thank you to everyone on the forum who has shared and commented. Like others said the variety of stories at different stages has been tremendous in terms of resolve and also to help understand the condition we have and the power it holds (or tries to hold). The experience of others has been an encouragement and a further wake-up call in some cases. I have tried AA in the past. I have tried sobriety in the past. I have never found anything like this forum and I wouldn't be here right now without it. Life changing. Transformational. And the positive outcome of this thread's effect in my life for generations is truly priceless. ..Bless everyone of you dear people. I am privileged to call you friends. ..And for those of you who have been lurking (I lurked for months as well and it never occurred to me to join until last Wednesday)...we're all here whenever you want to make today your first day. I think so many of us are proof that it's the best decision you'll ever make and we'll be here to support you and cheer you on! ..**Much love!**
