After posting about having cravings all weekend and struggling I sit here typing listening to this awesome recovery playlist you all made (seriously it's great) typing out some things quick workout hanging out with my kids my first meditation ever I had a little realization. I'm sitting here feeling great really enjoying the alone time (wife out kids asleep) and on a normal day I would have started drinking when I got home around the kids heavily watching basketball and getting angry and drinking more until I passed out downstairs listening to music. Now I'm sitting here SOBER listening to music NO TV and my mind is actually WORKING the way it is supposed to. I have to say it is great. Anyways my wife basically talked me into not drinking and I was pissed at the time. but damn she was right. I used to think drinking brought out my creativity but NO it is like a brick wall to your own thoughts and that is truly what ruins your night. I'm rambling now but thanks the craving passed and glad to not drink with you all tonight. This has been an interesting process to say the least.
