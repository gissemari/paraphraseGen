How to get through a holiday knowing that yes it's my fault I relapsed and yes other family members will be drinking at dinner so it's probably for the best that I am not there. ..But I am feeling so miserable and isolated tonight. I want to pack all my bags and move to an island...Any advice on having to do a holiday alone in early recovery?

volunteering time at a soup kitchen / food pantry would surely revitalize your soul
Treat yourself to some good food exercise clean your house and watch a movie you've never seen ;) IWNDWYT
I agree keep busy doing things for your own pleasure or that are productive and will benefit you. I guess when I'm feeling down I always find it's a good opportunity to absorb how much easier it is to deal and heal without slapping a booze band aid on it. I'm sorry you'll be alone tomorrow I wish you Easter blessings and hope your day turns around. IWNDWYT
Day four tomorrow and I'll be home alone because of temptation. I would just get a nice dinner and binge some show. Maybe read a book. Fat dessert and in bed early and sober.
