i was going through a low yesterday on 4/20 and having a strong urge to have a drink yesterday when i hopped on facebook and seen  [this music video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU7RGS8568k) that gave me the strength to continue my 54th day of being sober. hopefully this can help anyone else dealing with relapsing

im glad you didn't relapse. that music video would stop anybody from drinking lol.
Yipee....well done for not listening to that idle brain chatter... it attempts to corrupt our minds when bored !!
Stic.man has a bunch of good ones too.  They're mostly healthy living / clean living:.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cScbD1jI10A&amp;list=PLA1CB22837A331375&amp;index=6
well done stay strong. polite suggestion: get a badge lower right hand side of this page. helps to keep track and motivate!
There's a great line in there that's something like "emotions will kill you if they're not on parole." It made me think of the [prison posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=author%3Aslipacre+title%3Aprison&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) our friend /u/slipacre writes about his AA service work.  So many of those guys ended up there because of their emotions.  So recovery is all about having my emotions on parole. If I let them have their way I end up back where I was.  That term is going to live me for awhile.  Thank you for sharing this. 
I'm so glad you posted this. Hip-hop/rap can be extremely inspirational. Kendrick Lamar is a personal fav (and is sober IRL) .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aShfolR6w8
