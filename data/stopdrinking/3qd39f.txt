It's been 3 days the longest I have achieved soberity in roughly 4 months it's not along time but this time I feel alot more confident in my recover. Today was my toughest day out of three The lack of sleep from the previous night left me feeling tired and juts generally miserable. See my sister in law and my brother lived with us for a while before finding a place of their own.  While they were staying here I begin developing a bound with her. She was a friendly girl with a great personality. She put up with my Bullshit antics for the best part of year. After everything I said and down in my drunkenness. She all ways said good morning to me with a friendly smile. In the end I got crazy paranoid that she was up to shit and started accusing her of stuff. I don't really speak to her much these days but now there struggling to meet the rent for this month. I feel like I should help out as an amendment for my actions. It's really been playing on my head all day but maybe something good can come from not drinking.

Being nice is not a weakness. Be who you want to be and not what others you think others expect. Paying forward is not a bad thing
Good for you keep it up. 7 days here and each day is better and better. This reminds me of a song I like to go back to and quote; ."If we're only ever looking back.We will drive ourselves insane.As the friendship goes resentment grows.We will walk our different ways"..Now I take this and say that it is better late than never to make amends with people. ..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b69pP7yLpas
