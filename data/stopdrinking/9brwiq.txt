last night was a real struggle I ended up going to bed early just to get my mind off things. thank you SD for being here for me to read while I couldn't think about anything but drinking. ..woke up this morning feeling fucking fantastic and so relieved that I didn't drink. today I finish work early and that's usually my cue to start the weekend binge but today I've made plans to clean out my old flat and be productive with the extra time instead. ..I've missed 50 drinks and saved about  56 so far. feeling grateful to have the chance to turn things around before they get as bad as my uncle (who's on the waiting list for a liver transplant and lost the last 2 decades to booze). ..thank you SD. happy Friday I won't drink with you today.

Props to you mate. Every day sober I achieve more than I would in a fortnight of boozing. Maintenance on my car boat and bike is done on time. I get to spend time on hobbies like playing the guitar and read books I could never be arsed picking up. We are all here on our second or more chance. We are all making up for lost time. Keep us updated on your progress!
HaPpY Friday friend!  Good job just going to bed last night!  Whatever gets us through to wake up to a brand new day feeling better than ever   there will come a time when it's not so hard anymore so far you've got the right idea and sounds like you're doing good- hang in there   IWNDWYT
