Have not been sure whether to ask about this but i suffer from anxiety...specifically health anxiety....crazy because drinking buggers up physical and mental health...yet i struggle to stop...does anyone else relate to this ?

You're right our drinking behaviors don't make any sense...Yes to a certain extent I relate to this. Overall my general anxiety is way less the longer I go. Specifically I have had some health concerns but since I quit drinking I take better care of myself can afford to see the doctor and have the willingness to actually go...So having gone I know I am managing my situations as best I can...It's a virtuous cycle the not drinking.
 Yes I'd stress about the toll my "lifestyle" was taking. Why not incorporate some good healthy habits into daily life? A little exercise eating healthy.. it can give you a sense of helping yourself out. 
I'm the same
