1. This community is amazing. The support really does help...2. This journey started over a year ago. I relapsed multiple times. It gets easier but it never goes away. I will always struggle with wanting to drink and I've accepted that...3. I drank every day for over a decade. If I can quit anyone can do it...4. I lost 50 pounds. I joined the gym at the same time I started to quit and slowly transformed into someone I didn't hate to look at in the mirror. I've gained 10 back but hey I like food and I still work out...5. My life has changed. I can sleep through the night. I've gotten promotions at work. I have a steady SO. My spiritual life is back where it should be...6. I quit more than drinking. I've been sober for a year without so much as a cigarette or vape...7. Alcohol ruined my life. Here's what I was failing to realize: **it wasn't too late to change.**..Thanks for reading and thanks for your support..
