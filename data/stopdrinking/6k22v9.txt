I need to quit drinking. 42 year old woman. I am quickly falling down a very slippery slope. I've never drank this much on a daily basis. What I drink now on a given day (7 or more drinks) was a good binge for me in college. Three years ago a crazy night was three glasses of wine. I can now easily down two bottles a day. Or five beers chased by several glasses of whiskey as I did last night. I'm not hiding mini bottles of vodka in my car yet but I realize I can end up there. ..I don't feel like I'm interested in anything anymore other than sitting outside drinking. Oh it's summer! I tell myself I'm relaxing that I've earned it but frankly nothing else really holds interest to me anymore. I used to have hobbies. I used to enjoy exercise. I used to want to cook. I used to value my health. I just don't care anymore because my main hobby is booze. It disgusts me and the feeling of self-loathing I have right now is almost too much to handle. ..I'm so tired of waking up in the morning hurting. I'm tired of trying to conceal my shaking hands all day long. I'm tired of looking ragged rode-hard. I'm tired of feeling puffy of aching of wondering if people at the office know I come in almost every day hungover to some degree. I'm tired of the dark under-eye circles. I'm tired of getting home from work and only having energy to either lay down or to start the whole drinking cycle over again. I'm tired of the shame. I'm tired of trying to hide it. I'm tired of lying to myself that my relationship with alcohol is both normal and healthy. ..Last night all I could think about was going to the doctor and crying for help. I feel like I've crossed some line into outright addiction. I'm scared. ..I would like to think I can moderate or just have one but I can't. I can't tell you how many times I've tried and failed. Almost every single day I tell myself that I won't drink today but every single day I do choose to drink often early in the day when I don't have to work. ..I see my thought patterns around alcohol are dangerous. I treat it like a friend. I obsess over it. I spend way too much money on it. I put it before people and loved ones. I use it as a crutch to numb feelings and check out. ..I just can't keep going on this downward spiral. I'm starting to despise myself. I want to be sober. I don't know how to start. There is all the emotional b.s. to wade through with free time and trying to figure out how to enjoy life without being checked out and drunk. ..I'm not even in denial that I have a problem. I just don't know how to fix it. I don't know how to get over the addictive voices that rationalize it how to beat back the emotions that surface when I can't numb with it how to navigate the restlessness and anger I feel when I "can't" have it. ..EDIT: Update (link below). On to day 3. Thank you guys SO very much for all of the loving support. Means the world to me. ..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6kgw3n/day_3_and_the_struggle_is_real/..Thanks for reading..
----------immediate responses--------

I will not drink with you today. You are not alone. 
I feel the same way. I know I have a problem.  I hate that I can't moderate.  
Are you me?  I am a 45 year old woman and I could have written every word of that.  I have been struggling every day for months and have had to reset my counter too many times. I feel defeated and like you say rode hard and put away wet. Everything in my life is suffering because of the booze and I can't seem to shake it. I hope that just by reading what you wrote today I will not feel so alone and I hope that me reaching out to you makes you feel a little less alone as well.  Good luck to us both on day one.  We can do it.
It feels so good to jump on the sober train.  I just did it.  Over a year many badge resets as I felt out stopping drinking.  It's really not hard.  It's just one little decision and a lot of support.  You came to the right place.  I also read all of the sidebar stories in Saturday Shares and Sunday Solutions.  I used Smart Recovery at the beginning when I decided I needed to make a change.  I also read This Naked Mind link to free download in sidebar.  I won't drink with you today.
43 yo. woman myself and as Dutchgirl said I also could have written this just a few weeks ago. Checking in here every day and reading The Naked Mind (free at the sidebar) set me in the right way and I'm in a roll SO happy now when I go to sleep and I express my gratefulness for another day without alcohol...Believe me when I tell you that the awful feeling soon starts to disappear! I depuffed almost overnight around day 10 and have been feeling and looking better every day you need to take it easy the first days to give your liver some time to recover - as in you'll feel more energetic but then get tired easily. Eat nutritious food drink plenty of any of the zillion delicious beverages there are sleep all you can and be very proud of yourself we all are proud of you and here to give a hand whenever you need it...Once you quit it all starts to fall in place bit by bit and it happens fast no more "my body just doesn't respond to any effort I make to eat better/exercise/smother in cold cream/sleep for ages/drink damms of water/whatever" ditching the sauce is by far the single action which has had the most impact in my mood my energy and my appereance. And I'm not even 45 days in! ..Lots of love it must have taken so much courage to speak up your mind but every step of the way helps get closer to the destination! I'll be rooting for you and drinking lemon water by the gallon!
I'm a 45yo female I also was drinking high volumes of wine each evening.  It just keep getting worse and truly wasn't even fun anymore but by that stage I was addicted.  It's hard at first to make that first step and you may feel like he'll.  But it gets easier!
Glad you're here.  Sorry to hear about your struggles...I realized that *Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..I decided to eliminate alcohol associated consequences from my life...I got support went to meetings and learned to live sober...I've never been happier!
I'm a 43 yr old woman and I could have written this several months ago. Unfortunately I was not willing to admit that anything was wrong and continued on a downward spiral and now I'm on the brink of losing everything. Not an exaggeration. ..I'm new in this journey (day 7 today) and already beginning to see the benefits of not drinking. Not going to sugar coat it the first 5 days were extremely tough. But I rode it out and yesterday I accomplished more than I have in years. I even read a book!..I find great inspiration by coming here and reading the stories and comments. Even when the mind is not completely clear the change in thinking you read about begins to sink in. ..It took great courage to write what you did. Hang in there! It can start to get better.
I could have written this post almost word for word. ..I thought I'd figure out how to stop drinking (actually drink less) somehow. Or someone would swoop in and fix it for me or something major would happen in my life to make me stop..... I don't know why we think we can figure it out on our own...I went to AA and it helps me tremendously. I never thought I'd be a person in AA but here I am. I'm not religious and the program works for me. Being around other alcoholics is an incredible relief.
Dear r/spicyporktacos  every one here knows what you're feeling. ..First step is looking for help and in here you will find it. I visited this sub when I was feeling as low as you are now three and a half years ago and it's a huge reason why I succeeded in kicking the habit. ..I can only speak from personal experience but here's my two cents: stop now before before something catastrophic happens . .It's extremely likely that your workmates know that you're drinking too much. Same with your friends and family. ..I had this realization after maybe six months of sobriety. I had changed and people around me noticed that. Not everyone is ready to confront someone with a problem. .Another thing : if someone else had a problem around me you can be sure as hell that I could see it. And very clearly too. ..I would advise you to see a doctor and get something prescribed for your anxiety. It won't be easy to face yourself when you don't have alcohol to hide behind. ..The fight you're embarking is not an easy one but it's so rewarding. It will literally change your life. You are in the right state of mind to make that change. You can't stand that relationship anymore. You have to stop it. ..Just don't drink today. You'll never regret it. I garantee. ..Good luck be strong.
(Apologies for the long reply!)..Welcome sister! I'm in my 4th decade too and I recognize much of myself in what you wrote. I knew I needed to stop when I started drinking almost every day (and especially heavily on weekends) I started taking an apathetic view of my own existence (I didn't really care if I died or not) and I started boxing out my loved ones. I didn't want to do anything but drink and be alone. ..My sneaking suspicion that I needed to change quickly morphed into certainty and then fear as I struggled to moderate and failed repeatedly. I stopped as "soon" as I did only because I found this place. The stories here confirmed my worst fear: I just had to quit...So one day in September I said to myself "This is it. No more."  ..For a few weeks "not drinking" was my only real priority (yes I still went to work and so on but I babied myself as much as I could). The benefits started accruing and that helped things along. ..* **Rationalizing**: I can't rationalize it any longer. If I choose to drink I know that I am making a choice that is bad for me (I know this even more surely than I did when I started this journey). There is simply no way around it. If I choose to drink that means that I am saying that I am okay with allowing all of the garbage that alcohol brings to me back into my life. I can't pretend otherwise. If I drink it would not be a "slip" (whoops!); it would be a headlong willful self-destructive dive into a cesspool. .* **Anger about not having it**: I know what you mean. I do. To combat this I've reframed my thinking--I CAN have it but I choose not to have it. I mean if I'm willing to lose everything I hold dear well heck yes--I can drink as much as I like. I'd MUCH rather have what "not drinking" gives to me. (Sometimes what "not drinking" gives me is permission to eat my weight in ice cream. All things considered that's better than drinking.).* **Handling emotions**: I always thought of myself as a nervous and angry person but things have naturally evened out a bit for me as I've recovered (I even managed to stop picking at my fingernails--a bad habit I was never able to break).  Meditation and actively working on shifting my own perspective have helped a great deal (these are new practices for me). My anxiety is way way down as is my anger. My partner now describes me as "calm." Heck I feel pretty calm most of the time and I notice when I'm not calm and self correct more quickly. I still struggle with a bit of depression but I feel better equipped all around to handle life as it comes at me. I am sure that getting a good night's sleep most nights helps with this. Sober sleep is the best sleep!..I feel grateful most days. 297 days ago I was in a very dark place. For me starting was all about getting my head into the game. Once I truly committed the path became much clearer to me. I accepted that I needed to change...I'll be rooting for you and I won't drink with you today. 
42-year-old woman here too.  I also obsessed over drinking spent waaay too much money on it and watched my healthy habits erode.  For me the first step was having regular support (thank you /r/stopdrinking and SMART!) so I didn't feel alone and could find shared experiences with others.  I also checked in on this sub every day committing to staying sober JUST FOR TODAY.
I could have also written this word for word. I started feeling suicidal and went into "emergency" mode in my head. I went to AA and cried humbled myself realized there was almost nothing more important than working on my sobriety. For me that means going to meetings working steps with a sponsor reading this sub reading books exercising (slowly) and eating nourishing food. Be kind to yourself though as you may have days where you have no energy or crave sugar etc. It's all OK as long as your sober. Something that resonated at first: Life happens and you can choose to face it sober or choose to face it drunk. Everyday is a choice. I just finished "Alcohol Lied to Me" and there are some good suggestions in there on supplements to take to even out damaged brain chemistry. I just got my vitamins in the mail today and looking forward to seeing benefits from 5-htp fish oil etc. Also I keep fancy La Croix in the ice box and still step outside to enjoy a cold one in my "quiet place." I've even given the patio a little makeover with new cushions plants and paint! It feels like a different nicer place now. Like my whole body! Also download and read "The Naked Mind" (free in the sidebar) ASAP. It's completely paradigm shifting.
45 yo woman here and I can't believe what I am reading as it's identical to my story I have reset my badge so many times thinking or hoping that I could moderate but I can't it's not working for me. It's only day 3 but It feels different this time though as I read so many similar stories. I really just want to give it my best shot this time &amp; see &amp; feel what it's like on the other side. Together we can all support each other and win this battle once and for all. Let's do this not drinking with you tonight.
I will not drink with you today.
Another 42 year old woman here. I've lost everything but my health and my parents. You're not alone and I won't drink with you today.
I'm a 45 year old woman too. I'm on day 5 without alcohol for the first time in 10 years. I was disgusted with myself. 20 pound weight gain daily hangovers bottles hidden all over the house from my family. At my recent doctors appointment my liver enzymes were elevated. My thoughts every day revolved around when I can start drinking. I didn't want to go anywhere but home so I could drink. I read posts in this group for a few weeks. Listened to podcasts. Read some self help books. Listened to the Naked Mind on audible a couple of times. Now I'm not drinking. A couple of days of cravings but I powered through for a couple of hours. Went to bed sober and woke up feeling great. I've realized how much alcohol was taking from me. My energy my family my health my life. You sound like you are ready. You just have to find what is going to work for you. Listen to podcasts consider professional help read the posts in this group. You are not alone. You can do this. 
I'm 57 -you are an amazing writer the detail in your post it was so me - I started with a book called the 30 Day Sobriety solution - it was therapy you do action steps daily and I did them exactly -even if I didn't understand -I always did the work during my drinking time !!! It was a fantastic kick start!!!!
You are stronger than you realize. When I first quit I did most everything the oppposite of how I would've if I was drinking. I would call it getting comfortable being uncomfortable. It involved always stepping out of my comfort zone. Dishes were a thing that I hated  for example. I forced myself to do them every day by  hand. I involved music with most everything and lots of dancing was involved to keep it enjoyable.  I enjoy doing dishes now. It gives me a sense of accomplishment. I quit watching tv and eventually phased out most forms of social media and focused on things like exercise and my health (at the time I was wayyyy over weight) . . .I feel like I am rambling now. .Take it a day at a time and focus on something positive. Keep fighting! I will not drink with you today!
41 year old mail here with 90+ days sober. I'm no expert. But my best advice for you would be to just do what you need to do to get through the first eleven days (be it eating foods you love soda candy etc.). Once you get past the first week and a half everything gets A LOT easier. 
I'm a 48 year old woman and I could have written this too. I knew the drinking was killing me but I didn't care. All I cared about was booze. It's been really heavy for the past 6 years and I got to where two bottles of wine didn't give me much of a hangover anymore. It's day 35 of sobriety for me and I can tell you that stopping was the best thing I've ever done. .The brain fog is starting to lift and I'm now really realizing how much I lost due to my drinking. I'm so happy I quit. 
Yay for 42-year-old women! Me too. There are a lot of us out here with similar issues. 
One of the best things I've ever done for myself is finding a good warm-hearted MD who specializes in addiction and recovery. If you can afford it consider it. They'll set you on a very fast and humane track to removing the physical dependence and making withdraw a comfortable experience. They are worth their weight in gold when it comes to getting from where you are to the point where you no longer physically depend on alcohol. There are other ways that are free as others have mentioned. Again if you can afford it consider it... it's the nuclear option but ironically makes the first steps much more manageable and comfortable.
I just want to tell you that you are a beautiful person and this stranger is feeling for you. ..AA has been amazing to me. It can be a group of people that empathize with you because they have been exactly there. 
39 y/o here. I cannot reiterate how much your post resonated with me also. My days consisted of getting up hungover as hell. Puffy. Looking like shit. I tried my best to conceal with makeup... expertly winging my eyeliner and contouring like a pro.. but even as I looked in the mirror I knew I was lying to myself. I work with a bunch of men... and there's a big alcohol problem with a lot of the guys. The managers would talk about how alcohol was ruining their lives... performance... and I sat there... nodding. And almost secretly wishing and wondering if they knew that I too had a problem. In fact.... now that I think about it... the last relationship I was in... I would go over his house not loaded.. but definitely tipsy. And it blew my mind that he never noticed. I mean... now that I look back on it I secretly wanted him to care! And be like wtf! But alas... he didn't. In fact no one seemed to care. I woke up most mornings in awe I didn't die in my sleep. That is if I didn't wake up in the middle of the night because I pissed the bed... or worse... shit the bed. (Gotta love those drinking watery shits... I don't miss that at all.) I had to go to a training and my work put me up at a hotel... and I recall putting those shower towels on the bed. Hoping and praying I wouldn't have an accident. I didn't... but the fact I even had to think about that? So humiliating. I didn't stop drinking though! I spent my days thinking of when I could start drinking...I would think about it during the day. I would pass out every night not remembering if I said goodnight to my daughter. I can't get those days back. But it took me just hating my life. Everything about myself and how I was acting as a shitty mother. And one night for my daughter to basically ask me to stop... I knew I had enough. I can't get back those days of basically ignoring my kid to drink and "watch tv"... although I've had to rewatch shows countless times...but I CAN move forward. It wasn't easy. Detoxing was a bitch and I felt like shit. But to remember watching tv and giving my daughter a kiss goodnight..... makes all those awful sleepless detoxing nights worthwhile. We're here for you! I too will not be drinking with you tonight. 
54 yo woman. Been on a similar slippery slope for the past 10 years. Ditto everything said above by others. Be strong. I won't be drinking with you today!
56 y/o woman here quit at age 52 after 25 years. I needed AA and Celebrate Recovery to stay stopped. Alcoholism is a progressive fatal disease. I identified with everything you said. There IS hope. I was terrified to tell my doctor the truth but when I did he was the first one to believe in me and told me I COULD DO THIS! I chose life. I hope you do too. 
You just have to stop and all your hobbies come back to you naturally. Its just do or die. 
Thanks for sharing this. Like everyone else I totally related to your story word for word. It's a beautiful thing to realize you are not alone and - you are not alone. We've all been there and now we want to change our lives. You're taking the right steps and remember it gets a little bit easier each day sober. 
You are not alone! I stopped drinking one day last year and was ridiculously kind to myself over everything else. 3 bowls of ice cream? Sure thing! Huge packet of potato chips? Of course! Lying in bed all day and binge watching movies/tv programs? Whatever it takes!..I also read SD posts whenever I felt just a bit panicky about not drinking. This community is an absolute life-saver and is hands down the most supportive place online I've ever been! We are all here for you and with you :)..It took me just under a month to feel that I was more under control and I didn't need all the junk sugar. I've now dropped 7kgs and am beginning to feel like I'm emerging from the cocoon. ..It is hard at the beginning but it gets easier and it so worth it! .Not drinking with you today :)
Your writing seems very perceptivem expressive and descriptive to me.  Maybe because I've felt exactly the same way for years on end.  I can tell you that relying on "will power" alone as a technique to stop is none too reliable.   Getting together with others in the same boat (there's lots of us around waves hand!) and talking about it live and in person can really be helpful.  Doesn't necessarily have to be AA.  ..You seem cognitively sharp and perceptive with a good heart to me if your writing is any guide.  I sure hope you don't burn that house down with alcohol as sadly so many have done.
I went through a lot until I decided this had to end. It was nearly 4 months ago and I am 42. ..I failed for years to moderate. I asked myself if I was too far gone. I was not. ..I still ask if quitting is worth it. And it has been. 
I have scanned through all of the comments and first of all and most importantly you have an amazing group of women and men around you that want nothing more than to support you in this journey. You are among friends and best of all the perfect type of friends that want nothing more than to see you through this...I will also say that I am not in the same situation you are in but it resonated with me because it was like future me speaking to current me if I don't change my ways...Just don't drink sounds so easy to someone who's on the other side. I'm not there yet but these are actions that are helping me get there...If you find yourself wanting to buy alcohol spend that money on a journal. When you want to drink write instead. Write about your feelings. Write about why you want to drink and why you don't. We drink because we want to feel happy and accepted. Write EVERYTHING in your journal - good days bad days frustrations hopes fears dreams. Write before you drink. Write even if you do drink. ..When you look at that journal you will see YOU. You might also see you when you drink - and THAT handwriting will give you the extra sense of pause you need before grabbing the bottle again...For me the more action I take lessens my desire to drink but also makes it more difficult because I feel I've "achieved" that day...and that's part of why I'm not out of the woods yet. But you obviously want to stop you're afraid for your future and my little bit of advice to that is - ..Start recording your recovery. You CAN and WILL do this.
I'm with you all ladies. Today I Will not drink with you all. Failure after failure of trying to quit the wine. Today I need to reset the badge and quit. I'm sick of being drunk and hungover. Wasting money and my life and feeling crap. Day 1 x
Your story is like my story-and so many others. There is hope. And there are wonderful people here who can help and support you along the way. Yours was a great and brave post. And the comments just incredibly honest and inspiring. I'm just really humbled to be part of this absolutely awesome SD group. I will not drink with you today.
Welcome! You've come to the right place. I get a lot of inspiration from this sub. Reading about people who have gone on from the misery of active alcoholism to the enjoyment of sobriety is just the ticket I needed. I will not drink with you today.
Hi welcome....I'm a 48 year old woman and my drinking spiraled out of control last year. I finally fessed up to my family doctor and everyone else I knew. I was slowly killing myself. My heart hurt and I had horrible coughing pain. I couldn't sleep very well and it's amazing I didn't lose my job. I feel a lot better now that I'm on a path to healing. My life feels a lot more peaceful.
I could have written your post.  It can get so much better! Hugs.
