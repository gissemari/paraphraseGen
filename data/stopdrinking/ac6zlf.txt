So I relapsed pretty hard between Christmas and New Years and had to reset my clock. I won't go into too much detail but it was bad and I regret what I did immensely...However I also realized - I spent more than half of 2018 sober! That for me is a huge accomplishment. I have never done that before. The two month and five months stints of sobriety in between relapses were INCREDIBLE and I am so grateful for that time...If you like me skipped over the holidays I hope you find it in yourself to get back up and try again. You may have had to reset your clock but the days you had aren't going away. Every day I make it through without a drink fills me with a sense of joy and accomplishment and I am determined to keep the momentum going. I still want to be sober and I'm not going to let that stupid slip up get me down!..Thanks for listening. I love you all. IWNDWYT.
