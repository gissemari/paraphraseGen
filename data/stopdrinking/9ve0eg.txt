Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
what is this? (i put on 70 lbs in the past year!)
I would not recommend except under medical supervision.  Protein and water diet...300 to 400 grams protein per day. I done 6 hard boils eggs. 6 to 8 litres of water. ..4 days I shed 5 kg.  11 pounds. I had to loose weight as I was very ill. Enlarged liver and spleen.
