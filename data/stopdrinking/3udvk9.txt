Boyfriend and family are discussing their beers and all I want to do is join in. They're having such an innocent time sipping slowly currently talking about all the new breweries popping up in Philly and I know I can't partake in any of it. Boyfriend's mom bought wine specially for me since I'm the only one who drinks it. They don't know I'm 44? 45? days sober...I'm going to bed sober tonight. I'm not going to drink. But I'm having a hard time. My brain is telling me I can have one drink and all I can do to fight it is to imagine what would happen next - one drink is never one drink things will be hazy tomorrow I'll be depressed and hating life...So I'm not going to drink. But I'm struggling. Are you struggling too? How are you dealing?

Not my favorite time of year. I hate holidays in general. Girlfriend's parents coming over soon and not looking forward to it. Have a few bottles of wine and a couple beers still in the house and can't say it isn't a little tempting...But whether or not I drink today two things are still going to happen. I am still going to have to go through parts of today I don't like and I am going to wake up tomorrow morning. While I MIGHT enjoy today better with booze I won't enjoy the morning better and I will have to turn in a badge resent and be all grumbly and grouchy all day tomorrow...Think about tomorrow morning if today feel too rough. In the short term a quick walk outside can help if you need a break from people. Good luck! We're here for you!.
Can you share with your boyfriend your struggles with this?   Maybe ask for some support?
Right there with ya. Live with my brother and his pregnant girlfriend and we are hosting dinner for our family. She spent last night making jello shots while we prepped the food which they are now lining our fridge. We have bottles of booze and beer all over. Its incredibly tempting and overhwhelming. I've been trying to hide downstairs and downing sparkling water. I've taken my dog out severaltimes but the rest of the fam isn't even here yet... The rest of the night should be interesting...
I feel you. My husband's family is tasting whisky and wine... ..We can do it. we can do it. You have 45 days. I have 44. lets make it one more. 
&gt;"boyfriend isn't sober? Break up with him or you'll relapse"..**Filter off** FUCK THIS SHIT **Filter on**..While most of the AA and SD community seems to mean well almost all of the time I see stuff pop up periodically that is so completely ridiculous it makes me gag. Some people go to all or nothing or to the fact that its almost like alcohol is this all powerful demon that will destroy you if you let a drop within a thousand yards of you...While I agree that dating a DRUNK might be a concern I cannot ever see why people follow this logic. The whole point of sobriety IMO is to make our lives BETTER. Cutting out legitimately great parts of our lives because of the RISK of negative consequences is so self defeating..."Oh you have an appendix? They rupture sometimes so even though yours is completely healthy let's just cut it out right now." Is not something a sane doctor will ever say...Just don't get lost in that (doesn't look like you are) and remember not all of us think that way...Sorry guess it was my turn to rant. :P
I take lots of little breaks--jump on SD go for a walk do some yoga. I also keep my hands occupied. Puzzles are great as are board games or dishes.
If I truly wanted to drink I would drink. I would find a way to do it and work with the consequences. If that was my life's goal and desire I would drink....But you know what? I don't want to drink. Drinking just makes me feel crappy. Its not that great of a buzz feeling for me. Makes my stomach sick I get tired I'm not at my peak performance it covers up flavors and smells gives me bad sleep headaches I can keep going with this list....So I am not struggling because I actually don't want to drink.  If I looked at drinking as a treat or something fun or romantic or sexy...sure I would be struggling. But I don't look at it like that. I look at it as a weak poison with negative cognitive effects....I don't look at sobriety as giving up anything. In fact I think drinking makes  you give up your full potential...Hope this helps.
Stay strong.  Im horrible with advice but I am rooting for you!..Edit.  I'm struggling so hard I decided to not go to any party.  I'm alone on thanksgiving which sucks but I know it will be worse in the long run if I drink again.
I'm alone today. Just finished grilling some chicken thighs and now I want to ride my motorcycle but I know this is when people are driving around liquored up so I'm going to stay in. Or maybe I will just ride in the neighborhood and jam to some grateful dead. ..Just stay positive OP. I was with my friend a few weeks ago where he was drinking and I wanted some naturally but just keep in mind how far you've come. The beer will not taste good knowing that you shouldn't be drinking. It would be an awful experience. When you do not want to relapse in front of company. That's the last thing anyone wants. 
Hugs to you.  This is my first sober Thanksgiving since I can't remember when.  Be strong!
The first holidays are hard. I struggled a lot that first year it's really difficult not to drink in general but when there are designated days where it's socially acceptable to drink excessively (at least for my family) it's that much harder. The first thing I had to accept is that I can't drink successfully no matter what. I just can't drink. .Everyone else around me can drink &amp; that's okay. Sometimes it's hard to be around it because it reminds me of how I used to speak or how I used to smell like booze. When I first got sober it was not easy to see that &amp; I had to face the person that I was. .Maybe you'll have to get honest about why you're not drinking. I had to be very open with my struggles (nobody was surprised) in order to stay sober. I had to accept that I was different &amp; I had the "allergy" to alcohol. I have a beautiful life when I'm sober if I drink I'll have to give it up. 
Hey I'm almost two years and struggling too. Woke up to a text from my mom asking if it would be okay to serve wine. I hate holidays as it is so I really was not happy about it (mom is several years sober she is "cool" being around drinking and I prefer not to)...So yea did some chores and shit around the house but wasnt feeling too well (stomach ache and a little lightheaded). Took a nap lions won woke up and started to get ready and started feeling terribly nauseous and like I was going to barf. Yea... feels like the flu. Called mom to explain I think shes upset but understands. She knows I hate holidays but honestly I am absolutely not using it as an excuse to not go. Well now her friends can enjoy their wine and beer I can enjoy my peace and quiet. Hopefully she stops by later and brings leftovers I promised my rats they could have some.
No wine in the house only beer. Don't want wine in the house but I have no problem passing up beer. I had get ready for this because it is going to sound weird water with apple cider vinegar while preparing dinner.  I actually like it and there are health benefits. If wine is your choice of poison  you might like it too.
Earlier in sobriety I found that I often compared myself to people who can drink "normally". In my head this meant I was not "normal". As time went by I turned down hundreds of drinks and hundreds of invitations to the bar and I continue to drive right on  past the party stores I used to buy booze at every single day. I tell people openly that I don't drink. If they ask why I tell them in plain English that I'm an alcoholic. To me this is as normal as I can ever hope to be and I'm okay with that...You did the right thing coming here to share your situation. Just remind yourself from time to time that like anything else sobriety takes practice. With enough practice that feeling of being in limbo will diminish. Happy turkey day and good work. 
The fact that you can come here and type this instead of drinking that beer means you're stronger than you give yourself credit for. 
There wasn't too much alcohol in my holiday so it wasn't too much of a struggle. I can't imagine if someone had bought me my own bottle of wine. ..I am in my first 60 days of sobriety and after leaving an IOP I am doing 90 meetings in 90 days. The fellowship of AA has helped immensely and I have over a dozen people I can call right now who would both pick up during this holiday but also spend the time to talk me through any anxiety I had about recovery and early sobriety. ..My only struggle is getting to a meeting right now. Visiting relatives so all the meetings and people are different and new. ..I am dealing with the support of AA. More specifically its the fellowship and support of other alcoholics. AA isn't a requirement but I don't know how anyone can stay sober without a support group. ........
that stinks
you can do it.  good job!  :)
I know it's tough to hear that when you're a couple months in. Just don't drink. You'll be really happy with yourself in the morning. 
We 2 score and more SD's are here for youstanding strong and ready to help.  I see /SheerWillITellYou and /NERDIsland and I have been working it like you..be proud of yourself recognize that alcoholic mind wants to control you while you have the upper hand as well as the higher mind.  See you at   CHECK IN FRiday.
I spent a majority of the day isolating. Im not sure that was the best move but Im still sober!
The best way to deal with the urge is to avoid social situations where people drink and do something that takes your mind off that gleaming cup of beer. Playing a video game might be a way perhaps reading a book if that's more in your alley. There are many ways to bring down the urge but try to not think about it. The more you think about it the more miserable you will be.
You can do this!
The Holidays are the hardest with family and emotions running high but you can do it. It's tough but you can do it. if you need to just leave for a bit. Does your boyfriend at least know?
