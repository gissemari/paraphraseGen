I've drank excessively for the past 4 1/2 years due to a toxic relationship addictive tendencies depression/PTSD/anxiety and an ensuing breakup with the toxic ex that sent me in to a spiral...I've also made a fool of myself put myself in dangerous situations and lost the trust of friends due to my drinking and sometimes belligerent behavior...These 8 days have been the longest that I've gone without drinking since the breakup in June of 2018. I was self medicating and drinking almost every day for the past year...I've known that I needed to get a handle on my drinking since October of 2018 but I never made the conscious effort to say  no  to a drink until now...I had enough of feeling and acting out of control so to gain self control and take better care of my body I'm striving to be sober until my birthday in October...In light of this journey I'm grateful have this group to lean on and seek advice and encouragement from. Thank you for sharing your stories insights struggles and triumphs to achieve and maintain sobriety.
