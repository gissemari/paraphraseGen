And sometimes all I want is to be a normal drinker. I felt great all day and got huge amounts of work done in my day 6 and worked through the witching hour. I know I'm safe now. I bought myself an armload of flowers to arrange on the windowsill instead of wine. I'll go home and make a healthy dinner and watch my husband drink his beer which is nice of him because I hate beer. And I will sleep and wake up tomorrow thrilled that I didn't drink. I want to make it to 30 days. I know in my body I cannot drink at all ever but I'm targeting 30 days because that seems doable that seems achievable and I've never made it that far before. 24 more days. I can do this. I'm thinking of you all and get more out of your posts than I know how to express. Every story of struggle and strength gives me something like sustenance like food. Thank you SD. IWNDWYT .

I totally understand some days I feel so awesome about my sobriety like a super hero and some days I'm fuckin pissed I can't drink wine with everybody else especially during this time of year. Great job on staying strong. I will not drink with you today  
I'm with you!!  I pledge 30 days myself. Come on we can do this. 
It will give me some accountability too. 
Being a  normal drinker  is so basic!!!..Remember:  ..We don't drink we time travel...
