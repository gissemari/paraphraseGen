I relapsed about two weeks ago and got shitty drunk 9 nights in a row.  I picked myself up Monday morning got back on here and pledged to stay sober.  And I did stay sober Monday.  It was good.  Then yesterday I pledged to myself to stay sober and I felt great almost all day.  Then the idea hit me yesterday afternoon that I should get drunk instead of catching up on my classwork.  I caved pretty quick.  It was not good...Anyway whether a new or sustained relapse is a question I asked myself and I've decided I could define it either way.  In the end the point is moot.  Doesn't even matter.  What matters is what I do next...I woke up this morning full of regret and I'm sitting here typing this instead of sitting in class.  I don't want to give up.  I will not give up.  Time to end this relapse.  Not tomorrow but today!!!  Sobriety get ready because here I come.  I will prevail.  I will not drink today.

I wish the best for you. I wish it for myself also.
You know you can not drink today! So that's great. In the early struggle to string together days and get my sobriety momentum going I had to focus on today and NOT on "omg no drinking forever." I can't worry about what I'll do six months from now or five years or twenty. It becomes overwhelming to me. ..I worry about just not drinking today and that's manageable for me. Although the counterpart to this is I have no plans to drink in the future either and I plan ahead to avoid putting myself in difficult situations where alcohol will be around. ..
