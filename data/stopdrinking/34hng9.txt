Can't believe it's already been 5 days... once you start focusing on sobriety it just goes by so frigging fast if you concentrate......Like I can't wait to continue this journey. My memory and fogginess is just beyond words I can't believe I used to look like such shit going into work in front of my boss and the call center. People know what's up and it's very depressing. All I can do now is move forward with this and for the first time I'm actually trying myself to do this...Just curious if everyone feels after that relapse and then a few days pass by you look at the badge and go... Seriously? That many days this fast?..Keep on that sober road guys if I hadn't of found this subreddit I might be dead.
