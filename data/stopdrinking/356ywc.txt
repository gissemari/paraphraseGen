So before I begin I haven't fully committed to the whole sobriety thing yet although I have been thinking about cutting the booze out of my life lately. I hope this question can contribute to some nice discussion though...So ever since I was a kid I've been fascinated with the tragic lives of the greats of rock 'n' roll electronica and hip hop. I feel as though on a subconscious level I've created this connection between the greatness of the musicians I love and alcohol. I'm scared to give up drinking because I fear for my creativity. This is completely irrational but although I *understand* that it's ir*rational* understanding and feeling happen in different parts of the self and don't necessarily coincide all the time. ..Maybe if I listen to some beautiful music about cutting it out and taking care of yourself that part of me will be able to rest assured. Maybe I just want to see someone else sing about the struggle...But it's more than just music. Although Bukowski's books deal with the most disgusting things thoughts and situations - dripping with unhappiness and depression - I still feel as though I *want* to be him. But I don't!..Anyway this is a thread for sharing the great works of art that inspire you to come to terms with your condition and to be better tomorrow than you are today.

Maaaaan one of the first things I noticed when I quit drinking is that my curiosity and creativity came back 10 fold not the other way around.  ..If you're a creative person you're a creative person.  Drinking only makes you less motivated to act on it.  That's just my $0.02 on it. ..Edit:  this might not be for everyone but it's a song against people getting their courage from booze.  [Minor Threat - Bottled Violence](https://youtu.be/WChbBgiJCLc)  They're definitely one of the greats in my eyes.  [Straight Edge is another good one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OSnAPxyMzo)..EDIT 2: [RHCP - Knock me down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNtO91LJ_f0)  Lord knows they've had their problems with drugs and booze...Edit 3:  Perhaps a little "prettier" than the others but [Passion Pit - Constant Conversations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBLuWKnKIn0) is "a song about alcohol-induced paranoia and how that affects people around you just watching those crumbling relationships"
How about the sweet sound of Ozzy and the often misinterpreted lyrics of [Suicide Solution](https://youtu.be/amcTfPrNFbI)
Some Reggae:..[Steel Pulse - Man no sober](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jw5_b8_Sxw)..[Iration - Time Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92SzQ25UhOU)
I have [the following](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090557/) to contribute. The movie's called "Around Midnight" and one of the great jazz saxophonists (Dexter Gordon) plays a fictional alcoholic jazzer who's lost it all and who's fucked it all up. It doesn't necessarily end happily but it's beautiful and makes you reflect...Plus Gordon actually plays in the film and it really adds to the beauty.
In high school I became obsessed with SRV. He's the reason I got into guitar and music. Later on in life I learned that most of my favorite recordings of his were from AFTER he got clean. Here are a few of my favorite SRV songs from after he got sober:..[Life without You](https://youtu.be/X7PQNvRZ10w?t=7m) - I queued it to play when he does his breakdown talking to the audience. He used this break to try and get in touch with the audience and tell them about his gratitude for being alive and walking away from the drugs and alcohol and to tell them to stay strong. Fucking love him. Then he rips into a monster solo...[Tightrope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX5ioDq1m5I) - A song about his recovery..[Crossfire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oK40sPa3SU) - song written by double trouble about having to deal with an addict and overcoming through support..[Wall of Denial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi3aJig1nsM) - Song about denial 
Jim Morrison won't ever wake up again.
I felt the same way about writing. Drinking stirred up lots of emotions in me and I'd use writing as my creative outlet for them. At times I thought I was Ernest fucking Hemingway. Pro tip: I wasn't...I've shared this in another thread but the music that's touched me the most at this time is Mumford and Son's album Sigh No More. Kinda seems like it was written about recovery but maybe that's just me twisting it to my needs. Anyway thanks for the post.
Not normally one to plug interpretive dance but [Sigur R s - Fj gur p an ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i9vEBWnu9I) has a great video which (unless I'm really misreading it) is about a couple stuck in a cycle of addiction. ..Every morning they wake up to a beautiful new world; every day they end up getting their fix and they have a brief period of ecstasy; every evening they turn on themselves and each other; the next day it repeats...It's maybe a slightly simplistic way of seeing pretty complex things but the music is so gorgeous that I often find myself thinking back to it. 
There's a wiki page for music. It's linked in the sidebar and FAQ. 
&gt; Maybe if I listen to some beautiful music about cutting it out and taking care of yourself that part of me will be able to rest assured. Maybe I just want to see someone else sing about the struggle...Most likely thing is that you want to continue to pretend that you're going to quit soon when in reality you're not going to and you know it. People do that for years or decades. You're fooling yourself.  None of this is getting you any closer to quitting.  Like the smoker who sees people die of lung cancer and says *oh man I need to quit* while lighting up. He has no plans to quit and that isnt going to change any time soon. That's you.  
The Gaslight Anthem has a bunch of lyrics where they sing about struggling 
[Asleep at The Wheel - "The Letter That Johnny Walker Read"](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmORbFtQaqM)..I wish you the best try to remeber that those feelings of self-compasion are just a trick of the ego to feel more special and unique "Look how tormented I am and what I create you can not understand me" you don't need them you can create true art by yourself looking at you honestly and proudly.

Jim Morrison died at 27. 
http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2015/05/duff-mckagan-bittersweet-superbowl.php..There's nothing elegant about being wasted. There isn't nobility in dying before you get old. ...Portnoy is the definition of greatness when it comes to writing and he wrote - .http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_Suite..Slash is sober; Alice Cooper is sober; Steven Tyler is sober... Actually it's harder to think of famous musicians that aren't. ..Almost none of them link their success to alcohol and many have had their success jeopardized by it. Alcohol for almost all of them was a coping mechanism with deeper issues that they also expressed through their deep talents and creativity. ..I used to have a similar relationship between music and alcohol and my creativity. Since getting sober I find I'm writing and practicing tenfold more. When I'd get drunk I'd just channel that into lying around and listening and thinking instead of doing. Now I do. ..Do yourself and the artists you love a favor - cut the link between the two. You're doing them a disservice by crediting their skill time  experience and dedication to a bottle. You're also doing yourself a disservice by keeping yourself tied to it. ..Edit: Jovi was sober his whole life; Clapton is now sober; the whole of MC is now sober...
I'm only 10 days sober so take my advice with a grain of salt but one thing that seems to be helping me adjust my attitude in favor of sobriety is transferring the romanticism I had attached to being a heavy drinker onto the idea of being a recovering alcoholic. ..Let me explain: I'm a musician in a rockabilly band. It has been extremely difficult for me to mentally separate the hard-livin' rockabilly lifestyle from drinking. The two are so intertwined and seem to go hand in hand. I had gained a favorable reputation among my peers many of them men for being this tough woman who sings the hell out of rock n' roll music plays guitar keeps a pint of whiskey in her purse at all times and knows how to have a good time. One of the guys. Part of me mourned the death of that rock n' roll me. ..Then I started thinking about this bar owner/musician/record store owner who I look up to as a pretty bad-ass guy. One night after playing at his venue he offered to give the band a couple of rounds of beer on the house. We asked him to join us at our table as he was done with work for the night. He nonchalantly laughed and said "Naw I can't touch the stuff anymore. I don't have just one I go ape-shit crazy and start jumping off of buildings and shit." He was so confident...and the fact that he doesn't drink has not affected his bad-ass rocker image one bit.  ..This sounds stupid but I also started thinking of rock stars in rehab...and how it's almost as romantic and cool as rock stars who are still in the grip of their vices. This is just a little mind game I've had to play with myself...to think about the musicians and stars I look up to who did not let their vices kill them and are currently sober but still rockin'. ..Just some perspective from someone who is trying to trick herself into believing that sobriety is cool. 
Well I've only been sober for a little while and already my creativity is getting better.  I really struggled with it while I was drinking not knowing why and now I'm starting to understand.  I have to be able to breath and be myself but when I'm drinking it's a false self.
