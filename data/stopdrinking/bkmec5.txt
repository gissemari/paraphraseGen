01/05/2019 marks 8 months since I last drank. My coping mechanism at first was to go to sleep but when you're having cravings at 09:30 on a Saturday morning going to bed is not an option. I decided to read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Drinking after seeing someone mention it on this sub. Thank you stranger for recommending this. I started reading it at the start of November. My partner and I went out for drinks for a friends birthday on 03/11/19 I didn't drink. I didn't want to drink. I felt so empowered. That book has helped me so much...At the end of last year I had a half year review at work. I was averaging 3 days a month sick. Here I am now not having taken a sick day since February (I had a horrific cold). ..I don't have bags of energy I'm a naturally lazy person. I still have bad days but my mind isn't clouded by hangovers or lack of sleep..To anyone struggling with their sobriety I just want you to know that you're not alone &amp; it does get better. You are in charge of your own destiny ..Reading this sub everyday has also been a wonderfully eye opening support for me thank you..IWNDWYT

I don't read much books. But I'll definitely check it out! IWNDWYT! Congrats on 8 months!
That book helped me a lot too. I had to read it a few times.
