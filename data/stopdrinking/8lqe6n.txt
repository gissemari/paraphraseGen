*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad--and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!..------..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**.Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:** .A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:** .A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...------..This post goes up at:..```.US - Night/Early Morning  .Europe - Morning  .Asia and Australia - Evening/Night.```..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...------..Good Morning from Scotland!..No quotes or stories today but I want to talk about one of my personal struggles that sobriety is helping with - and I hope some of you can relate or feel better for it...Whenever I'm out of the house I very frequently get nasty attacks of anxiety which have me worrying and hurrying for somewhere more comfortable. For 5 years or so I "dealt" with this problem by having a drink or two to make my brain forget. Because I drank every night my brain got used to the dulled sensation so when the panic happened it hit all the harder. Whenever it subsided I beat myself up about it because it felt irrational and stupid...Sobriety has given me new weapons to deal with this anxiety. It's given me:..* **Self-Care** - Looking after myself every day doing things to keep my body and mind healthy which I didn't have the time (or the inclination) for whilst I drank. I meditate daily and I'm starting to deal with my problems in a real way. This week after years of problems I made an appointment with my doctor to talk anxiety..* **Self-Love** - Sobriety has given me a whole new appreciation for myself. It's given me patience when I have a bad day and I feel like I look brighter and better. Whenever I look in the mirror or have a hit of anxiety I try and say something nice to myself now...So /r/stopdrinking what are your tools to look after yourself and feel good?..I Will Not Drink With You Today!..------..As a side note - I'm now looking for a volunteer to host the check-in for next week! It's a super rewarding process to hear from everyone every day and it's helped me stick to my sobriety this week! To host you need 30+ days on your badge. If you're interested let me know in the comments and I'll send you the details. :)

Good morning SD I'm in my last sober double digit day and IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
Thursday in Texas has a nice ring to it. I'm in.
No drinking today also in sunny Scotland.
I'm 8 hours behind you Scotland peeps so it is still night here. But it is a good feeling to know I will be waking up fresh tomorrow morning and IWNDWY Thursday :)
Another day sober. 
Well here I am at a week off 5 months of sobriety (143 days). Still thinking about drinking a lot but still saying no. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Good morning from Austria!..60 days of sobriety today. Being a bitt itchy last few days but I hope it will get better. Nice from you my friend to share your weapons to deal with anxiety. It would be nice to make a topic mostly from the veteran members who mannaged to maintain their sobriety for a longer time period to give their hints to us share their experience etc. Nevertheless to come back to topic IWNDWYT
Good morning.  Not drinking today.  Period.
No drinking today I have a day at home and it would be a trrrible shame to waste it :)
Finally finally finally finished a major project that I've been stuck in for the past 8 months yesterday and now I can finally move on to what I've been wanting to do for awhile.  It's such a gigantic weight off my shoulders but I don't think it's really even set in yet today was the first day I could wake up and not have to think about this damn project anymore.  Yayyyyyyyy!  Onto bigger and better (more fulfilling) things that will allow me to decide my own path in life.  IWNDWYT 
These last few days have been really hard...Cravings are back with a vengeance. I've been having a really hard time at work and all I want to do is order a bottle of cheap white wine and escape...I also feel so low and lethargic it's like I may as well be hungover...I'm not going to drink because I'm too close to 100 to give in now. I'm just surprised how strongly my desire to drink has suddenly come back after two months of fairly easy sobriety.
Good morning I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink alcohol today.
Iwndwyt! 
Day 4 and feeling best I have all week! I will definitely not be drinking today!
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today...Have a beautiful day! :)
Good morning from Alabama Grateful this morning for my sobriety this site my wife my dog. Sobriety has given me a new life the life I had but didn't really take notice cause I was drunk everyday from 3 to 9. Being clear and present for each day good or bad equals freedom to me it empowers me and helps me navigate my little world. No drinking with you lot today.. Peace
Staying sober today IWNDWYT :)
Good morning everyone happy to have been sober yesterday and relatively fresh this morning and looking forward to it again tonight! I will not drink with you today!
Being unwell never stopped me drinking for long in the past but I'm happy to say I'm doing everything properly to get better rather then covering it up with alcohol so I will not drink with you today 
No drinking here!
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
It's my last day of work before the long  Memorial Day weekend. When I was drinking this would have meant 4 days of extra heavy drinking. When I was more newly sober this would have meant I was really nervous on how I was going to get through it. Now it means I look forward to getting up early tomorrow to do yoga and get the house clean :) It does get better guys and it is so worth it! ..I'm not drinking today!
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today 
Good morning! Feeling better already. Slept well and more energy than yesterday. ..Lezgo day 2 I will not drink with you today!
Had a nightmare last night where I got drunk! Felt good when I woke up with a clear head ready to face the day though. IWNDWYT

Checking in. I won't be drinking today. But cheese. It's an evening for cheese.
I will not drink with you today...Six month is a ball hair away and the weight really started falling off recently...My newly single ass is looking toned and tight and remaining focused on no booze. ..Lets go!!
I will not drink with you today. I made it to an AA meeting for the first time in a month last night. It was really therapeutic to see new people begin this journey into sobriety. 
It is an honor and a privilege to stay sober with you today.   
IWNDWYT

Checking in peeps. IWNDWYT. Have a great day everybody.
Day 2. I will not drink with you today
Good morning SD. Today starts my day 4. ..Yesterday I got very bad business news (a contract that'd be work for all summer went to a competitor) and wow was that hard as fuck. A stress headache on top of 3 days sober being one of the longest stretches in years. ..But with the help of this sub in particular I held it together. "Play the tape forward" helped. While I have some real challenges today they'd be a whole lot worse if I drank myself unconscious yesterday and woke up feeling like shit and probably spun into a deep bender. .So thanks to all who participate here on SD. .IWNDWYT
Good morning SD! Stormy night overnight here in MN and I'm feeling extra drowsy from it keeping me up. Also for some reason had a blood pressure spike yesterday and felt shitty all day on my big 4 month badge day. I struggled even teaching my usual Wed night aerobics class at the gym. I wonder if now I have to quit coffee too? I did have an extra cup yesterday morning beyond my usual and it was a large nitro cold press from a mom &amp; pop roaster here in town. It was delicious but within an hour of drinking it I could feel the tension. I hope it was some fluke. I really do not want to quit caffeine too. ..Speaking of self care u/BoneConsultancy one of the main things I do now that makes me so happy and healthy (usually ugh) is my walk with my dog. We walk 3-5 miles most days now except for Wednesdays as that is his doggy day care day. So have to get going and get ready to walk!
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. Have a good day!
Smurfing in on this glorious sober Wednesday morning! I will not drink with you today! 
My son got upset in my car yesterday. Got him in the shower when we got home cleaned the car up and made him a cold compress. That would have sent me to drink a week ago. I did not this time. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!
Day 10!..Just got back from the gym and eeeked out a tiny bit more weight on the bench press.  Feeling good!..Last night I met a bunch of friends at a bar.  I drank ROOT BEER.  It was actually kind of tasty: it was my first time drinking root beer in ten years or more...I will not drink with you today.
Meditation. Daily meditation has been my keystone since I've become sober. With that I've been able to build and hold on to other healthy habits. It's funny how unaware we are to having an unconscious mind until we are aware...I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today!  
Iwndwyt
I will not drink with you all today! I faced my first temptation last night. I saw an ad for Apothic wine's newest wine... it is infused with cold brew coffee. Sounds amazing to me. Apothic red blend was my go\-to. I will resist though!!
I didn't drink today...I did get the most painful massage ever. After a few bad medical tests yesterday my shoulders were up around my ears. The massage man did his best but boy when he put his elbow in my mid back it hurt like beejesus...Is this just a Sydney thing or are these cheap Asian (mostly Chinese or Thai) massage places everywhere? $28 for 20 mins but my god they hurt. Very addictive.
Good morning IWNDWYT   
Feeling better today. Rest and gratitude. I will join you all in not drinking today or tonight. Happy Thursday. 
Count me in. 
Have tomorrow off so today is basically my Friday!! I will not drink with you today 
Thanks for your sharing this week u/BoneConsultancy!..Self-care for me is bedtime around 10 although since school finishes tomorrow for the kids and the alarm came move from 5:45 to 6:45 I might be up later for the summer!..Self-love is still pretty hard but I am beyond grateful that two munchkins and a great husband love me every day...I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
Thank you for welcoming me so warmly into this family. IWNDWYT in London 
I will not drink today
I will not drink with you all today.
 
Good Morning SD I will not drink with you today. 
The wolf/dog mystery from yesterday morning has been solved! The Husband did exhaustive internet research proving the last actual wolf sighting in OfuckingHio was in 1832. I went on our neighborhoods website to post the event. Several people shared that they had seen more than one all white Coyote roaming around both in the hood and in our Green Space areas. They all doubted it was as I big as I said it was! I was just so scared I guess! No matter what I will not drink today!
My Thursday was the type where self-care saw me singing the words "fuck a duck" repeatedly to the tune of the first few bars of the William Tell Overture. Thank goodness I telecommute. Between two seriously spin-cycling clients technology issues too many competing tasks and being way overtired I was ready to fling stuff at someone [however I did not fling things not at the cat not at the dog not at the Kiddo not at the gold fish]. I also didn't drink and I won't drink tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow. Happy almost-Friday everyone! :).dum dumdedum dumdedumdumdumdumdum de dum de dum diddlydum... etc :). 
IWNDWYT

Goo for you u/BoneConsultancy I am working on "rewiring" my habits too. ..IWNDWYT! 
Almost two weeks down for this 5am m-f gym 'test.' I say test because it's a test to see if I'd even do it. I'm actually loving it! Haven't seen any visual results but I can tell I'm doing better...All of this wouldn't have happened if I were still drinking. Which I wouldn't have stopped doing if it wasn't for all of _you_...I will not drink with you today!   
I will not drink with you today
I'm going into day 4 with a hangover... from a MIGRAINE yesterday! It's a nice reminder of how I felt waking after having too many drinks. Have a great day everyone! IWNDWYT. 
Thanks for hosting this week u/BoneConsultancy! Self care for me is quiet time in the morning over coffee and SD before anyone is awake taking the time to work out 5 days per week and using some nice skin care products on my face twice per day! ..Have a great day and I will not drink with you today!
Good morning from BluJul! On this day 7 I am not setting out trying not to drink.  Instead... I am making a conscious decision not to drink. NOPE NOT TODAY!!
Hello Hello my mantra has been be the change I want to see. I'm non religious and will be going to the early A.A. meeting. I will take the good and leave the bullshit behind. I will not be upset if I'm preached at. My kitty just came into my room and wants love. I will give it to him and you all! Take care of yourself and if you can someone or something else!
Good morning friends!...I have plans to gym get some paperwork done visit my grandma play music and paint. Plus I'm restarting therapy....I won't have time to drink with you today. 
Day 3. If it takes a thousand a 3s to get to day 4 then so be it...I will not drink with you today.

I will not drink today.
Happy Thursday SD IWNDWYT 
I was up wicked early today so I managed to get my 6 mile run in even though I had to be back in time to get my husband up at 7:00 (he has narcolepsy so he needs me to give him his pills and prod him for an hour or so to get out of bed).  I have an appointment with my therapist at 10:00...I'm really not looking forward to it because I have to tell her that I am down in single digits for sober days again (I see her about once a month now).  Anyhow...whatever else happens today the important thing is: I will not drink with you today!
I just walked my kids to school for the final time this school year. Crazy how early in the year the kids get out of school these days! I remember my high school graduation was on Friday June 13. But that was over 20 years ago. Anyway time flies and I will not drink today.
no thanks.
I'm very grateful to be sober this morning and I won't be drinking today.  
Good morning from Mississippi ..I will not be drinking with you fine folks today!
One week! Let's do another and another and so on. IWNDWYT!!
I put up a fight last night and won a small battle. Here's to one more day. IWNDWYT.
Good morning from the Mississippi Gulf Coast! I will not drink with you today

Not today!
I think for some reason my badge says 3 but today is day 4 for me. Personal and professional life are so much easier and productive when you are not hungover.  IWNDWYT! 
Last night was a great reminder of why I don't drink. Some friends of ours decided to bring beer to our kids baseball games. It was like herding cats! I took the wife of one home in the first inning because she was falling asleep in the stands. Shes going to have bruises from trying to get into her house. Somehow they got more people to drink my husband included (he doesnt drink often and very rarely in excess). They where loud although nice to all no mean drinkers thank goodness. At some point they convinced me to go buy them some tequila.... and the rest as they say is history.  Got hubby home (kids taken care of and in bed) hubby showered. Then I guarentee he started cursing himself for drinking. I finally peeled him off the bathroom floor at 1 am after he prayed to the porcelain gods for a good 2 hours. ..I am up early to take the kids to a super early morning practice. Feeling great in a good mood and very happy for another hangover free sober morning.     IWNDWYT!!!  
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today.
Now you've got me singing: don't call Wagga Wagga Wagga.
IWNDWYT 
Almost half-way to the day I had last year... One day at a time and today I will not drink with you :)
Tomorrow wasn't so bad. It may have even been good. I will not drink today. 
Day 3. IWNDWYT. 
Can't be bothered to write all the shit that's going on.IWNDWYT
These past few days I've been getting these moments of tension and headaches that my brain still wants to knock back with alcohol or nicotine. Funny thing is they also go away on their own. I will not drink today. .
Not drinking today I'm almost at 2 weeks and I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Another day. I'm not feeling strong today. I want to call in sick but I'm trying to work through it. No energy or momentum today. Coffee is not hitting the spot. Honestly nothing is I feel terrible. It's another hour at a time day. I'm scared for the first day in a while.  But I won't drink today. 
Day 200! I'm happy but I was over 450 last time I relapsed so I'm not content or complacent. Checking in here like I do every day to make this commitment with all of you lovely people. I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today!
Even though I've had an extremely rough morning with my 8 yo and I had a few of those moments where I just stared at her thinking "Seriously?" ...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
I won't drink today!
Day three! Staying strong. Finally feeling back to normal after my final day of drinking so I hit the gym after work for a half hour of cardio. I was never a gym buff but we have one at my place of employment so it would be a waste to not take advantage of a free endorphin release! I hope all of you guys are doing great today and stay strong...I will NOT drink with you today.
Thanks to  [u/BoneConsultancy](https://www.reddit.com/user/BoneConsultancy)  for posting this week...I'm Rockin' in here at 43 days today...Will not drink today either.
I will not drink with y'all today!!   
I will not drink today!
i will not drink with you today
Tempted today - got a significant raise and a long weekend that starts tomorrow. Would normally celebrate drinking heavy. Not this time though! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT. But Perrier? You better believe I'll be picking up some of that. Have a great day everyone. 
Good Morning everyone! I will not be drinking with you today!
No major anxiety problems here except bouts of self-guilt for not dealing w/problems around me while absorbed in a liquor bottle. My weapon to deal with this is to forgive myself and try to learn how to deal w/said problems. Self forgiveness allows me to like myself again. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Day 2 (again). Starting to think about mental health and the chicken and the egg debate related to my drinking. Am I down because I'm hungover or am I drinking and making poor life decisions because I'm down?
Thanks for sharing the anxiety busting tips. Personally I like to put on a playlist or a podcast and knit with soft wool...Had my first drinking dream last night! It was horrendous. I was coming on way to strong to a friend who had come to me with a problem I was knocking things over my ex was shouting at me people were laughing... No coherent narrative just flashes of images and deep deep shame...Pretty glad I had it though since the Moderation Monster had been nibbling at my good intentions all day before. The shock to the system is just what I needed. ..IWNDWYT! 
Good morning! I can't believe it's been over 45 days now. Let's make it 46. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!!
Good morning! I will not drink with you today!

I get my cpap machine today!! W0000000t!!

On Thursday this May 24 alcohol SHALL NOT PASS!
Just checking in on day 3   IWNDWYT
Back in my own place after a 2 week cat-sitting stint...I survived being in a place with a wine cellar and liquor cabinet for two weeks. Didn't feel much of a pull to drink...IWNDWYT.  
I was supposed to be meeting a friend for dinner tonight and I was massively tempted to drink. She has now cancelled. I am relieved. IWNDWYT. 
It's great waking up not bloated and disgusted with myself. I swear I'm already losing weight. IWNDWYT
Just passed two weeks. My life isn't perfect but I take great comfort knowing that every emotion word and action these past 15 days has been all mine. I feel my real self coming back a bit more every day. ..I couldn't have come this far without you guys. I will not drink with you today! 
Day 5 checking in.  I'm sick with a sore throat and cough...at least it'll keep me home in bed and out of the bars!  I will not drink with all of you today!  
Day 300; yeah me. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today 
No drinking today- for those new comers who wonder if it's worth it or not- IT IS !!! .IWNDWYT:)
Just doing my routine check-in. Been tough to process some of my emotions lately but I've stayed sober. ..I'm a bit concerned tonight because I know I'll be in a situation that has been a trigger in the past. ..Today is going to be a big day at work though so I'm hoping that I'm too exhausted to even give drinking too much thought...I'm pretty confident in my commitment to sobriety...IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
I'm in guys and gals.  Gonna be a beautiful and sober day.

Day 3: Travelled to another city found a SMART meeting here and canceled "dinner and drinks" with my company team after the customer meeting. I need to be with a different group I had to lie and told them I needed to finish some work by the end of the week would rather lie about that than having to lie about missing a meeting because I was in jail again. 
Today I will not drink. Today I will start working out even if it's 10 squats and 10 push ups. I will start building my body up instead of breaking it down. ..Day 5. IWNDT. 
I will not drink today
Hey ya'll..Over two weeks sober. Not too shabby...Not drinking today

I will not drink with you guys today!!
I will not drink today :)
Checking in.  I was trying to remember if I checked in yesterday and then felt a bit bad that I might have forgotten.  Then I realized that is actually a good thing means drinking wasn't on my mind.  Wishing all a good strong day.
Starting over today... I thought I could do moderation but I can't. Day one I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.

Hello from foggy San Francisco. IWNDWYT!.
Beautiful post! I wrote in my sobriety "action plant" that I will practice self-love self-care and self-forgiveness too. :) Maybe I'll post the whole thing in case it gives others some ideas; even though it's only been a few days for me this is my umpteenth time trying and first time I've actually formulated and written down a plan! IWNDWYT
I wish I wouldn't be such a pissant when I get home in the evening every day but today I refuse to allow that to he an excuse to drink. IWNDWYT

Good afternoon from the midwest. Trying to add some positive changes. Just downloaded duolingo to my phone. I have some spare time now especially at night when I need to be occupied.

No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
Good morning from California!  I woke up and looked in the mirror this morning and noticed that my face was a natural pale color \-\- I didn't really realize until now that my cheeks were kind of pink from drinking every evening but  I'm glad I see that now.  Last night was a little difficult because I was feeling tired and frustrated because I was unable to concentrate....that is when I usually would drink but I  watched the documentary '32 Pills' which made me think that would suck if I drank and I went to bed.  I was happy to wake up feeling good this morning and I Will Not Drink With You Today!
Not drinking today 
Day 2! IWNDWYT!
Not today. It's day 5 and I had some honest clarity last night . Alcohol holds you hostage. Holds ones brain body and even actions hostage away from what you truly want to do or become. I'm tired of being held hostage by my own brain because my actions have polluted its thoughts and chemical balance. Fuck drinking. 
On it. Again...
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink with you all today or tonight   
Day one *not one day!*..I know what the right thing to do is. I will never do the things I want to do or be who I want to be with alcohol in my life. ..I *will not* drink with you today!
I Won't Drink With You Today  
And onto Number Eleven! IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT. Thankful to be sober this terrific Thursday! Hope you all are having a delightful day!    
Today I've decided that drinking no longer serves me. I had my last drink on Tuesday 5/22 @ 7PM CT. ..I'm scared and excited and nervous and anxious. 
Checking in. I will not drink any alcohol today. And I will feel better tomorrow for it. .On a side someone asked me when the baby was due today. I'm not pregnant  really hoping stopping drinking is gonna help me with some weight-loss!!
Day 2. I also will not drink today. (It's technically day 3 for me but I asked for a badge starting from yesterday since that was the day I joined Reddit and then it'll be all nice and orderly! Any other control freaks around here?) 
Back again iwndwyt..
Hey everybody! I'm not drinking today no way. I'm going to enjoy some yoga yard work and family time instead!!
Had a few squirrely days this past week. Been climbing the walls. But IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today.  
I'm beginning to think my anger and life issues don't stem from drinking but from me just being me...Anywho no alcohol. 
Just had surgery yesterday (on my ankle totally unrelated to my extensive history of drinking) and it's great not having to fight off withdraws before and after. Being sober has been great and I'm almost to a month again! Keep it up guys! IWNDWYT!
Not today!
Checking in. 3 weeks this week.

Thank you all for your encouraging and friendly comments. I absolutely know I wouldn't be here sober without all of you fellow SDers
Another one down another one up. IWNDWYT
One thing I'm realising is I need to prepare myself mentally every day for what MIGHT happen. So I'm prepared that if something goes amiss I won't drink. So today no matter how stressful or exciting it gets I will not drink. 
I will not drink today. 
Checking in. It's been a good day. I'm losing a lot of that anxiety I have while sobering up. I'm more productive at work. Man my life is so much better when sober..I'm not going to drink today.
107 days today. Really struggling. Sober.
I will not drink with you today.   
I will not drink today! 
Day 5 and IWNDWYT!
Seems I'm one of the last to check in today (Thursday). That would be because I started mowing early this morning. That would be because I wasn't hungover. That would be because I found the courage and the wisdom to change my ways...No I didn't today. Nor will I tomorrow (Friday). ..G'nite all. 2105 EDT/0005 GMT. OMG am I tired!
Not today not today.
A little late in the day but IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Good morning everyone it's felt like an eternity but I am entering double digits! Bring on day 10. ..I will not drink with you today...
Had a rough day and an emotional let down but definitely not drinking over it
Today was hard...I golfed - it was hot and I was craving a beer hard after the round...Instead I went home and played with my son in the backyard.
Not drinking is getting easier. I seem to be a workaholic when I dint drink though. But I guess that's better than being drunk. Made it through a weekend with my dad. I normally would have been drunk or feeling like crap all weekend. The temptation was a little tough but overall manageable. And I kept trying to tell myself I can have just one or two. But I kept thinking if it's a choice then I should also be able to choose not to. If it's not a choice then I need to make myself not do it. Anyway the ticker is ticking and life is good. Love all of yall. And I won't drink with you today. 
Hubs and I went out to dinner with a couple we historically drink with and didn't. It wasn't even that weird of a thing either. We just said  oh yeah we're cutting back on the beer trying to be a little healthier.  And the we're like  Alright cool.  In my mind I blew up telling people I wasn't drinking as this really awkward conversation or that everyone would feel weird about it but most people don't give a shit which is great.  Woo Day 10
Tried a new meeting tonight and liked it. Still not drinking!
I did not drink today!
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today. 
Hellooooo SD. IWNDWYT.
I screwed up at work and a whole wellspring of bad feelings came surging up. The "holy crap I cannot do anything right" kinds of feelings. I have no one in my life I can talk to about this kind of stuff. Part of the reason I drank for so many years. But not today. I know they say mistakes are opportunities etc etc blah blah blah. Hopefully that's true. Not drinking is the only way I can actually make that be true in my case. I love you all. Stay strong. IWNDWYT!!!.
I'm still hanging in there. Iwndwyt 
IWNDWYT. Had a few challenges this week with 3 occasions featuring booze (the main activity) but I drank sparkling water sparkling white grape juice green tea instead. ..Everything alcohol related is standing out to me at the moment-it's everywhere!! 
IWNDWYT!
Was reading the MGTOW sub and saw the link for this one on the right side of the page. I need to take a break from booze. I have too much time on my hands so it's just easy to drink and sit at the computer or play video games. Maybe spend more time in the gym and reading etc.
Staying sober another day and going to an AA meeting tonight IWNDWYT. 
Good Morning from BluJul!  Oh this day 8 I am not setting out trying not to drink.  Instead...I am making a conscious decision not to drink today.  NOPE NOT TODAY!!!!

I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY...Caps because it's Friday so I  need the extra emphasis. NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
Feeling some slight cravings today since it's friday but I will not drink with you today. I have too many plans and wouldn't have time to drink with you anyway unless I snuck something into the movie theater (seeing SOLO tonight!). 
Getting closer and closer to a year one day at the time. I must watch out not to see this as an end of my journey but merely the beginning...IWNDWYT
