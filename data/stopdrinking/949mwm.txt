Day 2: I have had some success lately in stopping drinking and that makes the relapses over the past few weeks even more painful. As part of my search for sobriety I am going to do a small journal entry every week day and post here on SD...Life is really good currently. Better than it has been in 2 years really. If I could finally kick for good I really feel as if this could be the launching point to the next level. On the other hand if I don't I know I could lose it all...Today is Friday. I will likely struggle this evening after the baby goes to bed. I'll want to sneak to the store for some booze. My plan to combat this tonight is to allow myself to have some really good evening snacks and read TNM. Hope you all have a great and sober day...IWNDWYT

Congrats on your journey to sobriety! The first three days sucked for me and I struggled a bit. Now especially on the weekends I plan things out in advance (just like you are doing right now). Well done! SD planning and exercise in the evenings (even if it is just a walk) have made things sooooo much easier. I hope you have an epic sober weekend! IWNDWYT
I know you can do it! :) IWNDWYT
