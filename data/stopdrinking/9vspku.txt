Went out for work night out told myself I wouldn't drink I just showed I can't be trusted in pubs and to just drink soda. Temptation got to me and alcohol wrapped its cold dead fingers round me once again. Take it from me anyone who's thinking of drinking today it aint worth doing again. Waking up at 2 in the morning feeling sick and struggling to get back to sleep and waking at 7 am feeling just mentally exhausted is not fun. I reset my timer from midnight as I came in before then. 8 hours and 8 minutes back on the wagon guys. IWNDWYT.

We've all been there testing our boundaries and failing. This time around I really focused on myself and didn't go out for the first few months.  Was it boring?  Kinda.  But as the days became weeks and then months my confidence grew and I got practice refusing drinks.  Now when I pass on going to the pub to drink tonics and lime while others are getting sloshed I pass because its repetitive and dull.  When I am in drinking situations I have more confidence and willpower to stay true to my own intention instead of crumbling under the onslaught of neon lights peer pressure fancy bottles and everything a pub atmosphere does to direct attention towards selling drinks.  ..It took me decades of drinking to get into this much trouble with it I can't just continue my same routines and expect different outcomes than what I trained repetitively for!  I have to spend some time learning new routines and mental postures so that I can move beyond drinking...it doesn't happen overnight.
