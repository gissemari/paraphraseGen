I've relapsed dozens of times since I first tried to get sober but I feel like I'm learning something new each time I get back on the wagon.  When I was drinking I would rarely leave the house just because I had to have a beer in my hand at all times.  Now I'm free to get out and enjoy life without that anchor weighing me down!  They tell you in therapy that each time you resist a craving you reinforce that behavior in your brain so that it gradually becomes easier over time.  It's not the instant gratification I'm used to but the benefits are definitely there.  Thanks to everyone in this group for being here. I Will Not Drink With You Today!

That's awesome!! I won't be drinking with you today! Thanks for sharing that tip! 
Morning esc!  Have a good one out there I will not drink with you today  
Congratulations! Good going...but remember you are not out of the woods yet and it takes time to unlearn the cravings and social triggers. My first 60 days were tough but now I think I've tamed the beast of addiction!! Remember we are always vulnerable to putting that bottle in our mouth but it gets easier with time for sure. You can do it! Again watch out for slip ups the first 60-90 days. Cheers!!
Good point about instant gratification.  I didn't realize how hooked I was on that part of it until I stopped -- and then I realized how fake that gratification was.  The "euphoria" I thought I would get from drinking was more in the anticipation. If I was really lucky I might get a 20 minute buzz which faded fast and then I kept chasing it.  Ridiculous!  ..Happy to not drink with you today!
