I'm so happy to be sober. I'm learning a lot about myself which isn't easy at all. But I like this more than blacking out and being so hungover it affects my day to day. I never regret not having had a drink even after a social event where everyone else is drinking because the next morning I can think back on the night clearly and analyze my and others' behavior more accurately than if I had been drinking which enables me to actually learn from mistakes not just block them out. I know that no matter what I do that's who I "am" not the alcohol speaking for me (which is both scary and liberating because I'm pretty sure I'm like *objectively* a weird person). I know my triggers more and how to work around them (exercise sleep food art). ..I'm very grateful to be in this position right now and I know it will only get better bit by bit. I want to believe in myself believe that I can have fun and interesting experiences and be a positive influence on others at the same time...I'm glad this sub exists because it makes me feel like I'm not the only one struggling and getting better also...IWNDWYT

Massive congrats on your first 3 months. What you said about learning about yourself resonates with me. It was around 90 days that I started to see the shape of who I was emerge from the fog of early recovery. It's not easy having to meet yourself again... but to feel like you're finally seeing yourself for who you really are is just totally breathtaking. For me everything snowballed for the better after 90 days. Weird sugar cravings passed brain fog lifted I no longer felt uncomfortable in my own skin moods had leveled. It's all up from here. Well done.   
Congratulations on 90! That was when I started to feel free. Way to go! IWNDWYT
