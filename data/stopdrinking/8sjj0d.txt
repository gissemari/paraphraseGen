Does anyone have experience with it?  My therapist has suggested it as I'm a chronic relapser. I'm considering it but wanted to hear some personal accounts.

It helped wasn't the cure-all I had in my mind but it had a noticeable effect. I wasn't serious enough when I was on it I wish I had been in therapy at the same time. Eventually I stopped taking it and quit without it. ..If you search the sub for 'naltrexone' you'll find a lot of people's experiences. 
As Im sure you are aware meds can help with recovery but they alone cant make anyone sober.   ..If cravings were especially difficult for you then nal might be worthwhile.  I tried nal under the Sinclair Method (not as anti-craving) and I did not find it useful.  That's just me though.  ..I can only suggest eyes wide open.  Nal isnt a short cut to sobriety.  It can help but you have to do the behavior modification etc concurrently.   Good luck!
