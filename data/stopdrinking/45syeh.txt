This has been the first time since I quit. It took a Benadryl and a Melatonin to do it and while I'd rather not do that every night it's still a lot better than drinking myself to sleep...I already feel a lot better today and I think a large portion of that is due to being able to sleep. I struggled with insomnia long before I struggled with alcohol and it can really mess you up. In fact in testing done by the military they found someone who didn't sleep the previous night is nearly as impaired as someone above the legal limit...So it's only day 3 but things are already looking up.

Sleep is magical for me. A good night's sleep is such a beautiful and health-enhancing thing. Glad you are feeling it :)
I started hallucinating on day 3 without sleep.  It was hard to tell if it was the alcohol withdrawal or the lack of sleep doing it.  I would hear a radio playing but couldn't figure out where it was coming from until I realized it was in my head...I went to my Doctor and was prescribed a low dosage of valium to assist with sleep and the symptoms stopped immediately...Sleep is MAGIC...Congrats on your sobriety.  Please keep trekking and don't give up.  We've got a long road  ahead but it is paved with support and friendship.
