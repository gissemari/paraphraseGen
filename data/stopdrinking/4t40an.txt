It's Just One Drink.  That's All...Just One...I'm going to just forgo One Drink.  The First One Today...With a nod of appreciation to so many regular posters here and the collective wisdom of several good friends herein and a thanks to u/good2gome who provided [The logic behind me not drinking]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4t36kx/the_logic_behind_me_not_drinking_whether_i_call/) I just want to share with anyone struggling my biggest obstacle...My biggest obstacle to stopping drinking was the concept of  I can't get my head around the notion of *never having alcohol again for the rest of my life!*.   The little evil sinister voice in my head would regularly show me that little note card:   you think you can go the rest of your life without ever having a glass of wine again?  With friends?  With a nice dinner?  On vacation?  During the Holidays?  It's part of the *fabric* of who you are!   That indeed was a daunting concept.  It tripped me up every time .. Until.     **Until**.   Until I realized that it's only ONE drink the first one.  ..I have influence control choice about the **first** drink today.  Because *after* the first drink I'm not choosing anymore.  The alcohol is choosing and it ALWAYS chooses **More**.  There's the oft repeated aphorism:   I took the first drink.  Then my drink took a drink.  Then my drink took me. ..This was my brother's plight.  He finally ended his life 5 months ago.  His family misses him.   The drink took him. ..I am not  stopping forever .  I'm not doing anything forever.  I am just **Not** having ONE Drink Today.  I made that decision when I got up.  Just today I don't have one drink   The First One.  It's Easy-Peasy...I decided not to have the First Drink Today when I got up this morning.  ..If today proceeds like yesterday I'll do the same Tomorrow with all you fine Sobernauts..

Great post. I will remember this. I'll not have that First One with you today. 
Thanks so much for sharing today I'm really sorry to hear that this shitty disease took your brother from all of us. Keep up the good work let's not drink today.
Really great stuff. And I'm very sorry to hear about your brother 
Thanks for the reminder. My monkey brain will start yammering about vacation or someone's wedding etc. but I just have to bring it back to that first drink. I'm declining that one drink. That's all.
This fear of the future really hit me the other day. I love being sober now but five years? Ten years? I had to pull myself back into the moment. Thanks for posting this - I will not take that first drink today.
Damn disease. Sorry about your loss. damn it lost another one. ...
Thanks for this post. When I finally hit that breaking point with alcohol I knew that I had to be done - forever. I can't quantify 'forever'. I can quantify 1 drink. I also know that 1 is rarely enough. This is my second run at long term sobriety. I had 10+ years. The road to ruin started with 1 drink. I know where it leads. Today I pick another road
great way to wrap my brain around lifelong sobriety
You are an awesome writer.  You have captured everything.  I am so sorry about your brother.  
Thanks for writing this . It serves as a reminder to my cocky self that I don't do just ONE drink anyways. So saying no to that one today and not gonna scratch that itch about tomm or any other future events. One day at a time. 
Yep that first one is a doozie! 
Well said u/Prevenient_grace !  Typing my daily SD check-in pledge and this quote offered by /u/Qpeser "every decision to go back and drink again is a sober one." has kept me from picking up that first drink many times.  I will gladly not drink alcohol with you today!
This is great insight. I can totally relate. So far it hasn't been too difficult for me to avoid that first drink. But I do know that once I start drinking it's hard to stop. And once I'm drunk it's like being on a ride that I want to get off but can't because it's just going faster and faster. Thank you for posting this.
So true. I am powerless after the first drink or drug. The craving kicks in. It's a bad scene that isn't worth it proven by evidence. Thanks for sharing.
Red hot spear of truth right here.  
Thank you! I am going to save this I had a close call last night but decided against it. Very happy this morning.
That's my obstacle too. *Never????*..Looking at it one day at a time has made it that much easier to wrap my mind around my cycle of one drink *always* leading to 4. Or 9. Who keeps count after that? I can control that first one though.
Love the post PG.  Thanks.
Boy scared the heck out of me!!  Great post.  It's so insidious "just one drink".  I thank my group that I know it's so insidious.  ..I share sometimes at meetings the reason I can't have "just one drink" because I'll kill someone.  It causes a chain of events that go like this..A.)  I have "just one drink"..B.)  I decide that one was fine and that I can have more..C.)  I have a couple more and start to lose track..D.)  I **always** end up drinking from 10 to 12 sometimes more..E.)  I run out of alcohol or the bar closes and but I'm not finished..F.)  After 12 drinks I decide that I "just want to drive" "it's only to the store"..G.)  I drive erratically and aggressively..H.)  As the consequence of statics I do this enough times that I get into an accident where I kill someone..Taking another person's life because I was drinking is my version of hell...Conclusion = I can never have "just one drink"..Thanks for your post!!  Soldier on fellow Sobernaut!!
I've noticed since I stopped that most normal drinkers don't have more than 1-3 drinks in a night. It's not as daunting thinking that they aren't overindulging either. 
Excellent words of wisdom as usually PG!

I like this.  I'm going to forgo having the first drink today.  And you can't have a second without a first right?  Thank you thank you.  I NEEDED to read this today.
Excellent post! Thank you for sharing! 
you have a great voice about this.  thank you for writing.
This is amazing advice thank you. I'm sorry that happened to someone in your family I hope you are okay.  
Great great post! Thank you!  .  .One of the "sobering" realizations once I stopped drinking was really just how much I had *made* drinking part of the fabric of my life (or it had made itself whichever.) I liked how you put that. But I quickly realized just how prevalent it is in other people's lives in society in every episode of the Good Wife...  .  .For some reason finally seeing how alcohol was like the blue pill in the Matrix made it possible for me to see life without it. I still only don't have one drink today   but realizing that today is the only thing that's "real" yesterday is a memory and tomorrow is a theory it makes "forever" seem as possible as "today."  
I remember your post about your brother.  RIP.  I think about it all the time.  I read it at the beginning of my sober journey and it had a profound influence on me.  Today I'm not going to drink.  Just today.
Fuck I needed to hear this. Feelin real lonesome today. Thanks for posting this. 
Love! 
I'm a college kid and I've got a lot of peer pressure around me. It was about 4 days a week of getting trashed out of my mind. However the past month I've been able to successfully moderate. I've had a drink with my friends but haven't been drunk in over 30 days! My record in the past 2 years was probably 3 weeks.
Im so sorry to hear about your brother. I hope you are doing well. I also had a death recently that challenged my sobriety but I am working through it ok as I hope you are as well with your brothers passing. Very insightful. Keep on keeping on buddy.
Thank you for posting this and I am very sorry to hear about your brother. I am still new to this and often have the same thoughts about "never" being able to drink again. The coming up vacation (which would normallyl be a booze fest) a wedding etc etc..."I have influence control choice about the first drink today. Because after the first drink I'm not choosing anymore. The alcohol is choosing and it ALWAYS chooses More."..You are right. It is the first drink. If I can get past that then it is clear sailing. Just not having one drink today with you. Thank you.
OP  sorry for your brother's death. I'm not intending any disrespect here just wanting to understand the expression you quoted. I never understand the part "the drink took a drink". Can someone explain this to me? It seems like it would be enough to just leave that bit out...
When I decide not to drink TODAY only--I am in the NOW as I keep that commitment.  There is almost no greater achievement in life than learning to live in the NOW.  
Thats all i said a month later im buying a 9 pack of pints every other day while on a strict budget after 8 months of pure sobriety of everything. its crazy how fast and hard you can trip back into it. stay strong and dont listen to your "Shady" side. no matter how bad things get. keep your heads up.
