Most of my life I have been a functional drinker.  I have been through a lot; both my parents were alcoholics in the worst way.  I had a daughter when I was 16 but still managed to put myself through school with an associate's degree and land an OK job.  I had another daughter 8 years later who is 12 now.  I met the love of my life after many shitty abusive relationships 5 years ago.  The problem now is that I get shitty passed out drunk every time I get stressed and I know I have a problem.  I want to stop but I still manage to go by the store and buy a bottle.  Every one in my life wants me to quit.  It is getting to the point that I am missing work and disappointing everyone on a pretty regular basis.  I quit for 55 days and relapsed.  I am the main caregiver for my family.  I go to work I come home and cook and clean and do laundry and run all the errands.  I also work 40 hours a week and I am going back to school for my BA.  I'm tired.  I have no friends no hobbies and nothing to look forward to but paying bills and getting up and doing it all over again.  I drink to escape but it only makes it worse but I keep doing it.

Welcome to /r/SD. While Christmas is over and done with today is here and now. I make a commitment each day to not drink. I can't change the past but I can predict the future (at least for 24 hours).
Hi there and welcome! I am wondering what helped you through your 55 sober days?
Welcome. I found AA to be a place where I could get away from the stress of my day to day life for an hour enjoy the company of others and chat with new friends all while learning how to live a sober life. 
Welcome your in the right place here I do it 1 day at a time I pop on this sub everyday it helps lots.
Welcome /u/mercadillo to /r/stopdrinking -- at [this link is a post called the Baby Steps which lays out what I did to stop drinking and get sober.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope you find something there to help you get your sober journey underway.  Good luck.
You do have something to look forward to a sober life. It's an amazing journey and things will get better without all the hangovers and wasted nights. Wishing you the best. 
Hi welcome mercadillo.you found the strength for 55 days you can do it again. I won't drink with you today.
Welcome. There is a solution I found one in AA. I would suggest you try it. I too used alcohol as an escape. Since sobriety I have learned how to cope without alcohol or anything else. Life is still life but drunk ass me doesn't make it worse anymore I make it better.
