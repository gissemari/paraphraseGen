As many of you know I've been going through a lot of stressful times and have been struggling with significant anxiety. I guess I'm feeling a lot of emotional overwhelm that I simply can't cope with...I know now why I'm an alcoholic. This shit sucks. I know I self medicated for decades and I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to drink to cope. But deep down I know it will make it a lot worse. Because I'll be dealing with crappy emotions on top of the wreckage of drinking...I'm getting through this one day at a time but right now I'm one minute at a time. Do the laundry. Rest. Feed the cats. Rest. Put one foot in front of the other and slowly things will get done...I just feel profoundly weak for being such an emotional mess. My husband deserves better.

I'm sorry...I won't drink with you today. 
The tides of the Oceans rise and fall...Emotions also ebb and flow.  ..I remember the 3 "C's" for certain things:..I didn't **C**ause it;..I don't **C**ontrol it; and..I can't **C**ure it...When my emotions are ebbing and flowing I've found it helpful for me to take a moment and really *Notice* what I'm experiencing.  It helps me to use my journal and put descriptors to the feelings.  Those might include - happy sad despair gloomy irritable excited and more..........When I really can identify what they are and it can be several things I take a moment and let them expand...I found that "the more I *experience* a negative emotion the more it dissipates and the more I *experience* a positive emotion the more it expands."..Your husband deserves and YOU deserve *authentic* you.  A real person with genuine emotions that ebb and flow.  ..I'm proud of you!..The Best You is Sober You.
You can feel however you want to!!! But I know I beat myself up enough for all those years of drinking etc. I wanna feel better now. Feel better with me ?? Im not drinking today.
