Picked this up on Kindly on Saturday morning and pretty much tore through it in one day. Really terrific narrative style memoir about one man's journey to sobriety incredible relapse and then journey back. Wonderfully written hits hard and hits very close to home more times than I cared to count. Parts of it were a little too sexually explicit for me but I was in the book for the recovery memoir and was taken by surprise by some of that. It wasn't problematic for the book but still a little too raw for my virgin eyes (HA!). ..Anyway if you want a book about recovery that reads like a page-turning novel pick this one up. There's a whole lot of truth laid-bare for all to see and experience and relate to here...Happy Monday everyone.

I read it a few weeks ago and give it a thumbs up.  Was hard to put down.
Yes I loved this book. Read it when I first got sober -- maybe I should read it again.
A fantastic book I thouroughly enjoyed. His other books are not recovery based but also well worth reading too.
I love that book!
