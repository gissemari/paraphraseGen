Hello everyone! Today marks my 9 months since I've had a drop of alcohol. I've had a few rough patches in life but that's what life is all about right? Dealing with life's struggles and doing so with a clear mind. I will say that old Katie would've cried and drank wine every night during times of stress. Now though I've noticed I am waaaay less emotional. Also I find that I deal with stress much better. The only thing that's changed is I'm healthier. Plain and simple. Now almost 35 lbs lighter working out and eating healthy. It's amazing how if you take care of your body your hormones seem to be at much more normal levels. I feel like a young healthy teenager again. I love this new me and I can't wait to reach my year mark! I want to thank everyone for posting words of encouragement on this sub always. If it weren't for you I wouldn't have had the motivation. So thank you so much. <3
