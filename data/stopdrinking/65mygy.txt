On my way home (from an AA meeting of all things) I started crying. Why? Because I want a drink.  I want a drink so bad my emotions are completely out of wack.  My ex then tells me that after we broke up he had over 20 seizures (his are the kind brought on by depression so obviously i was a huge source.). So a perfectly fine day turned into an emotional roller coaster of BS.  Im trying really hard not to drink and ik ill make it.  Still hard...I will not drink with you today.

Stay strong brother. I will not drink with you tonight!
You will make it. And you cannot blame yourself for your ex's current state what has happened happened. The only thing you can control is NOW. That only thing you should hold yourself accountable for 
Cry it out! Scream it out! Feel the pain and be okay with it. Drinking won't solve the problem. Think of how proud you'll feel in the morning when you remember how you wanted to drink but didn't. Hang in there. This too shall pass.
H.A.L.T ..Hungry angry lonely tired.    Avoid these things. 
your ex's health emotions and depression are his to own and manage.  they are not your responsibility.  him putting that responsibility on you or inferring that you are the reason for his seizures is called co-dependency.  you do not need to take that responsibility on and he shouldn't be guilting you into doing so.  ..anyhow... you got this.  i know you can stay the path with not drinking. i won't drink with you today.
