Stupidly decided to try moderate drinking again because for some reason I managed to convince myself that this time will be different than the other thousand times I tried that. Ended up drinking all night taking cocaine and now feel absolutely awful. Back to square one.  .  .Edit: thanks for the support everyone. Feels good to have somewhere to go to talk about these things

I relapsed last night too after 43 days. Urgh. Not feeling too clever about things but here we both are. Keep getting back up. That's the main thing! Let's fight the good fight x
But you're back on here so that's a good thing. I relapsed too last night. Hope you get to feeling better! I won't drink with you
Welcome back. What are you going to do differently this time?
Amazing how that happens.....I wrote something similar last week.  I have no idea exactly when it happened but at this point I'm not really safe drinking under any circumstances.  Excessive drinking will take place and likely some for of sketchy drugs and dangerous behavior.  It didn't used to be like that at least not that I can recall. 
Welcome back!
You are not back to square one you tripped up on the road but you're further down the road. Don't write off the success and experience you've already made. You might have have fallen off the bike but you haven't forgotten how to ride. Dust yourself down and get back on the bike.
