I'm mostly a lurker on Reddit and especially this group.  I've always enjoyed coming to this group to get perspective.  I was sober three years as of August 23rd but I relapsed on Friday. ..I deleted the group off of my main page a couple of months ago.  I don't know why I didn't see it as a warning sign but I just didn't think at all.  I'm not sure why I'm posting this if it's a warning not to get to prideful and to think you're above a relapse or if it's just cathartic...I just wanted to thank this group for being here even when I think I'm too big for my britches.

Welcome back
I was way too big for my britches for way to long!  It very nearly killed me!  Good to have you back!
Glad you made it back. Don't be a stranger!
Glad you made it back so soon. Welcome back...pull up a chair and hang for awhile. :-)
What were the circumstances surrounding you drinking alcohol again?

thank you for posting...
Welcome back!  ..Nobody is above a relapse. I was at a meeting on Saturday where a guy related how he dropped his guard after 12 years and went back at it. Pride and ego will bite you in the ass every time.  ..So tell us what do you plan to change? How will you prevent this from happening again?
how long from the first drink until it got bad enough you knew you had to stop again? just curious... it's not like i'm planning a timed slip or anything but i don't start because i know that... eventually i'm gonna have to stop.
