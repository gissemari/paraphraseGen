Finished my first two weeks today and it's really been great so far. Granted I'm in a private facility in Northern California that could easily be confused with a resort but the program itself has also been really rewarding and worthwhile. One thing that someone told me in AA a while back was that it's all the same stuff in a rehab facility (at least one that's based on the 12 steps.) I find that to be only marginally true. I've gone into much more depth here than I ever would have with the steps (in this particular facility you do the first 3 during a 28 day stay) and there's been lots of supplemental material about relapse prevention self-analysis and spiritual growth. Anyway just wanted to say that I'm really happy about the decision to come and would totally recommend it to anyone that has the opportunity and is on the fence. I've met lots of really interesting people of all ages and walks of life that I never would have otherwise and have learned something from each of them. I'll probably post again once I'm back home in a couple more weeks if anyone is interested. Peace!

Please do!  Enjoy your vacation it sounds kind of amazing actually!
Good on you! A nice "health spa" vacation could do a lot of us some good. I for one love N. Cali and am kinda jealous of your good fortune for getting to be in such a nice place. I hope you benefit greatly from your stay.
