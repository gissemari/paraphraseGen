I made it past a thousand days this week. My previous best was 15 days so I hope that offers some hope to people who are wondering if they can string some days together. I did and you can. I have wanted to drink so many times. I haven't had the experience of thinking I have this whole thing beat or feeling like I've had much in the way of sober life epiphanies. I can't remember the last real life conversation I had about my desire and struggle to stay sober which is why this sub matters so much to me. More than anything stories of relapse and regret have kept me sober. I recognized myself in a lot of  before  relapse stories so I was able to imagine I would share the same regret if I drank. I still get fierce cravings for alcohol but I also recognize that I just want to disconnect - and alcohol was always just my simplest quickest way to do that. Having said all that I also don't see myself as an eternal alcoholic who is always just that first drink away from relapse and collapse. After 1000 days I have a new lifestyle and mindset and alcohol simply isn't part of how I get through days now. I'm a creature of habit and being sober is now as much of a daily habit as getting drunk used to be. Thanks for reading and thanks to all past present and future members of this sub whose successes and  failures  provide so much help to so many people.

Yes I need hope to go on. Not easy but at least I see it is doable. When you hit 2000 I hope I am at 1000 or 1106.
