Hey folks. So I'm experiencing another hungover Sunday and it sucks as you know. I wrote a list to remind myself what's at stake when I pour that first drink. I'm only sharing because I thought it might help some people who are struggling like myself. Some of the reasons are more personal to my life but I think the ideas are applicable to other people. Anyway thanks for the continued support. For me I start my journey again...REASONS.. But first a reminder: you've had many sober nights in your life and many this year. I'm not going to pretend that this isn't going to be difficult but you can and will damn well do it...* Pop tastes better..* Right now you use alcohol to make the night more enjoyable/interesting but what happens when you take alcohol out of the equation? Do you not think something else will take its place?.* Productivity increases.* Anxiety plummets.* Take control of your future with a clear mind.* You're more introspective when you don't drink. By the very act of abstaining you start to think more critically about your life in general..* Hangovers can take a "fuck off pill  because I'm tired of popping Advils..* You'll have more ideas and thoughts because you're not hungover all the time.* Conversations will get better.* You won't be in a hurry to get home at the end of the day and if you are it'll probably be because you want to get some work done.* You'll be more passionate .* You care more about everything.* You'll get back to your exercise schedule.* You'll eat better.* You'll lose weight.* You'll have more energy.* You won't feel bad about snacking.* You won't feel bad about the night before in general .* Your compositions will be better.* Your marks will be better.* Meetings will be better.* You'll go to every class.* You'll go to bed at a consistent time - this point should not be taken lightly.* You'll wake up earlier - you're always complaining that there isn't enough time in the day.* You'll have more restful nights of sleep.* You'll smile more.* You'll feel better about yourself.* You'll be more confident.* You won't have to hide anything from anybody.*  Which means you'll probably open up more.* You'll save money..WAYS..* When and if you do drink don't hide it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing it with someone then it's not something that you truly want to do..* Get some pop or sparkling water. Cracking open a can of something is necessary..* Cravings will happen. Don't subscribe to the narrative that you'll be thinking about it all night so you might as well buy some booze so that you can get on with your work. Cravings come and go..* View abstaining from alcohol as something that's productive. If cravings are distracting you from work that's OK because you're still working on yourself on another level. Music should be what you focus on the most but personal growth is equally as important..* Read this list until the cravings go away.* Browse SD.* Pet your cat.* Deep breathes.* You got this...Edit: formatting.

Is this showing up for anyone? I think I may have been marked as spam :/ Probably should have chosen a different username.
"When and if you do drink don't hide it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing it with someone then it's not something that you truly want to do."..That's something I wish I'd told myself when I was first trying to quit. I hid my drinking from everone in my life. I almost never drank socially. Maybe shame would have been a bit of a deterrant if I had chosen to drink socially from time to time. I also feel bad for drinkenly neglecting my cat. He gets pet a lot more these days...I will not drink with you today!..
Thanks for this. I need to stop drinking
