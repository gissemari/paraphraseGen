Woot Woot Wednesday! Guess what day it is? YUP. I hope your hump day is shaping up to be less [like this](http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/233/6/c/Camel_Stock_by_chaoskomori.jpg) and more [like this](http://www.shefinds.com/files/2013/06/WED-HumpDay1.jpg)!..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: Ten months! 303 days! Wow! As the time is passing I'm checking off so many events and situations that have been "firsts" for me sober. This week was another and it just feels like I'm just [stacking up the wins](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/6029814528/h5B3EC7AC/). Frankly I thought I'd start to feel more blase about my sobriety as time passed but I'm still as ecstatic and proud and excited as I was on day 30. ..**Struggle**: Change is hard amirite? I'm coming to terms with the fact that it's also inevitable and I need to be better about welcoming it facilitating it and adapting to it. A lot can change in 10 months and a lot has. I'm going through some significant life changes right now and the desire to escape and just retreat into what's comfortable is very strong. I'm working to develop other coping mechanisms and tools to deal with the discomfort but there's a little part of me that still wants to whine "It's not the saaaammmmmee!"..**General Chat**: Can you believe it's almost June? Are any of you guys taking a summer vacation this year? Let's live vicariously through each other's trips and remember that /SD can be a great support when we're out of our regular routine and need to touch base with the soberverse. I know that I've personally checked in from the beach sand on my phone be damned! :)..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** 2 years of not drinking this past Monday!..**Struggle:** Sleep and getting back on track with my workouts continue to be a struggle for me. One of my dogs isn't well and has us up several times a night...**General Chat:** We're doing a big trip in December so no summer vacation plans but bring on the warm weather!!
Triumph: Tomorrow will be one week and I made good on my pledge yesterday...Struggles: Several big events coming up: A family member's memorial Bachelor Party My Birthday My sister's wedding (all of which are big drinking events). I will be needing every ounce of strength all in the next month not to break down. My biggest struggle is irritability and boredom.
Hi all.  Happy to be joining you here!  I love this place :). .**Triumph:** Slept the whole night through last night!  Ah blessed sleep.  I tossed and turned a while and thought about taking something to help get me through this phase but I decided I didn't need to swap one bad thing for another so I rode it out fell asleep and I feel good today...**Struggle:** Meeting a former co-worker at a bar tonight to get some info for a project I'm doing.  I will drink soda water with lime (my favorite bar-situation drink).   But still temptation will be there...**General Chat:** Well I'm new here so I guess I'll tell you a little about myself.  I am recently retired and I've fallen into the habit of getting drunk every afternoon and being hungover the next day.  I don't want to waste my free time any more.  I don't want it to sound like I just started doing this either as I have been a pretty heavy drinker most of my life.  It's just that the retirement has put me over the edge and made the problem that much bigger and more obvious.  So no more.  I have the rest of my life to live and all the time in the world now.  ..edit:formatting
**Triumph**: Finally planted a vegetable garden.  I've been planning on it/wanting to do it for years.  ..**Struggle**: Underemployed/underpaid at the moment and still struggling to find quality and fulfilling employment.  ..**General**: My baby brother just got out of jail for a drug-related offense.  He sounds healthy and clean and I really really hope he can keep himself out of trouble this time.  I miss him but I keep him completely at arm's length when he's using - which has been basically the last ten years.  So yeah.  I want my brother back.  
Triumph: getting in the habit of playing the tape forward to work through drinking urges which have been really strong lately. ..Challenge: Have a good attitude at work. Yes it's a dead-end job yes I want better. But I realized that having a shitty attitude about it isn't going to help. Soooooo working on that being grateful for the good points of what I'm doing right now (of which there are several). I feel like that's a maturity thing for me like I shouldn't have to play by the same rules as everyone else or do the same work that others do to achieve the things they want.  ..General chat: I bike commute a little over 6 miles each way to work and it's really fun for me to think that it adds up to around 3000 ish miles per year! When I first moved to my house which is further away I dreaded the commute. I figured it'd take me a long time and that I'd be exhausted every day. It takes about a half hour and is a really nice route. ..
What do we say when the desire to drink rears its ugly head? Not today. Have a wonderful day my friends!
**Triumph**: I told another family member about my decision to stop drinking and it went very well.  .**Struggle**: I can't seem to get my moods and attitude under control. When I brought it up with my therapist last time she thought it might be a side effect of me stopping drinking but it is hard for me to not just feel like there is something wrong with me.  .**General Chat**: I have a huge project to get through at work over the next two weeks but then I leave for a two week vacation. Two whole weeks of nothing but spending time with my husband wandering around and eating! I am really excited about a hangover free vacation. That would have been unimaginable to me prior to starting this process but now it just sounds amazing.
**Triumph:**I just passed 30 days with no alcohol.  I feel like I can maybe start working on other issues and habits without feeling too overwhelmed and setting myself up for failure.  I feel pretty solid in my commitment to not drinking...**Struggle:** I am moody.  Last night I was very off center.  I very nearly made some bad decisions but let the moment pass the IRC chat was helpful but still I hate feeling so unbalanced...**General Chat:** I have a two week trip in July to visit my family and friends.  I'm excited but I worry I'm going to stretch myself thin (I have family/friends in Detroit Cincinnati and Chicago) trying to see everyone.  Yet also I want the excuse of needing to see other people to get away from my immediate family because they don't lend themselves to self improvement or sobriety.  
Triumph: One week and I've started running again. It's pretty excited...Struggle: Resisting the urge to drink when I'm frustrated or angry...General: We're going on a camping trip soon and I'm very excited. We've been slowly putting together our camping trip. First one with the kidlet but I have a feeling he'll do ok! I just bought a tiny little kiddy pool for him to splash around in the water while we're getting our campsite set up and we have a canopy to put over our chairs and fire in the case of rain or so we have shade that is coming today.
**Triumph:** I've strung together 4 days without drinking and I'm really excited about that. I feel like I'm back in this! I've gone from telling people that my life is a mess to telling them I'm sober again. I'm starting to feel like a non-drinker and getting back to the place I was before I first drank 2 weeks ago. Also I'm finding myself more motivated to actually change myself because I know it's needed. Also I bought a bike!..**Struggle:** While that's good and all it's still a massive struggle almost everyday. I worry about weekends and upcoming events like I did when I first got sober. I need to be like mega vigilant these days but at least I know that. ..**General Chat:** I dunno! Everyone here is the best and I love you all so much &lt;3 I'd seriously be fucked without this place. 
**Triumph:** Got back on track started making some solid plans for the future (sobriety and otherwise) with ways to track my progress to encourage me along the way. I plan on returning to school in September! ..**Struggle:** Part of returning to school is doing assessments for various subjects including math. I forgot how terrible I am at math! It's been frustrating at times for me trying to re-learn all this stuff I never quite grasped when I was in high school but I'm not letting my emotions get the best of me and sticking it through with a good attitude. Does anyone know any resources to help with math for adults?..**General Chat:** Me and the girlfriend went to JYSK (an IKEA-like store) to shop for a couch yesterday and made it out still a couple...relationship milestone crossed.
**Triumph**: I haven't had a drink in over 60 days. That's the longest I've gone since I was probably 18. I'm not even close to ending it there...**Struggle**: Juggling my time and responsibilities. I'm pulling myself in a bunch of different directions and I love all of the directions but last week I got overwhelmed and fell apart. It's a struggle to keep myself calm and focused when I feel overwhelmed...**General Chat**: I was made a moderator of /r/SDrunners the new sub for those of us who were determined to pick up running as a substitute for alcohol! Please come check us out I got us some flair and I aspire to make that sub yet another inspiration for self-improvement. :)
Triumph: I am sticking to my workout routine and it feels wonderful to complete goals I've been wanting to for some time!..Struggle: Aside from my usual mood swings due to being a lady ;) There seems to be a bit more added to it since sobriety. Little things bother me more than they have in the past. I am trying to let it all just roll off of me. Second minor struggle can't make words bold. Life is hard. ..General: Two years ago I got a wonderful job with my state university teaching and I still have it! My anniversary just passed and I'm working in a master's program. I think alcohol suppressed my intelligence as I am excelling even in areas I used to struggle in. 
**Triumph:** Sobriety is feeling very normal lately. I feel like I've settled into a life that feels safe and comfortable. Maybe it won't always feel like this but it's nice right now. ..**Struggle:** Everything else in my life is actually a madhouse. I just moved from Chicago to Minneapolis this weekend only have my job for another month don't really know anyone don't know where anything is house full of boxes etc. ..**General chat:** Anyone have any great sober activities/groups/meetings to recommend in the Twin Cities? ..Happy Wednesday all!...
I won't drink today! Day 11!
**Triumph**: I'm trying to eat more fruits and vegetables and doing pretty well so far...**Struggle**: I had some paella made with wine on Monday and felt pretty out of sorts afterward but I'm trying not to let it get to me...**General Chat**: I'm thinking about going to Vietnam this fall! Anybody been?
**Triumph**: Two weeks sober and I've been running daily which helps keep my mind occupied...**Struggles**: My cousin drunk at the time had me do a beer run. He doesn't know I've been trying to stay sober and I certainly don't blame him for pawning the trip off on me but walking through the liquor aisle wasn't particularly easy...**General**: I've moved on from my ex (who broke up with me a month ago). Maybe not totally but as recently as two and a half weeks ago I was getting drunk and self-pitying every day. After two weeks of sobriety I feel a lot less sad about the whole situation and generally think about my future more than my past with her.
**Triumph**: 276 days :) Feeling more at peace with life and myself these days. Also just finished the last course of my 5 years study at law school. If my thesis goes over well with the tutors it means I will be graduating with a Master of Laws on June 20th :)..**Struggle**: So many things to deal with seem to have a harder and harder time communicating with people. I used to have bad social anxiety have to be mindful of my own feelings and behaviors and tend to what I need to. Sometimes my older decisions baffle me like having accepted to run a NPO for musicians becoming a lawyer etc. But I've been making good of it and trying not to let my preference for avoidance take over...**General Chat**: I regularly forget how great this sub is which is nice because then I often get to be pleasantly surprised! I love this place for support.
**Triumph:** Still not drinking and just starting day 10. Double digits baby!! Feeling good for the most part trying to stay in a positive mind set. Even if that means locking myself out of my miond for a few minutes of silent time. ..**Struggle:** Still getting the urge to follow habit of stopping on the way home. Stamina at the gym is way down so thats a work in progressever seen rock swim? Yeah that's me. ..**General Chat:** So far so good. This sub has really help me keep perspective on what I am going through and knowing that I am not alone. AA isn't readily available on my schedule here so this is my best bet so far. Did meet someone also in Japan last night in the IRC which was cool.
Triumph: the weather here has been perfect the past several days and I've been getting outside as much as I can. I threw my best game of disc golf ever today and I can say I'm starting to actually look like I know what I'm doing now it only took 5 years of practice. My savings account continues to grow at an astonishing rate and I should be able to afford a decent car pretty soon. It's nice to not have to choose between drinking and being able to own a car. The new dog has been here for a month now and were starting to get more comfortable with each other. She's calmed down a lot and I'm figuring out how to keep her happy. ..Struggle: I don't know there's not much. The only worry have right now is that I'm taking too big of steps into my sobriety. I've taken on a lot of responsibility since I quit and I don't want to loose that of I slip up but that's an issue that's good to have I think. Gives me some accountability. Other than that every day is awesome for me and I'm truly happy to be alive and sober. ..General chat: I've been playing to hell out of the new Witcher game. Anyone else into that's stuff? 
**Triumph** Um to be honest being sober feels like a triumph. I haven't been struggling with that it just feels awesome and amazing...**Struggle** I'm tired. Health issues continue to drag on. I'm not very productive a lot of the time...**General Chat** Feels like summer! .
