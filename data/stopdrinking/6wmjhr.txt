I am seriously struggling to not stop at the store on the way home from work. It's been a couple days of not drinking.

Stay strong! we are here with you. Take one day at a time. I will not drink with you today!
I know that feeling mate. My trigger is drink after work every day. The way I have been overcoming for the last few days. is trying to do something else. For example i changed the spark plugs in my car something I have never done before. Then took it for a thrash. 
I'm new here so my advice might not be the best. Is there something you can do after work to distract yourself? Just until the edge is off and you can continue home? Can you drive a different way home to avoid the regular store? You can do this. I'm day 3 and struggling more and more as the day goes on but at the moment repeating "I won't drink today" and "I never want to wake up feeling shame again" has been helping me 
It'll pass my friend. It's hard we all know. Dig in. ..I refuse to drink with you today. 
If you used to stop at one place on particular take a different way home. Also helps to get involved an activity or hobby to keep yourself busy and break your normal routines. You can do it!
