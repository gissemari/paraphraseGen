I'm living in a three quarter house and I get drug tested regularly. Pretty soon though I'll move out to live near a university and take classes there. I will be able to get away with drinking without immediate consequences...These past several days I've been feeling an increase in relapse thinking. I just really want to get drunk. It's not like it used to be where I'd feel the craving and know I wouldn't act on it. I'm thinking about drinking and I think "yes I am going to do that". Why wouldn't I? I love it. I love the effects of alcohol...I shared in an in house meeting about feeling like my program wasn't up to par and that I was having thoughts about relapse. Yesterday I called my sponsor I prayed the third and seventh step prayer and talked to a sober friend. I'm at the point where I still know to do the right thing: not drink and take positive action. But how long will I stay here?..I'm struggling with the higher power part of AA and my sponsor tells me that without a connection to one I will drink. I pray and ask for a connection but it just doesn't seem to work for me. I don't understand what one feels like. How do I know when I have one? Just when I'm in a good mood and I'm being spiritual?..This could all just be a reaction to me leaving the three quarters residence where I've been safe and secure for the past year. I could just be scared of being free to relapse...I don't know. I'm not drinking tonight and probably not tomorrow. But I feel the "insanity" creeping in -- that first drink that returns me to misery and despair. I don't want it for myself but then again it's looking pretty attractive right now.

I'm in the same boat as you: getting cravings and thinking about relapse "in the future" right now. I also had/have issues with the higher power part of AA. I'm agnostic not necessarily atheist but I've never had that spiritual side. I also had a sponsor who said that a higher power was the only way to stay clean. After a lot of attempts at the third &amp; seventh steps I stepped away from AA and my sponsor. I now manage my recovery through A) individual therapy B) once weekly IOP meetings C) Medication D) writing here and (most importantly) E) family...I don't know if a higher power is necessary for sobriety (not doubtful just uncertain). I think you'll find some people who are adamant that you need some sort of higher power while you'll find others who manage their sobriety successfully without one. I don't know you and it's ultimately up to you as you know yourself better than anyone else. With that said you need *something* in your recovery. Willpower alone doesn't work...Good luck with your sobriety congrats on the year and stay strong.
To me you are the one making yourself insane. Drinking will have immediate consequences. That looks like your mind's first trick. The progress through 397 days will take a physical mental and emotional battering should you take that first drink. The end result may kill you. I know that it will me; therefore I must not drink no matter the circumstances...Since I know that my own will does not suffice as I have admitted that I am powerless over alcohol there must be something greater than myself which allows me to keep living without drinking. I have my own conception of what that "power" is and you have yours. If you have not done so I would write that conception out on paper: a higher power. I turn my decisions over to the higher power when I'm actively practicing my recovery. Some days are better than others...It looks like you are also powerless over alcohol. Normal people don't  live in three quarter houses have relapse thinking or question their own sanity in regards to a drink. What can you rely upon other than something greater than yourself that is not you as clearly we will both send ourselves into oblivion?..If you still can't come to grips with the higher power concept there are other tools of recovery throughout this subreddit. I'm sure your house would have suggestions as well should you honestly explain in grave detail your situation.
