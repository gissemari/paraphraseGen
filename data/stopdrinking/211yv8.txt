Gotta say I relapsed.

It happens man. I sure as hell know. One lesson I've learned is don't let that be an excuse to drink again. Learn from your mistake and start the fight again immediately.
Sorry....put it behind you and start over.
What happened?
Can you identify any triggers that helped facilitate it?
It took a lot to confess it here. I would have probably just let it go removed/ignored my badge and returned to 'moderating' (which for me is even worse than regular drinking as I go all out when I actually do drink)...Good job on jumping right back onto the sober path. I fear I wouldn't have the strength to do that.
That's a good start. Keep it honest keep it in the day. Welcome back.
Back on the horse these things happen.  The important thing is to figure out what happened.  1) try not to relate smoking and drinking.  Cigarettes and beer don't come shrink wrapped together in a package.  2) I pass by a doughnut shop everything day but I don't stop.  If I did I might have to travel a different route.  Maybe you aren't ready to be going to bars...We're all here for you. 
Nicotine and alcohol are intimately connected. In spite of some advice to the contrary research shows it is easier to quit drinking if you quit smoking too. Glad you have the chance to come back; some don't make it. I had to protect myself from alcohol and make sure it was never within arm's reach thus no bars. Don't drink today!
