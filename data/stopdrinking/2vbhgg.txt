I began 78 days ago struggling to get through 24 hours without a drink. I had done a lot of tapering first though so I'd learned a lot more about how to pace myself and build up some willpower muscles when it came to saying no not yet not today. When I finished 30 days sober I felt like I wasn't done yet so I tacked on another 30 days and have since read a dozen books and guides and spent countless hours going through online forums and commentaries..When the 60 days was over though I still felt like 'what's next?' My original goal was to be a moderate drinker which I hoped was possible because I do have a fairly established history of moderate drinking. It's only been in the last 5 years that my drinking got out of control after a series of crises and most of my emotional work in the last 60 days was about dealing with those crises in therapy and in my life. I wanted to return to normal relationship with drinking but I've been worried that it's not possible..I didn't have an answer for myself so I kept abstaining until last night. I found myself worrying a lot about drinking again and going right back to square one and I didn't want to waste time worrying anymore than I want to waste my life drinking. I used the best practices model from Moderation Management to have a single drink. I ate a full meal drank some water and then measured out a single drink and sipped it slowly. My tolerance is way down so I felt a buzz for about 20 minutes. Then I felt kinda gross after. That's about all I have to report. It was a fun for a bit and then not. I recognized the magic moment at 20 minutes where I'd previously been prompted to have another drink to kick myself back 'up' again and thought 'aha there it is..." and then watched that feeling come and go..I feel some relief to be honest that it wasn't terribly magical frightening or compelling in any way. I made sure I wasn't in any position to keep drinking - I only had the single drink available - but I also didn't want to aside from the 20 minute hump and that made me happy. I can trust myself with this I think. If not I'll keep on abstaining permanently. But hopefully willpower is like a muscle and I can learn the tools and patterns of having a single drink and then hitting the stop button. The good people at MM are very firm to remind me that learning to abstain and learning to moderate are quite different and one doesn't teach you the other so I'm approaching this very cautiously..My plan is to abstain for another 7 days and then open the window to another single drink. I'm going to repeat that pattern for the foreseeable future and feel pretty optimistic about it..I just wanted to share this for people who wonder about abstaining forever and get scared off even trying or perhaps are tempted to try moderating when they really aren't ready. Moderation is not a free-for-all. Learning or re-learning to moderate may take me as much time and patience as not drinking. I still don't get to down a bottle because I feel bad. Moderate drinking stops at a light buzz and a couple of drinks over a few hours never more than a few times per week. If this is something you're considering please read about it plan for it and be prepared to go back to abstaining if you can't manage it. Abstaining and moderating use different skills and methods to manage alcohol and they seem to work for different types of people..Since accountability is a tool for both camps I'm posting here to report on my progress and commit to the next 7 days of abstaining.

Best of luck to you with whatever you decide. I tried and failed at moderation on a couple of occasions and quite frankly looking back at it it's a lot easier for me to not drink than to try to force myself to moderate.  ..I've mentioned this before but I've come to realize that what differentiates me from 'normal' drinkers is that 'normal' drinkers don't have to force themselves to moderate they just do it naturally. 
I really hope moderation works for you.  It sounds like a lot of frustrating work to me.  But I'm the guy that years ago decided that I'd drink my coffee black because one time a waitress refilled my cup before I was done.  I'd spent time figuring out the right amount of cream and sugar to add to my coffee... Then she pours more coffee into my cup.  How do I deal with putting the right mixture of cream in sugar in now?..So for me instead of the aggravation of figuring out the right ratios I just decided: no more cream; no more sugar.  Then I never had to deal with that dilemma again...Going through the process of learning how to drink moderately and putting all of these rules on myself would just be extremely frustrating to me.  And I'd worry about how I'd deal with that feeling of "1 (or 2 or 3) is not enough today!"..Good luck!  I hope it works out for you.  Just from pure laziness abstinence is easier to manage for me.
