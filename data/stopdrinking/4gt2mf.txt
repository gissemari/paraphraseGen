So today I'm happy to say I'm finally in double digits of sobriety - the longest (by far) that I've been sober for about 5/6 years (when I gave up drinking to try and get my life on track)...I'd been finding the first few days of my sobriety surprisingly easy. But in the last couple of days that changed. I'm constantly thinking about alcohol - literally every single second of every single day. Before when I was drinking I wouldn't think about it at all. I guess because I would just drink it and it wasn't something I needed to think about. Last night was hard. I hadn't slept much at all the night before because I was having nightmares about drinking again and that just set the course for the day. In the evening I went bowling with my friends and whilst we all weren't drinking there was a lot of booze around the place. I didn't ever really want to drink any of it but it just gave me that crashing realisation "this is my life now". I know the best advice to take is to be sober for 24 hours at a time but it's hard training my brain to think that way. Constantly thinking about drinking was making me sweat and giving me headaches and a dry mouth...I didn't drink though and today I feel better than I did yesterday. I want a month badge and then 2 then 100 days and so on and so forth. I'm determined but I'm definitely struggling. SD has started to become my rock and I just wanted to thank you all. Gonna go to an AA meeting tonight - the first time on my own and not with any friends - so I hope it's a good group of people...Thanks again

The best and least popular advice for early sobriety is dry people and dry places. In my experience it was much easier to stay sober without having alcohol all around me.
