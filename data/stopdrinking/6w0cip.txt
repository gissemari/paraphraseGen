A very very small group last night. Talked a bunch did a disassociation meditation. Pretty good. I was a bit in my head because of work. At the end I talked with the group leader. We wondered where everyone was. Asking about different people. Vacation. Childcare. Not sure. "Remember Dan? Long black hair? He od'd." So sad. Tragic. A young man lost his struggle. A reminder that I don't want to lose mine. Life is strong yet fragile. Addiction is powerful. Damn tough. The fight is worth it though. I want to win. And live...Be well sobernauts. I won't be drinking with you today!

Alcohol is a jealous mistress a cruel warden and an heartless executioner.  And to think I voluntarily walked up to the gates and said "hello!  Please let me in!"
I'm genuinely loving Refuge!
