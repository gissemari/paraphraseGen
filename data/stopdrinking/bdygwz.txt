I'm 6 days sober today which isn't much but we all have to start somewhere. I had my daughter 5 months ago. I didn't drink for the entire 41 weeks I was pregnant with her nor did I drink for the first 4 weeks post-partum as I was breastfeeding. But the instant my milk started to dry up I was back to drinking my usual 2 bottles a day. ..The past few months have been hell. But it was a hell that I created by myself. Last Thursday I just couldn't take it anymore. I looked in the mirror and I hardly recognized myself. My skin was all red dry and puffy. I felt like shit constantly having hot flashes. I just decided to not drink that day. And that's what I've done the past few days. I don't miss it. I'm so much happier calmer and obviously I have much more energy. I've lost 8 lbs and I've even started to exercise. I can't wait to see how much better I feel as the weeks progress!..I've been so scared to stop drinking wondering how I would live without my crutch. When in reality drinking was the one thing that was holding me back. I can't post this anywhere else because no one knows I was struggling that bad. But if you've taken the time to read this I thank you!

It is definitely scary. But life for me is better sober.
