First I want to thank everyone who gave me encouraging words yesterday after I relapsed. It was a really rough day for me and it helped so much to be able to come here for support. After spending all of yesterday in various stages of anxiety and full blown panic I can honestly say that today is better. I'm going to try to focus on moving forward instead of how close I came to destroying my life with alcohol in one ridiculous night. ..The positive side is that I didn't destroy my life. I didn't go to jail. I didn't do anything too terribly embarrassing. I can recover from this. However I was lucky. It wasn't because I had any control. I just got extremely lucky. I'm ready to get back on track. ..If there's one positive thing I can hold onto it's that I never have to do this again. I'm reading This Naked Mind and I can absolutely see that alcohol doesn't do any of the things I convince myself it will do for me. It literally has no up side. I almost got through all of April without a drink. I'm ready to jump off of this carousel and get on with the rest of my sober life. ..I will not drink with you today.
