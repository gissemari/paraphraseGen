I was sober 92 days and only had about 7 drinks last night during relapse. Is it possible that I could be withdrawing again? Its been 24 hours since last drink and I have mild anxiety along with fast heart beat.

Yes. 
There is a heading in the /r/stopdrinking wiki under "Alcohol Withdraw."  It references a phenomenon called ["Kindling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_%28sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal%29).  It basically states that every time you withdraw the withdraw symptoms get worse.  I know my story is anecdotal but I can attest to this being the truth for me as well.  The last few times I drank last summer were not big crazy blowouts like I had previously in my 20's.  Yet I still had worse and worse withdraw symptoms.  Fucking sucks... :(
You're probably just really hungover. I don't think physical dependency can be built up again after a half dozen drinks in one sitting. ..I would be shocked if it lasted more than a day or two. Eat well try to move around go for a walk stay extra hydrated take an Advil maybe have a small coffee. Get some rest. ..And take it as a strong reminder why you quit. Use it to reestablish determination to stay sober. A slip can lead to positive things if you use it as a learning experience and warning of things to come. Not that I recommend doing it just that now that it's happened dwelling on feelings of failure isn't going to help you. Refocusing on your goals will.
