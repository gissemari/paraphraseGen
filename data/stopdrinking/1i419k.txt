So many times I used to hide my empties in other people's dumpsters or trash cans. I just now right before posting this took all my soup cans and milk jugs and other recyclables out to the trash can.. .It is filled full of empty handles (I mean jugs) of all sorts of alcohol.. .God I wish to forget those days but it also means that someone in my neighborhood is struggling with what I went through.. .

Hopefully they find the help they need but keep going strong my friend.
I used to do the same thing.  I also used to hide full Bottles in their garden as well as I thought they would not be found.  They had 3 kids under the age of 8 and I fear to think what would have happened if they found them now.  I didn't care at the time though but I don't think they ever figured it out though.  Thankfully I can laugh at it now as you can!
