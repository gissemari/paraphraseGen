8 months in..I feel weirder about my sobriety than ever. It feels so normal to me now so a part of who I am. It doesn't have the kick it had in those early months. In a way getting sober is a bit like getting drunk at first. I mean the early stages of it. There WAS a drug like feeling to a different kind of mental state a cleaner one...And then that became normal. And I've had to deal with everything I avoided when I was drunk. Like what am I really doing with my life? That's the only really important question and then the hardest one to answer. It's also one you can avoid when you drink. You can lie to yourself and tell yourself you are truly happy just sitting in a chair alone with a beer. ..I'm looking back on all of it   the fact I travelled to New York Singapore Malaysia and the Philippines by myself and didn't relapse. The fact these trips would never have been possible when I was drinking. I would have told myself travel was a waste of time. And maybe I was right but I'm proud of myself for trying different experiences...But when I was first sober it was enough just to be sober or I hoped it would be. But the reality is life is harder than I ever imagined it to be. Every time I think I'm making a breakthrough I realise I've just broken down one wall to find there's an ever larger wall erected behind it. ..I live life with too many half measures. Because if there's one good thing about drinking it's that it throws you into the flames of life. It brings you together with people and pushes you to ACT. And that IS important and very hard sober. I don't want to live like a detached monk. A detached proud monk saying 'hey I'm sober and healthy.' I want to be in the thick of it all. And that's where it's really hard. And that's where actual life is. ACTUAL LIFE. Not just a simulation or relieving oneself from stress with as many products as possible...And there are so many ways to cut yourself off without drinking. Go to starbucks! Watch a movie! Watch game of thrones! Watch porn! Eat a snack! Eat a meal! Even FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS can be at least for me a mantra I use to detach myself and work in complete isolation. Often without REALLY following my dreams due to avoiding the right kind of skill building work. Essentially living the illusion that I'm truly trying whilst actually not doing the heavy lifting. A bit like going to the gym and doing a light jog on the treadmill...I don't have a lovely aspirational message. I can't say. Hey everyone! I'm doing great! I love my life. I see now how wonderful even the simple things are. It all seems hard and endless a lot of the time...But I'm glad I'm still here doing this. And I'm glad you are too...This too shall pass...EWOK..

Thanks for sharing that. Nice work on 8 months! I'm right behind you!
I know how you feel.  Alcohol can be great at pushing you into things but what its even better at is making you avoid dealing with the stuff you're already facing.  It's been hard for me to work through my non-alcohol issues but I am working through them and every time I want to take the easy way out I just remember I wouldn't be able to make any progress at all if I was still using alcohol to avoid stuff...I'm glad I'm sticking with it and I'm glad you are too.  Don't let the bastards grind you down.
