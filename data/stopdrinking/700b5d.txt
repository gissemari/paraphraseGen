Just finished reading this amazing book    by Augusten Borroughs.. ..It made me laugh nod my head so many times in agreement then cry (his relationship with pig head). ..I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was sat next to a best friend reading his words....That then meant I could hardly bear to read about his extremely painful relapse. So glad he once again pulled himself out of the abyss in the end.....Remarkable book I highly recommend. ..Butterfly   ..Edit: It does describe some graphic memories of childhood (sexual) abuse and drug addiction so be warned if you do read and/or this would be distressing to you.

What's the title of said book?
Thank you Butterfly for the recommendation!.Going to check it out!.Have a great day!
Wow! I read this when it first came out. Too bad it didn't stop my spiral. :( Glad you enjoyed it.
I've heard that was a great book.  I think I'll get it after I read Naked Mind and Allen Carr's Stop Drinking Now Again.
