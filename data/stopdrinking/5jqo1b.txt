Hi friends..Life is much better at 67 days sober! Sleep however continues to be a struggle. I've been up since 2am (probably due to nerves about going to CA with hubby tonight to see family) and I wrote a poem. It might be complete shit because I'm super tired and all over the place but I'm sharing anyways:..Anxious and wired...and yet so tired. Sober for 67 days just beginning to emerge from the haze. Scared. Bared. Stumbling towards the open light a mixture of joy and fright. You're free little lamb. Starting anew out of the dam...Keep your chin held high. Nurture yourself let yourself cry. The wounds of addiction will heal in time the life you create will be sublime. ..Show up for yourself and do not despair - you are a gem so precious and fair. Patient and tender no need to be rough. Always remember You Are Enough...I love and appreciate you all my sober friends. Happy holidays! I will not drink with you today. FTZ...
