PLEASE guys. I recently hit 5 months but feel like I've hit a bump in the road...My SO who has vowed to stay sober with me (he is a normie but claims he truly doesn't want to drink - he wants to support me and is super happy about the weight he has lost since quitting beer) drank two weeks ago and tried to hide it from me while reaking of beer and clearly drunk. I guess he didn't realize how easy it is for an alcoholic to notice someone is drunk and hiding it... Cuz come on we've all done that and every trick in the book to hide our drinking! We're the experts. Anyway he apologized profusely. It was so triggering though I almost drank. He said he would have blamed himself if I had relapsed but I told him it would be my own decision and I'd have no one to blame but myself. Were his actions that night a trigger? Oh hell yeah but it's MY responsibility to choose whether I take that drink or not. I actually bought a bottle the next day and kept it hidden in the trunk. But then I "told on myself" by telling him about it and he threw it in the dumpster. I think I may have chosen to relapse that night if he hadn't but I was also mad at him for making the choice for me by getting rid of it because then I felt like I wasn't making my own decision to not drink he made it for me...Anyway after this incident I told him that I don't expect him to stay sober for me. It was his own idea to do that with me in the first place. I said that it's his choice if he wants to start drinking again but that what I absolutely CAN'T handle is him doing it around me and trying to hide it. It felt like a betrayal. He knew how much it would trigger me to see him drunk but was just naive in thinking I wouldn't notice. In response he told me that he truly does still want to stay sober with me and that the reason he drank was because of a weak moment and wanting to take control of things because of how he was feeling so down that day for other reasons. So he is still planning on staying away from booze with me...Since that night my cravings have been worse than they've been in a very long time. It's so intense. I've tried everything to get past them. I'm still in a treatment program where I go in 3 times a week just for an hour or so to meet with a case manager and go to a couple group sessions. That keeps me accountable. And so does my fianc . I know how much it would break his heart if I were to relapse. This is the longest I've ever had sober. We are getting married in December and want to start trying for a baby soon after. I know that to reach these goals and raise a family I CANNOT go back to drinking...But it's so hard. I have every reason in the world not to drink. Yet the short-term desires are so hard to shake. God I want to feel drunk again. SOOOO badly.

The only thing that works for me is to tell myself I will wait until tomorrow to make the decison. When tomorrow comes I am over it. IWNDWYT
Why'd you relapse?
