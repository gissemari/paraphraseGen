The first few days I felt amazing. The last few have been a struggle with some depression and anxiety setting in. Getting through it. At least I can say I'm a half month sober!..Tonight I'm heading to my first yoga class in weeks - my new favorite type of "happy hour" :) ..Not drinking with you all today!

Yoga is on my list of things to try. My eight-year-old daughter says she loves it so I might try to find something we can both join...Today I'm not drinking with you!
Good work on getting to two weeks. I find yoga and exercise helps me a lot with depression &amp; anxiety I try to think of it like my medicine. Enjoy &amp; I am not drinking with you today :)
