Every day for the last three weeks I've thanked God for the blessings in my life...Being part of this community is a blessing. You're a huge source of positivity for me. I'm glad too be just a small part of your struggles and triumphs because all of you are a part of mine. Every post every thread every comment I read furthers my own insight into sobriety...From everyone on Day 1 to everyone on Day 100000 I give you my sincere thanks...I'm not going to drink today.
