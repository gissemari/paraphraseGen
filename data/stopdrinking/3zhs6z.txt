"To be godly yet creaturely is impossibly cruel."   .Tea has been helping my first 3 meetings (all today) have been great.   .I'm not big on religion but the fundamentals are amazing. I'm working on a sponsor but I'm back to work and have amazingly put out all the fires.   .To all you out there struggling YOU CAN DO THIS!   .I won't drink today with you!   ..I raise my tea to you!

Well done!!!!
4 days ago I rear ended a car and got a DWI. Things are so bleak right now. I have been sober saw a therapist today and going to AA tomorrow night...This shit is the worst. Best of luck to you. I'm right there with you.
Another mug of tea in the air. Cheers to making it through day 4!
I'm on day 4 as well but I am still on the fence about going to meetings (especially those with connections to religion). La Croix and green tea are my go-to beverages of choice and hibiscus tea in the evening. Your quote inspired me to give The Denial of Death a re-read since I was tipsy through half of the book. 
Our new ritual he brings me a cup of tea every night (he used to bring me a different kind of drink) as a Brit married to an American this is very special especially since it's a good cup of tea. 
Also Day 4 andbenjoying a cuppa! Congrats on your journey so far!
