I drink all week but even more on the weekends. My last drink was Thursday. I got through Friday knowing I was meeting friends at the gym this morning. I struggled all day today with not going to the liquor store. I made it through my toughest time of the day from 5-9pm tonight. I DID IT! It was so hard though. So so so hard. I'm nervous that I'm going to struggle all day tomorrow too.

Oh geez that downtime of the weekend is brutal! Way to much time to spend in my head weekdays are easier and have that structure to them best of luck! 
Line up snacks and NA drinks did those hours if you can. And if at all possible change up your routine. That is not discussed here very often but it has been *huge* for me. Now it's literally a pain in the ass to think about even buying wine because I have filled those hours with something I adore (and need) to do. ..You can do this! But I can almost see your white knuckles in your post    Having a plan helps so much.
