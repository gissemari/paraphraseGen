Hello All..This is my first post for I have literally just been introduced to this sub and couldnt be happier to be introduced.  I am now 37 days sober.  I would rather not start off with my past right away however lets just say I use to known as the "party guy" filled with "friends" I called my "blackout buddies".  I told myself I would be completely sober for 60 days just to ensure to myself that alcohol was a want and not a need in my life after I came to realization that I had a problem. ..So to what I am looking for suggestions on..the topic of traveling/backpacking in Europe for two weeks where it is practically based around party cities such as Barcelona Amsterdam and Dublin in party atmosphere hostels.  I planned this trip prior to my start to my alcoholic self-test and will be leaving for EU literally on the 61st day which for me means I completed my test of 60 days sober.  ..I am struggling with myself on if I should be completely sober for the trip or if I was to have some sangria in Spain or a real Guiness in Ireland would I be fine.  Its been an internal battle now and I would just like your opinions on the matter.  ..EDIT:  Just looking for opinions on my thought process - not what decision I should make.  Apologies on the wording.  Just wanted to clarify.  Thank you any suggestions or ideas

I mean you set a 60 day limit and you won't be breaking that.  But from what I've heard is if you have to set a limit for yourself you most likely have a problem.  I can not tell you how to live you life but for me I know if I have one drink it will lead to at some point many drinks and I really don't want to get blacked out drunk and regret stuff anymore.  So for me that means no more drinking.
Hi I'm in Italy on vacation right now. I'm at the point where I am ready to fully commit to sobriety and I'm a little older than the "backpacking through Europe" crowd so my situation is a little different from yours. But here's what I've done:..I found AA meetings online that I could attend (AA meetings are great for sober people traveling many people who don't attend regularly at home will find meetings when they are out of town.) I'm on this trip with my husband who knows about and supports my sobriety and we've discussed drinking and my sobriety prior to the trip and while being here. Just because I'm sober doesn't mean he needs to be but I can't put myself in situations that would endanger my sobriety and I need to feel comfortable bailing from anything that makes me uncomfortable. I'm checking in here regularly. I have a sober support network back home of people I can contact and talk to if need be...I don't know whether you would be "okay" drinking on your trip. That's not a question anybody else can answer for you. I mean I've had sangria in Spain and Guiness in Dublin - it's hardly the highlight of either location. They aren't even the culinary/taste highlights. (The Guiness brewery in Dublin actually just feels like being in a giant commercial for Guiness. It's not massively interesting. I'd give it a pass and go see the bog bodies at the national museum instead.) ..It's been a while since I've been to Barcelona but my memory of it was that the Spanish people there did not drink heavily. There is so much art and architecture to see there - as there is in Amsterdam - that many people actually *do* go there and stay sober...My own experience has been that periods of sobriety did absolutely nothing to "reset" my binge drinking tendencies and my tolerance was just about the same (so it still took me a lot of booze to get where I wanted to be.) I eventually found it more painful and difficult to control/moderate my drinking than it has been to just quit drinking completely...I guess one question you'll have to ask yourself is what happens if you *do* decide to drink and get blackout on one or more occasions? Do you have a way to get extra money if you lose your wallet or credit card? Are you going with your "blackout buddies"? What will they say if you decide to stop after one drink?..Whatever you decide please come back and let us know how it goes!..*edited to add that you should check out /r/SDIreland before you go and say hi to /u/rogermelly1! Also you should check out [Victoria's Way](http://www.victoriasway.eu/) it's pretty mental.
