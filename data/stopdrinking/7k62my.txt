This is the worst month for me. December is a miserable time. I had a grandfather die from alcoholism when I was a kid and an uncle end up in prison due to his drinking a few years ago. My baby cousin died 10 years ago and it forced my extended family to exile themselves and I stopped seeing my three cousins who I basically was raised alongside with as siblings...This week last year was one of the hardest ups and downs of my life. I finally got with this incredible woman who I loved more than anyone. I thought everything was fine but now I realize starting something through her cheating on her boyfriend was a huge mistake. She ended up not leaving him after all. I had never felt more mad at myself for being an accessory to cheating or broken from allowing myself to get so close to someone only to be ditched...I don't want to blame my recent behavior on this but I don't know what else could have stirred this. I was doing so well. I was sleeping and getting work done. My apartment had never been cleaner. Here I am now my chest hurts from chain smoking last night and drinking. I need to stop this. Nothing I am doing is good for me...But how do I do this? How do I stop myself from drinking and smoking not sleeping and general self destructive behavior. I feel so lost and helpless.

One step at a time - stop drinking first. The smoking part can come later because cold turkey from both can be a bit much. Once you've been sober for a while the nicotine cravings will be easier to tackle...As for the awful time that you're going through I bet you already know the hard truth. It's going to suck and you're going to feel like shit but drinking will make it so SO much worse. Meditate run swim keep yourself busy. I'm sorry that everything seems to be falling apart around you but if you keep YOURSELF together you'll be able to cope. It isn't easy but anything worth doing isn't easy. Start right this second. I won't drink with you today. 
Its good you at least recognize there is a problem with the alcohol. Many people treat alcohol like its more of a food than a drug and use it every day to "survive". ..Ive only been sober for a little while and I agree with the other commenter about how stopping both at the same time is difficult. Quitting drinking first is better than quitting smoking because chances at relapsing while drunk is much higher than being sober. ..Taking it one day at a time is the important part. Soon your "normal" will be when you are sober over being drunk all the time. ..I wish you luck on your journey I have faith in you...I will not drink with you tonight.
