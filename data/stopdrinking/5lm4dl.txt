I've never been a daily drinker but more often than not I tend to drink too much and I'm also on anti-depressants which will cause me to black out...On NYE I got off work and went to some friends for dinner but as I had work the next morning I couldn't stay long. I don't really remember how much I drank; a few glasses of red wine some champagne and a beer. What I can remember at least...Next thing I know I wake up in my bed when the alarm goes off. It's fairly amazing that I remembered to actually set the alarm but I really can't remember so it means I managed to take a bus get off at the right stop and walk 15 minutes home...I've had black outs before and also spent entire evenings getting drunk at home for no real reason other than to just get drunk. Two years ago I spent most of my vacation drunk at home and I went to different stores so I wouldn't have to deal with the shame I felt when I thought the cashiers recognized me...Last year I didn't drink for four months then slowly started drinking again and was able to handle it - except for a few relapses. But I feel that it's time to stop again this time I've decided to go for at least three months...I don't think it's gonna be a problem because I've told my closest friends and they've been supportive before and know what I've gone through. I don't know if I'll be very active here I just wanted to let you know that I'll be reading.
