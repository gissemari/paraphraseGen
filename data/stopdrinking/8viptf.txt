I just wanted to take the time to thank each and every one of you. This is the best and most supportive community I have ever been apart of. I have posted a few times in the last couple of days regarding my current struggles and hoping to receive the advice and encouragement I needed.......SD came through big time! You guys messaged me and commented me and it was exactly the responses I needed to hear. It's always amazing to me how relatable we all are and how some of the things we deal with are so similar. It's just an unbelievable asset...Anybody who is just starting out keep coming back here. It is a life saver and as I approach 6 months I can honestly say I wouldn't have been able to do it without SD. THANK YOU and I will not drink with you today.
