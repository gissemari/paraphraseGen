I'm happy to have 60 days today but its been really difficult especially this weekend. I was at the beach with a group that was drinking a lot and I wanted one really bad. It took everything i had not to accept a drink. Also tonight I ran into some people I knew that were outside a bar on my way home. They invited me in for a drink and I wanted to go in and catch up. I said no but now I have FOMO and wish i could be normal and have a drink and be fine. I know I made the right decision not to have a drink tonight but part of me wished I did and im feeling like im missing out on a lot :(

I mean you are missing out. Missing out on tomorrow's hangover the resulting shame the shitty feelings any loss of appetite.   ..Nice choice. I know it's hard but you're only thinking of the good things. Hanging out.catching up. Having a drink or two. You wouldn't be here if that's ALL your drinking brought you so what about *those* things? By not drinking you're missing out on those things too.
Congratulations on 60 days!! I know the FOMO's are tough but when you say that you know you made the right decision that's powerful. You know that it was your alcoholic brain that wanted to do those things. You should be very proud of yourself...I'm proud of you and so happy for your beautiful 2 in your star ;).
I've been making coffee dates with people so that I don't feel the FOMO. Not sure if that's an option for you but it's helping me to not be a total hermit. It's a really big change though &amp; I just wanted to acknowledge that. What you are doing is a big challenge and it's not easy. Good job hanging in there! .
