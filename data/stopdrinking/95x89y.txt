Today I'm so anxious. It's been escalating now as I enter my third day. I also quit smoking too. Who knows maybe a bad idea? ..Between work (mind you which is sooooo overwhelming and no staffing) and this I could blow up at any moment! ..Deep breaths here. ..I've always struggled with anxiety but often have a crutch. Now none.

Congrats on Day 3!..Day 3-4 are notoriously horrible as detox is in full swing by that point and it's when any physical withdrawal symptoms can peak - anxiety being one of those withdrawal symptoms!..Kudos for stopping smoking too - getting rid of both at the same time is really hard but it'll be so worth the initial temporary discomfort......Keep up the good work and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I've also struggled with anxiety. After I quit it did get worse for awhile but once I got over the initial week or so it got so much better. I still have anxiety but it's way more manageable on a day to day basis than it was when I was drinking. Actually all my problems are! Hang in there!!!
It's work coming up with new tools for anxiety but you can rebuild your toolbox. I started building a new toolbox in the months before I quit drinking and I threw myself into those as enthusiastically as I used to throw myself into wine. Some stuck some didn't. Books helped a lot. Meditation was intolerable at first (everything I've ever done has been to escape my brain and now you want me to hang out there without doing anything else?) but I found out there's other kinds of meditation where you talk and chant and move around and stuff. Now it's a little less scary to sit with my own thoughts. I used to think my favorite way to experience the outdoors was by getting drunk on patios but I found out being outdoors is really soothing and I really enjoy bird watching.
