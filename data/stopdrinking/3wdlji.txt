I had a really bad day. I took the mother of my child to court over transportation issues and was shot down by the judge had to wait 2 hours for a train to get to work and then had a busy crappy day at work. I've had a lot on my plate lately with bills job interviews my daughter and my IOP (intensive outpatient therapy couldn't recommend it enough). Living with my girlfriend who is constantly worried about me (it's gotten better I know she just cares about me) I've had next to zero alone time that I've been needing...I actually didn't have any direct cravings but a couple thoughts entered my mind and I was able to roll the tape back and realize where that road would go if I drank. I actually stopped at a bar near the train station for lunch and sat at the bar and ate. I looked at the liquor bottles and still no cravings. (Don't recommend others doing this I'm just aware of where I am in recovery now so I knew it was safe)...The only thing I felt was this craving to do something devious. In group I've learned this could be pre-lapsing behavior so being aware of that helped me not entertain those thoughts...I've gotta say being in IOP really helped me recognize the early warning signs to a relapse and it gave me coping mechanisms that I actually use. I white knuckled it for 4 months at the beginning of the year but really never saw my relapse coming it was already there and before I knew it I was back in the hospital...I know people swear by AA and it's not for me but I wholeheartedly recommend seeking some sort of structured help instead of trying to just do it on your own. We really are all in this together and there are people that truly want to help you. Yesterday was a day I could've used as an excuse to drink but I didn't and I'm proud of myself. All of you should be proud of yourselves too. Don't be afraid to pat yourself on the back. You deserve it...While I'm craving some alone time I can't discount all the happiness I've gotten in sobriety through human connection. They say the opposite of addiction is human connection and boy have I found that to be true. I have a long way to go but I honestly feel better in sobriety now than I have in all of my adult life (I'm 32). Sobriety fuckin rocks!..Here's to 4 months!

It sounds like you're benefitting quite a lot from the tools you've been developing in recovery...I'm not an AA guy either but I've also learned a lot from structured and unstructured methods of recovery...Always love to see someone "rolling the tape back" :)
Better than pro-lapse....  That would be painful...I'll see myself out...
