Today is day one for a festival I'm performing at that centers around booze. I'm less than a week sober and my friends are making a liquor run. I'm at the hotel reading your stories to remind myself that while I'm emotional and struggling today I can do this. I'll not drink with you today. One day at a time.

Sober On!..You're a brave person.
You have our support! It probably won't be easy (I'm really nervous about going to work at a bar tonight so I get it) but you're taking your first steps and I'm proud of you! I won't drink with you today I believe in you!
You got this!  
You might be in the middle of the show or have already finished but I want to let you know I am thinking of you. I will not drink with you today! Let us know how the performance goes. :)
You. Can. Do. This. 
When you wake up tomorrow you'll be so glad you stayed sober tonight. Ignore what others are doing and enjoy yourself. 
Cool!!! Good for you! I used to looooove being the sober one at dnb parties before I started drinking heavily. Made me so proud to be having just as much or more fun as everyone else but without having to drink to get there. I know the beginning was the toughest for me so wishing you lots of strength. Have a great time!!
Nice! Those early victories are the building blocks to continued success. Keep up the great work.
