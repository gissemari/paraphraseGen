Started a side job today. Basically greeting people and helping them onto and off the elevator. Well on one of these typical greetings i asked a random guy "hi how are you today?" he says something along the lines of "oh man im on the verge of getting myself a drink." this all would have sounded normal as its a pretty big event and i have to deal with drunk people all evening but  Something was off about how he said it made me ask him "do you mean alcohol?" he looked me dead in the eye and said "yeah man I've gone 28 years without a drink. i used to down a sixer every morning just to get me started." i told him; " i know the feeling trust me. I just started this a few months ago and sometimes its hard but dont do it. It wont help anything you may be going through. You have 28 years of nothing! Just dont. Youll be better off." right then the elevator stopped on his floor. I wished him luck and he walked out....About 15 mins later he gets back on the elevator with a coffee in hand. We just gave each other a smile and nod and he went on his way. It felt good to help a fellow alcoholic stay off the sauce. I hope he stayed away from it tonight. I did and i will not drink today.
