I'm reading Dry by Augusten Burroughs right now but ill be done with it soon.  Are there any books you'd recommend relating to the struggle of recovery?

I loved "Drinking: A Love Story" by Caroline Knapp.

Ann Lamott is a recovering alcoholic and a really good writer.
FYI: There's a list of recommended books in the sidebar.
