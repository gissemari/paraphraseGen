Yesterday I had my last hangover. This is Day 2. I've been struggling with alcohol abuse over 3 years now. Tried to quit many times. But I'm convinced this time it's for real. I'm not only doing it for myself but also for my kids family my job ... Day 2 and looking forward to al the future days. IWNDWYT

Same here. Day 2 for me. Yesterday was my last hangover too. Can't stand it anymore. Alcohol is the enemy. Keep it away from you. You can do this  
I quit for the same reasons 60 days ago. My life feels much better already... so keep with it. It gets easier. IWNDWYT
I'm on Day 2 too.  I recently relapsed after 67 days and reset my badge to stay accountable.  I can tell you from my own experience that being sober is so much better than the temporary buzz of alcohol.  I too am a mother so that is a huge motivating factor.  When sober my job performance is better my workouts are better but most of all my parenting is better.  I applaud your decision.  IWNDWYT.
Glad you're here! My last hangover was August 29. At least a few times a week I marvel at the fact that my body was made to feel this great naturally. I spent so many days sick with headaches nausea diarrhea and anxiety that I just assumed that was my body's normal state of being because it couldn't *possibly* be alcohol's fault...I am getting closer to 2 months sober and every day is better than the last. I will not drink with you today!
I'm on day two as well. Let's do this.
