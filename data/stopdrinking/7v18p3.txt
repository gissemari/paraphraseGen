I have felt amazing these last 40 days but the cravings are still intense especially on the weekends. I come and lurk on SD everyday. I gain inspiration and encouragement. I also can relate to the badge resets and struggles cause I've been there too many times...I won't drink with you all today!

Congratulations on your new PR Pinchy :D That's gr8! Keep it up bro! Something that has helped me tremendously with cravings in the past is to drink something sweet instead. A cup of chamomile tea with honey or a big ass soda will kill a craving. Alcohol cravings in the early days are really just sugar cravings. There's so much sugar in alcohol it's ridiculous! You wouldn't think there would be when you're drinking beer but there is! Good luck Pinchy! I hope you have a gr8 day m8 
Well done. The cravings come and go I find. It's about the the process of feeling better.  Stronger. Healthier. Clearer. You can do this.
Amen. Ditto. That is me...Everyone says they diminish...so I'm clinging to that!! ..And trying to remember all the obvious positives...      ..IWNDWYT 
SD really helps! My PR was set because of this place no question about it. The stories are so inspirational. Good job on the 40!
Congrats on 40 days!!!! Well done!
Twinsies.
Congratulations I'm right behind you. We had beautiful weather today and I kept thinking how 'nice' it would be to have some wine out on the patio. But I realized it turn into a big shitshow and I've come too far to have to start over again. We did awesome not giving into the cravings!
