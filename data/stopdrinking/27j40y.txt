I Think this might be the end for me (heading into actual words for stop drinking reddit people) or at least I'm writing it out here in this forum and after a year of reading and being with you people I feel like you're my people.. Dammit. I have spent the past seven years on a roller-coater of sobriety and drunkenness  . I've found bruises where they shouldn't have been; I've been through all of the "count the days ("58?") of not drinking" and the "oh my god I relapsed for a weekend but I'm back on track now". As far as I know I'm not gonna have some organs fail (I'm 44 years old but have sent flowers to a family friend who just died from drinking himself to death) and my blood tests have come back with a "you should change your diet to reverse this but you're pretty much okay". I don't trust them - I've been abusing my innards with booze for a long time ( at least ten years full on) and there's no way I can be okay; If I go for two months without drinking I'm sure it's good for my physical well-being but in the end I know I'm an alcoholic. I feel so in control right now but I know I'm not --- sometimes the confidence depends on what I have in the house available to me (it might be 6 beers left over from a party or it might be the bottom of a gin bottle that no one will notice if it's a little bit lower in the morning if I grab a quick shot). BUT even that is not reason enough. Just writing this makes me feel in control; I have a HUGE bottle of water next to me right now (as I'm hammered)  as well as a huge bottle of Whiskey that I will not touch. I'm not gonna be stupid tonight but I will be drunk enough to sleep --- drunk enough to fall asleep and start a new day but not sober. dammit. I'll be drunk enough to not not care...The hardest thing is to get to a point where you're sick of the continued bullshit right? I quit drinking for two weeks and I rewarded myself with a simple purchase if a six-pack and a little pint of whiskey (classic idiot alcoholic). Here I am. I'm okay. I might just get fed up with life and go to bed and be a little hung-over and grumpy in the morning but what have I accomplished???!!!! Tomorrow will be all about me figuring out how to be a real human being (maybe eating good food and practicing good nutrition will push me over the edge?) as opposed to figuring out how not to drink. What kind of life is that?..Dammit I'm with all of you here doing the same thing --- there's no answer right? You just have to figure out how deep your love is. If it's deep enough maybe we'll get through this   do you love yourself enough? Are there other people who love you unconditionally? Do you love yourself?..All judgement aside I feel for each and every one of you who are going through what I'm going through right now; It fucking sucks. We have to stop. But it's harder than anything. And it makes me cry. All of you who are suffering like I am right now (I don't want to wake up with red skin and full of shakiness). Let's beat this bullshit. Right? Im gonna keep trying. Every day. You should too...Day 1 of a decade of Day 1s  .. never give up. Never.

This sub is filled with people who didn't think they had the strength they have. The strength in staying sober a day and making that your goal no matter what else is going on. I can't be reminded of this enough. Good luck JP; I hope I see you sober a day and then two and then three.
Welcome /u/JacquesPlaques -- again.  Make it a day that you decide not to drink; go to a recovery meeting or two TODAy and go to bed sober; tomorrow repeat.  No more difficult than that to get a successful Day 1.  Each of us silences the alkie-brain day by day doing precisely these sober actions.
