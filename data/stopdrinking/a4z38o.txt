I'm on my lunch break from work and I'm struggling so hard today. I'm sorely tempted to get a drink to ease the withdrawal symptoms but I'm sticking with my iced tea. Anxiety is through the roof and everything feels raw. I managed to rack up 6 weeks earlier this year and then I fell back into old habits. ..Here we go again. IWNDWYT

Hiya. Welcome back. Iwndwyt  
Let's just not take that first drink.  I'm with you you can do this thing.  IWNDWYT 
If you're having withdrawal you should probably be under medical guidance.  Seizures are not fun.
What's your plan for sobriety?
If you drink to put off withdrawal only one of two things happen: You deal with withdrawal someday anyway or you die without ever being sober. ..I found that realization helped me suffer through the first days.
