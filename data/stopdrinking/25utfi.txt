You can either stop before these occur or wait till after.  But I don't know of any way to stop unless you truly want to stop...Wanting to stop is the first step and it's a prerequisite to actually stopping....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|39|14|offtherocks|*Bought a bottle of vodka last night* by fuzzylasagna|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25di7r/bought_a_bottle_of_vodka_last_night/chg41ii)|.Way too close of a call. I have no idea why people are congratulating you that you didn't drink it was mostly luck. You will probably not be so lucky next time. ..Something is wrong. Find it and fix it.

I did all the things I tell newcomers: 1. I stopped drinking 24 hours at a time; 2. I went to lots and lots of AA meetings (bearing in mind that my sponsor said 90 meetings in 90 days) this allowed me to build a super strong network of friends in recovery; and 3. Each tomorrow I repeated.  ..Move the feet move the feet move the feet--don't over think this.  A year from now we will celebrate your anniversary and you too will have the relapse experience to share with other heartbroken newcomers.  ...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|37|6|swift_lippin|*Sitting outside the hospital about to go in.

Despite my best efforts my drinking started to hurt others; my family friends co-workers everybody despite my best efforts to ameliorate the harm...You know what?  Relax and enjoy the ride.  The road to hell is not only paved with good intentions but you'll meet some very interesting people along the way.  Just keep you eyes ears and mind open. ..The trick is to live to tell the story....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|24|0|girliesogroovyy|*"You know you're an alcoholic right?" (x-post r/alcoholism)* by risky_throwaway|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25l4zc/you_know_youre_an_alcoholic_right_xpost/chi9qg2)|.Hey I have totally been there. "High-functioning alcoholic" or so I thought - check kept a 4.0 throughout grad school while maintaining full-time employment and relationships with family and friends. Admitted I had a problem but sort of wanted to just ride it out and stay drinking - check. The thing is alcoholism is *progressive.* It only gets worse. All those things we kept up... can and will go. All those things I hadn't experienced (arrests OUIs jail time health stuff etc.) are all *yet*s...I had to get real desperate and hopeless in my drinking before I could finally and fully realize that I needed to stop. I used to hold out hope that I could one day moderate. For alcoholics that is impossible. I thought I wanted to just stay drinking every night and that would be all well and good. Inside I was crippled. Eventually my outsides matched as well. It always gets worse never better...You don't have to reach a horrible bottom to stop drinking. If I had known then what I know now about alcoholism I might have recognized the signs and been able to stop. Alcoholism is when you have one drink and with that first drink the rest become uncontrollable... but you can't help but take that first drink anyway. (my paraphrase is a horrible definition just trying to convey what I have learned)..Check out /r/stopdrinking tons of info here on the sidebar comment history etc. AA helped me immensely. It was mind-blowing to realize that there were other people who had my problem and they were not only staying sober but being *happy* doing so....  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|22|1|Nika65|*Yesterday was the rock bottom time to get my act together* by butchknockov|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25g83r/yesterday_was_the_rock_bottom_time_to_get_my_act/chguk3e)|.Welcome.  I am a lawyer and you just described much of my past life...If you are anything like me it does not get better and there is no such thing as "toning it down."  I won't lecture you but I will tell you that I was in a very similar position as you.  I kept thinking I needed to get a handle on it but the thought of 100% complete quitting and admitting I was an alcoholic was something I could just never do.  That is of course until I got to the point of becoming so depressed over my behavior lies and risks that I just wanted to kill myself.  My wife finally made me go to an inpatient facility to detox and it was the first step to completely changing and saving my life...Most states have a very good and active lawyers assistance program.  I volunteer for mine.  I strongly suggest to you that you look into your state's program and speak with someone there.  Be completely honest.  Your license to practice law is nothing to mess around with and based on your post you absolutely are risking it.  Good luck my friend!...  ..  ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|21|0|captaineddie|*[update] day 5 - full blown DT last night I watched a swat team outside my apartment for two hours.

Your fiance should have taken you last night honestly. The reason I was hospitalized when I had DTs is that it progressed to full status epilepticus and I had to be completely sedated and intubated. ..Even with treatment DTs of that level have a 5-15% mortality rate. Screw the money dude - this can kill you. If you can't drive call an ambulance.
