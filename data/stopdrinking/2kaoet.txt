Threw away my 100+ days of sobriety for a few nights of getting wasted.  Was it worth it?  Absolutely not!  The positive aspect from this is unlike my previous relapses I am stopping after a few nights and moving on.  Thankfully no one got hurt and I was trying to be "responsible" and did most of it at home so no drunk driving was involved.

You did not "throw away" that time. You have 100+ days of sobriety behind you minus a slip pick up where you left off and learn from the experience. You are not starting from scratch no matter what anyone tells you.
&gt; Thankfully no one got hurt and I was trying to be "responsible" and did most of it at home so no drunk driving was involved...You got hurt.  Welcome back and I know I'm not going to drink TODAY!
Glad you made it back. I'm wondering what you are going to do differently so this is the last time you drink the poison.
Thanks everyone.  It has been 4 days so far and I feel great.  Absolutely no desire to drink.
