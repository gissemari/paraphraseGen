Back in the house where I did my worst drinking. So many triggers. Plus my wife was all in my ass about how disgusting our old place was after the tenants moved out. We want to get it ready to sell but those people lived like warthogs if that's not warthog libel. Long story short instead of doing anything regrettable  I stopped talked her down and talked myself down at the same time. It really makes me appreciate how much my sobriety is worth to me and what kind of struggles are still out there. Good luck Sobernauts.

Perfect opportunity to overwrite some bad memories with some good ones! ..I'm fully equipped to deal with and overcome my difficulties in sobriety whereas the smallest things brought me to my knees when I was actively practicing my disease. 
There's a saying in AA: First thought wrong.  It goes to heart of what you're doing at 146 days being a whole lot less reactionary.  Amazing isn't it.
What a wonderful thing to share! When we have some sobriety under our breath we can take a breath and do what we need to do. In this case communicate and share. Thank you!
