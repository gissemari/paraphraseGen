I started AA a few months ago and in the beginning I enjoyed it. I went to a lot of meetings and tried to really follow the program the best that I could even getting a sponsor. I relapsed a couple of times but stayed in the program and continued working it...In the last couple of weeks I tried to use the phone numbers that people gave me in the meetings when I was having a hard day and needed someone to talk to just like they encourage. Every time that I called someone the conversation would always just lead to them pushing me to go to meetings or pray. Eventually that was frustrating to me because I felt like everyone just tried to push the program on me...I was getting frustrated and eventually decided to call someone who I had made friends with beyond the meeting on a more personal level. I tried talking to this person to get some advice for things I had going on in my life but it was the same thing "go to meetings AA is the answer!"..I tried talking to my sponsor about my concerns but in the end he also always just tries to push me to meetings and I don't really feel like he cares about helping me his main goal is to work his 12th step and "be of service" AKA Push AA...I was supposed to meet up with someone later tonight for some big book study but after I got off the phone with my sponsor I felt even more sick of AA and turned off by it. ..I told the person I was supposed to meet that I am helping a friend move and I'm not sure I could make it in time and that we would reschedule another day. His response was "Do you want to stay sober? sobriety first don't worry about your friend he will be ok" then we went back and forth with him trying to push me to meet up no matter what. That also made me angry because again I felt like they were just trying to push the program on me. ..At this point I'm not sure what I am going to do. I like some parts of the program like learning about spirituality and I think its something that has been missing in my life. I enjoy hearing other people share there stories of how alcohol effected their life. I just cant stand the people constantly pushing AA. If I continue to go back I don't want to associate with people from the program. I feel like if I want to go once a week I should be able to without people constantly pushing me to go every day. If I go I want to just be the fly on the wall...What would you guys do if you were in my position?..**EDIT** After writing this thread and going through the comments I realized my problem is that I have made my own opinion and found what works for me and unfortunately that does not align 100% with the guides of the program. I'm feeling frustrated because people in the program don't understand and see what I see. I'm going to continue to hit up meetings at my convenience and also reach out to other resources. Thank You for everyone who helped me on this thread to realize this!..

Different meetings get new friends AND a new sponsor...

Man....its your program. Just don't drink. Get a new sponsor. Find different meetings. Start over. Just don't drink. Its your life your program your sobriety. I do suggest you work he steps with a sponsor but you can do it on your terms.
I am not into AA at all but a good friend of mine is and he's got 3 years under his belt.  It worked for him...Try not to get angry but look at it from their perspective.  Who is in AA?  People who it has worked for.  The people who it didn't work for or didn't like it are gone sober or not.  It's a lot like religious people who push their religion on you -- they really think they are trying to save you.  It may be frustrating to you but understand that their intentions are almost always genuine.
I'm sorry you're having such a frustrating experience with AA.  Have you looked into alternatives?  The FAQ in the sidebar mentions a few.  I personal have been going to SMART Recovery meetings.  They're not as ubiquitous as AA but they're growing in numbers and locations of meetings...I think the meetings are very much like AA meetings but without the spiritual nature.  Also nobody pushes SMART on you.  But at the same time nobody is going to offer you their phone number either.  I do recall an instance of an attendee mentioning that she was having a rough time and requested peoples' phone numbers.  And people were happy to give their number to her...Otherwise you could try a different meeting if there is one.  From what I've heard (I've only attended two different AA meeting locations over a few months and found this to be true) that different AA meetings differ greatly in makeup personality and general feel...Good luck!
Old AA adage =if you think everyone in AA likes you you haven't been to enough meetings.  Another is 'change you home group change your sponsor change your higher Power just don't change your clan date.'..I would suggest branching out and going to other meetings.  I picked my sponsor because we had similar interests and would talk about many other things besides AA...If you are in a small town with only one group it can be hard but try to get into the city where they have meetings all week end.
Wow. I feel your pain and confusion and I am very impressed that you are not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. ..First with the phone calls. If you are calling when you are crisis that is too late. These folks are responding to a stranger. You need to call before you are in crisis. That way they can have a little context. ..Second with your sponsor you don't feel like he is cares about helping you? What do you want from him? What have you asked for? I would suggest you be specific. "Sponsor I would like to work on Step 1 today. Where should I start?" "What suggestions can you offer that will help me today?" That sort of thing. ..Finally the reason that you are getting more annoyed now is that you are not drinking. Congratulations you are now capable of having a real honest to god feeling. And you know what you do not have to drink to make it go away. You do not have to do this perfectly. That is why we say "progress not perfection". ..When you first stop drinking you may not feel better right away but you will feel MORE! ..Keep trying. Reach out to connect with the people who have what you want. Get to the meetings early and stay late. Angle for an invite the coffee clatch after. Go to the business meetings and take on a service commitment. Reach out to other newcomers like yourself. ..**Stop being around AA get in AA.**..
It's funny with AA we are given this awesome spiritual solution and so our immediate reaction is to give it to other people. Of course most people don't know how to go about it. I think one of the big things I see in this post is you're looking to vent and no one in your circle notices that. I understand how you feel on that but this program is something that applies to all facets of life. So by that reasoning if I have a problem in my life and all of my solution to everything else is of a spiritual nature then prayer would make sense. A guy I know told me a few years in he thought he had things figured out. He was tuned in to the program he had a good relationship with his higher power and he was working with guys. However he kept having problems and he realized that he had taken 4 things in his life that were in his control and shouldn't involve his higher power. Those four things were money women family and his job. Guess what categories his issues fell into? It was always one of those 4. We come in to the program after just having the living fuck beat out of us and we say higher power it's all you take it all. Then once things settle were start to take things back and that's when shit comes up. I'm not saying if you will never have problems but that really put stuff into perspective for me. ..Where are you in the steps? Step never fails to make me feel better. What about service. Are you apart of a home group? When I felt my shittiest and didn't wanna be around AA a service commitment kept me right in the middle...My question is what's going on in your life that you need to get out? We're all here for you.
&gt;In the last couple of weeks I tried to use the phone numbers that people gave me in the meetings when I was having a hard day and needed someone to talk to just like they encourage...I think you should abandon this entire mentality of leaning on strangers for emotional support. Don't become an AA headcase who goes to meetings to vent about how his dog died or girlfriend dumped him. At 14 days sober you should already be feeling a lot physically and mentally healthier. You can start to move on in life. Whereas if you adopt the mindset of a fire-and-brimstone AA'er you'll be fearful and cautious in life always afraid of "relapse" or whatever and you'll be spending time in dreary basements with strangers who are emotionally brittle. ..I do go to AA by the way. I've met some great influences there. The funny thing is that those great influences were the people least invested in the program. They're successful people with very busy schedules and they only go to a meeting once a week if that. 
The thing that actually surprised me in AA was the fact that these people aren't therapists. I know this should be obvious but when I first started out I wanted the person on the other end of the phone to be my life therapist and it took me awhile to figure out that they're just a bunch of drunks like me. The reason they're in my life is to help me not to drink not to help me with relationships/finances/self-image issues. Those issues are the ones I deal with on my own or with an actual licensed counselor or friends not AA folks. The Steps are helping me deal with life as well...I go to meetings because on the days I go I'm not gonna drink. I go because I've committed to purchasing the coffee and toilet paper for my home group. I go because my sponsor is going to ask me how many meetings I've attended this week. I go because I need to hear others' stories of what they used to be like and what they're like now. I do not go so the people in the rooms can help me through my life problems...I've had to deal with unsolicited advice (one woman chastised me when I mentioned that my sponsor and I text daily but do not talk on the phone much. I politely told her my program is working for me thanks). I just try to remember that they're trying to help (mostly) and that I can smile and nod and take what I need and leave the rest.
In AA you take what you need and discard what you don't.  Yeah there are parts of meetings that are a drag but humility and patience are important virtues in sobriety.  I've been to some meetings where I felt worse coming out than I did going in.  Be up front with your sponsor about how you feel.  If that won't work you may need to find a different sponsor.  Try a different AA group.  I don't mean to sound preachy but you're early in the program.  It's a little early to chuck the whole works.  I had a period when I second-guessed why I was there.  I tried a different group learned some skills then came back to my old group.  I saw things in a different light.
So relevant it hurts: http://www.orange-papers.org/..My story in AA was very similar. Being given contradictory suggestions such that situations were impossible to resolve and then being told I was "thinking too hard" and needed to practise "THE programme not [my] programme"...Long story short don't take the first drink. If being a fly on the wall once a week works for you do it. There's nothing in the Large Book about having a sponsor. There's nothing in the book about going to meetings. Remember that. And most non-drinkers are more successful *apart* from the AA groups...But the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. So show up and do whatever you want. And if they push you into doing the whole AA dog and pony show remind them that you are responsible for your own recovery...Also do read the link above. I feel people do need to be made aware of the problems in AA and recognise that there are ways of staying sober apart from it.
I don't know what to say.  There are times when I feel like it's BS and people are jerks and not really *listening* but just spouting catchphrases or stock advice.  Usually when I'm feeling that way it's because something inside of me is off not because the people around me are...Remember AA is made up of human beings and we aren't perfect.  Try other meetings.  If you're in a big city there are probably some pretty happening young peoples' meetings around why don't you try some of those?
Give smart recovery a try. Don't give up on aa right away but I'm a big fan of smart so far.
You are your own manager don't blame anyone else. There are dozens of programs/strategies out there find your own. AA might be the key for a lot of persons but not for everyone. 
I'm glad you brought up your experience with this.  I've had similar things come up.  I go to a lot of meetings usually the same ones but if I change it up then go back I always get shit from people "oh where have you beeeeen?" It bugs me more than it should.  And I've had rough days and would call over 10 numbers with no one answering or calling back and if they did I'd get the same canned answer I knew I'd hear.  That behavior from people and my first sponsor led me to getting a new sponsor and finding people I think I can talk to.  I try to remind myself that the others in AA are spiritually sick too.  I'm happy with the few I do talk to now though.
Have you tried to work the steps?
yeah keep looking...I have hated AA through the years...But the only thing that keeps me off booze is hanging with other AA's and yeah some of them are total freaks; but I find someone who seems cool and I try to befriend..Been disappointed more than a few times..Esp since I'm a chick...I'm not trying to bone anyone that is for sure!.Hang in my friend the rad people are in there...just not as obvious!
As a long time AA member I have gone through periods where I 'hate AA.'  So what?..Recognize that this is not some crazy cult (well maybe we're crazy but whatever we're not a cult) and you will not be punished for your heresy...Just don't drink no matter what find a support system that works for you in good times and bad and let the people who like banging the AA drum do their thing...When the resentment dies down go to a meeting and let people know how you feel/felt.  ..If I were one of those people you tried to connect with and my advice/behavior had unintended consequences I would want to know...Thanks for posting.
AA might not be right for you.  People who do really well in AA (the kind of folks who answer the phone or become sponsors) are really into AA they see their sobriety as depending on it and want to help you by giving you what they have. They truly want to help you and this is the way they know works.  This is the most charitable way to read what you're feeling from them... Acc. to AA's own triennial study 26% of people don't stick with it for a year.  Of course this is not a bad statistic if you think about the wrecked population of folks who walk in the door.  But that doesn't mean that the other 74% are doomed to become assistant crack whores or die in fiery wrecks.  Many of us find other ways to get sober.  ..But for the folks who make AA work and who find their sobriety in AA they genuinely want to help you. I respect them deeply and owe them a great deal.

Im really getting interested in SMART
You are early in sobriety very young as a matter of fact. You have a lot of "shoulds" for someone who doesn't know anything about recovery yet. .."People in AA should do this and should do that"...High expectations of others leads to resentment which is what I see flowering in you. ..I'm as open-minded as they come. There are many things about AA which I don't like but it saved my life. I would never have been so presumptuous as to judge the people who were dragging me back from the brink when I was 14 days sober. But that was me. ..After reading this thread I feel surprisingly defensive of AA and frankly a little black and blue. I just don't believe so many people are the lousy representatives of AA which you describe. You seem rather demanding. Besides we're a bunch of recovering drunks just human beings with our own lives work businesses families and problems. ..Getting a counselor is a good idea. ..
I had a similar experience when I was first going to AA like my first week or so.  Guy came up to me (I didn't know him) after a meeting and told me he wanted to be my sponsor and bullied me into agreeing.  Within a few days he started telling me which meetings I could go to.  How to dress who I could hang out with... It REALLY bummed me out.  On AA on sobriety on recovery in general.  I struggled with it for a few days then I told him he wasn't right for me.  He got really pissed and told me I would relapse if I didn't do what he said. Minor meltdown "Overly Attached Sponsor". Bottom line dude was a psycho or something. Narcissist maybe?  Anyway once he was gone I found meetings I liked with people i liked and it got better. So the moral of the story is find new meetings new people.  Keep trying new meetings even after you've found a home group. You never know what you'll learn.  ..People tell you to go to a meeting because it helps.  Talking on the phone about AA isn't easy for everyone.  Many are afraid they will tell you the wrong thing and make it worse.  We're programmed to tell you to go to a meeting because that's the place you're least likely to relapse.  The idea is to get you out of the environment you're in and put you in a supportive group that has a better chance of helping you and keeping you from a relapse.  I don't believe they're trying to sell AA to you you're already there.  I think they're giving you the best advice they know to give.
I personally choose to look at it not as "pushing AA" but as sharing experience. And for an alcoholic like me I have literally tried every way to get sober I could imagine. I could only piece together a few days at a time on my own and yet somehow in this program I have been sober for almost 11 months. I lost the argument that I had the answer and started listening to what others had to say. At the risk of sounding harsh maybe these people are right if you are hearing it this much. Have you started to work the steps at all? I know that the steps are what most consider the "pushy" part but it's self-improvement and it's worth at least a shot in my opinion.
I can relate a lot to the situation you're in. There are a lot of things I like about AA and there are also things that drive me nuts. Your example about telling that person you were going to help someone move and their response being "do you want to be sober or not". I can't stand it when people pose that rhetorical question. Yes I get what you're saying but the reality is I have to help someone move (even though of course you were lying)...I think the thing to remember is that people infuse their own opinions and rules into their program. There isn't anything wrong with that. In fact it's what to an extent you should be doing. However when they take their own personal piece of recovery and jam it down someone else's throat then it becomes counterproductive. Worse yet I don't think people realize they are doing it. ..The bottom line is that your recovery is *your recovery* and you've got to figure out what works best for you. I don't have a sponsor because there are a lot of people out their with shitty advice. What I do have is close friends who are also in sobriety that I talk with and more importantly just have them listen to me. ..What I do is take from AA what I find beneficial which for me is largely the steps. I don't get wrapped up in a lot of the shit people just made up somewhere along the line like "you've got to call x amount of people a day" or " you've got to do 90 in 90". That arbitrary stuff just doesn't fly with me. ..
Get a new sponsor go to meetings *when you want to* and don't drink. Also I started reading the big book and it really turned me off from the program. I don't think you absolutely *need* to read the big book. Just my opinion
