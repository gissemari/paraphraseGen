I woke up this morning after struggling through a very hot night (even with the air conditioner on) feeling like I had a dreadful hangover.  I had a headache I was exhausted and I had my biggest cranky pants on... I felt like crap...Then I realised that this was the way I felt most days when I was drinking.. why would I do that to myself? Why why why?  I seem to be asking myself lots of questions in week.. what did I get out of drinking? Why dont I love myself enough to treat myself well? Why do I crave alcohol when it is so bad for me? Why cant I stop at one glass of wine? Why me? Why bother? Its Friday afternoon in the land down under.. its boiling hot and its almost beer o'clock.. but IWNDWYT...and I will check in tomorrow.

Oh man this is so true; only I did drink last night and I woke up in the heat and this relationship I have with the bottle is pushing the friendship today. Still asking myself the why why why as I chow down a bacon and egg roll for breakfast at 1pm. I'm proud of you for not drinking. I'm gonna join you in the not drinking fellow Aussie because aren't we expecting a weekend heatwave? Not the best of reasons to reset the badge but being hungover in the heat is the pits. Any reason to quit for good. 
Might sound stupidly obvious... but I believe the answers to a lot of your questions is... because you're an alcoholic. Please note I am not attempting to label you an alcoholic if you haven't had that realization yet or don't believe it to be true. My point is that this is what alcoholics do. ..Those questions drove me to a lot of sadness and pain (and still can) like... Why don't I love myself enough to treat myself well? It's a really difficult and challenging question. Even worse the answer can be completely terrifying. In my own sobriety I've found it easier to focus on the 'what' of things rather than the 'why' of things - at least at first.  ..Instead of trying to reconcile this problem about not loving myself enough to take care of myself - I think it's easier to focus on what can be done about it. Action in my opinion is the way out. The thinking piece the part where you figure out why you were hurting yourself comes later - after you change the harmful behavior...I hope that what I've written gives you something to think about and is helpful. I won't drink with you today.
