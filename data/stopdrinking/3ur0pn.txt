So I made my first sober trip back home sitting on two months clean.  I have known for sometime that I need to end a long distance relationship with a woman that I love more than anyone.  So when it came time I just started slamming vodka.  Ended up hospitalized 2 days later.  Missed thanksgiving dinner missed precious time I should have spent with my kids.  We mutually agreed that neither of us want our relationship to be "done" but neither of us are in a position to have a healthy relationship (she's not an addict but has been having trouble with housing work shelters).  So I fly home today take a long bus ride home and now just feel about as sad as I've ever been.  But I did survive and sobered up but not completely detoxed.  We had the talk and love just isn't enough to fix everything.  So now I'm stuck in bed terrified at the possibility that it's completely over between us.  Terrified that I'm not anywhere near where I want to be.  Not physically financially emotionally.  I don't know how to be sad.  Even though I know I have every right to.  I've always turned emotional problems into addiction problems so dealing with real sober issues is proving harder than I've ever imagined.  I'm not sure the point I'm trying to make here but I know I'm in pain.

I empathize. My heart was broken early in sobriety. A therapist and AA gave me the coping tools I needed. 
Life can suck sometimes I totally get that. You don't have to make a point you can just vent. There is no particular way you have to feel or behave just take small steps in the right direction it will eventually lead to where you wish to be. Keep coming back here us nutters have been there one way or the other. .
