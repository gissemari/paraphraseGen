I had to reset my badge today. I wish I could say I didn't drink at all for the last 73 days but that isn't true. I drank on halloween and three other occasions never had more than 3 drinks and I didn't feel compelled to drink more or more frequently at all. I didn't count them as relapses don't really know why I guess they just didn't feel like a relapse...Last night I drank a lot and as with most of my relapses nothing explicitly bad happened but this time it felt different. I felt compelled to do shots and was hassling people to do them with me I didn't want to go home I spent a fuck ton of money and this morning I woke up with the usual anxiety and mild hangover. It was definitely a relapse. ..I'm disappointed in myself because in the last 73 days despite a few drinks I had made a lot of progress and I'm terrified of backsliding. It's a lot harder for me to be sober in New York than it is when I'm home but I'm here until late December with intentions to live here permanently in the future. Maybe if I intended to live in my hometown I COULD be a normal drinker but in New York it's all or nothing. ..Thanks to this sub I at least don't feel so alone in my efforts when all my friends are out getting wasted. Happy early Thanksgiving to all you in the US!

I went down that path many times. I found it's just simpler to not have any drinks ever so I don't have to worry about relapses and moderation and whatnot...I'm glad you're posting here though. I'll join you in not drinking today!
