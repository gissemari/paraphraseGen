I don't really know how to explain this so let me start at the beginning. From as far back I could remember I've had a fear of the full moon I don't know why but it makes me extremely thirsty for alcohol and usually I wouldn't be able to ignore it no matter how hard I tried. I always ended up drinking long before I even got anywhere close to a year of abstinence. This time it's different. I'm past the one year mark and I actually want to stay in the triple digits of sobriety. I still heard the calling loud and clear I was fearful at first but then I heard the voice in my head say "just don't drink. It's going to be okay."; that almost never happens but this time it did and I'm thankful. I just shared this because we all share the same moon and I'm sure others besides me are feeling that gravitational pull towards a drink. I've been in and out of sobriety since 2007 and every time there's been a full moon I have completely lost my grip but I learned from it otherwise I'd be out planning an extended bender right now instead of on here sharing. I must admit that the past few weeks haven't been easy on me but at least I'm sober. That's all that really matters. I hope my sharing this with you all will help someone struggling to stay on the wagon. I'm with you. We'll make it. Just don't drink. Peace and good vibes.

Hang in there you crazy fucking werewolf!
Was yesterday a full moon?  It was a hard fucking day for me.
*Sing to Michael Jackson's "Thriller"*..It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking.In the dark..Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops.Your heart..You try to scream but terror takes the sound before.You make it..You start to freeze as horror looks you right between.The eyes..You're paralyzed..'Cause this is MILLER MILLER LITE..And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to.Strike..You know it's MILLER MILLER LITE..You're fighting for your life inside a killer..No MILLER MILLER TONIGHT!
Ooooh I like this post. As you can see from my username I have a thing for wolves and I also considered using the moon as my higher power in AA... ended up going with gravity which is related but encompasses more and is always present. It's crazy what gravity does - it keeps the moon orbiting around the earth which reflects light from the sun to keep the night lit up and changes the tides and keeps us glued to the earth so that we can do nothing but watch in wonder as these changes take place. I don't know what the point of me saying all that is other than I think it's pretty neat. There are forces bigger than me at work and I can get drunk and close myself off to them or I can stay sober and watch in wonder. Today I choose the latter.
