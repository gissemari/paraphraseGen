I drank after my classes ended from Christmas to a couple days ago. Nowhere near the amount I used to drink but enough to bring me back in a pit of despair. My husband drank too. We enabled once again. My classes start today. I feel like I don't want to live but not suicidal. My husband is gone til Friday and I'm very lonely. I am not beating myself up about relapse like I used to but my depression is getting too real and it's scary. I know this is an on/off disease. Need help.

It's thought but good on you for getting back into the ring!   IWNDWYT. 
You can do this. I'm back again after attempting moderation after a year sober. Hate the first few days but I need to stop the crippling anxiety and depression that has been brewing in me since I started drinking again 
Welcome back. I understand that feeling. So much self loathing. Depression. Anxiety.  I wouldn't say its an on/off disease. It's always on. It may be just below the surface for a time but given the chance one moment of weakness it comes raging back.  Then the cycle begins again. The only solution is to not play the game (you like my war games nod :-).  Hang in there. Be kind to yourself. ....
