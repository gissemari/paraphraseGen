I met this guy over a year ago in a detox centre we both came off alcohol together. He went home and got straight back on the drink and I went into rehab then managed to stay sober for a while. We kept in touch all the way through with letters and phone calls. I eventually went to see him in late January and I relapsed. We drank together which deep down I knew was gonna happen. We got together and fell into that quick stupid love. There was a period where we were extremely happy together and not because of the booze. We decided to sort out lives out he would stay with me and come off the drink...unfortunately it didn't happen. We just drank more and more. Typical for a pair of addicts. I got quite bad after about 7 months and I referred him and myself to the local Drug and Alcohol services. He refused to come with me. He started to look yellow and very ill so I took him to the hospital and they admitted him straight away. I went home. Found out the whole time he was there he was going out and buying booze from a local shop. He then discharged himself and ended up taking a heroin overdose. He used to be an addict 15 years ago! He came back to mine and we got into a fight about why he would take heroin after all this time. It ended up with him strangling me then kneeing me in the ribs and I had to call police. I haven't seen him since. He just disappeared got calls from his family asking if I'd heard from him. I collect playing cards and about 3 weeks ago he sent me the Queen of Diamonds in the post! I just got a call from his sister saying he's just been found dead in his flat. I'm so confused what to think. To top it off I'm in hospital right now because of my liver.

I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It sounds similar to my story in a lot of ways. I hope your liver is better soon.
