I'm almost a month sober now. I find myself getting angrier and more frustrated. I was playing video games on my day off when I would normally be drinking and I just put a hole in my drywall over a game. I'm so mad at myself right now it's so stupid to get this mad over a game and everything just keeps getting me mad. Does anyone else struggle with this? I'm normally a very passive person...

Early recovery is an emotional roller coaster. Your brain is feeling raw emotions that used to be numbed out with booze. What you're experiencing is perfectly normal. It's all part of the healing process. Therapy exercise meditation and meetings have helped stabilize my mood in recovery.
Yes the same I'm getting angrier and angrier. Last Saturday I destroyed the cupboard door out of frustration and anger. Unfortunately I cannot suggest a way out of this since I don't know what to do. I'm normally also quite passive and absolutely not used to this anger so I don't know how to handle it. 
Sure it makes sense...Anger is my self-manufactured drug.  More powerful than alcohol...What helped me was the acceptance that I was allowing myself to choose anger...Whoa...Nothing and no one can  make  me angry...All along I've been *deciding* to be angry...Once I recognized that it was then in my power to choose or not choose to be angry...Whadda ya think?
I encourage you to give meditation a shot. .There's a great app called Insight Timer. It's very helpful for early recovery. .Meetings and a sponsor really helped me..My therapist was a godsend too..IWNDWYT.
