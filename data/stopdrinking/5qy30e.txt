Did ok for 24 days and had an irresistible craving on day 25 and downed almost 7 glasses of gin and soda at Applebee's last nite. This has happened in the past after about 4 weeks of being sober. I drank only a couple of days in January though so I'm gonna start all over again and put my soberness to test yet again! Wish me luck!!

As I plummeted  towards my bottom the amount of time I could stay quit declined dramatically.
I think we have to EXPECT that there will be times where our alcoholic brain screams begs and will try anything in its power to convince us that we should drink.  We've lived through the results of that enough times that we really should know better.  I hope I do the next time I'm faced with it.  I hope you do too.
