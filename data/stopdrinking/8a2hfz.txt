Got my heart broken again. I feel shattered. I found out the man I love is getting married in a few months. I feel like this is so petty. I'm in shock. I cried a little but now I am a robot. I have a therapy session in a few minutes. I'll try not to drink with you guys today.

Oh geez you poor thing.  Hang in there.  Drinking will solve nothing.  In fact it will make things worse.  Deal with your feelings sober and move on.  IWNDWYT
Sorry to hear...Hang in there!..Alcohol only worsens everything.
I won't drink with you today.  You're worthy of the good life.  
Be transparent with your therapist. All this will heal and doesn't need to be a reason to drink (drinking won't change the circumstances.)..You're surrounded with support here. Even the lurkers are with you...Will not drink today with you.
Oh sorry to hear that. Hang in there! Alcohol only will make things worse. If you accept the feelings you have right now you will only come out stronger...Many hugs!
I'm so sorry.  Heartbreak sucks but a drink won't fix it.  You've got a whole week under your belt.  Congratulations on that big success. IWNDWYT

Trust me drinking will make it worse. Not to mention if you do drink you run the risk of drunk texting which is always a no. I am so sorry for your heartbreak IWNDWYT. 
Good news is that you found out what an asshat he really is.  Now get in there  get help and your sober SO waits you in the future.  I know it is tough and it sucks  but you are so much stronger than you know.  You are getting help and you came here I think you win.  IWNDWYT
