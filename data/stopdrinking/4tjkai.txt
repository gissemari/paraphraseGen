Greetings! It is a beautiful morning here on the south west coast of England UK. What makes it even better is that today I celebrate six weeks sobriety. To say I am delighted is an understatement. I absolutely could not have regained my sober mindset had I not discovered this SD sub and all you super ladies and gents who belong to this community. Your posts support and shared experiences have been invaluable in helping me to get back to sobriety one day at a time. As some of you may know I relapsed after five years sober living and it has taken me just over eighteen months to get it back. It feels good. To those of you still struggling to stop and stay sober please don't give up. Here on SD we are all with you. Once again many thanks for your continued support. I join you all in not drinking today and wish you a great sober Tuesday.
