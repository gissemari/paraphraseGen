I am glad we are in this together! I actually put a couple cans of an alcoholic beverage in my grocery cart today. Then I turned around and put them back on the shelf. So thankful. I know I wouldn't  even enjoy them. If anything I would feel bloated and gross!. I do not need or want to drink poison :)
Thank you
I failed
