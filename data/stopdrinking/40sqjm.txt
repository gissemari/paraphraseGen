Are there any sober loving houses like Oxford in your area?

Tough situation. ..Sounds like the automatic drinking response is still pretty strong. It's good that you are listening to the alarm bells though. Keep listening to them stay strong and try to stay grounded even if the stuff around you gets shitty.
Relapsing is a choice. If I don't choose it I'm OK...I hope you can find an environment that is more conducive to sobriety. In your situation - aside from staying sober - that would be my first priority.
So sorry for you. Hope you will find some way around this.
