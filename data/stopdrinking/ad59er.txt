Good morning! I woke and it's day 6. I think with each day. it is getting a little bit easier. I have done this before and quit. And I find that on day 10  it's like Dorothy's Oz. You suddenly feel clear headed less anxious not depressed and much stronger. I am bare knuckling it to day 10. And the evenings are sooooo long. But find a hobby to immerse yourself into. I painted for two hours last night on canvas and it really passed the time. I listen to youtube videos like Craig Beck or Alcohol Mastery... just keep educating and motivating yourself. Make a big pot of tea and chug all day long. Get one of those electric tea kettles and some quality tea. You are doing very well. I am too. People with addictions I believe are deep thinkers feelings and empaths. We feel so strongly that we want to numb ourselves. But I want to live life with a clear mind body and spirit. If you're struggling go outside into nature. Take a long walk in silence. I promise that day 10 will be here before you know it. Hugs!

I also suspect we must be deep feelers/thinkers...I keep thinking imagine how much better the world would be if we weren't afraid of our power if you will (well I'll speak for myself- if I weren't afraid of the big feelings) and instead found a way to harness it all for good.

Great post u/RubyRed.  It has helped me immensely not to focus on how many days but on today - what am I doing *today*? Is what I'm doing today taking me where I think I want to go? (I know I can always revise the long range plan if  In my imagination I always see those old black and white movie calendar pages flying by.  It's just always now. ...
