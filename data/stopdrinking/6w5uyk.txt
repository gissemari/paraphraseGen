I'm not so worried about staying sober but as to even have a good time bar hopping to have fun. Any tips or things I can do to alleviate the struggles of being the sober one? Idk what to do I really am worried about being a buzz kill because I'm really an introvert with social anxiety anyways but this is a really good friend of mine and ill be in his wedding too so I want to be a part of this. Idk really what I'm looking for from you folks but any insight is appreciated. Thanks!

I would say be happy funny (lets face it your jokes will get "funnier" as the night wears on) and let them know that you are a designated driver which is very helpful. 
I avoid events like this even after being sober for a "few" days. Nevertheless I understand that you plan to go. Some things that are helpful:..* Hold onto a nonalcoholic drink so others are .   less likely to offer alcohol;..* Have you own transportation so you can leave whenever.....* Hang with those who aren't abusing alcohol if possible;..* Step outside for a breath of fresh air if feeling stressed;..* Focus on having a good time but leave when it is no longer enjoyable..........
I just wanted to wish you the best of luck and let you know you've got tons of supporters here you can lean on if you need! I am not in any place to provide tips on how to have fun around drinkers though. Im currently at a BBQ with many drunk people and feeling a bit frustrated because honestly a couple of them are acting like total idiots. One has kept making "jokes" about me drinking water. I would love to leave but alas this BBQ is at my house! Anyway wishing you lots of luck with the bachelors party!
