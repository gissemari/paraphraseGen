I don't really know why tonight in particular was any different than other nights. I've realized lately that I still have a ton of insecurities self-esteem issues and feelings of low self-worth. A lot of these are feelings of inadequacy (not good looking enough not tall enough not smart enough). I have a lot of work to do on these. But tonight I did not drink.  ..Basically from around 5pm-9pm I was having HUGE cravings for alcohol and for a cigarette. I walked by the liquor store intentionally at 5:50pm and 5:55pm (it closes at 6pm) to somehow prove to myself that I wouldn't go in. I guess it worked ... but I'm not really sure why I was testing myself? I was googling and contemplating calling alcohol delivery services (in Ontario everything on Sunday closes at 6). I almost called but didn't. I took another walk. I got home watched Netflix wanted a cigarette really bad. So I took a walk.  ..I didn't call my sponsor or anyone else during this time. I have never been one to call people when this stuff happens even though I know that's exactly what I should do. I feel like I know what I should do I'm 2 years sober I made it this far SOMEHOW but tonight I just felt like I forgot everything and I was so close to craving. I didn't. But I scared myself.

Dude that sounds scary! I personally can't test myself like that. I would cave but the walk idea really does sound like a great idea to get out the nervous energy. Sooo happy you didn't drink. 2 years is a long time to turn your back on congrats on the good decision.
