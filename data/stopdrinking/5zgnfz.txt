You know I think this sub could be really good for me. Anytime I think I am smarter than the booze. When I start thinking I can drink again like a normal person. I'll read some stories here. It will remind me the struggle is real. It will remind me of why I chose to quit drinking. It will also show me that it can be done and that I'm not alone in my struggle against alcohol. . .I won't drink today. ..I can't figure out how to get the badge beside my name. Not so computer savvy.
