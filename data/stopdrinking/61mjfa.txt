I suppose now I have a foundation to build on again even if it is a single brick. ..I have some less serious withdrawal symptoms... they are not fun but I also knew this would not be easy to redo. ..Maybe in due time when I am more comfortable I can share some of my fucked up stories. ..for now all the best to you all. ..Thanks for the advice and support.

Hello. I'm glad you're back /u/ifnotnowthendead! Not everyone makes it. I needed lots of support to build a sober life. What are your plans?
I am back too. Day 2 for me. I realize that I can't do this alone. Welcome. 
I was in the same boat for a long time. Just drinking alone to silent the depression. What has worked for me though is building on skills. I'm not replacing one addiction for another. I'm breaking an addiction and using the full weight of a sober mind to study something new. Looking at all the paintings I have around me right now looking at how much better I am getting how proud of myself that makes me for the first time in my life. Becoming a better person is my driving force now and it's a choice I made rather then just a compulsion. Which I think was a very big turning point in my recovery because my mind went from ... I have to I have to I have to... To.. I choose to I want to. Find a thing for yourself that you have always wanted to be better at and make small goals so you can watch yourself get better at it and feel that pride in yourself! Stay vigilant! You got this! :)
I'll not have a drink with you today.  Something you said really resonated with me.....I basically have 2 circles of friends:  in one circle I'm the drunk and in the other I'm usually less drunk than the others.  I'm grateful to have the circle who is not a bad influence on me thanks so much for pointing that out to me!
