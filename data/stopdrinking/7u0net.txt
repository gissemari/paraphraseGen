And whenever it was it probably wasn't by choice. I almost constantly have people drinking around me. My brother drinks every night. I had a couple of friends over last night they all drank and I didn't. I have trouble quitting if I don't absolutely want it - which is why I'm having trouble giving up the weed. I also quit smoking cigarettes when I stopped the alcohol because they always went hand in hand...My point is though your mind is incredibly powerful - you can have achieve anything you want. You just have to want it...To anyone struggling with going sober have a read of Napoleon Hills  Think and grow rich'. Read it and you will understand why I suggested it. ..I just hope it might help someone who needs it.

That's great! Day 3-4 are the hardest during the first week. You're over the hump! Keep that ball rolling...
Well done on 4 days. Here's a link to the book in pdf format you mentioned - https://www.ivpp.nl/wp-content/uploads/masterminds.pdf. Not personally a seeker of financial wealth I'll give it a perusal nonetheless.
