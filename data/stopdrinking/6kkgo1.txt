I was drinking sun up to sun down 7 days a week. I used to say my only weak times were when I was conscious.   ..Here's our wiki page with ideas for things to fill that time:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/bored
For me it was becoming real serious about my health.  Developed a work out routine changed my eating habits and the foods I ate educated myself about health and nutrition.  Objective was to undo all the harm that alcohol had done to my body.   
I drank every evening. Now I drink alot of water and eat ice cream or snacks instead of beer. It helps me to always have some sort of drink with me all evening  (not alcohol ) cause that's what I'm used to.
