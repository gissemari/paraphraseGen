I am happy to inform this community that I have sustained from alcohol. Some have read my struggles relapses and crazy stories. I am grateful to be alive. I am doing a lot of soul searching. I quit smoking cigarettes as well and practice a dominant vegetarian diet with seafood on days I feel like I deserve it. This isn't a post about giving advice because deep down I know that we have and are going through all of this for a reason. In the end just make the right choices. Thank you stop drinking for all of the knowledge you've passed on to me I believe I'd be dead if I had not chosen you to be a part of my life. Thank you
