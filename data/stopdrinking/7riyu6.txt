Continuing with the challenge I started: I added another 4.20 miles of distance on my latest running session. It took me about an hour to complete so still not very fast but feeling stronger every time I try. Most of all it is my forth session and I find myself excited to wake on the mornings where I am going to run because I know it brings me further a long a path that I want to go down. ..That being said the weekend is coming up and it is always one of those times that I really struggle with drinking. My goal is to get out enjoy the winter atmosphere and maybe add another 5-10 miles of distance. Most of all I just want to remember that I am actively choosing to do this everyday. ..Thank you all so far for the support you offer and I will keep updating everyday.
