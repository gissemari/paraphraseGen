At midnight tonight it'll be my birthday.  ..It's my first sober birthday. The first since I can remember. The last time I tried to get sober was five years ago. I made it three months and relapsed on my birthday. I woke up the next morning and thought "oh well" and just kept on drinking while my life continued to get worse...I'm relieved that I'm sober today. But I can't help but feel so ashamed of the last ten years. Ten drunk fuzzy sick shameful birthdays. And for what? Nothing. For absolutely fucking nothing. What a waste. What insanity. I mean Jesus what the hell have I been doing for the last decade? Fuck...Tomorrow will be a good day. I will wake up and check in with my commitment to 24 hours of sobriety. I'll probably still feel like this but there will also be cake...At least there's cake.

Are you going to get new shoes? Also happy birthday!
Happy Birthday! 
Happy Birthday! Mine is in a few days and I've been batting around the same sentiments. Why did I waste so much of my life wrapped around a bottle? But I'm excited by the prospect of a sober born day...and happy for you too!
Happy Birthday!! I hope you get new shoes. And cake!
Happy birthday. May it be a symbolic rebirth for you the start to the next decade that you will look back on with pride. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Hope there's lots of cake! 
"It's time to wake up time to make up time to shake these memories. It's time to leave the past in the past and lace up a new set of shoe strings " ..Happy birthday! Get new shoes!
Happy Birthday! Happy new life! Happy new beginnings! Here's to all that and more :)
I hope it's a beautiful birthday and the start of a fresh year of opportunities goals achieved and adventures had!
