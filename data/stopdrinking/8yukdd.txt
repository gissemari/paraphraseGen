A friday night out with friends and i didnt drink..A wedding and i didnt drink..My birthday - i didnt drink..My mates birthdays - i didnt drink..The telling myself 'ooh i think i could do it in moderation' phase - i didnt drink..The mate telling me 'well done u made it you six months now lets drink to celebrate' - i didnt drink..a work social function - i didnt drink..The football world cup - many late nights in bars watching games with very drunk friends - i didnt drink..Still a few big events to go like stag parties Christmas and New years but so far so good...A big thanks to this group for the help and for making me realise im no different from millions of others out there who struggle with alcohol. There is real power in supporting each other so lets keep it up. Thanks to everyone who posts i find reading them a source of strength and support which keeps me on track. IWNDWYT
