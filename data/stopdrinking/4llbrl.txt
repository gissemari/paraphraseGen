I hope it's okay that I ask this here but if it's not I will remove this. What I love about this sub is while there are a lot of people struggling there is also a lot of Hope and encouragement...I have been looking for other subs for different reasons like depression and anxiety and I actually find that they make me feel worse because there isn't a lot of Hope there. It seems that it's mainly people talking about what's not working how much things suck and believe me I know they do but I can't help but wonder if there aren't some more supportive and hopeful subs for people who struggle with bipolar depression and anxiety...Any ideas?

There's some subs listed in the sidebar and FAQ. If anyone has a sub that helped them personally that's fine we just want to avoid  bashing of other subs.
