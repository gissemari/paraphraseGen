Hi all. I stopped drinking in September (2017). I had prefaced the stop with a dry January and 2 dry months in May-June. In both those cases I found that at the end-date I drank pretty hard (celebrating my 'success') - and with less tolerance came a swift reminder of the joys of a  fullbodied hangover... Therefore I decided not to put a duration on the September stop. It would only become another date in the horizon to reach - and then drink when it's over..But I am getting a little worried about myself and my prospects of staying sober now. I think about stuff like the half year mark quite a bit. And sometimes that if I stay sober a year I'll have proved my point - that I'm not addicted that I'm in control and far beyond the grasp of brain+chemistry causes for relapse.. This all annoys me. I would have preferred to not think so much about alcohol. And not have this persistent devil whispering in my ear that I should take up red wine again after a year. Because surely then I will be better at drinking in moderation (this reeks of lies).Does anyone in here have some experience with these feelings? How do I get past 6month an 1year anniversary dates without having *great* ideas about another little red wine party? How do I let it go? I do have a lot of other things going on in my life and although I am still often bringing sobriety into conversations - 'yes I got through Christmas' 'well I was really exhausted by not being in control' 'I used to blackout every time we went to that pub &lt;friendname&gt;' - I feel it is right that I discuss this with people. Maybe discussing the sobriety will help someone else.. But I want to let go. I want to be content without alcohol and without pesky little brain demons..Any comments or advice would be greatly appreciated :-) And thank you for having this wonderful community. I spent a good reassuring day here when I had the first relapse dreams.

For me I've learnt over the years not to get too worried about the consecutive or cumulative number of days I haven't consumed alcohol...I just get up each morning and aim to get to bed without drinking for that day.  If I think about the future too much and 'events' like weddings etc my mind wanders to either wanting alcohol or alternatively being annoyed that I won't be able to drink.  So for me it's back to basics and 'one day at a time...'  Courage to you on your continuing journey.
I can understand your nervousness I hear that voice chatter sometimes too. But you know your truth. I just remind myself that *none is easier than one*. I can't moderate this substance so I'm better off without it and so is everyone in my life. You can do this. IWNDWYT 
Those thoughts in my head that say I don't have a problem are one of the surest signs I have that I am an alcoholic. I've never met a normie who has to have these kinds of internal battles. Great work catching those thoughts!
I managed to quit for good when I completely and totally embraced these concepts:     .**Alcoholism is a progressive disease that will kill me.** Just like a person with a peanut allergy that cannot touch peanuts I must avoid alcohol at all costs.     .**Moderation is an illusion.** Zero drinks is easier than just a few drinks. There is no point in drinking just a couple. It is torture. Avoiding the "first drink" eliminates any stress about trying to monitor my behavior.    .**One day at a time.** Avoiding alcohol for the next 24 hours is a much more reasonable approach than imagining myself not having a drink for the next 50 years.    .**There is no negotiating with the Voice of Addiction.** The Voice that tries to convince me that I have beat alcoholism and I don't have a problem is a tricky lying son of a bitch. It is always lurking. It has many excuses. As long as I am aware of its deceit I can push forward.    .Accepting the fact that I was an alcoholic was extremely difficult but once I was able to come to terms with it (and say it out loud) quitting was attainable. 
The good news is you NEVER have to feel this way again!..Alcohol made me a liar and a thief.  Alcohol made it easy for me to lie to myself misrepresent my impairment to others and "try to keep it secret".  That resulted in guilt and shame.  I stole emotional connection and my presence from my loved ones....I needed support to be successful.  I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  They were warm welcoming and non judgmental...They were sober wanted to stay sober and amazingly wanted to help ME be sober!..Evening meetings were especially helpful!.
When I have thoughts like this I like to remind myself that normal drinkers/non addicts most likely do not have to think this much about a substance. They also likely don't feel a need to prove anything to themselves about their use...These remind me that no I cannot be a normal drinker.
