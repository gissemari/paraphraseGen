Hello all!  I had my self a relapse & need to get out of dodge for a week.  I told my immediate manager the truth & hes all for helping me.  We're not sure what to tell the department head because its not a "scheduled week off".  He left it up to me figure out what to say.  Im not checking into a program (so i cant produce anything) but i am leaving the state to stay with a temp sponsor.  Ill go to meetings everyday do reading & overall de-stress from my current environment.  I need to reset.   Ideas are welcome.  Thanks!

Being honest is an option but I don't know how willing your work will be to work with you. I mean this is a health reason. ..Are you close with your primary care physician? I'm sure they would be happy to write a quick letter explaining that you need a week off of work for medical reasons. I dont think your work has a right to know what's wrong with you. Just that you have a doctor's note. ..Best of luck to you! And remember a slip is just that a slip. Learn from it. And it in no way erases the progress you've made while sober. :) ..
Death in the family? 
Fatigue it's kind of true? Or a personal issue that needs your time...
