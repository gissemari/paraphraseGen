I've made it a month and some change with only one slip up where I had one drink (still one too many) and tonight is probably the hardest night I've been through so far. I'm so desperate I feel like I'm shaking but instead of pouring a drink I've already thought ahead about the consequences cracked open some diet soda and snacked on some chips. Now I just have to get through the next few hours until I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open.

A month is huge mate. Let's keep the ball rolling. I just play the tape forward and think of the consequences of drinking go to the gym or eat whatever I want while watching Netflix. Do what it takes I'll be rooting for you x
Nothing wrong with a hot shower and crawling into bed with a book an hour or two early.
