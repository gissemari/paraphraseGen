Day 3 has now rolled around and I'm quickly learning more reasons to not drink again...1) Looking at my father-in-law's health issues and knowing that I don't want to put my wife through any of this a second time..2) Looking at my past all the stupid things I've done or said relationships I've ruined all because of alcohol..3) It's nice to remember conversations from the night before and knowing everything I do and say is with a sober mind..4) This community.  Y'all's stories are very inspiring and I want to support y'all as well.  The only way I can do that is if I'm not being a hypocrite by drinking..5) I feel like I'm rediscovering the things I love.  It's different to listen to music or play guitar or play video games when your sober...I thank you all for making this such a great community a place where anyone can confess their struggles or look for support.  It's a place where I know I can talk to people that have or are going through the struggles I am.  Y'all are awesome..

#3...the last couple hours of each night used to be mystery to me and was always worried what grief I was about to get when I woke up.  I was lucky in the sense that I was an uneventful drunk so usually would just stumble to bed most nights.  However there were times where my antics put me on n the dog house more than once.  Regardless I hated the feeling of not having control of my life and enjoy being able to recall everything that has happened.
