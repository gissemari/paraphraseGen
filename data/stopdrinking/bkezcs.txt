to bloat up more after a relapse? Mine only lasted a week after quite a long sobriety time but in that time I drank/ate a lot. However I feel more full now on my third day of no drinking than before and look it. I'm barely peeing my period cycle is due (I know this is some of it) but physically looking it's liked I gained 10 pounds in a week. How long to go away? So uncomfortable on a woman!

Time sober will mend all sorts of things.
Ah the joys of being a woman and going up an entire jean size in less than a day. I don't have a specific recollection of that happening to me but it sounds about right. My experience with relapse in general has been that I really can't go home again. Once I got sober for any length of time once I started drinking again the effect it had on me was all around worse. I'm so grateful that I don't have to do that again. IWNDWYT
