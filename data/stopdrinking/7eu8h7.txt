27 days here. Then I treated myself on Monday. Not worth it.
I'm with youit's stupid  beer in brain outI'm fed up of resets I'm 39m got to start acting it
Amen brother! Story of my life. Over and over I ve had months sober and the voice go silent and then half a drink turns the volume up to eleven for weeks and months. Hate it totally hate it!! IWNDWYT!
It's baffling - had ~40 days drank in moderation didn't crave it.  So I did it again.  The mental obsession the 2nd time....five or more days really wanting to drink.....It did settle down but I've never gotten that son of a bitch feeling to completely go away.......I will not drink with you today.
I've definitely been thinking about it today....first holiday without being drunk....thanks for your post it helps...And you are back here so keep it going! I won't drink with you today :)
I am a 48 year old man who has friends revolving around drinking.  I played 9 holes today at a university course and the urge to drink was so much it affected my mood game and enjoyment of being outside.  I'm watching a movie tonight w my wife and she will open a bottle of wine.  I'm such a functioning alcoholic that I could drink stay home black out and nobody is hurt but my head in the morning.  ..But I'm not going to do it.  Too much to lose and if I don't stop now - when?  I'm not drinking today. But god I want to- say a prayer. 
I come to this sub for this motivation so I never forget. Thank you.
