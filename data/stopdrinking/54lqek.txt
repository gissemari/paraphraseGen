And thought "man that was an amazing night's sleep!" I didn't even have my alarm set until 5:15 but I just couldn't sleep anymore. Got up feeling relatively refreshed and mentally clear. What is this craziness?!?! Is this real life? ..It's these things that make me appreciate my struggle because little things like this mean so much more to me than most people. I'm definitely not drinking today.

You beat me by thirty minutes! So nice not having to spend time in the morning waiting for the shakes to subside and my head to clear!..Let's do it again tomorrow morning!
I don't force myself from bed until 6:15 but it has been so much better getting up these last 3 weeks. It's nice getting to work and not feeling like crap and I'm enjoying my Sundays again instead of laying in bed sick all day!
Yeah it drives me crazy but sober has me waking up to darn early and sometimes every few hours. The only part of sobriety i really hate. I hope it stops soon for me to. I will not drink with you tonight
