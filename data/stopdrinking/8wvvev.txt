Sending positive vibes your way. There is only 1 thing that will guarantee that depression gets worse and it's a drink. Coffee sounds like a good start! IWNDWYT 
You got it homie!
Hang in there! It got better for me! You can do this.  IWNDWYT 
You can do this! 
you can do it hang in there. i noticed that after the first month the cravings got noticeably fewer and farther between and you're almost half way there. don't give up!
Sending good thoughts!  You never know how the day might turn out.  Hope your mood gets better.
You'll get through it. Proud of you for 13 days!
It gets easier. I get cravings occasionally and tho beer was not my drink of choice a Beck's or St. Pauli Girl NA does the trick...It's natural to feel depressed. Everyone feels that way from time to time. Drinkers or not. Part of life and problems don't go away...They are easier to deal and take care of the longer you are sober. IWDWYT.
IWNDWYT  :-) .Hang in...you will be so happy tomorrow   
Tomorrow will be two weeks sober. Just make it to two weeks.
