I am extremely hungover right now. I was blackout drunk yesterday and my family is really worried. I dont remember much about yesterday but my brother told me i was rambling about random nonsense. I might have even wet my own bed. I am so ashamed and want to quit so bad. I think might have hit rock bottom.

What's in the past is out of your control. You own the present. You can't change yesterday but you can decide not to drink today. I'll be right here not drinking with you.
Well at least you're still here with us and you didn't hurt anyone. Welcome back. I'm recently back from a really bad relapse and am also lucky that I didn't do anything too too bad. I'm trying to make the most of this new chance. Best of luck to you in that as well. Any ideas for how to do things differently this time?
We've all been there. Wanting to quit more than anything is a great place to be. The key now is turning that desire into concrete action. What can you do to help yourself stay sober today?
Remember how you feel now.  Maybe take a selfie. This will propel you happily through the coming days.  I won't drink with you today.
One thing that I love about SD is that nobody is going to kick you for falling. Everyone here is waiting with a smile and words of encouragement to help you back up. Welcome back.
Im not drinking with you today 
Just remember there is SO MUCH More to you than the drinking and concentrate on that. Good job coming back!
I will not drink with you tonight. Time for a fresh start. You can do it one day!
You guys are all really awesome. Even though i havent been here for long i can already feel the support. Thank you all so much! 
I'm not drinking with you today. Glad your here.
