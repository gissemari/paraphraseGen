Hi everyone!..Happy New Year's Eve to y'all. My New Year's resolution is to continue committing myself to working on my sobriety. That's it. No matter what else happens this year no matter what else I do I'm going to continue prioritizing my sobriety and making the effort to work on myself. ..As long as I do that I will be able to work on what I need to work on in other areas of my life and grow how I need to grow. If I don't do that I stand a much greater chance of relapsing. And even if I don't relapse I know from experience that if I quit drinking but don't work on my sobriety all of the underlying issues that I used drinking to cope with will make me miserable. Drinking wasn't my problem drinking was my solution. I need to actively work on my recovery so that I can actually address my problems...I hope that you all are well. Have a safe night out there and I will check in with you tomorrow...Ginger_Sprout Out
