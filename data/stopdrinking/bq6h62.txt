I decided to reach out to an old friend today. We dated for a little over a year in 2012. After I moved out of state I ghosted her. I don't remember why I did this but I imagine it's because when I thought about her my mind immediately went to the times I got drunk and hurt her. I hate the person I was then. Selfish self-destructive sloppy...My message to her was well-received. I had built it up in my mind that she hated me and held resentment for me but that just wasn't true. She told me she was struggling with substance abuse while we were together. I had no idea. And though we weren't talking at the time she got sober the same time I did almost to the day...It's humbling to know that everyone has their own shit. I am not the only one who has fucked up. I am not the only person who struggles or has kept secrets from the people closest to me. A weight has been lifted today and though my recovery does not wholly depend forgiveness from others it's nice to have. I need to work on forgiving myself too.

Thank you for posting this. Hearing other people's stories helps everyone.
I'm not sure how to tell my story and ask questions of the SD community. I made a day and a half. Just blah!!! I should have just laid in bed.
This is lovely. It feels so great to make amends and put something to rest. Nice work.
This is beautiful thank you for sharing
I've been thinking of someone who I was very close to more and more lately. I'm so glad I read this post thank you.
