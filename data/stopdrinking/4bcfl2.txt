I am at the same spot I was in last September when I decided I would buy a pint of vodka after being sober for 6 weeks.  My drinking mind keeps telling me that it would be o.k.  My sober mind is doing its best to remind myself of all the reasons why I quit again.  While it is easy to quit and say you are resolved when you are sick It is so diffiuclt not to justify 'some drinks' when you are feeling fine.  Embracing the struggle and riding the wave.

You got this. I will not drink with you today. 
Kudos for six weeks! What you are feeling is exactly the reason why I didn't rely on myself to get well. The support of a therapist and AA helped me stay on the road to recovery. 
I can totally identify with this situation. I am at 40 days and this is when I usually revert back for just that reason. I figure I can now moderate and reward myself or somehow convince myself that not drinking is somehow more stressful and that I should just chill and drink when I want to. Wrong.Wrong. Wrong! I always work my way back to drinking too much. I also understand the "feeling fine" comment - I actually tended to drink more when things were going OK - like work or family stuff. I would have a great day and it was so easy to grab something on the way home and then it would gone shortly after..Stay with it - I am with you - I will not drink today!
SMART has good tools for when we feel that way - play the tape forward and cost-benefit analysis are 2 that come to mind right now.  Nice job on riding it out!
