It's 4:00pm on Friday in my time and under my Day 150 challenge...I haven't feel me energetic these days so I have to find something except alcohol..I think I'm better than before so I wanna keep sober.But I sometimes feel my energy level down and I have to solve it.I need something energetic me. It's my day 150 today but I'm struggling the same as about 5 months ago.Really tough challenge for me and I feel a little tired....But I will not drink with you today..Have a good day friends!...

Not that I'm glad to hear it but I was in a similar place though maybe earlier in the fourth month. I felt a huge setback in energy and motivation for a few weeks but I stuck with it and am very very glad. I started doing yoga and looking into supplements (nothing crazy) for my diet. Anyway the first step I took was adding fish oil (omega 3) for the numerous benefits to brain and body and I treated myself to this wildly expensive (for me) highly rated fish oil called Barlean's. It tastes like candy. ..Are you sleeping okay?..You have a most excellent day yourself. :) I will not drink with you today my friend.  
Hey there when I started here I was 10 days behind you. Had I not relapsed I'd have been on Day 140 today. So I'm kind of in awe of you! All the times I gave in you stuck with it! ..I'm sorry your not feeling great these days. Having low energy stinks. I wish for you and I'm sure you'll find something (even if it's just more time) that will help with that. I can tell you from back on Day 5 that without a doubt alcohol will NOT bring your energy back. ..Take care &amp; I won't drink with you today. Congrats on 150!
