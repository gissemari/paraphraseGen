Welp I'm back from a recent relapse... And it's been okay...I was thinking back about this last go at drinking and how having just one drink turned into a 2 month binge. I'm finally crawling out of that hole and I reallllllly don't wanna go back...You know how some people suggest not making a bunch of life changing decisions when you're early on in sobriety? Well sometimes those decisions just need to get made...I started back to work at a company I see myself spending my life with. I mean a real dream job. Landed the gig while I was in my first month of sobriety... My husband and I couldn't afford for me to stay at home so I made the decision to start work...We also inherited my 18yo neice. She's a great young lady... But back in my hometown she was living in the same toxic environment I was and I was convinced that since I was really doing the sober thing this time this would be a safe place for her. So I made the decision to have her come live with us. It's been great but it's been a transition...My oldest just started Kindergarten... The transition of going from being at home all day to having to wake up at 5am to get us ready for the day has been exhausting...So I did the whole "I'm fine no big deal here. Cool as a cucumber." I did it when anyone would ask me how I was. I did it when I'd share at meetings. I did it when I was talking to my sponsor. Hell I even halfway believed it. ..But I wasn't okay. While all these great things were going on I phased out taking my sobriety seriously. I didn't need meetings. I didn't need to call my sponsor. I didn't need to check in and see what was going on here. I was "too busy" and I was "doing fine". ..I fined myself into a deep hole this go around. Everything is a blur. My days at work were hazy and my evenings were drowned in booze. Thankfully I got out of it alive this time. ..Today I found a meeting by my new job... Thankfully I have a flexible schedule so my lunches can take a little longer. And today they talked about "I'm fining" it and how dangerous that can be... And how it's good to feel feelings because there's growth there... ..And I realized thru this binge I don't remember really feeling anything. As soon as I got home I'd drink till I was in bed. Drowning out any sense of positive or negative feelings except those that were manufactured from a bottle of booze. ..Getting those damn feelers back is a blessing and a curse. I'm kind of nervous about it. But I'm gonna try every day. I'm gonna start feeling shit. I'm gonna have to remind myself to breathe. ..Sorry for the novel... ..TLDR; I didn't drink with you guys today and that's a fuckin' miracle. ..

The flood of emotion can be overwhelming.  I hope it's my brain purging the cravings.  Congrats on the way back!  Iwndwyt
I agree.  I feel like stopping is just pulling back this thick heavy numbing blanket and exposes all the raw nerves firing off in all directions.  Luckily I've found that over time it slowly fades more and more.  The hard part is the only thing I've found for that is time and patience.  I figured I've been taking the short cut to do that with years of booze and drug just gotta get used to it gradually subsiding to manageability.  I will not drink with you today!
