Why is it that Christmas advertising seems to be centred around alcohol  ? It's all I seem to be seeing recently it may be because i have not had any in a week and I'm noticing it more but it certainly does make it a lot harder for those of us who struggle with alcohol. ..IWNDWYT.

On TV?  It's all booze trucks and boner pills. Thank the maker for commercial free Netflix.
Most people don't drink or drink rarely...20% of drinkers buy 80% of all alcohol purchases...Big Beverage cartel wants to increase the top "drinker" proportions and us recruiting!
It definitely appears as though drinking culture is increasing it seems as though there is a forceful program taking place to train more heavy drinkers.
