So sleep hasnt come back to me yet I still struggle somedays.  .Couldbt sleep last night and then woke up at daft oclock but I have a clear head. .Took the doge out for a long walk got doge food without having to drive whilst still tipsy/pissed from the night before.  .I got the kids coming around at 9 so we can go to a trampoline park which would have sounded hell with a bellyfull of booze from the night before.  ..I won the irish lotto ! But its on my ex's numbers so will offer the chamce for to have it.  ..Met a bloke at aa last night he was really struggling so offered him my number and gave him a lift home I hope he calls.  ..Going to grab me some sunday lunch with a friend today in this nice pub.  ..Seeing my sponsor tonight.  ..I will sleep tonight after last night limited sleep.  ..I am grateful.  Ups and downs.  I am grateful.  ..Iwndwyt.

Wait.... you won the lotto?! :)
Way to go man. Remember to see the positive changes and celebrate them. Be proud of yourself!  IWNDWYT..Also reading before bed helped me a great deal. 20-30 minutes and I'm not even able to keep my eyes open.
I think sleep is hard for a lot of us. Congrats on staying strong! IWNDWYT!
Sounds like you are real about stopping friend well done on noticing the problem. If I can give one bit of advice the pub will be temptation for me when I go I see people enjoying a beer it looks so tasty and nice but when consumed as an alcoholic it never goes well after a handful. I'm graceful you are here thanks for sharing.
