What is it about the weather and vacation that has you struggling?  Is it boredom?  Wanting to participate in the bar scene there?  Picturing yourself in a lounge chair with a drink?..I don't think weather is a real trigger so I like to go full toddler and ask but why? but why? but why?  Until I hit the real source of it.  Don't know if that will  help you too...If you have some alone time maybe a podcast about quitting would help focus you?
I find that hot weather triggers cravings for me because I'm physically  thirstier and want to guzzle fluids. Often a big iced tea lemonade or flavored seltzer will help get rid of that feeling. 
The weather can be a powerful drinking trigger.  Anything can prompt an urge.   I used to love the first touch of fall in the air because it would make me think it was time to drink "hearty" beers ha.  ..A SMART technique is ABC.   Activating event (trigger)----&gt;spurs an irrational Belief----&gt;leads to unwanted Consequence..To fight the urge dispute the irrational belief.  ..Instead of:  Hot weather---&gt;good ol days of drinking in the sun---&gt;ill have a drink..Try:  Hot weather---&gt;whats so good about being dehydrated in the blazing heat and then miserable hungover---&gt;i wont drink
Thank you all for suggestions to aid with my current struggle.  I'm actually enjoying the boredom and occuping my time looking for dolphins.  Ocean City has been great so far and looking forward to the 4th and the fireworks.
