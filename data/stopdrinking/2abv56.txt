Hey y'all! This is a long post but I'd love feedback. Don't worry. There'll be a **TL;DR** at the end..I have an older sister a paramedic that sees dead drunks all the time. Her view of alcoholism is fatalistic. Even when I'm doing well she worries that I'm doomed to end up dead...I love my sister but when the subject of alcoholism comes up we end up fighting or someone cries. The rest of my immediate family went to some al-anon meetings and that REALLY helped. Her hectic paramedic schedule makes it hard for her to do so...I try not to bring it up around her but she will inevitably ask how it's going. I always say it's going well but the conversation ALWAYS takes a turn for the worst. We both end up upset...Unfortunately the conversation is inevitable. Not talking about it is off the table for her. She has a strong protective instinct and really wants to help. Her understanding of the disease is just very limited and quite frankly frustrating. I understand where it comes from but I'm just so tired of conversations about my sobriety ending in failure and death.....Anyway I'm thinking of lending her my uncle's Big Book (he's fine with it. He's also very open about his alcoholism and has helped me through a lot. Plus my sister's a sucker for family stuff like that. I think she'd like the gesture). I'd like her to read the first few chapters...**Story Time**: She told me through tears a couple of weeks ago about having to make a call on a suicide. The man was my age and after talking to his family my sister found out he was struggling with addiction. She's worried I'll end up the same. Like I said I completely understand where her morose outlook comes from...I just want to show her that it DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. I want her to know that there is a solution that has worked for so many that there's hope for me! I'd appreciate any and all suggestions...**TL;DR** My sister thinks that as an alcoholic I'm doomed. I'd like her to read the first few chapters of the Big Book for a fuller more optimistic understanding. ANY SUGGESTIONS??? Thanks everyone! Love this community.

This may be a case where you can show some of the celebrities that are sober (and that their lives haven't been doomed)...Also you may want to go through some of the anniversary posts here where people are talking about how much better their lives are since they quit.  [Here's mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qwb7d/here_are_some_numbers_18_90_365/)...Good luck.
I understand she is worried but her worry won't change the fact that you are an alcoholic.  And as an alcoholic you are doing what you need to do to stay healthy and sober.  Since she can't make any al-anon meetings maybe she can visit the subreddit?  It's always there no matter your schedule.
It's pretty dense but I've shared my love of [Infinite Jest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest) with my friends and family. I read it while I was still struggling with addiction (though it's most definitely still a struggle.) and I'm reading through it again right now. A lot of the anecdotes from the novel are ones that I've identified with and repeated when talking about my relationship with alcohol with loved ones. My mom and my sister haven't read the book but they loved hearing about the stories and humanity that permeates it. My mom just recently picked up a copy because she thought it might help her understand addiction better. It can be a really beautiful parabolic tool for understanding alcoholism addiction and the different dynamics of humanity as a whole. The author. [David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace) unfortunately committed suicide due to his life-long struggle against depression loneliness and absurdity but he was nearly 25 years sober before he passed away. Wallace's work is almost entirely to do with combating melancholy depression boredom and loneliness. It can be cathartic heart-throbbing cerebral life-changing stuff. I think his legacy is a testament to his insight. Just talking about his ideas with people I care about has helped me describe addiction recovery and healing more than most other ways.
I understand this issue very very well most of my family is Mormon a lot of teetotalers. My parents thought I just "wasn't done having fun yet"....my last drink was shitty vodka right out of a liter bottle while I was crying and vomiting....fun hu? They finally started understanding when I took them to a few meetings. The only thing I could do to show them was staying sober. 
Has she ever been to an AA meeting or met people with years and years of sobriety? Try asking her to accompany you to an open AA meeting maybe one that is a speaker-format so she can just listen the whole time. Maybe that will help...Find that part of the Big Book or 12 and 12 which talks about how we are only doomed to "the gates of insanity or death" if we do not pursue a spiritual path or whatever. (sorry for my terrible summary - I can't remember what it says exactly) Explain to her what you are doing to create that shift in yourself. ..Have you told her how it makes you feel when you have these discussions? It's not like you can suddenly just not be alcoholic to solve the problem. No matter what you do - she's probably going to behave like this until she finds another way to process her fears. 
Also maybe you can have a code-word. I once had a roommate who I really admired and who admired me - but we both HATED receiving compliments. SO we had a code word that we whipped out when the conversation resulted in a compliment to one person. Whomever received the compliment just said "cinderblock" to acknowledge the compliment - then we changed subjects. Maybe you can say some sort of code word when your sister starts down on this path which is just both of your ways of acknowledging that your sister is concerned for you and you are doing the best you can to stay sober. Then you agree to ALWAYS change the subject.
I've read through all these comments and they contain some GREAT advice. Thank you all SO much!!! Some of it (like showing her successfully sober celebrities talking about al-anon telling how it REALLY feels when we have these conversations) has already helped so much...**UPDATE:** We had a bro-sis night out at this local burger restaurant we used to go to as kids. Later we sat on the porch and talked about all this. She's really starting to understand alcoholism. We had a GREAT conversation. At one point she started talking about Bill's story. I was like WHOA you go girl!
