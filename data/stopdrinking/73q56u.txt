A little background.  I've struggled with alcohol for my entire adult life.  I'm 37 years old now. ..I drank daily for several years then managed to quit for a time  but inevitably I start again after a few months. ..Recently  I went on a serious bender. My girlfriend was aware that I was drinking  but she had no clue as to how much I was consuming since I was coveringmy tracks pretty well but I would feel sick if I went more than a few hours without a drink. ..Finally  things broke down. My relationship with my girlfriend was truly suffering.  I was missing work so I could stay home and self  medicate...I came clean to my girlfriend and she took me to the hospital for detox and depression.  The hospital staff were wonderful and took great care of me. I was given IV fluids a multi vitamin infusion and was given phenpbarbital for shakes and seizure prevention.  After 24 hours I'm discharged home with a prescription for a Librium taper to help with withdrawal symptoms. ..Flash forward  things are improving by leaps and bounds.  I'm back at work  my employer was very understanding of my problem and is being very supportive.  My girlfriend  stayed with me while I was in the ER and now our relationship is improving...I'm truly blessed to have the support system I have right now and I'm thankful to be sober.  I can't say that I'll never drink again  but I'm not going to drink today.

I will not drink with you today friend. Thanks for sharing your story.
&lt;raises hand&gt; Same boat. To say "never ever" makes things *very* hard. But today? I can not drink *today*. Been doing that for 5.5 weeks now that way and between how *great* I feel and the book This Naked Mind I'm losing my desire to drink...I'm not drinking with you today
