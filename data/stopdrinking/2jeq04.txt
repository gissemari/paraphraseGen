Today is 5 months since I decided I needed to find hope and save my own life. ..Today is 5 months since I stopped numbing my feelings completely and hiding my head inside a bottle...Today is 5 months since I had a serious suicidal thought...Today is 5 months since I used any mind altering substance...Today is 5 months since I woke up hungover ashamed feeling guilty and barely remembering the events of the night before...Today is 5 months since I accepted that my way just wasn't working anymore....Today I am struggling with major uncertainty and scary health concerns but I am not alone and somehow we will make it through this...Today instead off drowning my feelings I am using my support system appropriately...Today I am a better employee friend and support for my family. ..Today I have hope...We all have today...I love you /r/stopdrinking family. ..Mouse

Good for you! You've really got a great outlook on your sobriety! I hope all the things worrying you turn out ok....
