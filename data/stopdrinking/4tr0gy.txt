My friend said it's a pretty big achievement.  I keep saying "tell me that in a year" but I don't want my self deprecation to keep me from observing time spent reclaiming my time...So here is to 8 months 2000$ raised for AFSP 640 underprivileged fed 1 garden struggling against the climate 2 wood working projects countless bottles of seltzer a persistent dad bod and frequently quoting Red Green "If they can't find ya handsome they should find you handy" when in the wood shop....And never purchasing La Croix.  IM FIGHTING YA ON THIS ONE SD!!!!.
