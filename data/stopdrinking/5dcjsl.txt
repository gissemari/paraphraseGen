I drank again. Felt guilty on the first round. Thought about putting it all down the drain after the third. Lost count around 5 or 6...I had a bad day at work and it didn't take much to say yes. It didn't take much to forget all the reasons to say no. One bad day followed by a moment of weakness. It was that simple...I'm not going to beat myself up. I won't live in shame.I won't let it keep me up at night wondering how long this time or if I'm strong enough...I will learn from this. I will embrace a network of support to help me remain accountable. I will get a sponsor to call in my moments of weakness. I will find a way to handle run away emotion and thought that doesn't involve a bottle...Please reset my badge. Today I was hungover and working. Tomorrow I will start a new count. Fuck a month. Fuck a week. TODAY I will not drink.

You are strong enough. I have reset many many times but we can do this! Glad you are back!
Hey I've said this before but I used to revel in bad days! "Anyone would drink after a bad day you earned this by having such a shitty day" although good days were a good excuse to celebrate too :/ ..I had to get a few coping mechanisms since I had like basically none. At first I was a little gluttonous tacos and pizza and chocolate but slowly started adding healthier stuff that helped me relax like yoga or a run or a long walk. Hope you have a few things in mind to help you out next time you have a bad day. And great work coming back here.
Back in the saddle good job. Many people are inclined to give up entirely but you made the decision to get back on the horse. Ride forward don't look back. But don't forget enough to make the same mistake again.
