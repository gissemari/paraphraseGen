----------immediate responses--------

Congrats on the 2 weeks of IOP NMBP!..Triumph: Still managing to stick to training schedule for upcoming 10K (8 days eep!)..Struggle: Trying to pay a lot more attention to what I eat and eating less of it. Unlike a lot of others sobriety didn't summon the magical weight loss fairies for me. :(..General chat: My AC turned on for the first time yesterday summer here we come! Enjoy your day everybody!.
Triumph - started this journey..Struggle - Not leaving work early today when feelin pretty sick positive it was from detox..General chat - going to fix the motorbike this weekend with all this new free time I have!

Triumph: you know each day it just feels more and more normal to be a nondrinker...Struggle: so mild anxiety this week.  I think it's the break in routine now that we're on the last week of school...General chat:  I am convinced my cats shed more than any other cats.
Triumph - I reached 30 days today without blinking an eye (sort of - it was a lot easier than I thought once I got into the swing of things).  And I'm down nearly 15 lbs...Struggle - Heading to a friend's for dinner tonight with food that won't be good with my diet plan and tons of booze everywhere.  I doubt I'll struggle too much not drinking but ugh I really don't want to throw off my diet tonight...General Chat - Two major storms over the last week and a half and we finally have clear skies.  Perhaps we'll finally have a clear evening to take out the telescope.
Thanks and congrats sounds like things overall are good in your hood!..Triumph: unsolicited raise and an offer to teach a couple courses at a top 10 public uni..Struggle: focusing on the negative.  Lots of good in my life but I have a realy hard time not dwelling on the negative and its dragging me down even when good things seem to abound...General Chat:  excited for a 4 day weekend upcoming.  and congrats to everyone here
triumph: 5 sober days in the past week. .struggle: my kids will be at there mothers this weekend for 3 days always my hardest time to not drink.  .general chat: my puppy likes the increased attention I am paying her
triumph: worked through some tough emotions in a mostly healthy manner.  Did not hide from them...Struggle: Miss my wife ..General Chat:  My air conditioner will be fixed today - going to crank it down to 69 versrus the 85+ i've been living in the past week.
Thanks for posting NMBP!..**Triumph**: I've reached my goal.  I weigh about 214 (from 288).  I look good and feel good.  I live a pretty active lifestyle now and eat well.  I've settled into the life of a sober person and it is my new normal.  I'm always aware of how I feel about things.  I'm aware of the alcohol around me and how I feel about it...**Struggle**: I'm not too motivated to work this week and I am annoyed more this week by other peoples' actions.  My dog that had lung cancer in January now has a brain tumor.  We're not quite sure how long she's going to be around.  I know that's affecting my mood and my productivity.  She's lived a very nice life compared to what she would have if we hadn't have found her.  It's just going to be sad to see her go.  She's the most affectionate being I've ever been around.  I hope she's comfortable and happy for a year or more but I know that's selfish.  To be fair to myself though I hadn't even considered drinking because of this except for just now when I was thinking that I hadn't even considered drinking because of this (and I have no desire or plans to)...**General Chat**: The other reason I'm not feeling productive: I'm going on a cruise... I leave Friday!  I can't wait.  Two weeks completely disconnected from the world!  It'll be great!..Keep up the great work everyone!  Being sober is awesome!
Triumph : I feel 1000x better today than yesterday. Got to bed relatively early and actually slept ..went to store yesterday and stocked up on fruits and veggies for Nutribullet. Freaking love that thing!..Struggle: lack of motivation right now..I really don't want to get out of bed and not because I'm so comfortable. Will force myself to the gym today....General: Glad to see bbbarks is alive..That was really eerie. 
Triumph: crossed another person off of my on-going 8th step list.  Even though I'm technically done with my steps and am currently cycling through 10~12 I still have some people on my 8th list.  She was an old girlfriend and I had lost touch with her (things didn't end well -- I believe she confronted me on my alcoholism and I threatened suicide which made her bail.)  She was incredibly happy to hear about my sobriety and told me the only amends I needed to make were to live a good sober life.  Works for me!. .Struggle: I'm co-dependent and my girlfriend is co-dependent.  When things are good they're fantastic.  When things are bad it's a fiery train packed with rabid weasels and fireworks going off a cliff.  Usually one of us (ahem me) threatens to break-up and it snowballs and turns into a shit storm.  We've been through therapy and we made great progress but we're both still human and we both have emotions.  I'm still learning to deal with mine.  I hadn't used them in so long.  Sometimes it's a struggle.  The last few days have been excellent though.. .General: watched Star Trek at the IMAX 3D and damn near flipped my wig.  What an intense experience.  I had never been to IMAX before.  I'm in constant amazement at the little wonders in life that I have missed..
Triumph: I am on the 3rd day of cigarette free. After reading Allen Carr's book this is easier than I thought it would be.  I finish off another financial amends on Friday.  Then I will have 1 left. (and this one will require me to do a little work to make contact)...Struggle: I will include the quit smoking. With the help of Allen Carr's book this is easier than I thought it would be. I have been feeling a little lonely lately. Not the soul-crushing kinda lonely just wondering where 'she' is you know the one everyone tells you you will meet one day...General chat: First really rainy day in a long time here in Calgary. We need it its been very dry lately. Guess I need to crack out a rain jacket.

Tonight at midnight I'll have been one week sober! Feeling really really great.
Triumph: 5 months sober today unbelievable..Struggle: Body is screaming for alcohol. AA has shone light on how nasty and severe my alcoholism is. Work is just now really starting..General Chat: Ice cream and Coca-Cola phase seems to be over. Eating healthier than ever. Awesome.
Triumph:  Check it out 114 days!  My boyfriend surprised me with a trip out of the state last weekend.  He said that it was a present both for our six month mark and also to celebrate my sobriety.  :)..Struggle:  This morning I missed a bus out of town.  I actually saw it drive away while I was still stuck in traffic.  :(  But the upshot of that was just feeling frustrated crying a little and then letting it the fuck GO.  It happened lesson learned (get moving earlier in the day!) and I have another chance next week...General chat:  Loving life!  I can't believe what a difference sobriety makes.   I was so... fear-based before I let go.  My boyfriend just ordered Allen Carr's stop smoking book (after seeing how well the drinking one worked for me) and he's nervous as heck about stopping even though he really wants to and that conflict really resonates with me.  Looking forward to being supportive.
Triumph: setting some PB's in the gym and committed to going to three weightlifting competitions. Deadlift squat and bench. Yessssss!..Struggle: two years coming up and lots of my new friends dont know im alcoholic. I want to share Bur im not ready yet. ..General chat: go. Sens. Go.
