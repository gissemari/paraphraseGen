I know I'm not alone in my crazy struggles because I read about yours and see that it's just like me.  I can't do this without you brave people sharing your stories and reading mine and giving me feedback.  Thank you for having the courage to keep this sub going with your fights to reclaim your lives.  Take care.

Same. SD is what even made me even think of Stopping. I'd always regarded my drinking as an inevitability. Not anymore.
Same here.  This is where I come when I have thoughts of drinking and by the time I've finished reading the thought has passed and I'm back on course.
There are so many kind people here it's astonishing. People take the time to help here. So many givers. SDrs are good people.
Good vibes 
Back at ya!
Right back atcha!
Yeah - crazy community this! My kinda people. It's my 'group'
It's like TRON? Just need to defeat the negative programming with our cool glowing disc things and awesome bikes! 
This is so true!  We are lucky to have this community.
I have witnessed a tremendous amount of grace from the people that share here I agree with your sentiments.  Good post thanks.
