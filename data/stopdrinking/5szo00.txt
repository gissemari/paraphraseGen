Hey guys. Been struggling with alcohol for about 10 years. Lately it got bad. A girl I really love had to make a tough decision for the both of us and decided to end things. My goal is to use it as a wake up call and learn from it. It hurts a lot but it's out of my control right now. I'm back at AA for the first time in about a year and am going back to take care of my mental health at a new facility. Looking forward to putting in the work and I'm sure you'll be seeing plenty of me around here. Just thoughts I'd say hi and introduce myself. ..Thanks
