I was wondering if I could hear people's thoughts on approval. I was talking to my wife today and I found myself saying "I hope they think I'm a good Dad." It seems that sometimes even subconsciously I'm seeking approval. I've also recently been struggling with some loss of identity issues. Anyone else experience these things?

If you love your kids then it's natural to want them to love you back - and them thinking you are a "good dad" is kind of part of that...Having approval is an evolutionary advantage - if our social group likes us they will share food and shelter and let us stay in the warm tee pees. So I think on some level we all want some approval...Identity issues certainly can come up with change in life. I worked through a lot of these sorts of things over time in counseling - I wasn't in there for that but it was just a side effect of talking to my counselor about all sorts of issues. I originally started counseling because of unexpected mental illness in the family but I kept going indefinitely because it was one of the most educational/helpful things I've done for myself. ..I don't think it's bad to want approval - but at the same time if you are doing your best to be the dad you want to be then you can "approve" of yourself also. My counselor also told me that if parents are trying AT ALL to be good parents they are usually ahead of the game. 
Isn't it a blessing that you care?..When I was drinking I cared what people thought in so far as I could make sure my lies were still holding and I could maintain my manipulations of them family and friends both...Obviously you can overdo anything and there's a healthy balance. You want to find motivation to be a good dad because that's a profoundly wonderful thing to be. It's among the most important things in life. ..Which is more important to you: whether someone else thinks you're a good dad or whether you know you're being the best dad you can be? If its the former and not the latter that'd be something to talk some more about...Take care.
