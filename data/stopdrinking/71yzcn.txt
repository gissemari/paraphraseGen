If you're new to this sub and/or want to attend an AA meeting yet have reservations what are some questions you have about AA &amp; your first visit? There are many many people on this sub who will be able to give you the benefit of experience with recovery programs like AA. ..Below are a few thoughts of mine on AA which has been a very positive experience for me. There are quite a lot of "what to expect at AA meetings" resources in the cloud but these are some particular things I wish I'd known when I was considering AA and might have attended sooner: ..Q: Are all meetings the same? There seem to be quite a lot of them in my town. ..Yes in format generally. But different AA groups have different personalities for lack of a better term. You're completely free to try out different AA groups to see which one works best for you. ..(Aside: I live in a large metro area so I have the good fortune to have multiple different meetings a day available. I know this is different for those living in smaller towns &amp; rural areas.) ..Q: What's the best way to find a meeting? ..Google "AA Meetings" + (your town.) Some cities/chapters have interactive maps &amp; apps some have more basic text-based lists of meetings. ..I would defer to each particular city/metro's online AA listings vs the online national meeting finders. I don't have much experience w/ the latter but I gather the local chapters/groups maintain the local lists directly so are probably more current. ..Q: Is it really anonymous? .Yes. You do not have to sign in and your name and vist are never recorded anywhere. If you speak at the meeting you are expected to give a first name but you can use a psudonym if you like. ..(But -- I would encourage you to use your real first name from the start. It really will have more impact on you to open up to a group of people with your actual name.) ..Q: Do I have to speak at the first meeting or any meetings? ..No. Sometimes especially if no one feels moved to speak a moderator/Chairperson will directly ask attendees if they'd like to speak and you can always decline. ..That being said opening up to the group and being able to discuss what you are going through where you are is an incredibly empowering and theraputic thing to do. You can talk about your problems here in a way many of us simply can't with family spouses and anyone else who isn't going through the same thing. ..It is also of incredible value to other attendees to hear of your story your struggles and your successes. ..Q: What does it cost? ..There are no regular dues. A donation plate/basket is passed at every meeting and most everyone chips in a couple of dollars. This helps cover the cost of meeting materials coffee donuts etc. But if you can't donate that's fine. ..Q: Can I bring someone with me for support? ..At many meetings you can. The AA listings you find online &amp; in the meetings booklet you'll receive at the first meeting list "open" meetings (where anyone can attende) with an (O) and "closed" (for those in recovery only) with a (C.) ..Q: The whole thing seems pretty religious and most meetings seem to be in churches. I'm not very religious/atheist/agnostic will I be welcome? ..Absolutely. Yes much of the official literature and guidance is based on finding a spiritual relationship with finding your "higher power." For many/most in the groups I attend that translates to the God they were raised with. But as someone who gave up church long ago I'm very comfortable at meetings and don't feel like I'm being preached to. ..Q: What's the dress code? .There is no dress code. ..You'll see people in shorts &amp; flip-flops suits and everything in between. Wear whatever makes you most comfortable. ..(Aside: When I first started going I would keep an extra shirt in my trunk so that I wouldn't have to wear my branded work shirt to the meeting. Looking back I now realize that wasn't really neccessary; everyone at the meeting's first and only concern is that you are actually there and getting help not where you work.) .

I have absolutely no interest in the program and just want to meet other sober people.  Is that alright?
Check out the sidebar of /r/Alcoholism. Scroll down near the bottom and you will find an excellent description of what to expect at an AA meeting.
