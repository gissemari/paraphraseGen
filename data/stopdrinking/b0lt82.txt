Up front I apologize if this is not the correct place.  I know /r/leagladvice sounds like the better place but I was hoping people here may have a bit more direct knowledge.  If this is the wrong place I'm hoping people can at least direct me.  Also obligatory on my phone please don't mind the formatting...Preamble: I am aware that I have a problem.  That is why I'm getting help.  This is coming from me as an anxious person helping to alleviate concerns.  I have an appointment setup with a substance abuse counselor coming up and this is what this revolves around...Relevant information:  Looking back I've had a drinking problem for 4-6 years.  However back then it was only on occasion and usually when I was playing online games with my friends on the weekends.  However closer to two years ago it greatly picked up and it wasn't just playing games with friends and not just on the weekends.  For the record it's almost always just a few drinks.  Not enough to really get really drunk.  Just enough to get a bit buzzed.  In all this time I have maybe woken up with a hangover from this drinking 2-3 times...Initially it wasn't bad enough that my wife started discouraging me from drinking but eventually it did.  At the time I worked on ways to just avoid it but I kept coming back to it.  Fast forward I eventually started hiding the drinking from her.  I stay up later than she does so it's usually easy to drink after she goes to bed.  Eventually I came to bed with alcohol on my breath and confronted me.  I have tried a few times to drop off of it myself to no avail.  So after relapsing a few more times and getting caught a few more times my wife told me I needed to see a counselor and I agreed...The issue:  A core element of this is the fact I kept hiding this from my wife.  I love my wife (and daughter) very much (Hence why I'm seeking help) but I'm worried that information I give the counselor could lead to me being separated from them.  I'm almost always limiting my drinking to when they are in bed.  I have never been violent and I've never injured or endangered them...The question:  Without being a danger to them (Mainly just myself) is there anything the counselor can do to force me/push to the legal system to separate me from them?  If I could at least get a point in the direction of legal information that would be great.  I really want to get help... But I can't see myself truly opening up if I'm in danger of being separated from them...Tl;dr: Seeing a counselor for help with my drinking problem I've been trying to hide from my wife.  Considering I've never been violet/endangered them does the counselor have any means to separate me from them?..Thanks for any advice

Why would they separate you? Having an alcohol problem doesn't mean you can't have a family O_o what would they even do throw you in an adult orphanage or something? If you don't have any legal trouble and you're not a threat there is no way they can force you out of your home. Not to mention I'm sure you have some form of HIPAA (I assume you aren't in the US) and patient/dr confidentiality.
This is a bit confusing.. is there more to your story that you haven't shared? And what is it you think a counselor can do?..A counselor/therapist/sponsor is not the law. They cannot force you to do anything. And that even includes forcing you to stop drinking if you don't want to. ..If you think about it in many cases the law can't even stop abused spouses going back to their abusers sadly. ..No one is going to force you and your wife to separate. Unless there is something you haven't mentioned.
