Yesterday I have relapsed. My friend's bachelors party. I was nervous about it and it was like: "you cant say no to a drink". I didnt have any option to run away because the party took place in the middle of nowhere and I wasn't driving..I got 4 beers and couple of shots. I dont feel well today. I haven't done anything bad but I just hate the hangover. .I will not drink with you today and I have no tendency to drink again. .I hate that social pressure.

Live and learn.

I just slipped after the same amount of time as you.  The key is to learn from it and get back on the horse.
Going to a place when drinking is expected and you have to way out is a very big risk. That was how I relapsed after 8 months sober.
I'm supposed to go to a bachelorette party next weekend.  I'm trying to figure out how to get out of it without pissing off the bride to be because I'm not sure how I will handle being around alcohol...I wish you well and I won't drink with you today
