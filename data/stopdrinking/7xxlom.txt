It wasnt a dream where I forgot I wasnt drinking and I was in a bar or something. I made the decision in my dream to relapse. I know it sounds dumb but its shook me a bit. Dream me can suck it waking me isnt following in his sleeping footsteps.

See how much it bummed you out? Remember that feeling and use it if you ever start to get cravings when you're awake! Maybe it's like your mind was showing you what "could" happen and now you're forewarned and forearmed! 
I still have drinking dreams (not like I used to but it still happens). Keeps me on my feet lol! ;)..I think you'll find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) interesting :)..
I had my first one last night too. I don't like that feeling at all. Glad to be free of those self-imposed chains. 
I've had those before. In my dream I was drinking but in my subconsciousness I was filled with a huge sense of dread and doom. It was like alcohol trying to tell me fuck you I can get you here! I think its our alcoholic brains trying to make one last hurrah. The alcoholism is losing control and we are winning!
