[Here is a pic taken right before I got sober](http://i.imgur.com/EnpBd7N.jpg?1)..[Here's another pic of me with a swollen face eyes glazed over.](http://i.imgur.com/tk7Gg16.jpg)..[This is me now.](http://i.imgur.com/EZnISBg.jpg?1)..[This is another taken recently.](http://i.imgur.com/opqcZVJ.jpg)..In the last 145 days I have lost 10 lbs quit smoking cigs and started working out. I wouldn't have started working out every day or quit the cigs if I hadn't quit drinking. I think what's most noticeable is that my skin looks 1000000x healthier than it used to my face doesn't look as puffy my eyes don't looked glazed over or dead on the inside. ..Biggest struggles have been pressure from work to drink the overwhelming desire to drink during certain/most all social situations and the general feeling of sadness/self hatred/defeat knowing that I can't change the fact that I'm an alcoholic. It won't just one day go away. ..(I swear maybe I can just have one glass of wine and not 17 one day right?? nope??? never? fuck.)..Thought I'd share. Happy Sunday y'all.
