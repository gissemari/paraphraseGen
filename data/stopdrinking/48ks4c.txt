**My fellow stopdrinkers; lurkers; white belts; distinguished DINOS; Mister [badgebot](http://sd.bot.nu/sdlocal/sdatlantis.php);** [(click for fanfare)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VEC4YLRy78&list=PL2yW2adfehiU7ohKMRohS0k4n_giIiXQd)..Well...here we are. 35000 subscribers.   ..SD has a humble beginning. Almost five years ago a fantastic man decided that he wanted to create a subreddit for anyone looking to stop or cut down on their drinking. No membership requirements. Moderation part of the game plan for some. A pretty [crazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iIsTWvp_Zo) idea right?..Over the years we have changed and adapted. We had massive subscriber volume this January due to an article in the Washington Post and then we got picked up again and again!..*We're kind of a big deal*..Since the beginnings we've changed but our main focus has stayed the same: to support and encourage anyone who wants to look at their drinking and make a change: either by stopping or cutting down...Now moderation is a hotly debated topic. Did you know we [wrote something in the FAQ about it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_i_want_to_moderate_and_control_my_drinking._why_aren.27t_people_giving_me_tips_and_tricks.3F)..___.**NOW ONTO THE ACCOLADES!!** .**[THANK YOU!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN3E9Yyd1HA) YES YOU!!!** .and...../u/larry_sellers_  - Quotes of the day  ../u/dancing-lobsters - What's Up Wednesday!  ../u/finally_woken - Thankful Thursdays../u/slipacre /u/thornkale - Tools Tuesday (As Slip would say: keep on reading more will be revealed) ..Thank you to everyone who has run the daily check in! ./u/jcohle /u/MessedupMakeup  /u/finally_woken /u/Flow_Morpheus_Flow /u/chinstrap /u/McLensky /u/TeddyPeep /u/Rusty101114 /u/sivart4891 /u/Morebeermoreproblems /u/soberlifebeckons /u/dancing-lobsters /u/sletzer_bro /u/BoozeCruiseBlues /u/drognan /u/shineonme4ever /u/OhHiImThatGuyy /u/KissinTheBottle /u/FreeFromMorgan /u/HaytUponHayt /u/Ecalifornica /u/silverbiddy /u/self_saucing /u/stopwining /u/Bluejay888 /u/koolpeanut /u/brando1206..___.One of the many awesome things about Stopdrinking is that it brings together people from [all around the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7exajMfNiFQ)  It's amazing to see. [We even have a map of our own!](http://sd.bot.nu/sdlocal/map.php)..Sooooo what does 35000 people look like one might ask?!?...Behold: [**MacMahon Stadium.**](http://cfl.wp.uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/12/18124805/generic-aerial-mcmahon-stadium-angle.png)  Capacity 35400 (give or take a few for the lurkers out there.) Home of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic games. [Shot of the opening ceremony complete with DINOs!](https://canadaalive.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/1988_calgary_opening_ceremonies.jpg). .Imagine 35000 of us all out there together [celebrating the triumphs struggles and achievements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GwjfUFyY6M) of one another. I bet it would be a bit loud!..I'd like to personally thank each and every one of you out there from the bottom of my heart. This community is amazing and it's very awesome to see the growth of so many fantastic people and to know that we're all in this [together.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Oct1Qv8x0)..[**Onward and Upward!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjTIJYDn48c).___.*As we go forward beyond 1000 users to 2000 5000 or 10000 I hope that we can remain true to the spirit of the subreddit. To make sure that we are open to anyone who wants to get control of their lives and tackle their problem drinking. That we can make sure that everyone feels welcome here no matter who they are where they come from or what methods they're using.* - [Franks2000inchTV Dec 13 2011](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/nb728/1000_subscribers/).

Nice job errybody.
Who ever would have dreamed that StopDrinking would become a hot thing?  What it has accomplished is providing a safe supportive venue that lets us tell the truth without judgment and allows us to learn from each other.  What a great achievement!   Thanks SD!
Great post! Thanks for all you and the rest of the mods do. You're a huge reason this sub has stayed true to its original intent. 
AMAZING!  I LOVE ALL OF YOU MWAH!
Yes let's celebrate our large family by not drinking today congrats to all of us old and new
I am so happy I found this site. I have never been to Reddit until now.
Wow what a great post! Thanks /u/stratyturd! I especially like the [Onward and Upward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjTIJYDn48c) video that's some funny shit...LACROIX 4EVER
Thank you SD!!!! 
Wonderful community. I enjoy spending time here.
Amazing. And so many of us owe so much to this group of awesome supportive people. Long live stopdrinking!!
Holy guacamole!!  That's a whole lot of e-Christmas cards that need writing I better start now! It's just fabulous to think that so many lives have been touched by the magic that is SD!! If only we really all could get together it'd be awesome!! Thanks for this post /u/stratyturd and to all the other mods who work tirelessly to keep SD a safe haven for all. Today is a great day love love love you guys   
I am NOT proud of my drinking but I am proud of my/stopdrinking.  I let everyone I meet that I think could use this program know about it karma thank you so much for all the support you have given me and continue to give as I grow my badge number
My mom sent me the article and this community is helping me pull my life together. Thank you so much!!!!
Feels like yesterday we hit 20000!
I feel very proud to be part of this community.  These amazing people who give so much every day by way of advice inspiration and good vibes the brave people who share their personal stories and start a thread seeking advice inspiration and spreading good will.  And all of us who are saying enough is enough this drinking culture has to change first for me and then for anyone who sees my example and seeks my support. This an amazing loving and supportive site of strangers coming together for a single purpose. Bell done all of us.  And a huge shout out to the man who conceived this site...thank you so very very much
Wow great post! Thanks for the visualization of 35000 people - no wonder I feel so supported here!  Thanks to all the mods who keep it going!
This post was a great way to start my day with a smile.  I live in a wonderful place we call "Ashlantis" so I was surprised to find a discrepancy in the map although I guess yours isn't that far away as things go. :)..love the 35K.
wow... 35k but it feels like a family..Thank you all..
This is great news! Getting sober is getting cool...I'm curious how many active posters there are. Is that available to sub mods?
I don't mean to rain on your parade but let's be serious here. ..When you see that 35k subscriber number you have to realize that there are probably less than 500 users at any one time that have joined and then stayed sober with any good amount of time and stuck around. It's just the nature of the beast when dealing with alcoholics that many wish to stop but not a lot are successful for any long period of sustained time. ..It's a great thing to celebrate that 35k people have at least hopefully gained a glimpse of what their life can be if they put some real effort into it.
