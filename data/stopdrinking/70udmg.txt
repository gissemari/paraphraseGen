Congratulations!! 
Thanks for sharing your sunny space with us! I look forward to more updates. ..This morning I am grateful that I slept without waking at 3:00 which happens quite frequently.   ..It's morning here and I have to get ready for work now. Goodnight to you QHG! 
Nice one Quirks!..Looks like your hard work is paying off... What a great transformation and such a cute space to work with... shame I'm not closer I'd whip round with my best gardening gear and give you a hand... ;&gt;)&gt;..I woke up at 3AM and decided to stay up (sound familiar?) so am a bit fuzzy round the edges now.....The doorbell just rang and made me jump out of my skin but it was only the bloke from the Internet company with a new router for us to replace the old one which was on its last legs.....I'm also in the process of cobbling together a frankensteinian e-cigarette from Mr W's drawer of bits and have just been in to town to buy a new coil etc... hopefully this will help with the cough!..And just because I'm a dirty sneaking junkie I bought two pecan danish pastries and ate them all to myself before the wife woke up... hope he doesn't find out! *They were fucking delicious*.....Happy Gardening can't wait to see what it looks like in a few months from now!..Love Woody ;&gt;)&gt; xxx.
Beautiful pics from a Beautiful Girl! What an amazing transformation. I love how much growing a garden has in common with getting sober. From seedlings we continue to grow. With lots of TLC we're here! Hmmm. Is it just me or do you see the *irony* in the new growth on that rose bush that you and your lovely daughter bought?! Beautiful. How's it going on that end? I *so* hope she'll be visiting :)...I'm grateful that I am sober to take K for his knee procedure at the hospital today. The daily wisdom I get from his 15 years sober is priceless and I'm happy to give back :). Lots of love xoxo
Hey everyone! I didn't drink last night and I'm not drinking today no matter what!!!! This is my 3rd day alchohol free and I feel so amazing and clear! I am grateful for my body and mind......and thankful for its forgiveness of how I have treated her in the past.  I make the commitment to not drink today .... I don't know what will happen tomorrow but for today I ain't drinking with y'all! 
Wow! Looks amazing Quirky   A truly beautiful space. ..Felt a bit teary reading about your rose   bush.....I feel how important this precious time is for you but I also understand how you can't push..  I'm keeping everything I can possibly cross crossed for you! I don't pray much but I am sending every positive thought I can your way. ..The passing of time sometimes makes the world of difference! ..Love hope and hugs zinging your way from the UK! ..    xxxx..
