I don't really know how to describe whats happening. This is the longest I've ever gone without relapse and I'm incredibly proud of myself. I know what happens when I drink. I do okay for a while then pretty quickly I spiral out of control. Binges DUIs fights depressionconstant blackouts... I have not forgotten these things. But lately my cravings have been pretty intense. I'm dreaming about alcohol several times a week. I stop by the gas station I stare at the tall cans and 40s like I did 15 months ago. I don't know where this is coming from...I'm helping my significant other stop drinking. He's struggling with it more than either of us thought he would thusly he's been needing me to act more like a sponsor. It's going to take lot of coaxing to get him into AA. That will take the pressure off me but it will still take time. Also I am starting at my dream job on Tuesday(more pressure!) I've been finishing all my legal business(from my last alcohol related charge) and I'm taking on a ton of new responsibilities(full schedule money management new place). These things are all causing me  massive stress and I've always delt with stress by playing bubbles with a bottle of vodka. I guess this is why staying sober has seemed so difficult lately...I know what I need to do. Stay busy stay active in the program focus on my short term goals and talk. So that's what I'm doing. Talking to other drunks. Thanks for letting me vent guys.

Congrats on making it 518 days!..I don't know if talking to your SO about some of this might help encourage him to get a sponsor sooner which could help take a bit of the load off of you or if they would take it as a blame game but you know your relationship and it's something you might want to consider.  Hopefully the stress will abate a little as the job starts and the anxiety of "new job!" fades.  Best of luck and hang in there.

Sounds like its time to regroup. 90 meetings in 90 days. 
What you've done is incredible. I hope you can take the time to take a breath and pat yourself on the back for what you've accomplished. Good luck!
&gt;Stay busy stay active in the program focus on my short term goals and talk. ..Thanks for posting...You didn't mention the one thing that got me into AA keeps me there and keeps me sober when life hands me a big lump that I can't handle alone - *ask for help.*.."I need help."..Probably the most painful and also the most important words I've ever said...Don't be afraid to be specific.  "I need help with xxxxx can anybody offer me suggestions after the meeting?"..This to me is a perfectly legitimate share at the AA meetings I attend.  Even if it's only feedback on staying in emotional balance or just kind words knowing you have someone who has your back is huge...And being *helpful to others* is a key component of any recovery program.  Let others stay sober through unity and service too; don't shoulder burdens alone...Thanks for venting so I could reply.  Thanks for allowing me to bolster my recovery by supporting yours in this small way.
**Keep the focus on yourself - alanon 101**..You probably need some of those meetings too.  "Double winners" meetings if you can find them...Your dis-ease has been waiting for this.  It has sold you the pressurized option.  Tell it to fuck off.  Go to your dream job - revel in it.  No fear needed.  ..Same for your SO.  Find someone in the rooms to take over the 12 stepping.  That is NOT YOUR DANCE.  ..**meetings more meetings**
Noticing that you need to share and then sharing is a HUGE step.  God bless and I wish you the best.
