I had a tiny little window of pink cloud when the hangovers stopped but since then it was a long slow slog to day 40.  No energy no creativity tired crabby and depressed.  Finally on day 40 I started to get some energy back.  The last few nights I ran out of time before I ran out of energy and inspiration.  Thank god because I was starting to question weather it was worth it.  I haven't felt this good physically in 10 years or more. I accidentally woke up at 4:30 am this morning so it may not be as fantastic tonight but that's ok.  I've been reading almost every post here and it seems the first several weeks can be very individual experiences.   Hang in there! Eventually everyone gets rewarded. I hope this helps for any of you struggling early on.

good job. you inspire me to attack my own vice  one more time in spite of multiple failures.. quitting cigarettes -_- ..i made it 27 days and caved due to depression and anger. boy oh boy. you'd think i'd have learned something from my battle with alcohol. Hey stick to it it'll be worth it you will keep feeling better and better!..I will stay sober with you today
i remember that dead tired headache-y wall i hit every day for a little bit. it was discouraging but it doesn't last. hopefully you are on the other side of it. keep on keeping on. just gets better. swear.
I think this is an important message.  It takes time to recover from the assault of alcohol.  
Thank you! It helps me a lot to hear that energy improves. I've been very sluggish!
It's so good to hear others' experiences and be reminded that recovery takes time and isn't the same for everyone. I've been so tired and crabby lately and it's hard to tell if it's part of the quitting drinking or just other factors that I'm feeling more acutely because I'm sober. I will continue to push through and be hopefully for that energy. I will not drink with you today.
Thanks for this. Came across [another post of yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/563gw1/havent_drank_in_almost_3_weeks_feeling_more/) after doing a search about feeling more depressed than when drinking. Then clicked on your name and found this more recent post...Very encouraging to hear that you're getting energy back. Thanks for sharing. I really appreciate it.
