Hi Gang..I have been pretty busy and don't really track the days as much as I used to.  Sobriety is just becoming a thing I do and the way I'm living.  Last weekend I had a Scouts camping trip with my 10 year old.  The old me would have probably brought a bottle along to sneak some pull in secret and gotten a little too obnoxious and ruined a lot of peoples good time.  Ended up having a great time and not letting my sleeping bag that was tiny (kids Mom said it would fit me great it barely came up to my waist) with a busted zipper spin me out.  I just toughed it out until I couldn't take it any longer and went and slept in the car...lol.  ..Other than a relapse for most of July I've been sober since the end of April  so 5 out of the last 6 months.  I don't post as much as I should but I lurk and read a lot and get inspiration from a lot of posters and have a lot of empathy for people who are going through some really tough times.  ..Not drinking today in fact I'm planning my dinner and workout for tonite.  Aside from sobriety I've dropped a little over 50 lbs and have been hitting the gym hard.  Couple weekends ago I was grilling ribs and I was shirtless in my backyard and caught my reflection.  I had to do a double take maybe it was the the sun was hitting me but I was like "damn starting to look kinda jacked homie!"  So of course I stood there looking for oh the next hour or so :P..Not letting up and not gonna drink with any of you today.
