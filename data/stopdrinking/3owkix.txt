I just realized that my reddit cake day (the day I created the u/DrunkWooky account) was the same day as my sober birthday! ..As a bonus let me share with you an awesome overlap of my sober life and my comic book fandom. ..Eight months ago I posted this: [A Post About Iron Man #128 "Demon In a Bottle"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ph1ev/a_small_token_to_myself_for_achievement/) ..In that post I discuss the importance of the striking classic comic book cover and how I look to it for inspiration. Well earlier this month I had the cover artist and writer of that issue [Bob Layton sign the issue at a local comic convention.](http://imgur.com/G7T6811) It was great to meet him and he was just a hell of a guy. Real genuine and just happy to be there. Later I found this [post about Bob Layton's sobriety](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/09/28/i-have-two-major-legacies-in-my-career-iron-man-and-valiant-bob-layton-in-conversation/) and the struggle he was going through while writing that Iron Man story...>B[ob] L[ayton]: ...[I]t wasn't just another comic .... I've been sober for almost thirty years now. So yeah it did mean something to me. Comics can idealize life so Tony could overcome it while I couldn't. It was cathartic for me... It's good to know that that classic story did not come out of a vacuum and that there are happy successful people out there who understand my life.
