Man I had it all together.  My boyfriend and I were doing well with me not drinking life was good.  Until it wasnt.  We had a birthday party for a friend.  He drank I didnt.  He got very drunk and proceeded to tell me how hammered I was and yell at me about all kinds of things that made me lose it.  I knew better than to take that bait but I snapped.  I left his house and got lit.  Slept with a friend of mine.  I never ever want to feel this way again.  Therapy was working so well.  Fucking let the PTSD from all the childhood bullshit get to me.

&gt;Therapy was working so well...Are you still going to therapy or planning on going back to therapy?
Don't beat yourself up too bad. That sounds like a hard situation you were in.  Extract what can be learned so that you can apply it next time. IWNDWYT!
It is really tough to be sober in that kind of relationship. That was a real relationship test. Is he on your team or not?.Doesn't sound like he is. ..Birthday party or no average people do not get drunk whenever they drink. He may be on his way to his own issue.
