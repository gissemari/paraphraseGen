... and so far I have been feeling great!.While it is not the first time I attempt quitting drinking altogether I think this time is the real deal. I have been in a much better mood since I quit I sleep better eat better etc. But there is always this struggle when I come home from work where I start thinking about bringing back a six-pack of beer thinking how good it would be to drink it all. It's like my brain is still wired with my old bad habits. I usually get through that by focusing on how better my life is when sober and how I would be plagued by guilt for a few days if I broke my streak. It's been working well so far. I also quit smoking weed a few days ago so I feel a bit more clear-headed...Have a great weekend everyone IWNDWYT

It's been good for me also to play it forward to the next day and the guilt I would feel.  Great job on 2 weeks!  IWNDWYT
