I've always gone to interviews tipsy or on Xanax and it's always worked out for me. So I was a little nervous today when I decided to go to an interview completely sober. .....I was offered the job on the spot! I don't know if I'm going to take it or not but I have to say - it was honestly exhilarating to be on display and feel confident in my answers my presentation and myself. I've always struggled with anxiety and depression and I used alcohol to self-medicate. It turns out I am *much* better at managing them when I'm sober. Go figure. Yes I was nervous but the sense of accomplishment I feel now that I pushed myself to do it is so great. Like it's a high that rivals what I used to feel when I was drinking. I'm content and it's such a good feeling. I'm grateful I got to be present today.
