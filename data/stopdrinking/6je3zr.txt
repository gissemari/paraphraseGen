EDIT: I meant to type "it does get better" in the title. Oops...This is a repost of a comment I wrote a few days ago with a few minor modifications. Upon reflection I realized how much reading these kinds of things helped me early on and I wanted to get it a bit of extra visibility for those who need it..------------------------------------------------------------.Sobriety isn't always easy. I can definitely say that there are rocky times and for me those times have been a result of having to face so many things that I just used to numb with alcohol. But I can definitely say it will get better and I can kind of liken it to my experience with a gym. Substitute in your chosen sport/whatever as appropriate...The first time I went to the gym I remember feeling pretty useless. I could barely do the simple exercises I got gassed quickly and I was sore for days. I hated it. That said I kind of just trusted people who said that it was worth the effort and it would get better. I sort of had to walk on faith that eventually the shitty workouts would pay some dividends but from where I was that was really hard to see...As time went on I got stronger. I started to figure out good form and how to move properly. I wasn't sore for days I was able to handle more intense workouts and when I had the courage to try new things (I took up Muay Thai recently) I found that I really grew from them and was able to transfer some of those skills. It took a while to see changes but one I could it was a lot easier to stay motivated. There are still days when I'd really rather not go to the gym but when I just get off my ass and go I always feel better for it...My sobriety has been the same. Early on everything was difficult emotional and exhausting. I was really down on myself and getting through some days was hard (I was actually dangerously depressed at about 5 months sober). But when I just grit my teeth leaned on the support of people I loved had a bit of faith and took the necessary actions to get through the day without taking a drink (e.g. seeking help for the depression) things got better. Suiting up and showing up was hard but it has paid dividends...In many ways I am incredibly strong emotionally nowadays. There are some areas where I really have trouble (my love life is kind of a dumpster fire) but as I show up and do the work every area improves. My life is way way better today than it ever was when I was drinking and it's also way better and happier than it was in my first few months sober. I have struggled in sobriety but as long as I go through it it always passes and I am stronger for it...Keep it up. You were given this mountain to show others that it can be moved and I have full faith that you are capable of moving it.
