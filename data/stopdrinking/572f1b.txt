Tonight I had this whole plan. Work till 6 then hit the gym. Out at 7 grab quick dinner then make my meeting by 8 maybe even a bit late...Well I stepped out of the shower after the gym at 7:20 finished eating probably close to 8 made it to my car by about ten-past and had another 20-30 minute drive to my meeting. Needless to say I missed it. While this is the only meeting I attend a week I have lots of other backup meetings I attend but I won't have any time to get to any because of immovable plans...And this is why I check in here. You guys are becoming my instant-anytime-meeting. I see your stories. I read about your NDV's. I benefit from your struggles. I offer help when I can and sometimes even when I can't (again not perfect)...I'm happy to be sober and proud to be in SD. I will toast a glass of bubbly sodastream water to you all. Stay classy SD!

Glad you checked in! Terrific that you made it to the gym and dinner and online. We're here! And I am a sodastream addict lol it's right here beside me as I type. Bubbly water is the BEST. And 5099 days? wow. In awe here. 
I can so totally relate. I do what I can...and as always check-in here to really stay grounded. Love everyone here; its family :)
It sounds like you accomplished a lot!  Happy to not be drinking with you today. 
Perfection is a dangerous target to aim for. It sets us up for disappointment...I aim a little a little lower. And I am perfectly fine with being good enough...Nice post. Thanks for checking in with us!
I will not drink with you tonight
At first I couldn't understand why people would go to more than one meeting a day.  But now I am realizing that checking in to r/sd is really just like an all day meeting for me.  It's great!
You are staying classy - look at that a glass of bubbly sodastream and 5100 days!
