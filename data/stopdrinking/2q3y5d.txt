I am 23 days sober. I had 17 days before that but relapsed. ..I am on vacation for 16 days. Normally I would schedule drinking brunches happy hours or just drink alone. Very little would get done around the house and I would tell my husband it was because "I was too busy."..In just two days I've done the following:..- hit the gym feeling great each day.-  cleaned and organized the kitchen table.- ran the vacuum .- had breakfast with a friend .- watched 3 movies.-  went grocery shopping.- reconciled the family budget.- organized 2 closets.-  cooked 2 meals and made multiple lunches .-  baked **cookies** so many cookies. And I just keep making more. ..Has anyone else experienced a sudden increase in time and productivity?

Big time. I have more time productivity and money lately...It's no big deal now to fix stuff around the house and do activities with the kids. It used to be that somehow there was never time for anything...I didn't get any cookies though. Hmmm...
My apartment is pretty clean lately. 
That's so kickass so much more gets done sober. I used to drink and clean but in the morning things were only messier. I pick you as my inspiration for today.
That's the only downside of SD: no cookies!
Yay! I used to run a lot when I was hungover. It was always such a struggle to get out the door but I told myself that it would help me get rid of the hangover. Running is so much more enjoyable now!
You got it sister! Once I stopped drinking and smoking I wondered where all the bloody time came from!
It's part of your sobriety dividend by all means enjoy it.
