Today marks 365 (technically 366 since it's pst midnight) sober. Here's how I did it...1.) I went to NA and AA meetings.2.) got phone numbers.3.) went to more meetings.4.) got a sponsor.5.) went to more meetings.6.) worked steps 1-3 (NA).7.) went to more meetings..I learned to meditate. I learned that cravings are like tv commercials when you see the commercial change the channel as quickly as possible. If you see the commercials long enough you'll end up buying the product (relapse)...I went to meetings ..I learned to network I learned empathy. I learned to love myself for who I am. I learned to develop positive habits and hobbies to stay busy and focused...I stopped going to meetings. Things were working great. Resentments built towards people places and things. I stopped meditating...I went to more meetings...Progress. Not perfection. Thank you r/stop drinking for helping me.
