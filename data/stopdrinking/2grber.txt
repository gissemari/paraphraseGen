I've put together some ok periods of sobriety (40 + 20 + 25 days and a lot in between) over the past year so I'm fairly confident in my ability to quit...I've been relapsing strong for the past two months or so though and really having trouble getting out of the 1-2 weeks that is toughest...Every time I've quit in the past have been during periods where I had very little responsibility. My strategy involved a lot of distraction (watching movies etc.) and generally just laying about and enjoying the little things of sobriety...Next month is going to be extremely stressful. I'm taking an intense monthlong course that will involve 8-10 hours of work every day. I have to stop drinking...Anyone able to contrast the experiences? I'm thinking it will be immensely difficult to stay sober during this time due to stress. At the same time maybe the distraction give me 8-10 hours "free" every day where I just won't have the ability to drink...AA/support isn't a practical option due to time constraints and I am in a foreign country...I should have a 1-2 week head start. I'm not trying to sound like I'm making excuses I have to quit but I'm just really scared at how I will react to the stress and what my expectations should be...also my badge is wrong I'm at 0

.Welcome back.If you have time to drink you have time for recovery - be it AA Smart whatever  - and you actually gain time when you factor in not being hungover...Stress drinking adds to stress like gas on a fire.  We make mistakes do stupid things we need apologize for are hungover and not productive say "fuck it" and the next day we wonder how we got so far behind......Not drinking is not all that complicated but we love to over-think things.....
All right. Nothing changes if nothing changes. Just "not drinking" is not really a viable plan. SOMETHING has to fill the void. For me that something is and was AA. I worked 10 hour days four days a week and I found time to go to a meeting. What country are you in? A friend of mine is in Siberia right now and he is making it to two English speaking meetings a week without a problem...I don't know you or your exact circumstances but if you are allergic to alcohol like I am and yes it is an allergy than just not drinking is setting yourself up for failure. Stop making excuses start doing something. This is a progressive and ultimately fatal illness take it seriously before it takes you.
