Don't wait until after you've relapsed to post about your relapse...Feel like you're going to drink? Make a meeting post on SD call a friend do whatever you do to get some support...It's important to get support after a relapse too. I'm not saying people shouldn't post about recent relapses but it does ya more good to reach out before a relapse than it does to reach out after.

I meant to respond to this earlier... N E way. I was never able to take this advice not because it isn't spot on the right thing to do because it most certainly is. Over the last 11 years I've relapsed more times that I care to mention....if not just the fact that I lost count. ..Every one I had I swear it was an out of body experience I remember once I was living in a sober living house in Chicago I went to the grocery store to get everything I needed to make dinner for the house I love to cook so I made dinner for everyone 3 times a week. Went to the Jewel by the house got everything? Was walking home and I walked right into a bar and had a couple IPAs....no intention to do it auto pilot at it's finest. I stopped at 2 went home nobody noticed I brushed my teeth and went about making dinner. I wish I had the presence of mind to make that call I admire those who do but I was on autopilot every time never had the intent it just kinda happened. ..I'm glad it hasn't happened to me in the last almost 10 months....if I did now someone would call the cops to take a very pregnant me out of the bar. On that note anyone is welcome to make me that one to call.
