this or not. On the one hand I want to be sure I'm being completely honest with myself and on the other I want to avoid drawing too much focus/attention to something that I'd prefer to chalk up as a fluke. Long story short I work in the service industry. Yesterday was my bday and as I was cleaning up at the end of a busy shift the bartender called me and my two coworkers over to the bar. Turned out she'd made a shot for each of us to take in my honor...I didn't know how to turn it down guys. I took it just to save face. I've been going strong for 2 1/2 mos. I get cravings but they're typically fleeting and I love my life without alcohol. I guess I just felt totally ill-prepared/caught off guard because I was at work and therefore thought I was "safe." It's amazing how quickly/easily these things happen. I've avoided being social for this very reason-I always seem to cave under pressure which lets me know that I have other problems besides drinking. Anyway just wanted to come clean. I have no intention of continuing to drink. I'm just extremely closeted at this point I guess and in that moment it felt easier to go along with things than to try to offer an explanation; I vaguely recall the antibiotics excuse fleeting through my mind...it was foolish and harmful and it makes me feel lousier than I expected to share it...hopefully no one will judge me too harshly. Not sure what my problem is really. I've been down this road before...would love to hear from folks who've struggled with the same thing/figured out a way to stay true to themselves. It's almost like in those moments there's a disconnect between the fact that alcohol is the very thing I've been trying to avoid if that makes sense. Idk. Anyway thanks for being here:) I will not drink with you today even "accidentally."

We aren't judging you.  This is your ballgame.  I have mine others are playing theirs I know I play this particular game to win.  Am I winning is the question I ask myself.  And by how much (because that's my nature lol)
Teacher here. 75 days sober to 1 day with alcohol is a 98% sober ratio which is a solid A average. You're definitely on the road to long term sobriety and it doesn't sound like you've done anything major to sabotage that fact. Now that you know these facts from yesterday (and happy belated birthday by the way!) what are one or two ways you could avoid this in the future? That's what learning &amp; growth are all about right? And that's what outweighs any personal disappointment you may be going through. Learn from this become even stronger and we are all cheering you on :-)
