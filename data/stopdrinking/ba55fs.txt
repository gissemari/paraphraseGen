This is just an average day.  No big anniversary.  No relapse.  Nothing but a long string of sober days.  I don't have a big urge to drink.  However it was usually mundane and uneventful days like today that would be a gateway to relapse.  I have stuck to my program.  Having a routine is important.  I have become more of a believer in AA.  I still have major social anxiety.  I used to pregame frequently in order to be social.  Without pregaming I still find it hard to attend various drinking events.  Many times I cancel at the last minute.  Last weekend I did that twice and went to meetings instead.  Walking into a meeting room has become my safe place.  I go to two or three meetings each week.  Realize I did not like AA in my first weeks of sobriety.  I have one foot in the room and another outside the room.  I am impressed with 95 percent of the people who are on similar journeys whether through SD or AA.  The exceptions are more my problem than their problem.  I just cannot deal with people in sobriety who believe there is only one pathway to maintaining sobriety.  The line from AA about  it works if you work it  is true for me.  I just have a broader definition on how I work my plan.  I get just as much out of the great people on SD as I do from any AA group.  Thanks for being there and letting me share.

I like average days of the 'new average' variety.
A day when I am alive and feeling pretty good is a wonderful day in my book. I'm an average person having a wonderful clear headed day. IWNDWYT
