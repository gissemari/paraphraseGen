Yeah. Its pretty damned sweet. ..For those of you struggling trying to get through the first 30 days or trying to make a decision to stop. All I can tell you is it ain't perfect but it's a Hell of a lot better than the cyclical struggle and pain associated with alcohol abuse and alcoholism. You CAN go from daily drinking for 30 years trips to the er and near insanity to a really good life. I laugh everyday and I learn everyday. ..It DOES get easier it DOES get better than it was drinking you CAN learn to face all experiences without alcohol. You CAN go from the gutter to a good life. You CAN be happy safe and stable again. No matter how low you feel you CAN recover from it. I know it. I believe in you. ..The trick is not letting your brain  outsmart  you. For me  This Naked Mind' was huge. Finally leveling COMPLETELY with openness and honesty with my wife family close friends and my medical support was imperative. Complete surrender and open and honest and complete involvement in AA steps and sponsor and helping others struggling is what really makes being sober a happy experience. I read a lot I work out a lot I have my nutrition dialed in and I stay busy doing productive things in my job and around my house.  My sanity is returning. ..I believe in you. ..IWNDWYT
