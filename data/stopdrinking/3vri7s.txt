Hey Spottie you're not alone. I am so so sorry you're feeling the way you are. Are there any other meetings near you that you could try?
Share on /r/dinos or here.  We'll listen...P.S. Check your inbox for an invite to r/dinos.
I'm right there with ya. Breakups are one of the worst things in life. They're like a death but worse in that we are cut off from the something we once had. And somebody else gets it. I know it is a hard thing to get through but it will be easier without having alcohol fucking up your emotions. I hope you are feeling better. :)

I'd start by sharing this with my sponsor. And maybe my Grand sponsor.
