I had a couple good AF streaks in the spring of 2018 and then a few days or a week here and there since. But since the holidays I have just been stressed and down and struggling to get through Day 1 AF (and I know that alcohol only makes depression anxiety and stress worse). I am grateful to read so many posts here about successes and feeling good. ..&amp;#x200B;

Just get through today. Tiwndwy...Check in again tomorrow.     
Hey blue sky keep trying. It sucks during this phase when you quit then a week later you do it again then again etc. Felt like groundhog day. I had no hope left. I would quit and hope anyway. Fail and try again. I would come here and read and look at badges with astronomical numbers of digits. Then I read here more and figured... I'm just going to keep trying to quit over and over and hope the rocket reaches escape velocity. It seemed almost random to me. ..Like nothing was that different. Keep trying. it's enough if it works once or a few times. Or rather... its way better than drinking the whole time. 
Hey welcome! We are glad you came here. You are not alone. This bnb place has lots of support. So do not be shy. Just be honest and we will help with what we can. And I know what you are going through. My wife left me a couple days ago and she is never coming back. So believe me when I say to speak up and be the bigger person you were meant to be.
It's o.k. Glad you are back.  You can do it.  IWnDWYT
