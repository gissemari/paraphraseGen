and I am not proud of myself but I will continue on. I had been doing well remembering the HALT acronym when I felt an urge then Thursday night I got incredibly angry at someone felt hurt and my sobriety went away. The thing that upset me is that I even told myself that the feeling will pass but I just didn't want to wait. I drank all weekend long had my last drink around 7 I am nursing an upset stomach but I am here!

Telling IOP will give them a chance to help you with it so there's something to hold your head up about. Glad that you're back!..Will not drink with you today. 
Next time talk to someone first. That is maybe the hardest thing to do because for me if I tell someone they can talk me out of it. ..I have begun just talking to another alcoholic about anything helps. ..Relapse is not a requirement of recovery but finding out how to handle the triggers is important too. Next time maybe you won't give in. Lesson learned. ..Best of luck. IWNDWYT
