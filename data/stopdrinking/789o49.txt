Haven't opened it yet.  Daughter gets home from school in 2 hours. Not sure what I'm after with this post but I am struggling. ..Update: Thank you for the support. Went for a walk instead. Not drinking with you all today.

Do yourself a favor and get rid of it. It's taking up space in your head.
Pour it out.  Throw it away.  
Can you call someone? get out of the house or do some chores?  Good luck stay strong.  I will not drink with you today :)
This won't mean anything right now but tomorrow you will want your 160 days.  Everything that can be said sounds trite but isn't really.  This Too Shall Pass.  Without knowing the suffering you cannot know the good.
Gawd I love Basil Hayden. Good luck.
