I fell pretty far off the wagon. Getting back is going to be hard. I'm tired of lying and hiding and being ashamed...I keep having anxiety about what happened the last time I drank. I was blackout drunk and said a lot of inappropriate stuff to friends and co-workers. Apparently I said things that are *not cool shit to say to people* like "Hey you got nice boobs I'd cheat on my wife with you. BWAHAHAHA." ..I heard that they are more worried about me than mad but I'm still embarrassed and scared that my actions will come back to haunt me. It was a big work party and a lot of people saw me acting like an insane alcoholic black out drunk. I'm trying to see the silver lining--at least now people understand why I didn't drink for a while and how serious my problem is. However it doesn't stop how deeply ashamed I am to know people saw me that way. This is something that has damaged my reputation and rightly so. I'm thinking about getting in touch with each person I offended and apologizing in person or on the phone one on one. I'm mortified to do this...I also sprained my ankle badly and I don't know how I'm going to explain it to my boss. I need to be able to function to make very important deadlines but I can barely walk. I'm in pain both physically and mentally. I need to take time to work on my spiritual and bodily recovery. I've been daydreaming about sending a email or having a meeting with my boss who is my mentor and friend. In this email I explain my struggles and the truth about what happened. There is a 90% chance he would understand and be supportive because we have a good relationship from 6 years of productive collaboration. But I don't know. The outcome could be much worse if he does not understand. How much honesty is too much honesty?.

Words are wind...I acted my way into earning back trust and respect. ..I find that many people say they need to take the time for themselves but go into that time off *without a plan* and it often ends up in a spectacular relapse and drinking binge...I decided to go to rehab. I applied waited and prepared for it. I made rehab work for me. Honesty and asking for time off is great but it never worked for ME until I had a plan to actually get better.
How honest are you being with yourself at this point?  What is the depth of your problem and are you really ready to do something different?  If you are what is your plan?  I just have a sense that "honesty" might be a bit of a defense for you right now although I could be totally off base.  "You can't talk your way out of something you've lived your way into." Consider making a plan for how you will live your way out of this (the [Baby Steps](https://redd.it/2i427b) are a good place to start).  Then don't just share your current state of shame with your boss tell him what your plan is to stay sober and ask him to support you in it.  Then you have an accountability partner on your journey...edit: punctuation
