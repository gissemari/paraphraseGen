Today's my 9th day sober and I had one of my biggest struggles this afternoon. I was leaving work and wanted nothing but to grab a bottle and drink tonight. I have off work tomorrow so what would it hurt? I knew I shouldn't so I told my wife I wanted to drink and she helped talk me down. I'm home alone all day tomorrow which is scary but I'll worry about that then...I will not drink today.

Workout first thing in the morning run some errands hit up attraction that doesn't have booze but can take up time. 
I both distracted and exhausted myself in the beginning. Usually by walking or hiking yoga or doing an enormous project that I would have never finished if I was drinking. That helped a lot in the beginning until I got a new routine established. A trick we talk a lot about here is "playing the tape forward". Think about where that drink will lead. Eventually to having to do those 9 days over again. When I think about doing my first week over again that drink suddenly doesn't seem so inviting. Hang in there! You can always spend time here with us! I will not drink with you!
