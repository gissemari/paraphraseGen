HI I have not introduced myself I'm kind of shy about sharing these details of my life but for the last month I have been sober and using this group to assist with my motivation.  Sorry for the late introduction.  Here is the situation I was working with a friend of mine to do this we were dropping booze together this week he relapsed bad when his old lady left him and I prolly would have with him except I was working 16 hour days at the time.  He was my sober partner in crime we would do normal stuff together without the need to drink send text check up on each other and keep ourselves sane during this process.  I feel this just got a lot harder and I feel I also have to help him out and get him to AA (something I have never done before) but I'm not in the best shape to be telling him how to live and I also need help staying on this path as it only has been a month. Advice ideas and anything else appreciated.

Get to AA for yourself. 
You're number one. We can't help others until we've helped ourselves first. Focus on yourself be an example. Show compassion but you don't need to save him. Save yourself my friend :)..Also welcome!
Thanks everyone I'm going to work up the courage to go to a meeting this weekend.
I'll be your sober partner here That is the best I can offer you.
