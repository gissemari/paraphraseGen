Hi everyone..Today's post is going to be quick. Life is getting busy again but in a good way. ..I went to my old Sunday morning meeting and was pleased to see so many familiar faces. It's a solid group of people who are pretty stable in their lives and mostly just seem to be doing the next right thing. I'm making it my home group. Stability is what I need right now it's close to me &amp; I feel good being there. It still feels good being clapped when I share my day count in meetings. ..The speaker talked about not dwelling on the past practicing acceptance and focusing on the here &amp; now. Many of the comments also touched on this. It was very timely for me as I face my behavior during my relapse. It is helpful for me to realize that focusing on getting my life right moving forward is more appropriate than endlessly beating myself up. It's also helpful to realize that I will have help from sponsor when I am ready to really deal with my past actions. Some of my behavior has been hurtful to people but at the moment all I can really do is practice acceptance and get myself back on track...I texted my temporary sponsor. It's nice to feel like I'm doing the right thing &amp; have it be so easy. We're going to meet for coffee this week...I cleaned my place up a bit &amp; made a pot of Greek lemon chicken soup. I'm having dinner with a childhood friend who doesn't drink for actual health reasons. I'm planning on talking with her about my alcoholism/addiction issues. I need more support and I'm starting to understand that when I share what's going on with me with people who I trust it deepens our connection. I owe this to the work I've done in therapy. I am so grateful for my therapist she was definitely the right person at the right time for me. ..Then it's getting myself set up for the day tomorrow &amp; off to bed...I hope that this post finds you all well..Ginger\_Sprout out
