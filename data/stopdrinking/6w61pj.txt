I managed to stop drinking nearly 3 years ago with no relapses but can't seem to summons the strength to take a tolerance break from my 70mg Vyvanse daily habit - what the hell is all that about?? 
----------immediate responses--------

I also take Vyvanse. I never take a break because I have ADHD everyday. It is a serious condition so why the hell do you want to take a break?
Congrats on 3 years booze-free firstly that's great news and well done!..My understanding (am *so* not a doctor!) is that many problem drinkers or substance abusers can suffer from addiction issues in other 'clusters' too to a greater or lesser extent.....Personally my 'things' are alcohol nicotine caffeine and cannabis... I have stopped drinking but I'm still struggling with the other 3 particularly nicotine.... All of these seem to 'push the same buttons' and light up that 'feelgood' bit of my brain that instantly demands *MORE* but can never be satiated.....Others might get the same effect from shopping addiction or porn addiction or cocaine or gambling etc etc......[This article](http://real-recovery.co.uk/addiction-treatment/addictive-behaviours/12-characteristics-addiction/) by Dr Robert Lefever was an interesting read on the subject incidentally... (his Ted Talk and YouTube videos are good too).....Sounds like your 'things' are (were) booze and Vyvanse (which is an upper of some type is that right?)... it's probably not doing you much good so if you're finding it hard to stop on your own perhaps seek the advice of a doctor and/or find a recovery programme (such as Narcotics Anonymous) which might help?..Keep us posted on how you're doing - I won't drink with you today!..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Kudos for three years!      ..I also take Vyvanse. I never take a break because I have ADHD everyday. It is a serious condition so why do you want to take a break? I am assuming you are diagnosed with ADHD.
