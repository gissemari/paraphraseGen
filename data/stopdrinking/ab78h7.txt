This NYE is day 50 for me.  I quit a 30 year drinking and smoking habit cold turkey.  I have seen an aspect of myself in pretty much every post I've read on here.  For those of you that have relapsed and shared your regret thanks it helped me not to say screw it on a few occasions.  The biggest changes I've noticed is I now live in the moment and feel way more emotion ( I'm a burly 46 year old man lol). My brain feels incredible and my clothes are getting too big.  .I can think of a lot of amazing reasons to be sober and not one legitimate reason to drink.  .I'm not doing anything else for support other than SD and it's been invaluable and instrumental in changing my life.  So many relatable posts.  .Thanks.IWNDWYT!
