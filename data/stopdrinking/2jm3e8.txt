Stood at the bar before the band started for a long time. Told the bar tender I was thinking...Ended up just having a Coke...The band I went to see is fronted by a guy who struggled with alcohol. And as soon as he started his first song an ode to losing friends due to suicide I knew I'd made the right decision to not drink...I used to listen to this band on repeat for days on end...And now it's been 5weeks since my last drink and I am so much happier...This is thanks to you guys. All of you. Your posts all of them have helped me feel more connected to this than ever before...You've made me realise how strong I can be. Alcohol was my crutch and while not drinking isn't helping much my job is no longer debatable and I have an interview for a better position next week...So thank you. And here's to another day tomorrow.
