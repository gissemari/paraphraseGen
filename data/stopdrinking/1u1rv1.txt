This time last year I got so drunk I woke up in the hallway of my host's condo building having "fallen asleep" on my way home...This year I'm anticipating being quite bored and a little depressed...Sobriety has been a very lonely journey for me. Aside from not drinking it's allowed the social anxiety I was using the drinking to control to rise to the surface in full force and even nearly a year later I still have not managed to conquer that particular demon...I know I'll struggle tonight with wanting to go out and not wanting to go out wanting to be around people and not wanting to be around people etc...How does everyone else handle nights like these where it seems culturally the only point is to get drunk?

&gt; This year I'm anticipating being quite bored and a little depressed...Low expectations means higher chance of exceeding them! :D 
Many people not only don't get drunk on New Year's Eve but they don't even drink. I'm sorry to hear you're struggling with fear of being around other people. I found AA comforting and supportive. I spent many New Year's Eves at meetings and parties with recovering folks. 
I'll go to a meeting and be home safe and sober before the "amateurs" take to the roads.
