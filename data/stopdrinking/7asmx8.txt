I awoke in a good mood today having gone to bed in a pretty low mood. ..I was thinking about it and realized that I feel totally happy today something I almost never felt when I was drinking.  I have so many problems in my life right now - my husband had a stroke in December in July I was laid off from the job which brought me to the US and I am now struggling to find another...Despite all this I feel genuinely happy today.  Sobriety is an amazing thing and I never want to go back to feeling overwhelmed and depressed even when my problems were small. ..I will happily not drink with you today.

Happy you are are happy! 
It sounds good to me!  I'll happily not drink with you today too.  I'm so grateful for the days with no cravings.
