Hello wonderful people of /r/nodrinking. My SO who I know frequents this sub for help and support has a (self-confessed) drinking problem and has recently had what I suppose one could call a relapse. I've been reading some of your posts and feel like it has given me a clearer understanding of her struggles so I'd like to start off by thanking you all for sharing everything you have.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Of course everyone is different and the same things won't necessarily apply for everyone but I'm very curious about the role your partners (or friends and family) played in you quitting drinking. What things did they do that you felt helped a lot or which you simply appreciated? What do you wish they had done? And on the contrary what did they (perhaps unknowingly) do that you found very difficult to handle?

try r/alanon or /r/ScienceAndKindness  they are subreddits for people dealing with a loved one's addiction.  And this sub is called /r/stopdrinking 
In my case it was truly an internal battle. My physical decision making capability was short circuited by this substance...I alienated my loved ones even when they tried to reach out because I perceived their good intentions to be pity. It was almost like I was physically present in a place but was looking at the world through a deep dark hole...An emotionally supportive friendship / loving relationship is something I would have really appreciated. But I know I wouldn't have been a good partner. .So I'm just grateful to a higher power for every day of sobriety and clarity I get. ..Something else I can think of is not belittling the person's problem. Plenty of outdoorsy activities and exercise would have helped..No human in their right mind would choose this pain if they had an easy way out. You're a good mate for trying to ask around! Good luck!
