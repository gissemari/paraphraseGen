It was so hard for weeks. And a few days ago suddenly it was easy. I don't know why or how long this will last. But honestly if you're struggling just keep in mind that it will get better. ..I did this fully expecting freedom to evade me for many months. I was prepared to ride it out for a long time..But luckily I experienced a dramatic improvement after constant 24/7 struggle. I know I won't drink tonight because for the first time in a long time I really don't want to..

Keep it up!   IWNDWYT 
So happy for you! I'm on 19 too and I feel like at least I have some strength and clarity to fight back when my alcoholic self says it's a good idea to drink or that drinking wouldn't hurt. I am starting to see through my own denial. I feel some hope for the first time in forever. So thankful. Strength to you and everybody on this journey.
I'm at 19 days an just posted this almost to the letter.  Not really sure when it happened but I realized it last night.  I'm sure cravings will come and go but right now I'm not thinking about drinking every minute of every day.  IWNDWYT!!
A friend of mine told she would consider me " dry " at 28 days.   I don't expect to feel much different on day 28 as I do on day 18 but we shall see I guess.  
Congratulations Way to go!! I will not be drinking with you today  
My experience was that at about 45 days I realized the craving was gone and had been gone for a few days. It has not returned so far
I love that you wrote this.  Thank you so much!
This is really encouraging and something to look forward to! Iwndwyt!
