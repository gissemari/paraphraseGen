Hi everyone I am new to reddit and came here as a recommendation for support with my drinking...I'd like to take this time to introduce myself and share my story. I have a tendency to ramble on so **I apologize if this is long** but I find it helpful to get my thoughts out there as I have nobody IRL to talk to...I'm a 31 y/o woman happily married. I have no children yet but I hope to start that process in the next few months if I can get myself healthy...All my life I have had a weakness for alcohol. Mainly I start drinking and am unable to stop myself. I have tried to keep it under control by only buying a small amount at a time but on most occasions I end up making a second and even third trip and in some extreme cases I have even driven under the influence just so I could go and drink some more. I realize this is stupid and I've been lucky to never cause any damage or get pulled over. This was mainly in my 20's and those incidents are now few and far between. I'd like to keep my clean driving record!..The drinking hasn't really had a major impact on me though until the last few years of my life. A long term relationship ended unexpectedly and it took a major toll on my mental and physical health. My (ex) BF was a personal trainer and he whipped me into shape we ate all the best foods rarely drank and my body was definitely in peak condition. I felt amazing too. We were together for 3 years and currently hunting for our own place to live. So once he dropped the news that he no longer wanted to be with me I sunk into a major depression. I quickly moved to a new town to start over... but I was surrounded by horrible influences. I quickly developed a daily drinking habit and one morning I remember waking up to an empty whiskey bottle... I had consumed the entire thing the previous night and couldn't believe what I was turning into...Anyways I gained 30 lbs and made several half-ass attempts to get my health in order again. However I didn't have the motivation to stick with anything and since everyone around me was always drinking I easily succumbed to temptation. Bad food too eating out a lot...It was during this period that I met my husband online. Moved to be with him. That was motivation enough to cut back on drinking big time which I did for a little while...Shortly after we met I had a major health scare won't get into the details but I thought I was going to die. I have suffered from PTSD since then which causes me severe hypochondria. To the point where I am afraid to get out of bed eat and do regular day to day activity...I also had to spend 8 months away from my husband for reasons I will not disclose only for privacy nothing wrong with our relationship. I sunk into a depression. Between that and my already fragile state of mind I turned to drinking again in an attempt to take my mind off of things...The mass amounts of red wine I consumed in those 8 months paired with new stress from my temporary living situation caused me to develop ulcers in my stomach. So at this point I'm a hypochondriac with a drinking problem and stomach ulcers. Regular visits to the Dr's office and ER became the norm. Fun!..When my ulcers would flare up it would cause me so much pain and agony I would tell myself that I'd never drink again. I would always return to drinking though after a few days when I felt better...I was no longer myself since that time and I have been struggling to take control of my body and mind since then. The ulcers are still there and affect my quality of life...The last year I have reduced the amount of alcohol consumed because I do want to rid of my ulcers once and for all. It is noticeably better when I don't drink I just never had the willpower to quit altogether...**OK I'm almost finished my story**. Fast forward to a few months ago I have finally managed to get the drinking under control to just 1-2 drinks per day. However it's still EVERY day. The ulcers bug me from time to time but it isn't as severe as it used to be. I still get a lot of gas acid reflux and bloating...I've also developed some kind of permanent foggy state of mind. I am always light headed and dizzy now and it's to the point where I have to be seated at all times...I did not think that drinking just a couple drinks a day could have such a bad effect on my health but I finally went to a doctor today after a very painful uncomfortable and restless sleep. She basically told me that I'm healthy but my electrolytes are probably unbalanced from the alcohol. She said even though I drink plenty of water the alcohol will screw everything up. She also noticed that I have a slight tremor...Dr's recommendation? Stop drinking...I knew it all along. I knew I didn't have any of the life threatening diseases that I have scared myself into thinking over the years...I feel stupid for spending $150 on a doctors visit only for them to tell me what I already knew deep down. But at least it is money that WON'T be going towards alcohol...**Because I have made a commitment now to quit drinking for 3 weeks**. Enough time to ride out any withdrawal symptoms get my nutrition and hormones balanced again. After 3 weeks I will either continue to not drink or only once per week. I'll have to wait for the time to come to determine my next goal...I've purchased a good quality multivitamin and iron supplements. I already eat well and drink lots of water but will be adding more meat (iron) to the diet and also some kind of exercise plan even just walking...And that my friends is a recap of the last 10 years of my life. I absolutely hate that it's filled with health scares and excessive drinking. My husband has become frustrated with me talking about my ailments all the time. I don't blame him by any means. He is very supportive and I am very lucky to have him. He deserves the best version of myself that he can get...I often look back at the time in my life when I was with my ex and my health was in prime condition and it makes me very depressed to be the complete opposite now. I've wasted the latter part of my 20's with poor health and I am determined not to go through my 30's feeling this way...It's good to be here. I look forward to meeting you all. If you have any questions at all about me or my story please do not hesitate to ask I am very open...Cheers.
