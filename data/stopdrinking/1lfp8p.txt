[I've been here before](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ekcvs/for_the_first_time_in_over_6_years_ive_been_sober/) in case anybody wants the back story...Last time I tried to quit it was on my days off that I had the most trouble and relapsed. My weekend this go round (tuesday-thursday for me) was a breeze...Anytime I didn't have anything around the house to do I went on a walk. Didn't matter if it was for 30 minutes or 3 hours it helped take my mind off the urge. I spent time working in the yard laying out in the sun by the kiddie pool cooking reading watching movies and sleeping in...Anyway just thought i'd post my new record. I was able to drive by the liquor store on the way to work today without even thinking about stopping there. I'm proud of myself. ..Thanks to everybody here for the awesome encouragment you have given me and to others here as well. Hope everybody has a good weekend.
