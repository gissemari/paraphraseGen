I wasn't a heavy drinker until I got with my fianc . He's always been an alcoholic as long as I've known him. But he's a nice alcoholic. He functions well and still gets up to work his 13 hour shift the next day. Hungover and exhausted of course. But he still does it...We are splitting almost about 2 pints of vodka 2-4 times a week. I'm finding that I'm not the nicest drunk. I'm insecure depressed and holy shit do I have a temper. He's the sweetest man on the planet and he doesn't deserve drunk me. But we seem to really struggle with quitting. ..I never thought I'd be an alcoholic. I've had a handful of family members drink themselves to death. My cousin wrapped his car around a tree while driving drunk and died at 24. I've never known my dad or grandpa to be sober. I never met my other grandpa because he died of liver failure when I was little. My ex husband used to beat me when he had too much moonshine. An ex boyfriend tried to drown me in the bathtub when he was drunk. I thought all of that would be enough to keep me away from drinking. Because I knew it destroyed lives and hurts people. But nope. All day I've wanted that bottle. ..I hope I don't ruin my relationship with this. Im super put together and a joy to be around when I'm sober but I'm a total piece of shit when I'm drunk. I've even made my best friend and boyfriend cry hysterically the other night because I was being such a monster. ..I'm scared of myself. But I still want to drink. It's that few moments where I feel content and happy. I feel normal like a weight is lifted off my shoulders. But it never lasts long because everything I try to bury comes rushing back and drowns me. I become angry and irrational and stupid...I'm an Effin mess y'all.

One day at a time easy does it. 
I'm sorry. It sounds like you need support. I know I did. If there has been trauma in life therapy is essential. I had a therapist and went to AA meetings. At first I didn't want to be sober and I kept drinking. I kept drinking until alcohol backed me into a corner. It betrayed me. I was addicted. ..Luckily my therapist cared and knew what I was going through. She got me into detox then rehab then outpatient treatment then AA and more therapy. Today I have a sober happy life. ..I wish the same for you someday. I hope you find a way to be sober content and happy.
