Had a stressful day today and normally I would instantly have a few beers or a strong drink to take the edge off. I've been struggling all day with cravings and I'm trying to keep my mind busy but it's all I can think of. I know it's not the answer. I find that it comes in waves too. Going to try and stay strong though!

Hang in there! It will pass. I sometimes have something to eat as hunger can make cravings worse. And it's never fun to try to catch a buzz on a full stomach. 
Cravings come but they ALWAYS go too. I know the last thing you probably want to do right now is write down how you feel and exactly why you feel like a drink. These cravings are triggered somehow and it's important to try and figure out what those triggers are and what else you can do instead of giving in. Good luck to you man! ..I will NOT drink with you today.
Let's not drink the remainder of today.  You are not alone!
