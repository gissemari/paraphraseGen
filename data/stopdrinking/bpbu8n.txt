Welp I made it through night two. So close to caving....thank y'all for your support.  I didn't realize how comforting it would be to have someone to struggle with.

Way to go ! You are never alone. I will not drink with you today  
Good job! No one can do this alone. Hang in there. We are here. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
Nicely done. The first days seemed like the hardest but it is worth it. We deserve to be free :)
Wonderful!
You broke the 24 hour cycle. That's huge! Congratulations!
Awesome job Allison. I promise it gets a whole lot better!
Good for you! IWNDWYT
Congratulations on a sober day: every sober day is a good day. Iwndwyt'
Well done! It is also effective to pledge with someone especially during cravings. I am pledging not to drink with you today and lets get you through night 3! :)
truer words! I'm so glad to have found these people. There's only one day - today - to get through. Keep going!
KEEP GOING!! You have 2-3 more days before it gets WORSE before it gets better - don't give up!
That is how I am surviving from the amazing group of people on here that are willing to share their heartaches their failed dreams what they have lost and how they turned it around hopefully that will be me as well...IWNDWYT
NICE!! Congrats. I second what you said about finding support here. This is still my first week. When I'm having a really hard time abstaining I chime in here and there's always a supportive soul to share a piece of wisdom or advice or just a reminder of why this is the right life choice. Best wishes going forward. You've got this!
I agree! I'm becoming slightly obsessed with reading all the comments on here. It's what is getting me through the harder moments.
Day 2 here for me too! We got this! .I will not drink with you today.
