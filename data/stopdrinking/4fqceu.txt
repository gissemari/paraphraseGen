I'm encouraged to see all the people achieving milestones today. I remember stumbling on to this site and subreddit from a Google "rehab" search a little over two years ago. Prior to that I thought an alcoholic was someone who was homeless and drank on the street 24 hours a day... that I'd throw some cash at rehab and be able to moderate afterwards!!! Looking back I was in denial and completely in the clutches of a bad addiction...For those struggling keep your head up and realize that almost any success in life comes at the expense of many failures. Keep trying your honest best..

Yay congrats on 2 years!  Celebrating 100 days here...looking forward to future milestones.  This site is a great support to me.
Congratulations!
Thank you for your post! Super inspiring. Keep it up!!
I think honest is the key word here.  I am good at not being honest with myself.  When I lie to myself about who I really am I drink. 
Thank you for the encouragement and congratulations!!
Keep up the good work man!
Congratulations and thank you for sharing your hard effort to inspire us just starting out. .I also used to view alcoholism as the bum drinking from the paper bag on the street. .I have a job I can't be alcoholic etc etc. it's amazing what you can achieve when you stop lying to yourself!
Congratulations and thank you for the encouragement through your post and your 732 days!
Good for you!!   Congrats!!!
Congratulations!
