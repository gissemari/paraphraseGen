Almost 3 weeks ago I stumbled upon this subreddit. I've been lurking off and on even got some good solid advice. So 6 days ago I made the decision to stop drinking. I quit last year and into this year but relapsed on my birthday in March. I'm hopeful for a longer run this time like forever and to help me with this I'm trying to put in a support structure so if I fall I don't fall to far. Or to say it better...have people to talk to before taking another drink. I'm hoping to make some friends on here to add to that structure but even just sitting here creating this post I feel better. I'll be up almost all night tonight so I'll be adding  more to this post. Thanks for listening.

Great decision on the support.  I need it too.  I'll be your quit friend!  Feel free to PM me.  
AA is just people you talk to before you have another drink.  That's it just one drunk helping another.  All the other stuff you hear about God the Steps is just add-ons...Think of it this way the first two guys who kicked a ball were playing soccer; today there are tons of rules about shoes and fields and uniform colors.  Same deal with AA.
AA is just a suggested program of action with the stated goal of helping you find a power greater then yourself which can solve your problem of selfish self-centeredness.  The process of inventory confession restitution willingness to let go of the bad and work towards the good prayer meditation and helping other alcoholics do the same has worked for millions.  The meetings are just add-ons yet many find value in consistent attendance and involvement.  They're also where you can easily find other AA members in your community to connect with...Give it a shot!  If you don't like it they'll happily refund your misery :).
