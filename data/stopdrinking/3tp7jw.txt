My husband and I quit smoking about 10 years ago and for most of those years he's been lying straight to my face about it. I finally got it out of him a few days ago. He made up all sorts of excuses why he's been doing it and hiding it from me all these years and one of the reasons of course my drinking. I wonder what else he's been lying to me about. I thought he respected me enough to at least not lie to MY FACE about it. I feel like a fool. Is this karma? Am I allowed to feel livid?  And I was actually thinking we might be ready to start a family...The thought of drinking actually crossed my mind in the past couple days. I know it would be to spite him and I don't do that anymore. After unsuccessfully trying to run it off here I am SD .. I won't drink today.

Your badge says 509.  He told you that one of the reasons for lying to you about smoking is your drinking that you stopped almost 2 years ago???..These things are really hard.  I hope it works out for you but I am very encouraged to read the last 4 words of your post!!!  Congrats.
Yeah that sucks.  Boy do I get the bad mood.  ..I was in a rage this morning because I could not find the card table.  We have two card tables in our house or garage--one has wobbly legs that's OK to drape a tablecloth on and set food.  The other the one I was looking for is stable and you can cover it with newspaper and do things like wash storm windows.  I spent two hours looking for it all over the house and basement (4 stories) and the garage the garage toolroom the upstairs of the garage.  No table.  I found the chairs that go with it.  Here's the thing my tools get taken by my wife my adult son and my daughter and never returned to the right place so if you want to do a simple project there is the initial not so simple task of assembling the frickin' tools.  Are you getting this?  I am MAD as HELL!  I am mad that I can't find the DAMN card table!!!  So I angrily tell my wife that I KNOW that one of my adult children took the table and probably left it somewhere where they played beer pong ... I"M ANGRY DAMMIT.  My stomach is churning.  I an hurt my wife is dismissing my outrage and saying I'm crazy insulting me further.  Of course wouldn't it be incredibly ironic if it was in my room all that time I was raging?  Wouldn't I be embarrassed?  That has sometimes happened.  So as the Big Book tells us we need to stay away from self-righteous anger--it's a dubious luxury...It was with much relief that my daughter did 'fess up to having the table in the trunk of her car for the last few months.  She apologized and I was fortunately over my froth when she drove home from her barista job at lunch to return it.  What has helped me is adjust my expectations for others and to begin to practice love and tolerance not only for my friends in recovery but also for the rest of the human race.  I also had to take myself off the hook for their personal failures and lack of organization.  I can't cure them I can't control them and I didn't cause them to be that way--but I can love and tolerate them.  They love and tolerate me.
