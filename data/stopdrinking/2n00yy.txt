Hi everyone. I've been a serial relapser for the last 12 months but finally got my ass to AA and now have 18 days of sobriety (I need to update my badge). ..I feel OK...In the first 7-10 days I felt GREAT. I had all this new found energy. I was clear minded. I was sleeping well. I was saving money. But now almost 3 weeks in and I just feel OK...I've had a stressful couple of days where things didn't go how I wanted them to at work (me trying to play God really) and I've been thinking about drinking this evening. Not that I'm going to drink tonight but just that my life seemed more exciting when I drank. Yes there were the bad times yes I suffered panic attacks the day after drinking but right now it feels like something is missing the excitement of drinking. I don't know what it is - I just feel 'meh'. Flatlined so to say...I go to the gym 5 times a week I go to AA I go to meditation classes but I still feel rather empty. Has anyone else been through this during the first couple of months? ..I just want to feel good like I did in the first couple of weeks. ..Thanks for listening.

Congrats on the 18 days!  I felt exactly the same way on day 19 and actually relapsed (badge set on the way).  I think the novelty of not drinking wears off and - in speaking for myself at least - I'm left with some extremely disordered and irrational thinking which I have to fight at all times.   Needless to say I'm not happy with my actions and know I'm human but still... I worked extremely hard on those 19 days and now only have myself to blame...It really is a daily struggle and I'm making the pledge to not drink today...I'm hoping that empty feeling passes for both of us..
Hey /u/BoatLifer -- nice to see 18 days sober for you.  The emptiness is a "feeling" or an "emotion" that goes away with consistent time sober if my experience is any indication.  Plus if you read as many SD posts as I do you will see that that is exactly how it plays out in early sobriety for almost everyone who hangs in.
I have two pieces of advice for what you are going through that helped (and help) me too. ..1. Treat your head like a bad neighborhood late at night. Don't go there alone and if you do have to go keep your doors locked and windows rolled up...2. Don't take yourself too damn seriously. Early sobriety is incredibly hard. Not everything is going to be great and not everything is going to be horrible. Take it easy on yourself...This has been my two cents hope that helps!
In early sobriety you may not always feel **better** but you will definitely feel **more**. ..Congratulations. You are having feelings and learning to live with them. It might help to welcome all feelings with curiosity and acceptance. "I feel angry/empty/lonely/sad/fill in the blank. I guess this is a feeling. Interesting. I can feel it now. It doesn't seem like it is going to kill me so that is good. I suppose I could try drinking to make it go away. Oh wait that WILL kill me. Maybe I would do well to talk to my sponsor about it or hit a meeting or..."..&gt; I just want to feel good..You will feel good. Then bad. Then good. That is the nature of feelings. They come and go. They change. And you know what? There are no "bad" feelings. There are feelings that hurt that are uncomfortable feelings that you wish you would never have. But they are all good. They give you information about what is going on your life. Take sadness for instance. I am sad today because my sponsor and kitty are both dying. The good news there is that I have loved ones in my life who mean something to me. It is not bad to be sad. It is just hard. ..Keep feeling those feelings. It takes practice and when we were drinking we didn't practice that enough.
In addition to the excellent responses already given I will add a comment. A sponsor and working on the steps was a wonderful personal growth experience. The steps gave me focus and I started to "fill up" from the inside out. 
The first few weeks for me were definitely riding the pick cloud.  Just escaping my daily hangover left me feeling AMAZING...But once I got to 60 days I was really struggling.  Hair trigger temper cravings all over the place....You just have to work through it.  It took about 3-4 months for me...Filling the emptiness is what the steps are for.
I know this sounds really weird and probably unhelpful but you're exactly where you should be and where I was at this point.  It gets better and it gets worse and it evens out then gets great again then quickly plummets....and on and on and on.  ..Early sobriety is a roller coaster.  But stick with it and feel those feels.  It is so worth it.
Hey everyone. Thanks for all the replies. I made it through without a drink and I'm so glad I did. I'll be 4 weeks/a month sober this Sunday which is the longest in a LONG TIME (since I started drinking 10 years ago)...Keep on keeping on.
