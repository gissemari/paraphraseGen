Spent Friday to Monday with my dad and sister. My dad is elderly and has dementia. My sister is his main carer and resents this bitterly. He now goes to respite regularly but she is still struggling. I talked to her about seeking support for herself as she is just becoming impossible to spend time with. She was vile to all of us all weekend despite insisting we went there. I did not drink at all all weekend - she claims not to drink when alone with my father but certainly drank an awful lot over the four days which made me even more determined not to. Am so glad to be home. Now six weeks sober and have told family members and friends that we saw over the weekend that I'm doing this. A very positive reaction from all of them - one friend said I was the third person this week to tell her they had stopped drinking. Checking in and reading posts on here has really helped over the last few days. IWNDWYT

Congrats on 6 weeks! That is awesome! Also good job on not letting your mean sister drive you to alcohol. If she drank a lot of the four days you were there then you know she drinks quite a bit. She may be jealous of your sobriety. IWNDWYT
I'm glad that you got to see your dad and sister...As the primary caregiver to my mom (double amputee dementia COPD dialysis for kidney failure and heart issues) I can understand how difficult this is for your sister. It's so difficult to deal with an elderly parent who is ill and suffers from dementia...we remember them as our parents but now it's time for *us to take care of them*...However I'm sorry to hear that she's drinking. There's plenty of support and programs out there I hope that she finds what she needs and deserves...Perhaps you'll be the example of sobriety for her...Do you get to visit your dad much?
