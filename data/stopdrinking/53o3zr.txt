Two days. It's not a huge thing for me because I usually don't drink much during the work week but these two have been especially hard for me. Last night was the hardest it's ever been to resist a drink and it made me realize I might have a problem. Just sitting on my couch thinking about the bottle. I have a problem. I haven't gone more than 4-5 days sober in well over a year. My mind is cloudy I'm crabby and I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. When does it get better?... because right now it's so hard...Edit: one day completed on day two. Yesterday was my first day.

Day 3 was better than day 2. Day 8 beats them all so far 
It usually takes me 3 or 4 days to start feeling human after a binge.  Lately though unfortunately  I've been finding it difficult to string more than 10 days of sobriety together.  I did have around three months alcohol free earlier in the year and it felt great.  Was more clear headed less anxious and had more energy and motivation.  I miss it and intend to get back there forever!..I will not drink with you today!
Hi again.  Please don't get too emotional.  But I am not drinking with you today either.  It's the most rewarding and gratifying thing we can NOT do together.   Don't  you think?  Strange but true...Have and INCREDIBLE day!
