I didn't realize I needed it until I had to drink a bit in order to do things. I couldn't get off the couch clean my car or go to work/grocery shopping unless I got a bit in me first. What a way to live. I hate myself for that and can't wait to have it behind me. I'm going to treatment tomorrow and hope it will make this struggle easier. I hope everyone is getting by today

Good luck /u/rustyMunkee -- I'm sure I won't be the only one looking for your updates.
good luck!
You are headed in the right direction. Best wishes.
Good choice..
Good for you on seeking treatment.  Check in soon if you feel like it.
Oh lord yes that was me! I had to bribe myself with booze to get anything done. Congrats on that awareness and determination to be quit of the behavior.
Good on ya rustyMunkee!..I've just completed a 2 week day program.  I did it before 5 years ago but just wasn't ready.  I've had "breaks" then relapse over and over for so long.  This time I was truly ready.  Hope you are too.
Same here. I could not do anything without a drink.  Earlier it had been a reward for me doing things; but in the last couple of years it turned into a necessity before doing things.  Good on you for getting help.
