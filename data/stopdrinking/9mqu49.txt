Lost my wife 6 months ago because of liver failure at 36 years old.  We had drank hard on and off for years.  I have drank at least something everyday since 2016 when I got back from my deployment to the middle east.  Fast forward to now I have been drinking more and more thru my wife's death and as of the last 2 weeks I am up to a 5th (750ml) a day sometimes more also havent been able to go to work because of it.  I've been trying to taper down and was doing well (pint a day) but got hit with really bad depression when drinking and thinking about everything that happened the last days with my wife.  I feel like I am losing the struggle (not suicidal) but afraid I am going to miss week two of work because I can't control the tapering down as well this time.  Any help is appreciated.

Can you see a doctor? There are medications that can help with the short term withdrawal symptoms...You're drinking a lot. Don't take stopping lightly at all.
A fifth a day habit will have dangerous withdrawals. Go see a doctor and be honest.
So terribly sorry for your loss. Most everyone here will likely tell you to see a doctor which is no doubt good advice. A script for something to prevent withdrawals and ease the process would be worth a quick visit. Best of luck and know that we are all here for you. 
Hey man you should not be drinking anywhere near that much with your kid around. I'm so sorry for what happened to you and this is not your fault but it is your responsibility. Jobs come and go your health and family do not. It might be worth taking leave and getting a ticket to the grandparents while you recover and can still be with your kid. There is plenty you can do for work to keep food on the table while you recover and your family can help with babysitting. Send me a message if you want to chat.
