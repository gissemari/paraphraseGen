90 days is a big deal but today my husband's truck has problems which really blows we've put a ton of money in it. So my husband is in a shitty mood. Yesterday I felt great today I'm irritable. I paid a bunch of bills so that rocked but I feel like we can't catch a break. Although we did with the probation fees. I try to keep him positive but I'm just as frustrated about the truck.  I miss sex but I'm almost always tired. Which makes me feel guilty.  Ugh. Up down up down up down.  Sober tho. ..If you're struggling you aren't alone but this too shall pass.

I think P.A.W.S. gets overused around here.  Life is full of ups and downs ya know?  ..Sometimes I'll feel great in the morning. Then the day will wear on and I'll feel a bit tired.  I'll look out the window and wish I was outside.  But then I'll get interested in what I'm working on and lose track of time.  Then someone will walk into my office and interrupt me and I'll feel hurried.  I'll drive home and feel frustrated with traffic. But I'm listening to a good podcast and it makes me feel interested.  Then I'll see some guy walking his dog and it'll make me smile. Then I'll get home and see what a mess my house is and I'll feel overwhelmed.  But I'll spend some time cleaning up and I'll feel content.  Then I'll think about hitting the gym and I'll feel rushed. Then I'll get a text message from /u/raevie and I'll feel happy.  Then I'll go upstairs to shower and remember a bunch of things I didn't do and I'll feel like kind of a loser.  Then I'll find something good on TV and I'll forget all about it.  Then I'll crawl into my clean bed and feel relaxed...That's normal. That's life.
Outside circumstances are always going to be there. Think of yourself as an unsinkable boat. You'll get tossed around but really it's what you are made of that matters.
