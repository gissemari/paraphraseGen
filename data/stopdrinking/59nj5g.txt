Just want to say I'm loving sobriety! It does get easier each day and this is coming from a serial relapser. I can't remember when I've gone this far without drinking and really want to keep it up...So Happy Hour at work is tonight and I got such peer-pressure about going from the owner of the company. I hate lying and making up some ruse but I'm too early in sobriety to go. I just know it's too much of a temptation. My husband (bless him!) is going to text me during the day saying he is sick and I have to come home to take care of our daughter...That's my plan and I'm sticking to it!

Good for you! I am right along with you in sobriety and I will be doging the dinner and drinks after work tomorrow for sure also. Like you I'm not ready to put myself in that position and have no idea when or if I'll be able to and I'm OK with that as of now. Also like you I'm LOVING sobriety! Let's stay strong together and not drink together today! Have a great day!
Brilliant idea! I always get stressed before nights out or drinking events until I realise that I don't have to go! I have been invited to many Christmas do's already and I have decided not to go to any of them. Lots of people getting pissed at Christmas doesn't sound much fun to me right now. ..I have been out while sober but just not when drinking is the major event.
Thanks everyone!
