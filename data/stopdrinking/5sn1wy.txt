Hey guys and girls curious to know if anyone (myself included) seems to struggle with very poor recall of recent events. I'm not talking about blackout nights as those are obviously skewed by the effects of alcohol. But I often have a tough time remembering what I did the night before even when sober or having had only a beer or two. ..Wondering if anyone else experienced this and whether sobriety helped you in that area. I'm 6 days into dry february and I feel great but also hopeful that maybe my memory will improve as I continue the streak. ..Thanks!

I posted earlier today about my memory loss. I suffer from major memory loss. Yesterday was a long time ago.  I have read several studies that give me hope that this will improve. .Congrats on day 6!
eh maybe nothing interesting happened?  LOL  Kidding.  I'm still hoping my memory turns into total recall.
