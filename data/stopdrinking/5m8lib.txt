I drank last night. I was with friends and I made the mistake that I will have "just one". There is never such a thing. I feel terrible today.   .I  am a longtime lurker and before this I was off of the sauce for over a month.    .Don't make the mistake I did last night; I will not be drinking with you tonight.

What are you going to do differently this time?
Staying away from the first drink is my favorite topic in AA. Coincidentally (or not) It was actually one of the topics for the first 4 meetings I went to! I learned a ton in those meetings but the biggest lesson was how important it is to just not take that first sip. 
Relapse is part of the path to recovery. If I spent one night drunk out of 30 days sober I would focus on the latter
Falling down is part of life. Getting back up is living. I wont drink with you tonight!
