4 days is great well done it takes great courage not to pick up a drink during difficult times - and it will get easier. I hope things get better for you soon. 
You've done an amazing thing!! Look at the strength of yourself and be proud!
Congrats!  Glad things are going better.  I won't drink with you today (or tomorrow since today is almost over for me)!
Congrats on 4 days! Yay!..I've been following your posts about your brother so I hope he's OK - please let us know how it's going :). Love strength and best wishes xo
