Yes we can!!!.
I won't drink with you today!
I'm with you all!
I am struggling today.  Thank you for this post and I will not drink (anything other than an ice cold La Croix) with you today. :).
I'm really struggling today and my wife broke down crying saying she isn't strong enough to stop me from drinking. She wants me to succeed but the guilt makes it harder not easier. 
Iron Man breaks out in handcuffs?? Get out of town!!
also Zakk Wylde and Matt Pike. bonus points if you can tell me which former member of guns and roses used to drink his own vomit to get the alcohol back.
I'm sober and right there with you!!
Awwwww. =D
