Hi everyone! Just checking in...Earlier today I read a post on SD by someone who's spending their 31st day sober and who's about to celebrate their first month of sobriety. I actually just walked past the restaurant where I spent my 30th birthday the other day on my way to a meeting. I'd reached a crisis point with my drinking a couple of weeks prior and for the first time I was consciously spending an extended period of time sober...I was still so shaken by my last drinking binge that I wasn't tempted to drink on my 30th birthday. I involve a large group of friends out to dinner and deflected drinks by saying that I was having stomach problems. Which was actually true heavy drinking had given me acid reflux...Looking back I wonder why I didn't just tell everyone that I had a drinking problem so I'd quit. I see now that I really could have. I was putting up barriers by not being honest with my friends about what I was struggling with. But in order to be honest with them I would've had to be honest with myself. I wasn't ready to admit that I was an alcoholic and commit to sobriety. I was giving myself room to backpedal...I made it to a month sober before I started drinking again. My first night drinking was a blackout disaster but my addiction took over and drinking seemed like the solution again. It would be four more years before I made it that long sober again. Those four years were intense and miserable a lot of the time and lonely. I ended up isolating myself from a lot of my friendships. ..I've heard it said before that anything that you put before your sobriety is something that you'll lose. This is another way that that has been true for me. I was afraid to tell my friends I was an alcoholic partly because I was afraid to lose my friends. And I didn't want to give up my good times with them. But things changed and my drinking isolated me. Those friendships mostly aren't the same now anyway...I picked up my one month coin a couple of weeks ago and I've been carrying it around with me ever since. It's not the first time that I've been sober for a month since then but it's an achievement that I'm still sort of amazed by. Amazed that it's so hard to make changes that so clearly improve my life. And amazed that I've been able to do it at least this far...I wish that it hadn't taken me so long to get where I am I've caused a lot of damage along the way and hurt other people as well as myself. But I am where I need to be now. I'm doing what I need to do today. And as long as I keep doing what I need to do I will end up with the life that is good for me. I do have faith in that...Anyway I hope that life is treating you all well sobernauts. I will check in with you again tomorrow...Ginger_Sprout Out

How interesting this post..  the saying about the losing of everything that gets put before ones sobriety.  A profound truth that.
