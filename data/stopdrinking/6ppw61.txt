Dear Alcohol..You are such an insidious thing. You really entice me and make me want to go back for more. Each time- when we meet I feel so good. So relaxed and like I can do no wrong. You help me think of such great ideas and visions of myself achieving amazing things.  You give me great confidence and support- especially helping me with my social and public speaking anxiety. And so....I absolutely fall in love with you. I feel like I don't need anyone or anything else.  With you by my side I'm on top of the world and man it seems like people LOVE me!..Then....I start to come down and feel tired. Instead of providing REAL love and support you tell me I just need more of you. No matter what time of day it is. Morning afternoon or evening. You tell me that only YOU have the solution to make me feel better and get rid of my depression anxiety and hangover; you tell me to give myself even more to you. You convince me that I will be fine if I have just a little bit of you. So I do that. And I feel great. I feel so great in fact that I have even more of you. After all- if something makes you feel so good- why stop right?..But then again- I start to feel horrible. I'm actually slurring and saying some really aggressive stupid things. I'm not at my full potential because normally I would have nailed the situation and people would have loved me. Instead I have said some things to others that have upset them and makes them scratch their head as to who I really am because the old me would never have said those things; I act like a total FOOL and like someone the old me would've either pitied or looked down upon.  How embarrassing. I rearrange my schedule so I can dedicate my day to you. I put off doing things I normally would do immediately so I can be with you and only you. I make terrible decisions.  Choices I would never have made without you urging me on. ..What kind of a friend are you I wonder? I look around and my place is a MESS even though I'm an OCD neat freak. What the heck happened to me?..Then...I look in the mirror and oh God- my skin looks disgusting my body so fat. And oh by the way those great ideas I had when I was consuming so much of you and you egged me on....I did NONE of those things. Not even one iota. It was all "pie in the sky" when the old me would have achieved 90 percent of that in two months. What the heck happened to me?..So- after all the fun and fake confidence- I feel like a total loser. Someone who can't control my problem; is owned by another; shackled and in prison. And the worst of all- it's all my own doing. After being kicked in the face stomach head- you name it- I keep coming back for more. What does that make me.... a masochist? What the heck happened to me?..Alcohol- I really hate you. You are an asshole a total jerk. And honestly- an abusive person and I am the willing victim. I give you credit-you hold your head up high and continue on. You have hurt so many people but you don't care. Wow- you have some guts! And I have always been so scared to confront you. ..So I sit and think- why would I want someone like you in my life? I am an accomplished loving normal and rational person. I've achieved everything I set out to. Yet- you have imprisoned me. You have owned me for close to 12 years. And you did it ever so slyly. So---what the heck happened to me?..I am sorry to have to tell you this because you and I go back a long ways. This is hard.....but I've realized for years and have FINALLY realized for good....I don't need you in my life anymore. You have drained me to the point that I now have very little left. And like the fly in the pitcher plant- you have enticed me and sucked me in over and over and over again. If I let you- I will be sucked in to the point of DEATH. And I have too much to lose to give up that easily. ..NO. ..Today I have decided that you will have to go. I don't need you in my life anymore. You have always "been" my best of friends. Today I realize - you are my worst of enemies. ..The come-down will absolutely SUCK. But I will do it. I've been through worse. And when I come out on the other end I will read and re-read this letter to keep me away from you. To remind me of how you have so eloquently brought me into living HELL for over a decade. ..I can't....and I won't.  I want to see the light of day...and I WILL. ..Goodbye Alcohol. I may miss you at times but I don't ever want to see you again. Please respect me by staying out of my life....forever.  I'm going to find my old self and I will finally feel safe and secure after the LONG detour you took me on you f***ing asshole.  ..Leave me alone. Or I'll have to get a restraining order. ..God bless all of you struggling like I am today. I love you all and wish you nothing but a sober and happy life. Here's to a fresh start....

It feels good to get it off your chest. Greener pastures :)
I've felt a lot of those feelings.  Thanks for your post and I will not drink with you today.
