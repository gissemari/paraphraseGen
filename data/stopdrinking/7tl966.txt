It's the first time in a few months that I am headed into work without a hangover on a Sunday and a huge part of that is because of SD. I also changed my routine on  Saturday; made a point  to do some things around the house and then drive to a friend's house that night for dinner (we had Cuban food and it was awesome!) .My buddy lives about an hour away and I told him I'd be there and I was. Holding myself accountable made a big difference. Whenever I would reset my badge and post about a relapse the one reply that would stick out is someone asking what I'll do different next time. Even those small changes make a huge difference. Thank you guys for the inspiration and support. IWNDWYT.

Congrats!!  I'm at 763 days and heading to work without a hangover is STILL such a wonderful feeling.  When I first quit and felt like drinking I would remember how GOOD it feels to wake up with a clear head and a clear mind and not be hungover.  One of the hardest things for me at first on the weekends was the amount of free time I had and I slowly learned how to fill it with non-drinking things.  I became a much more productive person.  If you don't mind me asking what are things you've changed this time since resetting your badge??
Congrats on a great non drinking victory and on 8 days. I will not drink with you today.
