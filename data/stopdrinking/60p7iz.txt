So a couple of days after relapsing after gotten through the hungover and the shame I got to the gym and did some lifting. Damn did it feel good it made me realize how well I did have my life in order at some point...Three maybe four years ago I used to have a rather steady schedule of lifting thrice a week doing yoga twice a week and biking to work. I had a good posture - something I've always had problems with. I was strong and healthy and resilient not only physically but also mentally. Then anxiety started piling up and I started to drink more and more. A vicious cycle. Haven't really had any sort of a proper routine to my life ever since. I slowly fell to "doing some lifting" every now and then but never committing my physical condition on a slow but steady decline. Then why bother I said to myself all the while slowly getting more and more anxious more depressed getting drunk more often...Last year I had a nice four months of sobriety which did quite a bit for my mental health - but not enough. Went to the psychologist after New Year got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder came to the idiotic conclusion that it never was the drinking after all relapsed. Been putting the pieces together in my head today. Yeah sure not all of my problems were due to the drinking to begin with I suppose. Nevertheless a lot of them were and even the ones that weren't I'll never be able to fix if I'm drinking...Time for me to take a look at the bigger picture what sort of things do I want to have in my life what sort of things not? Alcohol for sure ends up in the latter category even if considered alone. But when I think of things like the prospect of standing up straight again being clearheaded present healthy happy - hell even feeling normal would be nice for a change - being able to cope with my stress and worries in a productive way then the lifestyle that that requires the lifestyle that I already had and enjoyed at one point that won't even leave any room for alcohol. Not the way I would be doing it...I don't think I ever did this last year with my sobriety I never completely understood the roots of my unhappiness. I'm not saying I do now either - it's just that this time around I see more. There's so much in my life right now to fix and alcohol's just one part of the equation. But it's a concrete and clearly identifiable part...So for the time being I'm going to start off easy lay off the booze and instead lift heavy things and put them down again three times a week. No goals other than just go there and do the thing. No biking or any of that just yet only lifting. Try that out for a month see how that works out. Briefly record my mental state at least on a weekly basis. Pretty sure I'll have enough material to draw some conclusions after the month.

A therapist was very helpful in guiding me to a better understanding of myself. I needed more than lifting to stay sober. AA gave me sober living tools. Stay in touch. 
Awesome insight!
