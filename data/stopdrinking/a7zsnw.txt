We got a new computer system at work a few months ago and the default login password given to me is  changemenow  which is still my password bc I'm too lazy to change it and I remember it. But just *today* I realized that every morning at work I type  change me now . Hmmmm I should take that to heart and realize that I am typing the words so that the change in ME is up to ME. Thanks to our awesome IT guy for unknowingly helping me on my journey. It's a struggle and I'm not ready to share my lapses but I am doing better. One step at a time? Right now I'm taking a little bit of improvement as encouragement. Not as strong as most of you but you all.Inspire me all the time and I will continue to come back here to read your stories and inspiring words. Thank you thank you thank you SD folks

One step at a time - sometimes they're sideways when you notice they're sideways just point your toes forward and step forward again.
