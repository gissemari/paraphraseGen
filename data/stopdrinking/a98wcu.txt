And if this were the past three years running I'd be getting shitty! I've always hated the Holidays because of bullshit family drama (that I stubbornly held onto letting go is such a powerful healing force) being a very transient person living in the tropics it was a work day and a bank day at that so we generally thought nothing of it other than holiday pay yay and then there was the whole being embroiled in divorce proceedings during the "happy holiday season" of '14 to cap it all off. So yeah the "triggers" to drink historically always raged supreme during this time of year. But someone on here the other day mentioned (claim your quote if you're reading this!) that "triggers don't pull themselves" which I suppose a bit akin to guns don't kill people people kill people; regardless it really hit a nerve. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've been trying to step into my existence and choose to live life passionately vs just run away and hide from it (depression and anxiety and a cadre of undiagnosed mental issues are super fun to deal with on the daily! Not!) which means interacting more with my family more and being invested and active in their lives. I've had a turbulent relationship with them who hasn't really everyones human and just doing their best but we all end up with scars along the way. I truly want to and do believe this. Plus no one is getting younger here and I'm seeing people my age (I'm only thirty!) losing their parents at an alarming rate. There's that "times a ticking" motivation but also the additional kick in the ass regarding the fact that I've been absent the last three Christmases for them. After they've made a supreme effort to be there for me.....&amp;#x200B;..After my ex-wife walked out and I was facing my first Christmas alone after having her around for the last seven my parents flew out to Maui to visit me (and they NEVER leave during the Holidays because of work) and keep me company and make a as-fun-as-can-be-considering-the-circumstances experience. They even bought and shipped me a silly fake palm tree with xmas lights. Haha. I wasn't as embroiled in being a super successful alcoholic (if you're going to do it do it right right?) but our family as always rallied around the booze and a I worked at a brewery and I got an assload of free beer so lets just say we were all a little hazy and emotional. ..&amp;#x200B;..The following Christmas they came out again and stayed with me and my (also alcoholic) ex-roommate. It was a SHIT SHOW of epic proportions all the way around and I was so caught up in my own pain (emotional/psychological and self inflicted via drinking) that I was getting wasted on hard liquors until 3/4am pretty much every night and being completely not present the following day (duh!). They were showing themselves around and experiencing life and I was hiding in my room lamenting my situation (there might have been some pity parties) and seriously missing out on life. I got schwasted on xmas eve (duh!) and was hella hungover on Christmas I also ate a pot cookie and was still high at like 3pm and freaking out. Mixing metaphors! Yay!..&amp;#x200B;..Last Christmas I had just recently made the move back to my hometown for solid and positive reasons but I was still all over. Change isn't easy for anyone and I was struggling not to mention all the triggers from my "past life" with my ex were EVERYWHERE. Not bueno. So guess what! I got drunk face again on xmas eve by classily stealing beer all night from my parents fridge after we'd already imbibed quite a bit and I definitely didn't need anymore. I was "hostage" at their place because it had snowed and I drive an '82 Volvo in the hilly NW which was a definite no go. I wouldn't get out of "bed" aka a couch right in the living room until like 11a and clearly wasn't a very present participant. I was muzzy and grumpy and nothing pleasant. Even after they had again made a great effort to make it homey and Christmasy and tradition-y without being too memory filled. Fail!..&amp;#x200B;..What's the moral of the story? I've missed out on a lot by drinking and I'm acutely aware of how much this time of year. I don't want to do that this year and I WON'T! I'm setting my intention right now I will not be the drunk kiddo who can't participate in a positive manner on Christmas (or Xmas eve for that matter) because I'm drunk/hungover. I'm really excited about the presents I've gotten for my rents mostly action/activity/experience filled things because memories &gt; things! And they just sent me the link to the cat tree they got my "kids" (two cats Maka and Z) which is adorable. ..&amp;#x200B;..I hope you all can hear what I have to say rally behind it in your own way with family/framily/pets/self and have an amazingly happy holidays! IWNDWYT!! Peace!..&amp;#x200B;..TL;DR: I've been supremely drunk face the past three xmas eves and thusly ragingly hungover on xmas while my family has gone out of their way to be present and make the holidays a good-as-can-be-considering kind of experience. I don't want to miss out on life and love and their company this year so I'm setting my intention to not be that person this year!
