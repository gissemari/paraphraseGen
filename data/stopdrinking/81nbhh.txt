Every time I stop drinking I worry about withdrawal. The only thing I seem to get is a pressure in my head and increased anxiety. I just feel so bad thinking over the things I've done and the point I've let my life get to and facing it sober instead of laughing it off over beers with all my drinking buddies is a very sad and lonely thing to do..The things I've done and the person I am while drunk and because of alcohol isn't something I can tolerate any more. I don't want this shameful life for myself. I haven't been proud of who I am in a really long time..A family member recently got a DUI and I went to the courthouse for their hearing today partly to support them but also to force myself to be in that room knowing it could have easily been me on several occasions. It's one of the most dangerous and shameful things I've done and as bad as consequences in my life have been they could've been WAY worse on so many occasions..It made me feel regretful and ashamed which is good to a certain extent but it also made me feel a bit more compassionate towards the people in the room and towards myself for the mistakes I've made. So many people were there pleading guilty and they all seemed to be decent good people that just did an awful thing and paid the price. .As much as addiction is a taboo and something many view as weakness there is also an incredible strength and humility in the people who I've known and seen take an honest look at their life and find the strength to change something so consuming..I don't think it's something a person that does not struggle with addiction can understand fully. And I want to be one of those kinds of people! I know it's possible and I'm just hoping it's really going to stick this time..Today was a really hard day but I made it through sober and am so grateful for it. .To anyone else out there struggling with feelings of guilt and shame and self-loathing I just want you to know you're not alone. I'm here with you and I will not drink with you today. :)
