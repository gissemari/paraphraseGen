So I drank all weekend starting from Friday night but I've been sober today (it's late afternoon right now where I live). Surprisingly I have hardly any hangover so I haven't had to struggle too hard to stay sober today. But I have this one bottle of wine left from the weekend. Knowing it's there is constantly at the back of mind... I know the smart thing to do would be just to pour away that damn wine (it isn't even expensive or anything) but I can't seem to bring myself to do that... Can somebody say something to help me get rid of that stuff?

Pour it down the drain. Now. Get it out of your mind. Then come back here and post and join us in not drinking today.
Good God get that shit out of your house. I didn't even finish reading your post before I started typing. ..Do it do it do it!
