I got through my exams without losing my mind too much and now I get to enjoy a short break which is great as I can finally rest. Quitting and studying was hard but I did well so I'm glad I stuck with it. One thing I notice now that I'm not drunk everyday is how I'm already starting to put slightly more effort into things. Cleaning up stuff trying to make a meal that bit better keeping track of stuff and all of that. Luckily my relapse wasn't that bad so I don't have any bad withdrawals but it's still hard to stay in that no-drinking mindset. I'd like tot think this time is really the time I stay sober for a long time again but I said that before my previous relapses to. I really want to stay aware of any thoughts creeping into my head which will subtly try me to get to drink again. The 'it's not that bad' and the 'you deserve a drink because..' rationalisations. Drinking just doesn't work out well for me...&amp;#x200B;..I think forming new habits and keeping yourself somewhat busy is important but besides drinking/drugs studying and chores I haven't really done much the past few weeks. I want to start with tiny steps as doing something is better than nothing and trying to do too much in this phase of getting sober might be too difficult. I want to try and exercise a little bit everyday (even if it's just a walk through town) read a chapter or two each day drink a green smoothie everyday drink a maximum of 2 cups of coffee every day and not smoke weed or drink alcohol. I think that's very doable and a good starting point. Thanks for the comments on previous posts. IWNDWYT. On to day 6.
