Hi everyone..I'm 28 years old been drinking a lot for 10 years. I've attempted to quit several times this year and have been successful for 10 days in a row using this sub. Really need to quit as I have a job that I'm in potential of losing. Been at my job a year (Oracle Business Analyst) and when I first arrived my reviews were great. Now my manager had noticed that my performance has slipped the last few months. ..I'm having anxiety attacks and although I haven't gotten into serious trouble with the law it's affected my relationships with loved ones and work. Gosh the idea of quitting is tough. ..Over Christmas I was at home with family and they all drank but they know my struggle. So I didn't drink for 5 days while at home. I looked and felt great. But for some reason I started up again due to boredom loneliness etc. Gonna be hard to actually face my fears as opposed to delaying them until tomorrow. But at least I won't have a furious hangover that cripples my productivity. Gotta look on the bright side! Thanks for listening and I won't drink with you today...J

I'm glad you're not giving up. I'm not giving up either. Good luck at work and good luck with staying sober. I won't drink with you today.
