Going to bed soon. Day two down. Feeling pretty good so far. I've spent a lot of time on this subreddit and it has been very helpful...I play music semi-professionally so I am constantly surrounded by booze and boozers. The test will come when I have to venture back out into that world later this week but for some reason this message board full of people going through similar struggles has given me a level of determination I have not had before when I've tried to quit...So thank you very much for that. (And thanks for the badge!)
