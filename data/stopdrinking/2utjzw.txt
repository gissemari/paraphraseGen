So I've been sober for over a month now some struggles but lots of supportive people have really helped me along...I just had a really good and productive day at work and my first instinct to reward myself was 'you've earned that beer'! But I know I'm not drinking today so I'm trying to find something else to treat myself to...I would love to know what do y'all do when you want to reward yourself?

Cheesecake.
How about rewarding yourself with a nice meal? Buying yourself a small gift as a reminder of your hardwork? A nice massage?
Slurpee!
Since quitting the booze I've found that chocolate gives me a nice little sugar high. Never liked chocolate all that much while I was drinking but now... Butterfingers are heavenly!
When I got my one month chip in AA I drove to the bar right after the meeting.  I was in the parking lot getting out of my car when I realized I should go find a new way to celebrate.  As for what I do now I keep a quart of delicious chocolate milk in the fridge.  Alternatively I treat my fiancee to something small.  A card her favorite cookies a surprise date night. Rewarding the people in my life is usually more rewarding than even chocolate milk.  Usually.  
I bought some jeans on day 100. And it was awesome cause I'd lost so much weight in 100 days (25 lbs) it was actually FUN trying them on!  I love actually deserving a reward!
Chocolate!
