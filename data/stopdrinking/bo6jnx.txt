Today I attended my first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous felt a lot of warm welcomes from people who understand the struggle. Every day is either hour by hour or one day at a time. Seeing people with years of sobriety under their belt it really felt eye-opening to see I wasnt alone. And that I can keep this up! IWNDWYT!

I plan to go again tonight! Met a really great group of people today and they gave me the courage to share my struggles. It felt like a ton of weight had been lifted off my chest
Good for you. IWNDWYT
