My school year is about to start up again and I have sulbutiamine which I have used before to aid with the fatigue I deal with every day. I pretty much only will take them when I study because they help me concentrate. I am in AA and I don't really know what my peers will think of nootropic use. I don't see using them as a relapse--I don't want to drink or use drugs other than caffeine. Also can't find any posts about this online.

I go by "can I buy it or sell it in the Tenderloin at 3am?" If yes it's not for me.
are you getting high?
Ask your physician.
I'm prescribed meds for my lifelong insomnia sometimes they take HOURS to kick in so 2 days ago I took them on the train home since the night before they took about 4 hours to finally work and I got very little sleep so was trying to make up for lost sleep. Needless to say I had NO IDEA they would give me a buzz if I took them and had to stay awake through the effects guess I've been sleeping through it all as intended. But whoa I was wobbling through the grocery store getting my dinner and went straight to bed once I got home but I don't feel like I relapsed at all just was trying to time my meds right...I think if you're under medical supervision maybe you should do what your doc says over and above what AA thinks? I don't know...
