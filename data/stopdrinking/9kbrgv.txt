I've been examining my triggers here lately and despite being an active lurker I've been relapsing a couple times a week. I'll just think of it as research. I recently went on meds to treat ADD and good god am I tense at the end of the day. I get that keyed up manic panicky feeling then can't quit obsessing over wine then end up making an excuse to run to the grocery store (omg I NEED hot pickled banana peppers or I can't eat this chili dog was one that I used last week to make a wine run). The inability to relax even though Im exhausted by 5 pm = recipe for disaster. ..SO...Bought a deep tissue percussive massager to use on my neck and shoulders. Holy shit I can relax after using it. I yawn! I'm sleepy! I can breathe! This is a game changer. ..Looks like my cravings could be due to unmanaged tension. Since I can't relax on my own I HAVE to go get some wine. Well now I have a way to physically relax. I hope this discovery makes a difference! I'm trying here!

Also the news these past few weeks has added to the tension. I feel like I should detox for self preservation but I also can't look away!
Be sure to talk to your doctor about how the meds affect you just in case they need tweaking. It often takes a few changes to get it right because everyone is different. Glad you're relaxing!
