I have no problem at all when home but when traveling I struggle to stay away from the red wine (my only vice). Free booze on planes lounges hotels etc. ..It's been about 2 years I have been fighting with this and it's landed me passed out in my room with no idea how I got there. So ashamed. ..Fortunately today my shame will keep me sober but what to do tomorrow???
