I have been up to two pints of Evan Williams a day. Two Thursdays ago on lunch at work I started to get faint and got the shakes. I excused myself to the urgent care across the street and they informed me I needed to immediately go to the ER at Beth Israel (NYC)...There I received two EKGs was given Librium and liquids via an IV. The doctor recommended me for detox but I have a job so she suggested outpatient as an option. I was clean for 5 days and relapsed. I am currently home from work after scaring myself and almost fainting on the subway (I drank yesterday again). I plan to get myself together and head to detox today hopefully to be put on a taper regimen...I am worried about my job they like me and I do good work but I have missed several days recently due to this. I plan on explaining myself to my immediate supervisor tomorrow. If you have never been through withdrawal it is terrifying. I thought I was having a heart attack I couldn't control the shaking heavy breathing shortness of breath and I thought I would pass out at any minute. ..Luckily my blood work said my kidneys and pancreas are functioning which I was scared of. I just wanted to share. This community is wonderful. We can all do this but it is certainly difficult. Someone else on here once said it was like "living life on hard mode". I couldn't agree more.

my employer was veeeery understanding about me going to detox and I would have lost job if I hadnt (drinking during day). if you can get FMLA paperwork for Drs to complete to give you some protection...proud of you!!
Wd and the effects of alcohol/drugs still terrify me to this day. Esp when i think about how much worse it can get...exponentially..Takes a lotttt of courage to medical help amazing job. .
