This is a shameless steal from the front page I'm sure some of you saw it. https://youtu.be/3lJlFA14rHw?t=2..It reminded me of myself...Some get away others are blinded with short sightedness. They all feel the pull but only some see what's happening. ..I can't let the pull of alcohol trick me into staying when I shouldn't. ..The vortex is real only some escape.

Well that creeped me out I won't drink or eat corn with you today.
Whe...where did they go?  ..Edit: Nevermind I went to the FP and found it. Poor creatures. *Stop filming and scare them away dammit!*
So *thats* where the tangy after taste of popcorn comes from!
