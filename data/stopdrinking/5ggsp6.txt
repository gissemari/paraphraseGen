Hi Guys!..I'm glad I found this sub...My mom has been sober for over 20 years but used to go through a box of wine in a few days and buy gum with her food stamps to get real money back to buy wine.  ..My dad had his legal adult competency taken away for drinking so much that it was causing Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and alcoholic dementia/alcholic related brain damage.  He was having his life-savings drained by his "caretakers" and didn't know it.  A head's up teller noticed and called the Sherrif...He now lives locked up against his will in a nursing home as a ward of the state and think I was the one that locked him up.  ..As for me my main struggle in is severe ADHD...I was diagnosed in 1996 - and after going through some treatment options decided ADHD wasn't a real thing - I had character flaws - that I could beat on my own through heroic efforts...I tried it all - even living as a Zen monk on a 300 acre monastery - meditating 3 times a day - living in a small hut in the woods - sweeping the same porch and cleaning the same things everyday.  No contact with the outside world...I watched a video of an ADHD expert and realized it was a real thing...A person could eat a lot of carrots to make their bad eyesight better but it wasn't going to go as far as prescription glasses...I went from denial to full acceptance (after some mourning).  I got a bunch of ADHD books the best ADHD coach in the world and got on meds.  My life is night and day difference...As I'm working with the coach I realize because of my low self-esteem from years and years of failure and disappointments from ADHD that I am really lonely and don't have any friends or much of a social life.  My coach and I realized how important it is for me to be more social.  I'm pretty isolated and not naturally social.  ..She encouraged me basically to get out more.  Also to go to Al-Anon which I do once a week now...I never really have had a drinking problem.  However I am not sure how to be social or socialize without it involving alcohol aside from sports...I've had an Achilles tendon injury for about a year now just because I don't do my physical therapy exercises so I recently got really serious about my rehab exercises.  If my Achiles tendon's get better I can join a sports league and that's mostly a non-drinking social event...So Friday night (as I type this it's Sunday afternoon) I recently went to this formal gala ball thing in Charlotte NC where you bring a toy for underprivileged kids for Christmas.  I went to that because I reached out to a very popular acquaintance saying I need to get out more.  He said he was going to this thing and I should come along.  People were meeting up at his house.  A couple of drinks at his house free drinks at the event (2 glasses of wine) we're having fun let's go to the bar next door.  More drinks.  Bad hangover Saturday.  Wasted day Saturday.  Off my carefully fought for sleep routine Sunday.  ..I honestly do not think I have a drinking problem.  I know I know but I mean I don't feel a compulsion to drink during the week or even the weekend.  When I'm out I go along with what everyone else is doing.  I rarely go out though.   No way do I think that everyone who was drinking at that ball has a drinking problem.  I remember binge drinking a few times in college but now I may have a glass of wine and just feel like that's enough and really not want anymore.  I did meet some really cool peeps - which was the goal.  ..Seems society really endorses alcohol. ..**I guess I'm here now because I recognize that with my goal of getting out there more and being more social it would be easy for me to dramatically increase how much I drink** (from maybe a glass of wine when I go out to dinner to the situation described above) **and I don't want that.**..I think it's better for me to draw a line in the sand so I can get out there more and feel confident that it's not going to cause all kinds of other problems or sabotage my ADHD progress.  ..If I get invited out to another drinking event I do believe that will be challenging - especially because I already feel socially insecure.  ..I want people to like me.  In some situations I'm confident but not as much around the guys I hung out with.  They are exceptionally popular alpha male types.  I can look and pretend the part being 6'3" and workout a lot etc. but I already feel like a bit of a charity case so like the not drinking I think would be just one more thing around them to make me not fit in.  That's where I feel like better not to go alone but reach out for support!  ..As a last note I will not be participating in AA (as described above I seriously do not think I have a drinking problem. I don't drink a lot at all.) but I will continue participate in Al-Anon...Also is there a stop drinking sub sub reddit for Charlotte NC?

Hello and thanks for sharing. One doesn't need to have a full blown drinking problem to decide their life could be better without alcohol. Socializing can be a tricky situation for a lot of people with or without drinking. I try to avoid things where drinking is the main and only event. When I do go out I plan ahead what I'm going to have usually club soda. I've found that most often other people don't really pay attention to what's in my glass. I order all of my own drinks and if someone offers to buy me a drink I just say no thanks. Most of all I know my limits crowds stress me out and when I start feeling uncomfortable I leave. It's great that you recognize that drinking could turn into a problem and you're being proactive about it I wish you well.
