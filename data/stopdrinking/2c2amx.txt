It's a looooong story but because I was an officer it took them a year to kick me out. "Conduct unbecoming of an officer" for the alcohol incidents and fraternization charges took me to Captain's Mast but my discharge papwerwork just says "Failure to adjust to CG life." ..I stayed sober throughout the whole process because I knew a drink would only make it worse. ..Anyone walking that path now? Did anyone else have that happen to them in the past?..If there's enough people maybe we should start our own thread to talk about the military NJP process and give each other advice... I just recently met a guy in a meeting who is really struggling with it himself. Military NJP can be scary and difficult to navigate by yourself. Hopefully your command is supporting you but I met two navy guys once who were given no assistance whatsoever.

I am so sorry /u/accidental_alcoholic -- is there an appellate process or have you exhausted that aspect?
Very sorry that you have to go through this but it's awesome you're staying sober!
I myself was booted out of the navy for one incident of underage drinking. Then when i went to San Diego i ran into a lot of boot camp buddies that had a few DUI's and such while in and were doing just fine after some NJPs...I thought i was over this until i did my 4th and 5th steps and now im angrier than before because of how i was treated.
