Hello everyone!..I am so glad that I found this community.  Today marks my fifth day of sobriety and I want to share a little about myself. ..I've been a self-aware alcoholic for several years now. I'm a 31-year-old woman who also suffers from bipolar Type 1 with psychotic features. My life has taken many unexpected detours and was often chaotic but I managed to get a fellowship to complete a Ph.D. program about five years ago. Although I've had two psychotic episodes during this time (one requiring a week-long hospitalization) and several other setbacks I've completed all of my requirements except for defending my dissertation. My personal life has been unstable but I teach my classes I work tutoring other graduate students in statistics and writing and I juggle several research projects at once. That tenuous professional stability has been frequently undermined by my relationship with alcohol and now I have precipitated a crisis that threatens to detonate all of this progress. ..Over a week ago I was pulled over for swerving out of a lane late at night. The second I saw those flashing lights behind me I instantly knew I was fucked. When the officer asked me how much I had to drink I honestly couldn't remember. I had been bar-hopping earlier that night primarily focused on drowning my sorrows rather than "partying." I had an awkward encounter with classmate/friend wherein we made out for a little bit but then he told me he didn't think I was attractive. Because I had already been struggling with a lot of self-worth/body image issues lately the remark hurt me probably more than I should have and I continued my lushery while he left me alone at the bar. Although my memories from that point forward are checkered apparently I thought I was in a position to drive and proceeded to make the worst mistake of my life. ..I blew a .20 BAC during the stop. I know that for some people this is a level of intoxication at which they'd barely be upright but my tolerance for alcohol was such that I was able to communicate without slurring answer questions and follow directions well enough. So I remained very compliant during the stop and the subsequent arrest.  Back at the station the arresting officer asked if I recognized him. Indeed he was the officer that subdued me during my first psychotic break in town until my parents could come to pick me up and take me to the hospital. During the entire ordeal he was very kind to me telling me he had been worried about me asking me if I was alright and giving me a blanket while I waited for my roommate to pick me up. When you feel very stigmatized and screwed up you really appreciate things like that. .. However the reality is that I've royally screwed myself and the people around me in several ways. My roommate who has been with me through two psychotic breaks and the aftermath of a rape that occurred when I was passed out drunk appears to not want to be around me anymore which I understand. She's completing her comprehensive exams this month then leaving for another state once she graduates. The guy I was (nonexclusively) sort of dating for a couple of weeks also decided that I was too much of a mess. My parents are extremely worried about my well-being and it hurts my heart to know that I've caused them this amount of stress and heartache particularly while my dad has been recovering from a VERY near-death experience (weeks on ECMO and months in the ICU) since last summer. I'm also facing down this DUI and don't know exactly what to expect from my penalties although my lawyer has assured me that she can get the charge pleaded down from a high-tier (for the high BAC) to a low-tier. I'm hoping that no one in my graduate program finds out and that my penalties don't interfere with my ability to perform my obligations or secure an academic position as I go on the job market this coming year. ..I have been aware of my need to quit in the past and have pulled off two months of sobriety before but now it feels very much like a do-or-die situation. I'm mortified at what I've done and that I potentially endangered others and have alienated people around me. I wasn't too proud of my drinking behavior before all of this either. I'm often sharply embarrassed to learn about the way I acted after a night of drinking in that I can become a little combative and very touchy-feely not in a sexual way but in a way that makes other people uncomfortable nonetheless. Alcohol has also been a factor in sexual violence perpetrated against me twice and was also involved in an unsuccessful suicide attempt I made before coming to graduate school. I know that alcohol exacerbates my mental health problems contributes to depression and potentially interacts poorly with my medication. When I list off all of the reasons I know that my drinking has screwed my life up I feel like an idiot for not taking sobriety seriously enough in the past. But now I'm seeking to move forward and want to make a declaration to other people that I simply cannot do this anymore for my sake and for the sake of people around me. ..Once you've screwed up this bad how do you get your self-worth back? What helped people the most during their first weeks? What keeps you motivated and inspired? How do you stop the useless self-recrimination and stick to your path? There are so many things I want to change about myself and the way I live and I sort of feel like I'm learning how to become an adult for the first time. I'd really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions &lt;3.  ..

Bipolar 2 (with some features of 1) academic here. People with much much more experience of sobriety here can talk to you about that (I'm all of 26 days in) -- I will just say a couple of things about my experiences in academia and bipolar... 1) I have never heard of a DUI impeding someone's academic career. I'm sure it varies by field and university but my college didn't even do background checks at all until a couple of years ago (after a particularly bad hiring experience). On the downside academia has a massive drinking problem (my department often has wine at department meetings one professor brings it to graduate seminars every departmental and university social occasion involves alcohol). Alcoholism is almost expected and no one treats it as a serious problem.   ..  .2) Bipolar and alcohol is such a horrible combination -- it exacerbated my mania (filling me with massive rage) and also worsened my depression. I was self medicating with it for years before I got a proper diagnosis and a mood stabilizer that works (Lamictal FTW!). I have found that having the right meds and therapy helped me be in a place that was conducive to sobriety (and as you said the meds work better without alcohol). I have found having a good psychiatrist and therapist extremely helpful as is dialectical behavioral therapy/ cognitive behavioral therapy. Otherwise for motivation I depend on this subreddit. I am going to start going to SMART recovery meetings this week. 
Hi there I'm sorry to hear that you're having such a difficult time. ..I understand self-medicating for anxiety and depression with alcohol. I drank because drinking made me feel better. It genuinely did - my anxiety went away and I felt significantly better when I drank. When I didn't drink I felt like garbage. ..I've gotten sober a couple of times and in my experience I don't start to consistently feel better until I've been sober for more than a couple of months. That doesn't mean that every day was difficult or that I felt terrible the whole time but I did not get to experience the full benefits of sobriety until my nervous system had a chance to recover and do some repair work. It takes more than a couple of days for the brain and body to make headway in repairing the damage caused by years of drinking. Also antidepressants definitely are more effective if you aren't drinking possibly other psychiatric medications as well. And just as an FYI benzos ..It helped me to learn about PAWS (post-acute withdrawal syndrome) and you might find it beneficial to read up on that. I found it easier to stay sober longer once I understood that I was going to periodically have days where I felt rough throughout my first year or two of sobriety. Instead of catastrophizing how I felt I was more able to maintain perspective and to recognize that how I was feeling in that moment would not be how I would always feel...In my experience beating myself up about past behaviors did not help me stay sober. In fact it made it a lot easier to relapse. What I have found works is practicing acceptance of where I'm at and focusing on my immediate responsibilities. When I first got sober there were days where I just focused on doing what I absolutely had to get done that day and that was it. I took care of what I *needed* to do and then I focused on taking care of my sobriety. The longer I am sober the more I am able to deal with various life challenges. I needed to put my focus on staying sober because without my sobriety my situation would inevitably grow much worse. My goal was to fall asleep sober and as long as I did that I considered the day a success. Some holes take a while to get out of and that's okay. The most important thing is to make sure you stop digging...What has helped me stay sober during my longer periods of sobriety is accountability and support. I posted here daily for my first three months of sobriety both this time around and the last time that I got sober. I also went to a support group meeting (usually AA) almost every day. I wasn't super-involved with AA last time around and I stopped going to meetings after maybe six months of sobriety but I credit those meetings that I did go to for the length of time that I was able to stay sober before I relapsed about a year and a half...Not everyone who gets sober attends AA and going to AA meetings in itself won't keep a person sober but it's a widely available and essentially free resource that is worth checking out. There are plenty of academics (and generally smart and talented people) in AA. I was actually talking to a woman last night after a meeting who's a department chair at her university and I'm friends with another woman in the program who's a tenured professor. There are also a lot of people in AA who have dual diagnoses and who might be able to provide support. ..My experience has been that when I show up in a meeting and talk about what I'm dealing with I feel better and I also tend to meet people who have useful things to say. I also just often hear things in meetings that are highly pertinent to where I'm at even if I don't say a word about my particular situation...It has also been a great way for me to learn about how to live a sober life and has helped me build up a sober social support network...There've been a lot of posts on here where people have asked about AA. Searching the SD archives should give you a lot of information about what people have experienced with AA. ..As far as feeling better about yourself I have a friend in AA who talked once in a meeting about how she rebuilt her self-esteem by doing esteemable acts over a length of time. I'm finding that the longer I'm sober and living a positive life in sobriety the better I feel about myself...I hope this helps. Keep going it takes time but it will get better. Sending hugs!
