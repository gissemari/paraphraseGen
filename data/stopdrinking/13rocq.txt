**Here's why I went:**..I thought I could do it alone and I'm doing *ok-ish*. Nearly 10 months sobriety now. But I'm depressed and lonely. I've taken up running but I run to escape rather than run to exercise. Every activity I pick up seems to be a distraction from some persistent level of anxiety. Sometimes I get swept up in the activity enough to be able to forget; I run to the point of exhaustion until I can't feel my legs and my gasps of breath hurt in my chest. Friends that I've already told I'm trying to stop drinking recently invited me out for drinks to cheer me up. I turned it down because I felt weak but missed out on the social element of hanging with my friends. It's all they seem to do now when they meet up. I need to address the depression. The loneliness. I'm not meditating any more and feel a bit like a scared rat...**Here's how it went:**..I chatted to some of the members about how I've stopped alone -- reading up about horror stories on /r/stopdrinking getting a badgebot badge and the Android app [Habit Streak](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.amimetic.habits). Admitting to friends. Meditation. Some members seemed surprised. They said they couldn't have done it without AA. One said they had gotten a year under their belt solo but were horribly depressed and resentful of those that could control themselves...From what I heard from the 'shares' (a 'share' is a personal account from a member about struggles and achievements they've been having recently that they wish to tell others in the group) it was a very varied bunch of people -- ..Some lived and breathed the 12 steps and praised the Christian God for showing them the way ..Others were outspoken atheists that identified with *"the human's ability to fantasize about concepts like a god in times of great need"*. They said the 'higher power' was AA. Being with others. Sharing their trials and connecting. Empathising. A power that you can't get alone. .One atheist said *"the same person drinks again"* -- so you must work on changing who you are and this is no easy task...All of the members began with *"Hi I'm <name> and I'm an alcoholic."*. I didn't share even though there was some pretty heavy nudging from the others' shares :-P..**Thoughts:**..I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. I know that I've been suffering from some sort of major depression for 2-3 years now and alcohol was a nice escape from that. Perhaps I just have lower than normal levels of seratonin/dopamine/norepinephrin and can't naturally experience happiness the same way others do. All I know is that alcohol helped me feel sane and socialise. I was self-medicating. But it was a slippery slope and soon I was much worse off binge drinking every weekend one beer implied another.....I'll keep on going and see how this plays out. I like that my local group has such a mix of viewpoints and yet all seem to accept eachother through their common problem...Take care all on /r/stopdrinking. What you're doing isn't easy and I respect you for working on your problem.

Whether you decide to call yourself an alcoholic is up to you. The only requirement for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking. There are no qualifiers on that. Whatever your reason it's good enough...If you are open to continuing to go to meetings my suggestion is to try a variety of groups. Each meeting has their own vibe. Personally I found that the more young people at the meeting the more fun people seemed to have.  I am an atheist who sobered up at 33 with a wonderful group of people in their mid to late 20's...Good luck. I wish you the best...
Alcoholic is just a label.  At this point our culture has such a severe misunderstanding of the word that it might be better to discard it and invent a new one.  What I think it means is someone who can't stop at one drink (and doesn't even see the point in just one drink) someone who thinks about drinking often or all the time and/or someone who has suffered personal harm or embarrassment or has caused damage to their relationships as a direct or indirect result of alcohol and yet won't seriously consider quitting...I also think alcoholism is a tendency rather than a defined state or a benchmark.  Too many people told me I wasn't an alcoholic because I hadn't killed anyone in a car crash or because I didn't drink in the morning or I hadn't gone to jail for a DUI or gotten drunk and hit my wife or... (insert imaginary scenario here)  Technically speaking I think it is possible for a person to be an alcoholic even if they have never had a drink in their lives simply because that tendency will be there partly due to genetic reasons...So don't get hung up on the label.  If removing alcohol from your life has solved your worst problems it's clear this has been a good move for you.  And if it's revealed other problems that were previously masked or hidden then so much the better.  These things are opportunities for personal growth.
I've just come back from an AA meeting and as a result I don't want to drink...That alone is a good enough reason for me to go back to another meeting tomorrow because I want to feel like I don't want a drink tomorrow too. ..Keep going back till you want to go back that's the best piece or advice anyone every gave me...Good Luck - oh and treat people who call themselves Atheists and people who praise Jesus with equal suspicion. Steer clear of anyone trying to force their idea of God or their idea of no God on you. You'll find the real sober ones don't do that  - find them and stick to them like glue..
I'm a noob in sobriety with only 68 days so I don't know if I have much room to talk. I'm an atheist doing 90 in 90 and AA has certainly helped me.  It has allowed me to open up after almost 20 years of ignoring my problem with drugs/alcohol. If not for AA I would not have come to that conclusion I'm certain.  I disagree with a lot of what AA/NA have said to me one of which is that I was never in control.  I have been in control yet my selfish self still chose to drink because I thought I had things under control.  I have a choice tonight and I choose not to drink.  AA is a melting pot of folks with the mind of addiction and sitting in those rooms gives me perspective on my own problem.  I check the crap at the door when I leave but I'm thankful they exist because where else can a group of addicts talk openly about the pains of their chronic illness. ..My sponsor tells me that if I complete the 12 steps that I'll be this enlightened and happy person and I'm in no position to dispute that but it's still hard for me to believe.  I'm still struggling with the 4th step and will continue to work them to completion but I have little hope that if my family is never whole again that I'll be happy due to working 12-steps.  Only time will heal that wound if I'm faced with it.
this is a cool story
Thinking if you need a drink to feel normal thats not normal.
