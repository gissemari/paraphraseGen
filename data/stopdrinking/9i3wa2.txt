I'm working on Day 6 been going strong... Until today. The weather's beautiful and I have all my chores done for the weekend. The thought of going out to get a drink in the sunshine won't leave my mind. I thought if I gave it an hour it would pass but no such luck. Any words of advice?

Oh i drunk last night and today feel sick.. vomitting.. brrrr       alcohol tricks  everyone... 
Nooooo! Having to restart on day 1 SUCKS! Go for a bike ride a swim go help a frail older person cross the road. Visit your family buy some flowers go watch a movie! So many fun options! Go to an AA meeting - they're actually really therapeutic and often involve lots of laughs..Stay strong- I'm going to believe in you. You can do it!
Keep chugging along! The sunshine feels so much better when you are sober! Iwndwyt
