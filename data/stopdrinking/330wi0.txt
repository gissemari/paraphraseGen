Today I respect others' rights to their beliefs just as I respect my own. I bring my love of openness inclusiveness and harmony with me wherever I go...If You Want What We Have.  1998 by Joan Larkin.. .********. To be open I must believe there is something to be open to; that's what I mean by spirituality. At the very least I need openness to my own future. ..San Francisco Calif. August 1995. Practical Enlightenment .Spiritual Awakenings..*********.Ebby T. suggested to Bill W.  Why don't you choose your own conception of God?   All that is required is an open mind a willingness to believe.  Adherence to any particular religious doctrine is not required!

For those who don't like the higher power thing ... how about just don't do AA? It isn't the only program out there. Check out SMART Recovery for example. They probably have a meeting in driving distance from you.
Have been agnostic in AA for a while now am tolerant of beliefs of others they are of mine in return...In the beginning I made it much more complicated than that wasted time and energy doing so but I had to figure it out for myself.
I'm not religious.  BUT. I have found so much peace in taking the time to be more intraspective. Replace "higher power" with "how I am thinking. In this moment." Taking the time to think about your actions and thoughts can be highly relieving. Journaling has been a strong force in my sobriety at the same level as AA. 
Here's a translated version of the 12 steps that's become kind of popular here:..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head..Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers.so I'll ask for help..Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life..Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life..Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal..Step 8: List everyone I have hurt..Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me.
I was raised in an ultra-religious home even home schooled; All my education and youth was religiously slanted. I rejected God at some point in my 20's became an atheist but found myself feeling whimsical from time to time about the idea of a higher power. The main problem I had was that that alongside religion I rejected all the good values that go into it as well. It left me a vacuous sarcastic petty atheist with no concern for the human heart or spirituality. I used the "higher power" thing as just one of many excuses not to go to AA and have done so much damage to myself and others over the years. I'm just starting to lift my head and try to find a new way of being to be happy and add value to people's lives.
