Hello SD! ..Just wanted to check in and say hello. I made it to about two and a half months sober. Went on a week long vacation with my family who are all heavy drinkers and I relapsed. Nothing crazy or destructive happened but my progress was thrown away and that's upsetting enough. .So here I am back in the saddle. I didn't drink today and tomorrow is another day.

Welcome back!
Nice!
Welcome back. How are you feeling after a week on the booze? 
Can't say I wouldn't have caved either.  Pick yourself up dust yourself off and try again!
Welcome back!
