Long time lurker first time poster.So ashamed of my drinking - finally confessed it to my psychiatrist and then he set up a follow up appointment for today - I was supposed to take action like look into outpatient programs if I can't stop drinking on my own. I haven't done either. I'm dreading this appointment. I feel like such a failure. Though there is good news in that - I've read drinking a love story this naked mind I have been listening to podcasts on sobriety. I'm just still also drinking too much - 5 beers last night. So I am looking for support - I'm inspired by this community. Is it ok that I am moving slowly with sobriety? Is it ok that I feel shame and dread about this appointment today? Is it ok that I am struggling with this? I shouldn't drink because of the meds I'm on for anxiety and depression.  I'm working on it...

You have taken the first step and that is important..I will not drink with you today
Welcome friend! It took me many attempts before I was ready. Talking with your therapist about why you haven't looked into any programs just might help you move forward...I will not drink with you today!
It's great that you have made some strides in your journey. The feelings you are having are totally normal. Just be honest with your doctor and yourself. You will commit to no drinks when you are ready. You have taken the first steps. Congrats on that. You can do this. Have faith in yourself. I will not drink with you today.
There's no shame in seeking help. My first detox was done in a hospital and so were a number of the ones that followed. I realised pretty early on that I have a problem.
