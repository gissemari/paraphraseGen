each of my loved ones is going through a significant life experience right now. my husband (major depression) parents (cancer recovery and depression) sister (suicidal thoughts - now on medication/in treatment) best friends (one divorcing abusive husband another dealing with strained marriage).... ..I'm an empathetic person and *of course* want to help my loved ones through their difficult times. but I'm also going through this huge personal transformation by choosing sobriety and I feel so alone and drained after our interactions. like no one really understands *my* struggle and how much energy it takes just to have a conversation right now let alone an emotionally dark one. part of me feels so selfish even typing that...last night was bad. after a whole day of phone calls emails Skype chats and texts to make sure everyone else was OK I sat in bed and cried for a very long time. woke up this morning still drained. ..what do you awesome sobernauts do when you're overwhelmed by taking care of other people? I used to drink til the blind euphoria kicked in. but I obviously don't want that to be my "solution" anymore. thanks in advance!

That's difficult. You may need to seek support/undersdtanding outside of your immediate family. Friends? Therapist? SD? :)..I will be pulling for you. You can do this!!
Can't believe what you are going through.Its hard enough dealing with one problem. Wish I could help other than telling you to stay here all you can and I know others can help you. Good Luck !
My heart goes out to you. Have you tried to distract yourself with something interesting? I like to read True Crime books. And Dickens. Takes me away from it all. I'm sure you'll get some good ideas here too. Best wishes will be thinking about you. 
I limited my exposure to people who I struggled with if they were getting too much. I learned to assert boundaries to say no to let others help out or trust people to seek the support they needed for themselves - I can't be the only member of their support network. I knew I wouldn't be able to help others if I wasn't able to put care of myself and my sobriety first above all else...I compared it to the airplane safety advice  *Please put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others*  Sometimes I've had to be 'good-selfish'...**WWSDD** Love it! I want the wrist band!!
.No answers here! ..The best I can do is let you know I am standing beside you and reverse your situation as a warning to myself. I currently have no family in trouble so I better practice being strong now!..
No answers either my support group helped a lot early on.
Mani/pedi download an escapist book onto my kindle have a bubble bath call a sober friend order your favorite takeout (or cook a favorite meal)...basically I do stuff to pamper myself! 
You're 18 days sober. **You** are going through a significant life experience right now. ../u/finally_woken is 100% right: your responsibility is to yourself first. What are you doing to build your support network? I have a lot on my plate right now: increased work responsibilities; I just bought a home; I have a second child on the way. I have a lot of things to take care of but I can't do any of it unless I take care of my recovery first. It's ok for you to take a break and put yourself first. It is not your responsibility to be everyone else's support system.
I remember when my dad was dying of cancer. That was probably the lowest I have ever been.  It was a long two years.  I got hammered every night. It made everything worse and I knew it.  Some things I can't avoid but I can avoid drinking which always makes me more depressed and anxious. Good luck with your friends and family.  I will not drink with you today.
I am a lot like you it is hard to figure out and overwhelmingly stressful and friggin lonely sometimes. This [quote](http://imgur.com/ElcphMe) kinda brings me back down to me. I get on here (I comment &amp; try to share &amp; help others still) I do yoga I do some hobbies I try my best to take care of myself - I think I am just wired to be a people pleaser but I am learning to balance with taking care of myself too. Hope you feel better!
Move something heavy. Exercise helps me focus and remain calm in a world that is anything but. It's also important to understand that I can't help everyone AND I can't help anyone if I don't first help myself.
Wow! That is a lot. I'm super proud of you for being committed to your sobriety. ..Here's my list: mani/pedi a massage cook a nice meal buy a new dress (or even a little accessory that reminds me of my journey) tea smoothies a friend date with someone supportive therapy exercise a good book Netflix/Hulu/streaming app of choice... If I come up with anymore I'll come back. I also struggle with self-care between school work a depressed partner and a step-son! 
Currently I'm making sure I have an obligation-free weekend so I can recharge take naps or do whatever feels right at the moment. Carving out that time for myself always helps ground me.
