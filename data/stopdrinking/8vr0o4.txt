Here we go again. After several relapses. I don't actually know are those even relapses. I don't know did I ever until now made the actual decision to stop. I think it has been more like: "I'll give it a try and see what happens" without dedication and commitment. ..Now after a week I feel fine. I feel like I'm not anxious depressed or anything like that. I feel completely neutral. I have no desire to drink and only few times that thought has crossed my mind but was easily shrugged off...I did smoke some week last weekend to make things a bit easier. It's not for everyone maybe in a long run it's not even for me. But right now I can handle it without overdoing. As a medicine not recreational :)..I could write a book about the stuff what has happened in my life during 1 year. I have wrote here and other subreddits before about it. Maybe I'll write something more in-depth to here later but right now I have no focus...I'm on a vacation. It's a trigger especially now when my kids are at with their grandparents for few days and I have zero obligations. Yet I have no desire to drink. This is new to me. It's so new and alien feeling that I'm almost scared. I know things will get harder at some point. Highs and Lows follow each other. I should just embrace this now and prepare to the fact that cravings will start at some point...Ok maybe I have enough focus to write things that has helped me during this year (not in any particular order):..- Meditation and thinking a lot of stuff.- Shrooms (they can really kick your ass if you have issues to deal with).- Weed to comprehend shrooms and back up meditation.- Wife.- Children.- Most open communication with my wife during our 15 year path.- Family therapy with my wife where I admitted to outsider I have drinking problem..- Friends.- /r/stopdrinking.

Hi thanks for mentioning /r/stopdrinking in your list nice gesture :)..You may not have focus to write but I think you like doing it am I right? Some less talked about benefit of quitting is all the new free time due to not having to make plans not being hungover and so on... So why don't you use some of it to write down whatever you like? I'd love to read it!
I thought I would embibe alot on weed when I first quit but I really haven't. I smoke it once every two months maybe but it never accomplishes what I hoped it would. Maybe it's just getting older but I am so happy with my sobriety that I don't give any of it much thought
