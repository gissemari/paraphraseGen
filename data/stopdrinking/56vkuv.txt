Pardon the bragging but I'm feeling pretty damn good right now...I own a small art gallery and picture framing shop. I bought it last year. I/it has REALLY struggled this past year. My mishandling of the stress of it all took my drinking to astronomical levels. I just did not handle it well and didn't know what to do. I KNEW drinking wasn't helping. I just didn't realize how much it was actively hurting me and the business...Art Walk (a Second Saturday art gallery stroll kind of deal) is usually the peak stressor. Tons of people I have to juggle a million things it takes tons of work and money to set up and run and it's just the height of insanity to do all by myself. So naturally it's normally a huge drinking event for me and my patrons. The wine flows freely...Last Saturday was my first sober one. Not only did I hold it together but I managed to interact as well as usual (alcohol has long been this introvert's social lubricant) and was MUCH better at juggling all those chainsaws. ..My reward? I made a huge sale which is rare for Art Walk. It's normally a social event and mostly attended by lookie-loos. In fact I've now made 3 big sales since I sobered up which is as many as the last 8 months put together. ..It turns out people are slower to buy things from a depressed drunk stressball of a human :)..The business is still very tenuous but I'm facing it in a much healthier way these days. Thanks for everything SD!
