I just felt like sharing this. I was supposed to have a little get together with my ex and I know I've put her through a lot but we both had just came back from some trips and I had reached out to her last week about catching up sometime next week she seemed receptive. Well this week I hadn't heard from her and sent her a text asking if she was still up for it and she apologised she hadn't really thought about it since we talked and that she's busy. ..Well I learned a new trigger today because instantly I envisioned guzzling my brand of whiskey and drinking myself into a coma. Unlike the millions of other times today I texted one of my friends that knows what I'm struggling with and told them I needed to come by after work and was warmly welcomed no questions asked or hesitation. I told another close friend the urge I was experiencing and he gave some support and encouragement. I still want to smash a bottle right now but I'm trying my best to reason with myself. I know why I want to and I know it will not help at all...I just wanted to vent to you people. I'm somewhat proud of myself to reaching out to my network of support instead of reaching out for the bottle. I'm learning. Making positive steps. It helped put the demon at bay a bit. I got this. Today I stay sober.

Generally speaking reaching out to Exes in early recovery is not a good idea.  There is just so much emotional and mental baggage that is associated with it that it can be very dangerous to your sobriety...This is why safe healthy support groups can be so valuable to people early on.  For the most part their only goal is to provide support to your sobriety and receive the same from you.  ..Great job on your 9 days!!  Keep it up.
