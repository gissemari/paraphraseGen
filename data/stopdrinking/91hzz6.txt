There is so much great insight on this sub but I am struggling today. I have shared before I am a binge drinker and with the exception of a semi binge a couple of weeks ago I have been sober for 2 months. I read that not drinking makes your head clearer and a better outlook but that is only half true for me. I have also read that alcohol use may mask bigger issues and I have been seeing a therapist but today I feel like saying *#$# it. The short term high at least replaced some of the periods of frustration and anger that I feel. I have a beautiful wife great kids and a good job that affords me to live a "comfortable" life..I know I'm not alone in these thoughts but would sure appreciate some direction.

I could not do it alone.  My rationalizations my fuckits my fears anger and more were enough to convince that I could drink 'just this once' and I did - more than once...I needed AA - despite my agnostic dis beliefs my hatred of being told what to do my suspicion my fear my isolation - it worked for me..there are alternatives now try one try em all..or not.
Something that helps is to replace the  it  with actual nouns...So instead of  *#$# It  replace  it  with..*#$# Wife *#$# great kids *#$# good job *#$# comfortable life...See if that makes ant difference.
Saying *#$# it is alcohol trying to get back through the door... via self destructive thinking. You know what that does so instead say *#$# that! The short term high lasts roughly 15 minutes while the rest is warding off the the hangover. I find eating a lot of food and drinking water helps every time: it gets rid of the craving and gives my brain the energy to overcome frustration/anxiety/anger. Be well and best of luck. I will not drink with you today.
For me the well-being part was a function of putting distance between me and the last time I'd applied alcohol to my brain. It just takes time for the brain to repair and chemicals and hormones to regulate and there can also be unexpected reactions from drinking again after a break--you might want to look up "kindling." ..I think you're doing the right things reaching out and getting professional support and hanging in there and that if you just keep coming here and stacking days and breathing through it you'll be able to put the distance in place that allows your brain to heal and return to balance. You will feel better no lie--you will get there if you keep going. I believe in you. IWNDWYT.
For me journaling is helping a ton. It's like a mini therapist session.  I have to slow down my spinning brain and put my thoughts on paper even if that starts with 'i want to drink so bad today I don't even know why'.  Then I'll start going through my day in my journal write about what might have been frustrating which helps get it out of my head.  Then moving on to what is coming up what I'm looking forward to in the next day or two - helps shift my perspective from past and frustrations to future and activities/goals.  It's the best thing I've found to redirect my thought process to something constructive.
