Long time lurker here finally decided to join in. I relapsed last night after about 4 months sober. It's a terrible feeling. I'm hoping being more involved and participating in this sub will help me stay on track this time. I will not drink with you today

Hi there! I won't drink with you today!
If you don't mind why the relapse?  I only ask as I am on hyper lookout for what could take me out.  I feel like I am almost doing to good and any day will be crushed with an urge I can't overcome...  I think a lot of my confidence comes from serious drinking experience and reading others trials and tribulations.
Honestly I just became too confident in myself I've had a few go rounds at trying to quit and this last time was the longest I had made it by far so I decided to prove my victory by taking just one shot of whiskey that shot became the whole bottle. I just can't dip my toes..
