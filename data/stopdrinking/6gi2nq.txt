If any of you are struggling with staying sober try to get involved with AA NA or a drug program with a hospital or something. I'm only 15 and while i'm not as deep as some people in their addiction i could tell you that it does help a shit ton. I've just got my 2 month chip today and tbh i never thought i could but AA helps in so many ways possible. I went in to my first meeting so irritable like "why do i have to be here it won't help" "i cant relate to any of these people" and just like a brick wall i never listened to anyone's stories. I honestly never thought that it could click like it did for me but after i actually started listening to their stories  i just wanted to keep on going to those meetings and it will be the best decision you make. I cant speak like i'm some prophet or anything or a know it all but it's just my 2-cents. It has helped me the most and if you haven't ever went to a meeting get involved!

You are a wise young person! Bravo for two months!    ..I'm glad you're here. Thanks for your post!
I wish I had gotten help early like you...That's great advice!  Thanks for posting. 
Congratulations on two months! Thanks for posting. I'm in AA too. At first it was hard to accept that I needed to be there but it has become an important part of my life and my sobriety.
