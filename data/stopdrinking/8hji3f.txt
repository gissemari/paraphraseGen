During the second half of today I finally started to feel as if my life was returning to me. For days it felt like every cell in my body was inflamed and that I couldn't think no matter how hard I tried. Two nights ago I couldn't stay asleep in the typical way that happens after I binge. I did things more poorly the whole time all for a few hours of forgetting about the world and shirking responsibility...I am a chronic relapser and I don't want to ever drink again and consider myself an addict/alcoholic. But I don't know what will be different about this time although I want it to be. I've been trying to post on here and yesterday I explained to a close friend in recovery how horrible I feel to be trapped in addiction. But I've done these kinds of things before. I am praying and hoping and grateful for this additional chance. Not drinking with you all today...Each time I feel like I have a choice. A choice to stay sober. It's that when I relapse it doesn't FEEL like a choice but in a sense I know that it is. My body goes into autopilot or at least the cravings and denial are such a habit and/or so subconscious I yield to them. I guess that's what it's like being an alcoholic. One day at a time.

Many things keep me from relapsing but the fear of [The Kindling Effect](https://www.recoveryfirst.org/blog/the-kindling-effect-of-addiction/) is #1. It is necessary to completely change your mindset towards alcohol. It helps to embrace the fact that alcohol is an addictive poison that WILL destroy our lives in so many different ways. In order to control alcohol we simply cannot drink it.
Never give up hope that this time could be different. Way to make it through 72. This chronic relapser is on Day 45.
