I was wondering if this was common. They are getting really bad when they do happen and I think i lose my sanity or badly damage my brain. When I was drinking regularly it was never like this and while it's good I'm no longer enjoying drinking at all I woke up with a dread that it will kill me before I'm able to escape it. ..Nothing to do but press on I guess and hope this time was the last. I never want to feel like that again. My brain still hurts and I hope no permanent damage was done.

I found this myself. Something about the idea of permanent abstinence leads me to want to binge hard if I do drink. Or the idea that moderation isn't possible. Feel like it's a self-fulfilling prophecy for me at times. Either way I have to come to terms with how I think about drinking because I've become unmanageably off-balance.  I've gone from obsessing about drinking to obsessing about not drinking. Many of the longtime sober people around here say that it gets better in time so I'm placing my trust in that because I can't trust my addicted out-of-balance brain anymore. I'm shooting for 90 days sober and then I'll re-evaluate if moderate drinking is something I want to try again. Until then it's all probationary. 
It wants to kill you...Have you considered getting help?  AAsmartan addiction counselor?
