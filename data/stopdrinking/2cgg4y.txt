I have always felt that my alcoholism was a symptom but not my root problem. I also struggle with mental illness and years of abuse that I haven't dealt with yet. Since becoming sober 6 months ago I feel so overwhelmed with this huge mess of issues to slog through without any way of avoiding or dulling them. I have both a chemical dependency therapist and a mental health therapist I see a psychiatrist and go to sober support groups yet I feel somehow this isn't enough. I am struggling to keep my head above water as it is let alone deal with things I have needed to address for years. I have made the (scary) decision to go to an inpatient facility so that I can briefly press "pause" and try to get a better handle on things.....My mother is an active alcoholic. Of my (adult) siblings I am the one that struggles with addiction. My siblings do not fully understand alcoholism in the way that I do - they don't understand why my mom won't "just stop" etc. Although they know that I do not drink anymore and see a therapist for sober support they do not understand the extent of my addiction the cocaine use the daily drinking. When I managed to get clean I just said that I didn't want to "end up like Mom".....The problem is I'm scheduled to go inpatient at the end of the month and have no idea how to tell them. We all live in the same city and see each other often so I have to say something. The thought of it fills me with severe anxiety - how do I explain that I am going to rehab after 6 months clean?  How do I explain how much I am struggling to them when they don't understand alcoholism or even know the extent of my addiction? I feel so ashamed I have always been a bit of the black sheep and now I feel like a disappointment. ..Does anyone have any suggestions on how to tell them? Thank you for reading this.

I look forward to responses because I can't understand no why you would go at 6 months sober.
It sounds like you aren't going for detox/sober support so much as you are going for mental health support right? It supporting sobriety is just a side-effect?..I would just tell them that you are taking some time away to deal with some health issues and work on yourself. Done and done. They don't need any more info than that. (And it sounds like boundaries are going to be a really important piece of your recovery given your family situation so starting out with respecting the boundary of not giving them more info than they need is a great one!)
