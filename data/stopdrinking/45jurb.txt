I've always had poor coping mechanisms. I'm 110 days sober. .I have eating issues too and was taking a drug to control my binge eating episodes and impulsive behaviors (so it kinda may have helped with the alcohol thing). Due to side effects I stopped that and have no other medical options there. ..Despite my options being very very limited I sought out the only 3 therapists I could find here neither of which worked out and would have been too expensive to keep up anyway...I also tried AA prior to my last relapse and I really worked at it began to believe in it out of desperation but in my year and a half of experience on and off I've only ever struggled more being very involved with AA - thinking about it and talking about it made me want it more...The best solution I found is to stay busy and do things I enjoy. And obviously never have that first drink...The reason for my post is... I ended things with my last therapist and stopped taking the drug **and*** got placed in a difficult position at work **and** had to go for mandatory business drinks (obviously just ice tea for me) all within the same week. And for the last week or two I've been really struggling with binge eating and as a result been feeling shit about myself struggling to keep active isolating getting emotional easily and just in couch potato mode at home on netflix (when normally I keep active and busy). I put on the 5 lbs I lost. Then today that familiar sick voice in my head popped up nicely suggesting that I might want to go pick up a vodka from the convenience store that it will motivate me to stop binge eating and get busy and back to my daily active hobbies (sadly this actually worked in the past. Only not for long when I continued drinking)...Obviously the voice is not reasonable and I'm not going near a drink. But I'm recognizing the signs that bring back the alcohol cravings. And while I feel safe now I'm remembering about past trends there's been quite a few times I've given in when feeling pretty safe about not drinking. I don't want that to happen. I know all the reasons why I shouldn't drink and I don't feel I need to constantly be reminded but I hate that physical feeling of wanting to drink and feeling as if I'm so close to getting that (very temporary) good feeling but not being able to because logically I know there is no good reason to...**tldr: I'm just ranting about a random first craving in ages and not being able to drink when a bunch of other signs that have previously led to drinking are popping up **

Good on you for ranting.  I agree sobriety has lead me to recognise so many things about me the good the bad and the ugly.  I got sober but ate soooo much I now have to lose a lot of weight which I am doing but it is not without pain! I think there are lots of us that address one addiction issue only to discover more things about ourselves that need attention.  Can I suggest continuing your attempts to find a great therapist. I went for a gestalt therapist and it made all the difference.  Enjoy your rant you are not alone in what you are experiencing.  However I won't be drinking today for any reason.  Best wishes to you 
Glad you told on yourself and didn't leave all this festering inside. That's a positive sign despite all the other signs. That said it looks like you need to figure out a different approach. I would encourage you to find a new therapist for starters. I know AA didn't work for you in the past  so have have you looked into other options in your area? I know SMART utilizes cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) which is a powerful proven tool in the addiction realm. Even if they aren't in your area there are online tools you can take advantage of. ..Just continue to do everything you can to keep your head above water. You totally can do this. 
Yikes sounds like you're really being tested. Congrats though 'cause you came here and ranted instead of buying that vodka. That took some serious courage and self-inspection. You've got a lot of sober days under your belt and I sincerely hope you can keep accumulating them. I've heard great things about the online SMART  program - you could probably do a SD search and get some honest reviews of it.  Anyway I just wanted to tell  you that I'm really glad you shared your story. I'm only a month-ish sober and knowing that these cravings and challenges can pop up down the road is good to know. 
What is it about not drinking that makes one so hungry? I stopped and bought an ice cream last night. Totally out of character..
