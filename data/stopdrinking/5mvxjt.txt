I tried to do this about 3 months ago in September made it about a week before I started drinking again. I'm now about to be on my 7th day. I'm not feeling 100% yet but I'm loving the fact that my skin is already showing improving and my stomach bloat is decreasing. Great motivators to keep on going!! I'm experiencing some boredom right now and amazingly **NO** craving to drink so I figured I would make my first post here while I sip on some hot tea and share why I'm not drinking with y'all tonight - *for the 7th night in a row*..I didn't plan this as a  new year new me in 2017  thing but let's rewind to last weekend  New Year's Eve.... about *10 minutes* into 2017  I drank too much champagne before during and after the ball drop (on top of a variety of beers earlier in the day) and I got the spins **bad**  ended up on the couch in the fetal position thinking I was going to throw up and my son says  Mom you're drunk!    yikes  he wasn't saying it in a bad way I wasn't being an angry drunk or anything he was teasing me because I was feeling sick  it was a complete game changer  ..I'm never *drunk* around him when I drink he's in bed by the time I hit **THAT POINT** which I realized was getting harder to hit I had definitely built up a tolerance and that was starting to worry me. However his statement immediately changed my worry changed from my personal health to my son's image of his mother. I really don't want him to grow up remembering his mom as a drunk absolutely not. Alcoholism runs *deep* on *both* sides of my family. I have not been heading down a good path with my drinking at all and finally decided **enough is enough**. ..I spent New Year's Day  cleaning  everything out of the house all the random beers from the fridge and a small amount of boxed red wine classy I know. I don't know why I didn't just pour them out but I didn't and it's all gone now except for a small amount of whiskey belonging to my husband. Thankfully he isn't a drinker and I have no desire to drink it as it's too peaty for me to enjoy. ..I felt like Absolute. Fucking. Shit. the next day. My husband called on the way home from work and asked if he needed to pick up anything from the store. Generally I would request a bottle of wine or a 6 pack (which I would usually drink all of that night) but not this time - **this was Day 1 for me**. I didn't make a big deal of it to him. He knows I drink too much but he's really never asked me to stop...The first week has been a struggle. I started having terrible cravings Friday night - first sober Friday in a long time for me and we were snowed in in the South. The governor said to prepare to  be home for 3 days.  I had gone to the grocery store a couple times to get food walked past the beer and wine aisles strongly and didn't pick up anything even though I knew that I had no responsibilities for the next 3 days and would be stuck in home. I didn't want it. ..Until my husband got home Friday night - the panic set in  *We're stuck here for 3 days without any alcohol?* I had a splitting headache and suggested he should go get some beers. I mean we're going to be stuck here why not? However it had just started to sleet and he was worried about getting up and down the hill to our house if the roads had already iced over. OK we're not getting alcohol GOOD I thought **I can do this** it's OK. My son was driving me nuts headache still going strong. I started dabbling with the idea of drinking the small amount of my husband's whiskey left in the house even though I can't stand the taste just to take the headache away. But I didn't. I had some ginger ale played monopoly with our son and watched a movie. Looking forward to many more Friday nights focusing on the people I'm spending time with instead of focusing on what I'm drinking while I'm spending time with people. .

Congratulations from a fellow day 7!
When I gave up smoking over five years ago now after a 30 a day 27 year habit I learned that the first time I faced a situation where I would have smoked (waiting for a bus/doing the crossword/after food) was a killer but the next time was easier. So now I've got my first sober friday and saturday night done the next will be easier. You can totally do this and it won't be any harder next weekend
