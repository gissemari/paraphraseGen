Hi SD. I've been lurking reddit for a few years now and decided to step out of my comfort zone and join up when I found this sub especially because I'm realizing I need to do something different if I ever truly want to get sober. The most time I've gone without drinking in the last five years has been about a month. Every time I try to do it myself I end up failing and going back to the beer...A little about me: I'm a 26 year old female. I'm a full time student and do research in a parasitology lab. Science of all kinds has always been my passion but the drinking has made me so apathetic about it lately. I got the "you need to get your crap together" speech from my mentor today hence why today I chose again to stop drinking. It is not the first time someone has given me this speech. I've been struggling with major depressive disorder since I was 18 and I think I started drinking to self medicate. My mother is also a severe alcoholic and because of financial reasons I'm forced to keep living with her until I graduate-- if I graduate. My GPA is hanging on by the skin of its teeth because of the drinking...What scares me the most is that part of me doesn't want to stop drinking. I like the way drinking makes me feel. I don't even go out to drink I literally just stay at home and play videogames and pound back beer after beer; sometimes 12-15 a night. For some sick reason this is fun to me. I know I am killing myself slowly. I've gained almost 80 pounds in six years my blood pressure is super high and lord only knows what my liver looks like. I choose to argue with the part of myself that wants to keep drinking and not give a damn because I'm still so young and I really need to get my health and my educational life back on track. I'm making the decision to try and fight back again. ..This isn't the first time I have tried to stop. I've gone to an addiction therapist but I didn't really like her that much because she kept trying to force me into group meetings and I'm a super introvert. They also weren't just alcoholics at this center they were meth heads pill poppers etc. ..Tomorrow I'm going to my first AA meeting.  I may not like group therapy but like I said I realize I need to change something about my approach to sobriety so I don't fall down the same path over and over again...It's raining here in southern California tonight which doesn't happen very often. I'm taking it as an opportunity to wash away whatever has happened in my past and I'm making a vow to wake up fresh and sober tomorrow.

Congratulations! You've made a good decision! There's nothing "hopeful" about your success; it's exactly up to you to do whatever you have to to make it work and that's #1 - you have to do whatever it takes and it may be inconvenient. It may push you out of your comfort zone and you may have to make embarrassing concessions. ..I know exactly how you feel - I used to drink alone and spend an entire Saturday drunk and stumbling to the fridge while playing video games! GTA was my favorite since I was free to just do whatever when I became too drunk to play well. I also drank every night before bed. ..I hope AA works for you! I've had no interest in it - my experience there is that everyone has "lost it all" and it is heavily religious. I have an otherwise rather good life and I'm not religious. Instead I've been trying to [apply the implied lessons of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg) as it is well supported Science. I have been focusing more on the connections I have - to other members of my family to friends work etc. as well as (sometimes) white-knuckling through another day. ;) ..I don't want to diss AA; different strokes for different folks etc. and I have at times taken a sleeping pill just so I know how much longer I have to be strong. Month 2 has not been nearly as bad as the first week! ..A while back [I wrote a short summary of where I'm at](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3otet0/where_ive_been/) and I really hope that you're able to work things out. It would be really tough to quit drinking with easy access to beer etc. right there in your house! ..I'll be watching for your next post. :) .
Welcome!  Glad you are here. Much of what you said reminded me of me years ago.  Life can get so much better!  Breaking the cycle is hard though. ..One thing that helped me quite a bit I early sobriety was doing the opposite of my first instinctive thought.  Your alcoholic mind tells you not to go to meetings?  Definitely go!  ..Good luck!!
