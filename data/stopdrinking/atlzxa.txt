Hi. Relapsed last weekend. Been to rehab 2 times in 2016 and 2017. Im an alcoholic and decided to start the road to recovery in 2015. Just want to share the experience. Drank alone and about 6 pints and a big glass of wine out on town. In my alcoholic times that was an appetizer. That alone made me breakdown the next day calling crisis phone and close friends to share the psychological pain. Anxiety and dread. Here i am on a friday finally gotten out of alcohols claws. Stay sober my friends and stay safe. Hugs and a nice weekend. Btw what do you think about AA? Have different experiences but mostly good. 32 year old man living in norway.

what matters most is that you're back and i'm sorry to hear the pain you went through recently. 2 years is really impressive and i think you can get back to that place. I personally don't go to AA but I believe if it's someone's only in-real-life connection to other sober people then it can definitely help.
I do AA and recommend at least giving it a shot for a year. I'm in the states so meetings vary pretty widely based on where you are regionally. I've found that if I like someone's share during the meeting connecting with them is the best thing I can do for my sobriety. There are a lot of different personalities and approaches to recovery in the rooms but connecting with those who seem to have what I want in sobriety and a similar worldview has really helped me build my sobriety network. 
Thanks heartwarming. Yeah AA seems ok. I see many people believing its a cult and have negative opinions about it. But its a good place to lay off some of your mental luggage and share with people from all walks of life.  Everyone i have met there are good people. Hope you are doing good.
AA was a wonderful help to me!
