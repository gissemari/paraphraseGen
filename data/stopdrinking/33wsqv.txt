Start of day 3 and I keep looking back at the past month of making what were quite frankly pathetic attempts to quit with a bit of embarrassment. This time its happening. Despite a positive mental outlook physically I'm struggling with a lot of anxiety. Woke up drenched in sweat last night and going out today is a very unappealing prospect. But I'm not drinking today.

Good for you. Hang in there and please keep us posted! Pulling for you. :D.
What are you going to do today? (after you take a shower please)  do you have a long range plan?
Yeah....when I first got sober I took a lot of showers and had to force myself to cook clean grocery shop and make my bed. ..So I  did one thing at a time until I saw that slowly even these few things reduced the external chaos in my life and helped me feel a little focused and productive...Hang in there.  We do recover!
What's your plan today? I would suggest working out to get rid of some of that anxiety. Personally I like to beat up a punching bag and pretend it's the physical manifestation of my disease.
