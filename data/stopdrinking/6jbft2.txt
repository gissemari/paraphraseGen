I leave work with the intention to not drink but then I pass a 7-11 or a grocery store where can buy a six pack of 16oz bud lights. There is a magnetic pull that lures me. I have an internal struggle part of me saying that I just have to make it home without buying any thing and once I am home I am good the other part says when I make it home I'll just end up going out to get a drink so why not pick it up now since I'm out. ugh.

Good on you to come here and discuss it. Just push through tonight. Go for a walk. 
Oh I know that feeling! My car seemed to steer itself when I got close to my old beer store. 
I decided to change my route home so that I wouldn't be triggered by the many places that I used to stop at and buy my favorite poison. I won't drink with you tonight!
I feel that magnetic pull even when I'm at my house
