I feel that one of the reasons I continually fail/relapse is that I do not plan and stay active in sobriety. For example if I know I'll be around drinkers/be at an event where there will be alcohol/be put in situations where I might be tempted to drink I haven't put in a lot of effort to avoid those triggers or temptations. The same goes with days where I have a long or busy day and learning how to cope with that without alcohol. I was prescribed Naltrexone last year and tried it out to pretty great success with not wanting alcohol. It helped curb my cravings and when I did drink I would half about half a pint and give the rest away or dump it. I don't know why I stopped taking it probably because I had began to think I could "moderate" even though the whole reason I was taking the medication in the first place was because I obviously couldn't. Anyways back to planning. Tomorrow I will be at an event reading some my writing and there may be alcohol there. Either way I'm checking in for accountability and I also took a full Naltrexone - which lasts up to 24 hours - so that I will not be tempted to drink tomorrow. I've also planned on bringing only enough cash for a soda or a coffee (another great plan if you know you'll be tempted to drink). Another one of my triggers is warm weather you know sitting on a patio drink in hand. Well low and behold the weather is supposed to be nice Monday and Tuesday. I've planned ahead for A) Taking Naltrexone both of those days and B) Planning an activity that doesn't involve alcohol - attending a sports game with some school friends that don't drink...As I've stated I've always kind of been like "Well I probably won't drink" and then I always end up not only drinking but wasted blackout drunk or hungover or hating myself feeling depressed and sleeping off the rest of my weekend. Not today Satan! I'm ready for a sober weekend and kickstart to my week. I hope my advice might help some of you who are wondering why you keep relapsing. PLAN AHEAD! XOXO IWNDWYT.

Yes! My first sober Friday in a long time which just ended included a heavy amount of planning and it was a success. Planning (and playing the tape forward) is very important especially in the early stages I'm just now starting to find out that.
Way to set yourself up for success!
