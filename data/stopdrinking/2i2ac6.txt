I just found this subreddit today. I'm in my mid thirties have 2 kids and a wife good job and friends. I drink a lot more than most people but probably not as much as my dad who is a chronic alcoholic. Drinking used to be fun but now it seems like a torment. The day after drinking I struggle with motivation get cranky with my wife and kids and can have feelings of shame without actually really having done anything bad to anyone. Last night I went for dinner with my wife had several nice cocktails got a bit drunk and went to bed. woke up feeling tired and cranky didn't go for a swim as I was planning to and spent the morning beating myself up. I dunno i try to cut back but my wife is a big drinker too so I'm finding it hard. Anyone got any advice?

Talk to your wife. Tell her you want to quit and how its making you feel. It sounds like you feel how many of us felt before things got much worse. You can decide if you want to continue in that direction. Post here more often if you have any questions or need help id be happy to help. I'm sorry I can't be more detailed I'm half asleep at the moment...Stay! Its sooooo worth it 
If your wife is a big drinker she must feel like a bag of shit aswell.Have you brought up the idea of giving up alcohol together.make some sort of pact.perhaps she has thought of quitting but hasnt made a plan of attack.Quitting together would make it so much easier and pleasant.Just a thought.good luck.
Why not give it a go for 30 days and see how you get on.  Grab a badge as have a look around the sub.  See what happens if your father was an alkie there may be a chance you could be on too maybe not today but someday.  Today is a  good day to stop.
