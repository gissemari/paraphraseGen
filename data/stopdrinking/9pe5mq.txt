I'm struggling tonight but I just try to keep reminding myself tomorrow morning I'm not going to wish I would have drank tonight. Playing the tape forward. As the weekend comes on it feels more challenging. I have snacks and Netflix and I'm not leaving the house! IWNDWYT

That's really the biggest part.  Playing it out in your head honestly.  Imagining what will happen after you drink the first second third etc.  Then the next day.  Then the next day after that.  The more you play that out the less appealing it is.
Stay strong! Sending positive thoughts your way! IWNDWYT 
Yup playing the tape forward is my strategy. There will never be a time when I wake up after drinking and not hate myself for doing so regardless of the quantity.
I made it over the hump! Whooo hooo! 3 days down!
