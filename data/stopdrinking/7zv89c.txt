So i'm sort of new on this subreddit... I've been reading here for a while but i just made a new account to post here... ..I was doing good i was able to stop drinking... But then 2-3 weeks ago i've seen the boy who sexually assaulted me who i've never seen since then and i relapsed. I started to drink again i've relapsed of my eating disorder (anorexia) again... ..But now it's been 3 days since i've stopped drinking.  And i want to continue like this. And I think that this subreddit is going to help me. So hello and I will not drink with you today.

Reading this subreddit got me past 100 days so far so it certainly can't hurt.  IWNDWYT
Hello. We're with you
It is such a trigger seeing someone that has assaulted you - I have been there myself. I hope you are getting some support around that to heal? This is definitely a safe place to get support and awesome advice to stop drinking - it's helped me crawl out the wine bottle I resorted to in an attempt to medicate abuse-related PTSD. What I've been learning is that type of self-medication doesn't actually help because just because the feeling couldn't be felt doesn't mean it went away. You are a super-strong and amazing person to have continued to fight for your own wellbeing and right to be whole in yourself. That's a big victory right there. IWNDWYT.  .
