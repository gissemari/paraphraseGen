As I sit here sweating feeling lost and alone. I want it to go away. Yesterday wasn't this tough. I gotta be strong.

Stay strong and know that withdraws deform alcohol can be very dangerous. ..Do not be afraid to go to a dr if things don't get better soon. 
Hang in there this day is almost done! Sending out some positive energy!
Breaking up is hard to do. Just remember that your liver is extremely pleased to be ending this relationship. I'm going to raise my La Croix to the livers! They don't have much of a voice in all this but they show up for work everyday on time and they do their best to clean up the mess we make.
The first week is hard! Here's what I did: Do it one day one minute at a time. Go on a walk. Take a steamy shower buy your favorite breakfast cereal from your childhood go to bed early. Make it for one more day. The sweats should stop in a few days. Stay hydrated. The alcohol is fighting you nowbut your mind and body are going to be so happy when they realize that the daily poison has stopped. I'll be thinking of you and not having a drink with you tonight.
my day 3 is half over and i an struggling as well.
Awesome! A fresh proud non-hungover morning tomorrow will be one of the rewards. The rewards start outnumbering the trials. We're all coming out of a pit. Sometimes it takes a few tries. But there's sunshine up there!
