It finally happened. I got the biggest wake up call this weekend. After going out with some friends I made the dumbest mistake of my life and got behind the wheel. I hit a parked car that hit two other parked cars. I fucked up I know. I also know that this could have been much much worse. You can replace cars but you can't replace lives. I can't help thinking what would've happened if it wasn't parked cars. ..On top of everything I struggle mightily with depression anxiety and bipolar II. I knew I shouldn't have been drinking on my pills but it never stopped me. I didn't care about the side effects. All I wanted was to get drunk and be with friends. On my pills I would often get much drunker or even have much worse highs and lows than normal. The guilt is too heavy to burden most the time. I can't sleep well I can't stop crying I can't even stay up. I keep sleeping. I had a therapy appointment today where I just cried for an hour. ..I am stupid and young I just turned 22 today. ..My family has many different alcoholic ties and this was the wake up call I needed. Surely it's a fucking hard and expensive lesson to lean but I am willing to deal with the consequences learn from this and most importantly **stay sober.** ..I have a good support system and obviously being in college staying sober is going to be tough but I am more than willing to better myself. ..This isn't my first shot and sobriety but it's definitely going to be my last. ..***IWNDYT***..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

It can only go up from here buddy! You also have some great insight and even understand your mental illness at such a young age! Most people don't know or accept that they have bipolarism at that age! Got nothing but solid expectations from you bud! Take care of yourself and your mental health and everything else will fall into place!  
Glad you didn't hurt yourself or anyone else. When I first quit I read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It really helped put alcohol in perspective and made it easier for me to realize I can actually have more fun without drinking. It wasn't easy at first but checking in here often helped. I also didn't feel great for about six weeks because I think I was detoxing and my body was readjusting. I suggest making a plan about what you will do instead of drinking like exercise watching a movie favorite snacks etc.   Stay strong and keep us posted!
You say it's your last shot and I know what yo uh mean but falling is... well it's a thing. Just keep getting up. ..Today is the only day that matters.  You can do it today
You are not alone. The ramifications you will have to face will not be fun but you will get through them and you will be ok. I like many other's look back on mine and I'm almost glad it happened. I'd still take it back if I could but I can't. It's not our fault that we have a drinking problem BUT it is our responsibility. Best wishes moving forward!
