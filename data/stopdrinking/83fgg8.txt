Can you share with me what changed? What worked for you? I've been trying to quit drinking since November and have had four relapses in that time. Good news is two were only a few glasses and then I realized the booze wasn't helping anything. In all four instances I was able to get back on the wagon the next day and didn't say  fuck it  and take the one way to benderville.  I've been able to go for as long as 73 days and as short as one week. ..After my most recent relapse two days ago I feel powerless. I feel like a failure. I'm having trouble moving on. I want to feel like I did on that day 72 again - the  I don't need alcohol to be happy  feeling. How did you finally get there after your relapses and what made it stick?

For me I stopped talking about sobriety and started living a sober life. I attend meetings (Refuge Recovery and Buddhist 12 step) I go to the chat here every day and have a therapist. But most importantly when things feel rough I reach out and say "I can't do this alone" and accept the support of others. I also go to the gym. ..Most importantly I don't do this alone. I can't. Being alone is a relapse trigger for me but having other in my life who support me in my recovery has been life changing. ..IWNDWYT!
During my last relapse I knew if I got caught again I would lose everything (girlfriend job House dog). I knew if I tried to taper off in secret I would inevitably fail. I came clean put myself into detox and lost everything. But I never felt better. I was finally at the point where I wanted sobriety more than anything else. I was finally willing to actually do whatever it took to get and live a sober life. I was also willing to work to rebuild the life I destroyed with alcohol. My SO came back I just got the job I lost back and my life continues to improve each day that I remain sober. Even the bad days are better. The most important realization was that there is no going it alone. I go to AA meeting at least 5 days a week after doing 90 meetings in 90 days. Although it wasn't a fun process I'm grateful for went I went through and what it led me to. 
I read a great post I'm [going to hand over](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/77nurb/three_years_of_sobriety/?st=JELWTB3J&amp;sh=95930adc) from my Saved pile.  It is a wonderful tale of a member who didn't give up even after many resets.  .You can only fail if you quit trying or die.  So don't you give up!  You're learning something you're doing something to your quality of mind you're searching you are growing.  If you keep chopping away at a tree it's going to ultimately come down.      I will not drink with you today friend.
