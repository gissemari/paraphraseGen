Good morning!..Theme: leadership..**"If your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader.   [John Quincy Adams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams)**..What I get from it: Today I asked my children to pick a leader between them as they would be "on their own" for a quick outing. By default the oldest was chosen but not without my adding that a good leader knows how to listen. Then I got a call from a friend who was struggling with an urge to drink and is having troubles with his wife also drinking... I listened. I also reminded him that he too can be a leader in his own family. Lots of "leaders" around me lately. Happy Monday!

I like it!  I find when I live sober treat prople with courtesy and respect and practice acceptance tolerance and patience with others a subtle effect occurs.  When I "listen" to others around me as you write all of a sudden in their mind my intelligence jumps several points (after all I'm "smart" enough to be interested in what they offeras conveyed by my listening!)...Then amazingly if I do have something to say it's received better and carries some "thoughtful gravitas".  ..I often think of the quote "will expressing the thought in my head improve upon the silence."..I believe our media has done a significant disservice to us all by regularly featuring 3-5 people all trying to speak "talk at" or scream over others!  ..I think I'll enjoy some thoughtful quiet this morning!..Thanks u/cdism !  ..Peace be with you.  Just for today I don't drink with you...
This is great!  Thanks
