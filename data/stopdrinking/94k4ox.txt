I feel that last night was 'needed' to reach this mentality. I got blackout drunk at a pool party. Vomited multiple times and cursed at my wife and slept in odd places (so I'm told)...I have a bar room in my home that I have spent some time this morning emptying. Liquors are packed away in a box (I hope to give them away). I am going to attend an AA meeting this evening...For years i have read this sub and admired all of your struggles with and commitments to sobriety. I always thought I couldn't do it. But I'm going to try. I'm going to try my best...

Best of luck to you. You may wish to read the daily check-in page for a word about *trying*. It clicked with me and made all the difference.
