I'm not sure if I can turn this into a series but I want to start making posts that highlight just an element of what alcohol does to the human body. .I am not doctor I will just pull stuff from the web however I want to drill it into me/you that when you drink alcohol the alcohol just does not pop into your blood stream make you happy then magically disappear (as we would all love it to!). ..#Alcohol doesn't cause your "high"..All ethyl alcohol which is broken down in the human body is first converted to acetaldehyde and then this acetaldehyde is converted into acetic acid radicals--also known as acetyl radicals. Acetaldehyde is a poison which is a close relative of formaldehyde...Two of the most serious problems of alcohol addiction.are craving and relapse; several studies have demonstrated.that relapse is related to the anxious state which occurs.during withdrawal and it has been proved that this.behavioural modifications results from an alteration of the.dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. An important role.in the neurobiology of alcohol addiction is played by.acetaldehyde (ACD) ethanol first metabolite...Source 1: [HAMS: Harm Reduction for Alcohol](http://www.hamsnetwork.org/metabolism/)  ..Source 2: [Role of acetaldehyde in alcohol addiction: current evidence and future perspectives Carla Cannizzaro Fulvio Plescia Silvana Cacace](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0ahUKEwiPvfTyjevKAhUkIJoKHRlVDEcQFgg5MAM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.um.edu.mt%2Fumms%2Fmmj%2FPDF%2F330.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFj5-mb0LMvANYgTQwyhvd-NkzVeQ&sig2=_10VeLG3JVA5Vc6o5NiFiw)..Edit: Formatting lesson from u/ThreeBlurryDecades. Thank you!.

Finally facing the facts that I was destroying my body (especially my brain) was what finally got me to stop.  The idea of dying decades early from a preventative cause was just unacceptable.  .Thanks for posting this reminder!
Thanks! .2 points. 1. Sometimes my gym t-shirt after a sweaty workout would smell of ammonia. Or smelled like that to me. I always had a suspicion that was related to alcohol in my body - as somewhere form school chemistry I had a feeling that they were both organic molecules? Or similar? Or a possible byproduct? .2. Your comment about anxiety dopamine alteration and relapse ties in with what I have been reading here and online about PAWS - post acute withdrawal syndrome..For me reading factual/scientific stuff like your post helps a lot. Keep going .
Great post looking forward to more Science.
I like this idea. Thanks!..If I could offer a tip if you want your links to look nice and pretty format them like this..[Words describing link in square brackets] no space here (link in round brackets).
I really like these type of "facts" posts. It helps me to see wine for what it really is - poison to my body. Like rat poison. 
&gt;Acetaldehyde is a poison which is a close relative of formaldehyde...This is extremely informative and helps my resolve. Thanks for posting.
This series is right up my alley.  I feel if more people understood the actual biological changes and destruction that occurs with abuse it would be easier for them to combat. 
I love this.  A big part of why I stopped drinking is because of the damage and breakdown I've caused to my body and brain thinking about how I used to be so athletic and strong...Am determined to get back to that place!
I also like these kinds of posts. What I read the other day was that it takes one hour to metabolize 1 ounce of alcohol and while that is happening nothing else happens.  Food is not metabolized fat is not metabolized your engine is completely focused on the alcohol. So for two decent size glasses of wine I'm shutting down my system for 10 hours. Not cool. 
Yes! What a cool idea. I find this kind of information super helpful in maintaining my resolve. Thank you.
Love this! Are you taking requests? I want to better understand alcohol's relationship to anxiety/dopamine/serotonin. And to sugar. Keep it coming!
Great stuff!  It would be interesting to know if/how the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems can be reset to pre-alcohol homeostasis.
I'd value future posts if you make them. Thanks for your time for this and in advance for any others you do.
