So this has been an interesting month so far. I found out I was pregnant last week. HUGE surprise but SO and I are very happy. I have told some of our friends and they have had a wonderful response. However I am hesitant to tell our families. They know about my struggles recently and I just feel like they won't be happy or that they will feign happiness when really they are concerned. Not that I would blame them its just dissapointing that  I don't feel like I can do some cutesy announcement ya know?..Also Last Friday we also finally received a diagnoses for our soon to be 4 year old. He is on the Autism Spectrum. We have known for sometime so its bittersweet in a sense now we will be able to get him more services which is great but it also means that it is official. I've talked to my therapist and she told me its ok to grieve a little over it. Part of me feels like my alcoholism is what contributed to his diagnoses (i didn't drink during my pregnancy or anything but I did start drinking when he was around 14 months) I feel like if I had been a more attentive mother...idk. ..Another thing is I just finished the semester and I think (fingers crossed) that I have passed all of my classes! I was really worried about one of them if I failed any I would violate my academic probation and not be able to receive pell grants for next semester. However I think I am in the clear and that makes me hopeful. Although now I am a little worried about being able to push through to get my degree with another baby on the way. ..Some of the bad stuff includes one of my little sisters. She is just spinning out. She is drunk all the time and just keeps making bad choices. She text me last night that she wants to start stripping. I'm like wtf?! dude you are just being lazy get a 9-5 and keeps serving in the evenings. She just wants to make quick money and be able to keep drinking and partying. I am so dissapointed and I just want to shake the shit out of her. I am trying to withhold judgement but I am honestly concerned for her mental health these days. Another thing is that I ditched out on a friends birthday this weekend. She is a big drinking buddy who I don't see anymore really since I had my son. She never asks me how he's doing and never asks really how I am doing. She doesn't know that I am in recovery. I said I would go to the casino with her and her friends and then I just ignored her texts on the day of. I know that this was rude and I should've just text her I couldn't make it. But part of me was feeling resentful. She never asks anything about my life she just calls to tell me about one drunken escapade or another. In one week I found out that i'm pregnant and my son was diagnosed with autism and I just didn't feel like going to a casino and being around a bunch of drunks. Still I messaged her today to tell her happy birthday and she basically wrote me off. Again don't blame her and really I don't feel too bad if we aren't friends anymore. We really aren't anyway ya know? I don't really know what I'm getting at here. I have been having weird feelings all month long. hormones and recovery no doubt. I just wanted to post and get it off my chest. I'm hoping that I can hash some of these feeling out with my therapist at our appointment on Friday. I won't drink with you all today. :)

Thanks for sharing this. I hope your family will surprise you with loving enthusiasm when you do decide to tell them about your pregnancy. :) I will not drink with you today either!
