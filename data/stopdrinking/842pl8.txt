I want to go out and have fun with my friends so badly!!! I just got off work an hour ago got into a fight with my boyfriend and am now sitting in my room thinking about going to the bar where everyone else is..It's 1 am and the bars are open until 5am.  .I'm trying to not drink with you today.

When I was a smoker and struggling to give up I realised that I would somehow create situations like a big fight where i could go off in a huff and smoke (cos that's what you do no?)... maybe that kind of addict brain stuff is operating here for you. ..Tomorrow. Your choice. Wake up remember had a row oh god I got wasted..Or... Wake up remember had a row I had a nice cup of tea and a good nights sleep and now I see it for what it is and I'm 17 days sober... ..Big hug. 
Hang in there it's worth it.
