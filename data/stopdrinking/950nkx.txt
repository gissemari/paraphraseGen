Not a sad post at all.  Life is tricky and how we maneuver around it says a lot about us.  There is no guidebook to help us navigate.  We do our best with what we have.  Take it one day at a time.
Give yourself credit for 70 + 100 days of sobriety and continuing to fight the good fight. If you keep trying you're not failing you're getting stronger and better every day  hugs

You are not worthless fat from it. You are worth saving. If you can't believe that right now let me believe it for you. I'm so sorry you're doing it so tough right now x x
Why is it we continue to sabotage ourselves?  We just get better then somehow as you say get complacent and the cycle starts again.  I know exactly what you mean.  You have done this before and can do it again.  We all can.  I know it's not easy but just one day at a time again and IWNDWYT.  Best of luck!
