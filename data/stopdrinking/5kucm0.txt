https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci7o5zmYbZw..I have a lot of personal struggles on the journey.    I quit heroin and turned to alcohol...everyone at the time said 'good for you! its better than dope.'     little did i know it really isnt.   its a slow and sneaky devil just like heroin.   everything starts out great and fun and relaxing and then before you know it years have passed and your stuck and anxious and....things suck.    I want to be free. I made it 3 days and failed. Farthest ive gone was 2 months.   I know I can beat this somehow....Sorry for the ramble.

you definitely can beat this. checking in here is a great start. it took me a long time to get 30 days and every time i "failed" I added a new layer of support/accountability.  Do you think something similar could set you up for success this time?  hang in there.  
Welcome.  Best wishes in your journey to freedom. You'll get there!  Keep trying. I will not drink with you.
Ramble appreciated.  Addiction is a bitch but I think you've got this thing.  You beat H you can beat this thing too.  One day at a time.  Ram Dass is great by the way - thanks for sharing that youtube.
