I put two pictures side by side and I couldn't believe what a difference quitting alcohol has made! I wanted to share with you guys since you were there for me the most. You got me here!..The first picture is taken the last day I got drunk Christmas Eve 2016. I drank almost every day. I attempted to sober up and cut back on my drinking many times. I always returned though. At the start of 2017 I moderated my drinking for the first 3 months 1-2 times a month and never exceeding 3 beers. I know I was bound to relapse again. I had my last drink on March 24 sitting at the bar watching the band play. I thought to myself "I was having more fun before I had that one beer." Moderation was too much work. I haven't drank since...The second picture I took last Thursday. I thought I looked brighter than usual. Side by side what a difference! I never thought I'd be the one to post a before and after. I love looking at others though. You guys served as inspiration for me. I can only hope I can return the favor...[Christmas Eve](http://i.imgur.com/xCKUOKn.jpg)..[Now](http://imgur.com/cq9Oq3W)..You all are beautiful people and I thank you for being there. For those of you just beginning things do get better truly! Nearly everyone will tell you that and it's true. I certainly have my bad days but I am not tempted to drink. I know alcohol will not make things better but going for a walk loving my cats or drinking a cup of tea - those are just a few things that DO make things better!..I won't drink with you today xx
