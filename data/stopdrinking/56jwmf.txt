I just turned 28. My father has been absent most of my life. My mother did the best she could. I have nobody to blame but myself. ..I've lost jobs relationships friends family. I didn't know my grandpa died until weeks later (after I went to his funeral) because I'd been drinking. ..To the younger generation of alcoholics: stop before you get too deep. Trust me here. ..I know it's not as simple as saying "I'll just quit tomorrow". I struggle everyday but it's worth it. ..It's not worth losing your life. You can physically be alive but still lose your life. ..A cautionary tale...Edit: word.

Inspiring post...Congratulations on your progress!
In my darkest times years ago I had lost my life.  It has been a long struggle but I am progressing towards fully recovering.  There have been some ups and downs but the progression is what I embrace.  I am almost 20 years older than you.  I think it is great you are mature enough that you did not wait as long as I did to get serious about this disorder of ours.  I wish you well.
You're so right. I'm 27 and will be sober 1 year tomorrow after wasting 5 years of my life to alcohol. I've done damage to my body and lost time I'll never get back. But the only path is forward and so I'm just going to focus on the time I won't spend drinking...Thank you for the reminder of why I stopped drinking. By the way 11 days is HUGE and it gets easier after the 1st month. Then month by month it becomes easier and easier to maintain sobriety.
Please be mindful of speaking from your own experience when posting on SD. We appreciate the advice but telling folks to stop before they get too deep is not speaking from the I.
