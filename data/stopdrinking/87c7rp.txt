More and more relapses I'm so sick of it. I've gotten to the stage where I don't even like it anymore..i hate who it turns me into i hate how it makes me feel it's all become a bad habit. ..I feel tired and groggy all the time i have no patience for anything i have no motivation safe to say I've got myself in a rut...Sorry for the rant.

I know right! It is the worst feeling getting that poison out of your system. When I started noticing the days of physical and mental feelings after drinking as negative I knew I was heading in the right direction. Relapses happen but picking yourself back up and trying again shows real strength. iwndwyt 
You got this - I'm new here but everyone has such great positivity you can only help but look on the bright side that you have what it takes. IWNDWYT!
Can you go to a doctor? Inpatient? I know it's kind of extreme but better now than when you have some crisis like a swollen liver or a DUI or something. 
Im right there with ya friend. My MO is having to reset after a week or two. But we keep going and we figure out what works and what doesn't. I'm promised that eventually we'll get there. Hang in there!
