She died a few years ago from complications with liver disease. Her memory is really complicated for me because of her drinking but the more I work on my sobriety and spend time in therapy the more the negative feelings get washed away. I understand now why she drank and I have to forgive myself for the anger I felt for so many years. ..I'm sober so I can honour her memory the brilliant woman she was and the endless love that she showed my family. Her struggles didn't define her. I'm saying a huge FUCK YOU to the thing that took her away from me. ..Here's to being present being a good friend being there for our loved ones building lasting memories with the children in our lives facing life head on and loving every second. ..I love you mom. I miss you every minute of every day.

Whoa yeah. I am sad that alcohol did that to you and your family...*And* I am humbled by your commitment to stay the course and honor her memory with your sobriety. ..Keep being awesome.
Sounds like she would have been really proud of the work you're doing.  Best wishes and an internet hug.
