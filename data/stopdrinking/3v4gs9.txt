Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** This week has been pretty good for me.  I feel like my anti-depressants are starting to kick in; slowly but surely I'm crawling out of that black hole.  With the fog lifting it makes it a whole lot easier to get other things done.  When I exercise I don't feel as if I am forcing myself to go through the motions and I have to say I wrote a pretty kick-ass cover letter for a job the other day...**Struggle:** I'm still dealing with the repercussions of some of my actions while drinking.  There were relationships in which I wasn't very kind to people and some relationships I shouldn't have been in at all.   Lately I've been seeing more clearly just how big of an impact my behaviors have had on other people. I'm struggling to figure out how to rectify that/wondering if I should try fixing it at all...**General Chat:** I honestly almost forgot it was Wednesday.  The holiday season/end of the year has me working more hours and doing different tasks than usual.  I have been devoting more time and energy to my relationship and trying out new activities with my partner.  Getting out of my routine.  It's been pretty easy for me to get a little off-track.  I've been trying to use reminders and calendars on my phone prepping the day ahead making lists... How are you guys staying organized?  What do you do to stay on the ball?

**Triumph:** This could be both a triumph and a struggle but I'm going to call it a triumph.  I've been sick since Saturday and it hasn't been fun. Yesterday I had intense stomach pains and threw up. I realised that this was my very first time throwing up since I stopped drinking 205 days (&gt;6 months) ago. I used to throw up every week! I think it's amazing I haven't thrown up in so long - it's awful! So my triumph is my health. ..**Struggle:** I rehomed my pet snake on Saturday which was a really really really tough thing to do. I got her while drunk back in February of 2010. In the past few years I've been considering re-homing her but I'd always get really upset and decide to keep her. Snakes don't recognise their owner or anything so she won't get upset that  she's been rehomed the way a dog would or anything and I haven't neglected her or anything but I haven't given her the best home. The guy who I gave her to will give her an amazing home and her life will be better but my heart just hurts.  I've been listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwHqWD1cXnk) a lot since. Anyway I know that it was the right decision but it still hurts. ..**General Chat:** I also use calendar entries on my phone and a to do list app called Todoist. It is web based and has a suite of apps. The only issue I have is remembering to put things into the app. 
**Triumph**:  made it through a difficult weekend with son in ER.  He's OK but long boring waits perfect for drinking in the washroom (didn't happen)..**Struggle**:  still having trouble letting go of the lose of an ex-gf due to my prior drinking.**General chat**:  I'm excited about Friday Christmas party where I will be drinking soda water (instead of staying home to drink whiskey)  
Triumph: I've been taking my anti-depressants for 10 days now. Nasty side effects but hoping those will subside now. I'm also less than a week away from finishing the fall semester in my masters program...Struggle: I haven't been sleeping well. I've got minimal energy and have been waking up crazy early. I've been taking some sleep medicine from the doctor with mixed results. I feel like a zombie going through the day...General chat: I've been loving the show The Leftovers. Check it out if your in the mood for one crazy show.
**Triumph:** Moving to the cities in January! Time to get out of this small town. I don't know how to express my thankfulness to my sister.  ..**Struggle:** I enjoy everyone I work with including the kids. However I know so many new opportunities are in the cities. ..**Struggle:** Going no contact with my drug addicted brother who doesn't want or need help. Also limited contact with my enabling mother.    ..**General Chat:** Wait it's Wednesday? Where the heck are the days going? Four months ago I stopped consuming illicit substances and meat and boom it's 23 days until Christmas. Organized? I usually wing it or keep a little pad of paper with me. I like making lists and always being able to add to it throughout the day - week. 
Triumph: I survived a family holiday with no drinks continuing on my sober streak. I bonded with my parents heavily as they live sober lives and even though I was sick during this school break I was sick and sober. ....Struggle: In my last year of college and this weekend I have been invited to seven different parties the basis of all of them are drinking. I am sober drive for my fraternity Friday night so that knocks two out but Saturday night I need to show face at about five parties to support my friends and I'm going to experience some peer pressure. ....General Chat: My final year of college is going scary quick! I have some job interviews for engineering lined up which is exciting but I can't wait for Christmas already! I get to go to San Diego for a week which will be fun! ..
**Triumph:**Five days sober including a couple days with inlaws while they were drinking.  Also handled a situation with my 3 year old much better last night than I would have had I been drinking..**Struggle:**I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that I cannot drink ever.  That the images of people at holiday parties sipping wine or enjoying eggnog by a fire simply cannot be part of my life.  The real images for me should be a woman on her 10th drink acting out at a company party and a woman blacked out in front of a fire gone cold.  .**General Chat:**I have WAY too much on my plate this month and am feeling overwhelmed!  One of my kid's birthdays is in December so on top of everything else I'm planning a bday party.  Calgon take me away!!
**Triumph:** I'm noticing that in the few days since I started a constant self-evaluation I'm able to focus more on things I've wanted to change for years. I'm still abrasive and aggressive but I can bite my tongue longer and my communication skills are improving. ..**Struggle:** I'm battling a pretty heavy case of depression and self-loathing. I just got off the phone with someone who demanded I shower change walk my dogs and call them so we can pick my next three tasks. It's pathetic. I'm un-medicated for the depression but before you pick up the pitchforks there are two reasons why: 1.) I'm unemployed/uninsured and with the thousands being spent on my DUI repercussions it's just not feasible right now and 2.) I'm one of the people they warn about in the commercials. Any anti depressant I've tried has turned me suicidal. ..**General Chat:** I went grocery shopping with a gift card I got for dog sitting last week and might try a new recipe for mozzarella stuffed meatballs tonight. I am excited to see how those come out. Happy Wednesday friends!

Happy Wednesday!..**Triumph:** I spent 5 days in new situations with folks I didn't know very well and was able to stay present relatively grounded SOBER and even got one meditation session in.  Baby steps.....**Struggle:** Learning to not eat or veg out on social media in response to stress/overwhelm is quite the challenge.  But I've just joined a gym so looking forward to using that for stress release.  Still got a case of the "now whats"...**Chat:** I use Evernote and Google calendar to stay organized in my personal life along with a notebook I use for lists and thoughts.  At work I use Things for staying on top of projects.  I'd like to start using Wonderlist more as it's an android version of Things that seems really flexible and adaptable.  What I'd REALLY like though is to have a life simple enough that this level of organization is not necessary.  Baby steps...
Triumph: I'm doing my best to prioritize living a sober life after a relapse...Struggle: Pretty disgusted with myself about said relapse. Starting to realize that I still don't really know how to make myself feel stable and happy...General Chat: I feel really out of sorts and unfocused at work which is frustrating because some of the big projects I'd been lobbying for in the past few months are starting to come through.

I'm on the subway so I can't write a long schpiel but I just sent this to my girlfriend and it about sums up where I'm at :..I don't always like getting up at 7 or having weeks of a packed schedule. But I like the man in the mirror these days and he's killin it so I might as well keep that up. 
....**Triumph:** Realised that I'm to blame no one else is to blame. It's all on me...**Struggle:** The stuff I've done drunk could potentially ruin my life and come back and bite me in the ass at any time....**General chat:** Hope watching/listening to motivational videos will help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZ0KbJcav0
**Triumph** Still sober....**Struggle** I feel like I am not really here.**General Chat** I am giving myself a pass on functioning at a 100% 
**Triumph:** Made it through thanksgiving weekend without drinking. Even went out to the bar with my old friends and nursed a water...**Struggle:** Feeling anxious/off/lazy past few days. I seem to go through this every few weeks lately where I feel off and can't focus on anything and I have no desire to talk to anyone. Could be PAWS but who knows. Been sleeping around 8 hours but I feeling like I need 12. Been late to work twice this week but no one has noticed (office job). I have had no motivation to get to the gym. I need to lose ~15 pounds...**General Chat:** Sober days are piling up. It's getting easier but I think focusing on my mental health is paramount now. Probably was self medicating for whatever anxiety/depression/ADD issues I have. It is easier though!
**Triumph:** Lined myself up for a productive and hopefully lucrative 2016...**Struggle:** Still haven't gone to the gym. Having trouble finding the right job...**GC:** I really want to start putting my best foot forward. I feel ready finally and hope that my life doesn't ape that of so many of my family members. I want to make sober friends.
**Triumph:** most things are going well...**Struggle:** Its amazing but issues that have been issues for years dont go away in days. Sobriety doesn't fix my problems but it does give me the opportunity to work on them...**Chat:** Stress is a big factor for me. Organizing and tracking my tasks is an effective way to reduce it. I use asimple task list note pad calendar grocery list and catch-all app. Plus email. Suddenly doesn't look so simple... Pre-crastination is key laying out the days tasks early and getting moving on them.
**Triumph:** the day before Thanksgiving I let my parents and sister know that I'm choosing to be sober. I basically said "drinking isn't good for me" and didn't go into great detail. they didn't pry or ask questions just said they were very proud and supported my decision. my mom can't drink too much anyway because of some digestive problems so she was my "sober buddy" throughout the holiday. so sweet!..**Struggle:** my dad has the best intentions but he kept offering me wine/champagne by habit then catching himself and apologizing profusely. I realized that sobriety is on my mind 24/7 but that isn't the case for my friends and family. it will take them a while to get used to it and stop enabling my old self. until then I'm trying so hard to stay strong decline and kindly remind them...**General Chat:** I use the Wunderlist app religiously! my husband and I even have a shared list called "Shit We Always Forget" the tasks that constantly end up on the back burner. when we have some free time we pull up the list and check something off: hang the painting finish some thank-you notes take apart the broken BBQ... moving those tasks from our brains onto a list helps reduce the cognitive overload and anxiety that weighs on our subconscious. and it feels great to get shit done. :) 
Triumph: Came back after restarting again. On day three and feeling better than yesterday and hoping I feel better tomorrow. Struggles: I had some weird kindling anxiety attack even after not drinking very much. Also still trying to figure out how to stay sober living with another alcoholic. General: Got my tree up and decorated and it's fun to see the kids so excited for Christmas. Might be applying for a new well paying job. A bit nervous about it but excited because I'd be working with one of my old friends from work who I miss very much.
**Triumph**: I have been promising myself I would clean up my act and at least cut down since my 30th birthday. I'll be 33 in January and have always found excuses not to quit. I'm kind of amazed that with the holidays and parties coming up I picked now. It's just time...**Struggle**: I'm not sure who to tell or what to tell. I told my best friend (who is also an alcoholic) and he was really supportive and also thinking of quitting. It felt liberating to just tell anyone since this has been my secret since I started. My husband is also an alcoholic but so far his drinking has not triggered me to want to drink. It's making me a little bit angry sometimes but my thought process is I need to deal with my addiction and problems first. We will get to the rest along the way as I recover. ..**General Chat**: I am thinking of coming clean about my drinking to my psychiatrist and psychologist - I didn't even tell them about it the entire time. I am hoping that my psychiatrist can adjust my meds to help if needed. Also I developed pretty bad psoriasis on my scalp and on other spots of my body that I am hoping go away. anyone else have this problem pre-sobriety? 
Triumph: winning at work! I love my new job. .Struggle: food issues raised their ugly demon heads this week. Those teeth are sharp. ..General chat: my brother went home after a holiday with us. Miss him loads but have a Christmas tree delivery this weekend. My first tree sober!
Triumph:  Well I made it for one day.  I finally worked up the courage to stop and talk to my Doctor yesterday and to use this site to help me stop drinking...Struggle:  This is only my seventh day of sobriety this calendar year.  Two last month and four days in a row in July when I was sick.  So far so good...General Chat:  My doctor put me on Gabapetin yesterday to help with anxiety issues of withdrawl but it seems to have a non-FDA use of reducing relapse and cravings...I will not drink today.
Triumph: I did some work on my fourth step today: I got some papers graded. I got a good nights sleep..Struggle: I'm starting to feel lonely. I'm not as far on my thesis as I would like to be. I have a cold. ..General chat: looks like a lot of people made it through thanksgiving sober!
It is my fourth night without drinking and I am out of town alone and surrounded by opportunities to drink. I guess I'll just go to bed now.  Good night everyone.
Well about 12 minutes later and I can't leave this place I am finding it to inspirational! Thank you all!
