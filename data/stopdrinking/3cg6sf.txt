I've promised myself and others a million times I was going to and I never followed through. But this time I faced my fears and I just did it. ..I don't believe that everyone needs AA to stay sober. But I believe everyone needs a plan and this is a huge compenent of mine. I kept on going through periods of sobriety followed by disastrous relapses and I think this is the best choice for me right now. ..I feel relieved and happy and nervous and very safe. And I can't wait to work the steps. I can't wait to realise my potential and to grow the F up. And I can't wait to live a life of sobriety. ..I hope everyone out there is having a good and sober day. Thank you!

&gt;But I believe everyone needs a plan..YES! How I wish I would have realized this earlier on. Congrats on getting a sponsor! Excited for you :)
Well put. Everyone does need a plan in everyone's plan looks different. There are similarities in success stories however at least that is what I have seen. Having contact with sober people seems to be helpful and it was for me. Also being careful about early sobriety in terms of people we associate with places we go etc. Best of luck!
Good for you!
I love having a sponsor! Someone that is willing to listen to you whine and complain about things and then offer constructive advice? For free? I've also found friendship with my sponsor and she's introduced me to many other people in the program. One alcoholic helping another :)
The hardest thing for me was asking for help. This is a huge first step! Keep up the good work!
