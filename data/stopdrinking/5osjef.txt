Apart from yourselves people from the alcohol support service and other half I never actually told anyone about my problem. Oh quite sure other people knew/suspected that's different. I didn't say it...Went to pub with some colleagues for someone's birthday. Pub drinking was never my problem really since I was always the driver. So we had good time...Outside for a smoke I had a private chat with one guy to see is he ok because he has depression. He told me somethings like he was sectioned before he came to work at Awesome Banter Inc (tm) and a bunch of other stuff. Surprised he told me that but he was/is struggling with things right now and needed someone to tell I guess. ..And so since he told me something personal and asked me to keep it to myself I did the same. It just came out as an impulse decision. "you asked me one time about me not drinking in pub we'll i'll tell you why - i'm an alcoholic." simple words but I was so surprises I said them and didn't trip on them...He asked me how long I had - then without asking anything else he gave me a big bear hug and said he was proud of me. even more surprise. very surreal evening but very positive. I won't be going around yelling about it fuck office gossip but I know that from him it won't go further...Keep on trucking friends life will surprise you :)
