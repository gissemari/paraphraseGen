*rambling* ..Hi guys. I need some support today. I'm early in my sobriety (after a handful of relapses) but I continue to drag myself forward every single day. ..The last six months have been hard beautiful and everything in between. My husband and I are visiting my family this weekend. I had a lot of anxiety leading up to this trip for the following reasons:..1. Trips usually equal lots of drinking..2. My husband is seeing my family after a really bad situation that involved alcohol (my fault) and the almost demise of our marriage. My spouse and I both drank a lot but he can handle his. Long story short my drinking was completely out of control six months ago and my family had to hear it from my husband about how he was fed up. They were upset that he chose to judge me rather than help (because he continued to drink with me) and I agreed. BUT although all of that may be true I too also know that my sobriety is MY responsibility and choice. ..Ive been attending regular meetings back home feeling good about my choice to not drink and surrounding myself with a great group of friends that support me and understand addiction. However all of these sober feelings mixed with anxiety and depression decided to pay me a visit today. I came close to drinking while at a pub having lunch with my husband but I chose to drink an NA. Not going to lie and say I still don't want to drink but something about being back home really triggered some feelings that I thought I was working through. ..I keep trying to remember to be kind and patient with myself but I'm my own worst enemy. Some days I look in the mirror and see an amazing and resilient 30 year old woman who realized she's an alcoholic and is taking action. But then there are days like today where I feel like drinking emotions running high anxious feelings of GUILT. These feelings aren't healthy and I've made an appointment to see my doctor and a psychiatrist because I need to be treated for anxiety along with my depression and OCD. Drinking has kept me away from getting healthy for so long and has lied to me and made me believe that it's the only way I can  feel better.  Alcohol makes me feel good for 30 min or until I inevitably black out. ..I'm a firm believer in cannabis and it has been a game changer for me. Anyway I'm rambling. Keep fighting the good fight my friends. ..IWDWYT

I'm glad to see you've made an appointment to see your doctor and a psychiatrist. A lot of us drink as a way of coping with our feelings or as a way to punish ourselves. Being sober for long enough should eventually help with your mental health a bit but facing your depression and anxiety issues sober will be essential to truly getting better. It'll be difficult so please check in with us daily! IWNDWYT.
Thank you so much for your message. Today has been quite an emotional roller coaster. Happy I didn't cave and drink. Happy to get back home at the end of this weekend and start on some serious self care. I will be sure to check in! Have a wonderful weekend.
