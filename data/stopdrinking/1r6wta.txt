... I got surprising news today. ..I was trying to end a relapse and get sober last month. I was about to start a new job on a Monday and decided Sunday would be my last time drinking. I was in a hotel and the next day would be driving across the state. I have a bit of gypsy in me. I am usually really good with being stocked with rations. I've forgotten to buy groceries before and when there is no store nearby yeah of course first world starving sucks. Anyways Sunday I forgot to buy snacks and proceeded to get drunk. Just the prior week I had bought a car my first car since I was 20 that was 5 years just riding buses bicycling and lots and lots of walking. I did not trust alcoholic-me with a car I always felt smart about that. I forgot my own rule against drinking and driving and went to Mcdonalds. On my way back to the hotel the cherries and berries lit up behind me. 0.13 BAC at the station. Spent 7 hours in jail and then a cop gave me a ride back to the hotel with a citation for DWI. Kept my car and drivers license. ..Today I called the prosecutor's office. They are sending me all the evidence for discovery. Apparently all I have to do is sign a paper admitting guilt and I will be fined $800. I will have a chemical dependency assessment and possibly 1 MADD panel. Unsupervised probation for 1 year. Ummm.... what? It sounded like the most underwhelming DWI plea bargain. *And I don't have a lawyer*..**FUTURE EVENTS APPEARING REAL** I did my best to avoid speculation since my arrest. Really since getting sober I am naturally feeling pretty upbeat about life. I was hoping for the best in a very general way. I did not forget I had pending legal issues but I also spent the minimal amount of time thinking about it. Just enough to make phone calls...Through my cycle of relapses quicker and quicker do I return to the pink cloud once sober. Its like SERENITY NOW! I am not drunk today and life is good.  I have a new coping mechanism if I hit a bump in the road this time: actually call a sober alcoholic in a time of my greatest need. When I relapsed I was debating myself one of those serious ponders on whether to go to a meeting or get drunk. I thought about calling my AA sponsor but ended up calling an old drinking friend instead. I had 6 people I could have called assuredly one would have answered. I dunno I never relied on the fellowship outright but it became such a big part of my life that once work became priority I just did not have the fortitude to stay sober alone. Now recovery is my main priority and I now am going to meetings nightly again. It has been so good to be back and now the program is starting to make the most sense for me...*"The Chinese word for "crisis" is a conflation of two characters. The first denotes great danger. The second denotes opportunity."*..I heard this a while back I am pretty sure it is not factual. But I totally feel that about whenever I fall down in life. I have to learn how to pick myself back up...

Consider yourself lucky  your shortcut over the double yellow did not hit oncoming traffic or a pedestrian - you did not total your car kill your passenger and wake up in hospital handcuffed to the bed facing a felony...I know men who are doing many years in prison because they were not so fortunate.  Call your sponsor now.  and start picking yourself back up.
