If you have seen my posts over the years you know I am a HUGE supporter of the concept  of Dry People/Dry Places in early sobriety.  Every now and then when I post in support of this I will get a response or PM usually from a new person telling me how wrong I am with a variation of the above logic.  For all you new and/or struggling people out there I want to respond to this and encourage others to list their reasons/arguments why this is the best advice possible:.. - First responding to DP/DP in early sobriety with the old "alcohol is everywhere what am I supposed to do lock myself in a room forever" is the same logic as my child telling me she can never cross a street because I have told her not to cross against a red light.  No one who advocates DP/DP means that you cannot go out and live your life.  They are telling you that going to a bar on St. Patricks day with just a few weeks of sobriety is simply reckless.  Going to a work function where everyone is drinking and you feel compelled to lie or fake your way through is asking for trouble.  Hosting a dinner party for your "friends" in early sobriety where alcohol is freely served and your SO is getting drunk makes absolutely no sense... - DP/DP does NOT mean you can never go out.  It means especially in early sobriety you must be very very vigilant.  Alcoholism is really fucking hard folks.  Why do you think the statistics are so poor for people to maintain long term recovery?  If something is so difficult that you statistically have less than a 10% chance at being successful doesn't common sense tell you that early on you should be doing EVERYTHING possible to increase your chances?.. - "Ah Nika that is easy for you to say you don't know my life and I really have no choice but to put myself in drinking situations early in recovery."  Respectfully none of us are as unique as we would like to believe.  Every single one of us has or have had a great reason to fail or quit at sobriety.  Whether your income is based on craft beer sales; you live in an incredibly small town where the only socialization is at the local bar; your SO is continuing to drink and you don't want to alienate him/her; all your friends are drinkers and they just won't understand; you need to "test" yourself and prove how strong you are; you are an introvert and your drinking is done at home so forcing yourself to go to bars is actually safer for you; or any one of a thousand other reasons **we have heard and lived through them all before and you are not unique.**..The fact of the matter is I have been around literally thousands of people attempting to find recovery I have never been around a successful happy person with long term recovery who would advise people in early recovery to ignore the DP/DP advice.  If you are in early recovery and you are prepared to ignore this advice you should ask yourself:  **Am I truly committed to quitting drinking and improving my life and the lives of those people who love me today and may love me in the future?**..I would love to hear other people's opinions/thoughts/experiences on DP/DP.  If I am wrong please feel free to tell me.  I promise you won't hurt my feelings.  :)  Thank you and have a great day.

\o/..Love this...Specifically: First responding to DP/DP in early sobriety with the old "alcohol is everywhere what am I supposed to do lock myself in a room forever" is the same logic as my child telling me she can never cross a street because I have told her not to cross against a red light.  ..*"lock myself in a room forever?"* - that question makes me crazy. 
It's the special snowflake syndrome.  The longer I am sober the more I come to realize that my problems are not unique and that most people in recovery have dealt with the same issues that I am facing...It is up to me whether or not I choose to listen to their suggestionsand learn from their experiences. 
This times 100000000. ..I was terrified to stop going out because I thought that it made me interesting. Dry people dry places taught me that I was not more interesting for my drinking it made me look outside the box for new things to do and adopt new habits and hobbies...I still need to find the motivation to write my damn book but by removing drinking events from my list of activities I've forced myself to do different things and the experiences I've had have been a lot more fun and a lot more rewarding. 
Gold-plated advice right here.
One thing that has really reinforced my sobriety this time is the ability to ask myself whether I might be wrong about something.  I used to make excuses about why AA wouldn't work for me (not saying it's for everyone but it certainly has helped me have the longest sober stretch in over 30 years) or why I had to go to a certain drunken event or or or.....Just the ability to step back and ask "Hm.  Is that really true or am I just making excuses?" about *lots* of things not just DP/DP or other alcohol-related scenarios has helped me keep my sobriety and made me a better person in general.
Still annoyed with how many alcohol kiosks there were at the freakin' zoo.
I agree with you completely. When in doubt about something I substitute the word "heroin" for the word "alcohol" so when I hear someone say in essence "I am trying to quit doing heroin but I hung out with all my other friends while they did heroin just to prove I could do it" I hear them putting themselves in a dangerous situation.
I had alcohol in my home still I think when I started I wanted to minimize my problem and make it seem like it wasn't a big deal - that overconfidence nearly cost me on at least two occasions in those early weeks where I decided I was going to pour myself a drink and only just pulled back from the brink. Therefore I cannot endorse the approach I took I just got lucky. ..Indeed in my "relapse pack" (that I hope never to need but it's there incase) on my things to do I have 'remove all alcohol from the house' - because I know that in early sobriety the urges to drink were strong and having no alcohol there would be an extra line of defence rather than relying on my willpower alone. ..I deliberately didn't go out to any drinking events until nearly 3 months sober; even then it was with a trusted relative accompanying me a sober strategy and an escape plan. And it wasn't an entirely comfortable affair.  
Thanks for this /u/Nika65. You're right about the "you are not unique" thing for sure. Honestly thinking I was a special snowflake is part of what got me in to drinking too much and then not recognizing it while it was happening. Normal people don't drink in the daytime? Well then I'll just hide it from them they're so judgmental they don't understand. So what if genes for alcoholism run in my family? I'm different I'm special it won't happen to me. Etc...I've been really wary about bars so far but I've found that there's a difference between going with a *group* of people who drink (I haven't done that yet I'm scared to do that) and going with just one person who drinks moderately and supports my recovery. I've been able to do that especially if there's another reason to be there like listening to a band or eating food or doing a crossword with a friend. (Yes crosswords. I am that much of a dork - I have a crossword buddy.) 
I planned poorly this week-end and ended up in a bar. I am also a firm believer in DP/DP. As you said that strategy requires a lot of work and planning more than I even thought because I failed to plan properly this weekend. I owe my sobriety to DP/DP and I will not let myself end up in a bar one again...I'm also post of the /r/loseit community and they have  CICO calories in/calories out. It seems to work well and the plan is simple it's just hard to stay consistent. That's the same with DP/DP.
Early after I stopped stupid me left lights on car and battery died by end of work. Nice coworker helps me yank battery and takes me to auto shop to test it. They say it's good give us 1-1.5 hours it'll be recharged. Coworker is all "cool. Me and guys are going to bar to watch game. Come hang and we'll pick up later." Alchie brain went into overdrive rationalizing and I said "nope. Gotta get home. I'll buy a new battery."       .Literally had 2 clerks and a friend trying to talk me out of waste $ on a good battery. Couldn't really explain my justification. But that was $90 well fucking spent.     ..Dry People Dry Places.    .Addiction isn't a pop quiz don't test myself. 
When I finally committed to long term sobriety DP/DP naturally followed. It's just how it works. Now I never find myself in those places because I see how pointless going to them is.
Hear hear Nika.  This is my third long-term sober trip (2+ years 9+ years and...on day 80).  More than ever this time the DP/DP wisdom has been crucial.  The first time I got sober most of my friends were also and that made a tremendous difference (in fact I started drinking again when I moved to a new city with a new partner who drank). The second time I got sober I was so clear about not drinking that I avoided alcohol like the plague...until I didn't.  This time because most of my drinking was being done at home I had to make my home a dry place and ask my partner (same one) to be dry at home with me too.  I truly believe that's been crucial this time and I'm confident that my partner will support me in it for however long I ask.  Then I can manage the extremely rare occasions I go out like Friday night when we went to see a band play and took 3 liters of bubbly water with us so I knew I would have what I needed for the night.
Love this...For me there was also a different dimension to this advice. DP/DP was a great introduction in learning how to set boundaries for myself and in particular in how to say "no"...Just like how I am am powerless of alcohol I believed that given a strong craving I couldn't say "no" to it I thought that if my friends/SO/boss/Pope/dentist/random person I just met/etc. invited me to a situation involving drinking I couldn't say "no" to that either. Because... actually I can't remember why. Because I just had to go? They might get upset? Who knows. All I know is I had to go...Learning how to say "nah" to things I don't want to do was like learning a super power. I couldn't believe I could do what I wanted to do in my own life...One common thread amongst the "I had to go be around drinking" posts is how truly AWFUL the situations are described. Mine were no different. And they lead to relapse.
I 100% agree.  Sure you can order a club soda and nobody will bat an eye...but when everyone orders there 2nd drink THAT'S when Pedro sneaks in.  "They are on drink #2 you can order 1 CAUSE CLEARLY  they have an issue not you my special snowflake... Why put yourself in that chaos early on? Until you get some time sober your will is weak.  Hell at almost 6 months I'm still weak.   Definition of insanity that is.  
Thanks for using my comment. I was thinking of writing a post on the subject also...I think my main problem with this sub is that often when people provide the DP/DP advice it feels just like they are telling their little kid off and I see comments such as; "why they hell would you do that" "why would you do this....???" etc. ..I don't mind tough love or the bare truth of facts based off experience but many times it does not sound like two adults talking to each other; but one taking a superior position and giving the poster another negative thought to dwell on. I also feel that this type of negative response is somewhat offensive to someone who has been brave enough to give us this insight; as we all know they are useful to reinforce and remind us of our own limitations...In regards to the question should/shouldn't that person have gone to XXX venue while I would agree that generally we are not unique in that we could all potentially relapse equally I do feel we are all different in terms of; a) how we made the decision to be sober; b) the level and extent of our 'sober tool box'...I have turned down and intentionally avoided many invites to places I would have wanted to drink however at the the same time I have also been working hard on fundamentally changing my perception of alcohol; and have been out and socialised **(because I wanted to)** without having any desire to drink. ..I also accept that you need to avoid triggers and limit temptation. However I do honestly believe that with the right tools and solid foundation of your sobriety you should be able to sit in front of a drink and not want to drink it. ..In regards to these two situations:  ..&gt; telling you that going to a bar on St. Patricks day with just a few weeks of sobriety is simply reckless. Going to a work function where everyone is drinking and you feel compelled to lie or fake your way through is asking for trouble.  .&gt; I can walk past 10 shops a day where I could just walk in and buy a bottle  ..I believe if anyone is significantly differentiating from these types situations must be dependant on their personal perception/experience; because for me these two situations are not really different at their core and can be tackled with the same tools. I went out to bars and drunk heavily and I also bought alcohol from multiple shops regularly. I could literally walk two minutes down the road now to my local shop where I used to buy most of my alcohol and stock up on any type of alcohol I wanted; or I could call a friend and meet up at a bar and drink it dry;  The same basic tools prevent me from doing either of these things; a) changing routine b) avoiding influence and c) education. ..To try and sum up; I am totally in agreement with the principle of DP/DP and agree it is good behaviour to learn in the early period (which I am and will continue to practice myself) however the way it is often told to the person who has lapsed or had a near-miss often sounds condescending and lacks any maturity or substance and to me sounds entirely negative (intended or not). ..Thanks for posting on what I fully accept is an important issue.
Hell yes. Well said.
I agree completely with these words. So far in sobriety the only situation I've been in was a small dinner a couple weeks ago where a bottle of wine happened to be present. The bottle was split by the four other people at the dinner so no one was drunk but being close to alcohol made me more uncomfortable than I expected. For me DP/DP is important because I don't want to be close to alcohol. Just seeing it and other people enjoying it gives me a weird sinking feeling in my stomach kind of like seeing an ex flirting with someone else at a party. Avoiding it for the time being makes early sobriety easier. ..Another thing I don't understand is why anyone would even want to attend a heavy-drinking event. Being around drunk people while you're sober is about the least fun way to spend a night that I can think of. 
Clear.  Accurate. Actionable. Accountable.  Solid!!
I'm so glad that you posted this. This really needs to be read by all people who are newly sober or just coming back. This would be a great post to link to in the future :)
People with much more experience than me (who have actually succeeded at maintaining sobriety) continue to stress the importance of DP/DP so I'm not going to be one to argue. I'm 62 days into sobriety which is still well within the zone where relapse is more likely than longterm recovery so I still have much more to learn myself. ..That being said for me personally just being in a place where alcohol exists hasn't been a problem. I still have about $10000 in Scotch lining my shelves at home (mostly because i'm too lazy to figure out how to sell it and I refuse to pour $10K in booze down my sink like I did with the cheap stuff). I still hang out with my friends who drink. I still go to restaurants that serve alcohol. What I have found more true for myself is to stick to dry SITUATIONS vs. dry people or places. By that I mean I avoid situations where drinking is the activity or the sole purpose of the evening. I would never go meet my friends "for a couple of drinks" and then just order a club soda. I would never have friends over 'just to hang out and shoot the shit over a couple of beers' and expect that i'll enjoy myself as they get drunk and rambling to each other and i sit around sober. When I'm getting together with people there is always a plan. If I'm going to a restaurant/pub I'm going for dinner and then i'm going to leave the restaurant/pub the minute dessert is done. If i'm having friends over we're going to play games or we're going to go see a movie etc. I wouldn't go out to a bar for St. Paddy's day or go to a club to just stay sober and dance because these are activities that are fun because of drinking not in spite of it. Luckily for me some of my friends drink and some don't so drinking is so rarely the actual activity for the evening and I am safe. This may be nuanced but it's reality for me so far. The activity and the situation is much more important than the people or the places (that being said obviously heavy drinkers would put me in drinking-focused activities so I wouldn't hang around with them)...All of this being said I would never advise anyone who is newly sober to listen to me - they should be listening to those with more experience and they should be listening to what works for MOST people vs. what works for me. I only state my slightly different experience because I do sometimes find people here get quite judgemental if people aren't doing things the exact way that works for them (note: this is not referring to the OP  who is always extremely respectful of others). This post is great because it is simply providing advice from experience and I truly respect that. 
Thank you for posting this Nika. I cringe every time a read about someone 'testing' themselves after a week or two of not drinking. I don't think you're wrong.
Thanks for this Nika great post!..This advice is solid and hard to argue with including the point that you should do everything possible to increase your chances of sobriety certainly in early sobriety..However I do have a question though (devils advocate time) in the realm of possiblity. I've come across a number of characters who have on getting sober continued to go out to bars and clubs and stay sober successfully long-term (i'm not talking about those who use willpower to do this and then cave and relapse but people who have done this successfully long-term). E.g.There's a youtuber who has been sober for 5 years and continues to go to bars and just order water with a wedge of lemon he hasn't relapsed there's another guy (a pick-up artist) who goes to bars and night clubs 7 nights a week for 10 years and remains sober. There's the Allen Carr book and Jason Vale who goes out to a pub and drinks his pineapple juice and lemonade. I guess what i'm saying is it's POSSIBLE there are people who have done this... and i'll be honest those are the people i'd like to emulate (to be clear I never want to drink alcohol again i'm done with it)...I read some AA literature in another thread earlier and to paraphrase they were talking about having achieved an indifference to alcohol and they could now be around alcohol without experiencing the temptation to drink. That's really the place i'd like to get to...*I would never recommend anyone else on this sub go to bars even beyond early sobriety as for some a single slip has the potential to lead to jail insanity or death and people on the sub have written about this.*  However for me personally now that I know the above is POSSIBLE/achievable and want that for myself is indifference to alcohol while maintaining an active social life really such a bad thing to have as my ultimate goal? ..Thanks for reading...............
Please lend my voice to DP/DP in early sobriety. On this go at sobriety I reached out and took help. DP/DP was a good sound piece of advice. There was no reason for me to 'test' myself by hanging out at bars and other places of easy temptation. I knew I would be tested in other ways but as I could see the temptation coming it was better to avoid it. This is an excellent post and there are many really good responses here. 
So there are people out there who don't see DP/DP as common sense?  
DP/DP has been the difference for me this time around. I took note of the line 'Hang out in a barbers long enough and at some point you're going to get a hair cut' and 'You relapse before you pick up a drink'...Last year I also stopped drinking for January with the intention of 're-wiring my brain' about alcohol. It didn't work. I continued to meet friends at bars and for a while was happy to drink sparkling water. By May last year I'd only had an alcoholic drink on 4 days that year but without the habit change I was doomed to failure. Which is what happened...Reading this sub has helped me understand how I need to change my behaviour. It's taken a bit of time for me to get my head around the fact I can't moderate very well. I knew I drank more than was good for me but didn't really understand that for me it's about not picking up in the first place...Now I do understand I've put plans in place and changed behaviour. ..So far so good... 
What do you consider early recovery? 3 months? 6 months? A year? 
I read this post earlier and have taken a long time to think about it and respond. I see my specific scenario I posted about yesterday and of course my first reaction was to take personal offense to this though I'm sure none was intended. ..I get that in early sobriety we are to be very selfish putting sobriety as our #1-#10 priorities and all else comes afterwards. And yes ideally we should avoid any and all drinking situations. ..I totally get what you are saying and I agree with the concept. I simply must counter with the fact that life is NOT black and white. Granny has a wake where alcohol is going to be served and everyone in your family is a booze hound. Do you not go? Can you understand why an individual committed to sobriety may still attend such a high risk function? What do you say to people facing this type of dilemma? ..And I agree with the guy who expressed annoyance at how ubiquitous alcohol is. "Dry places" are pretty hard to find in my neck of the woods. We were at the theme park today and there was beer and wine everywhere. I take my kid to the Chuck E Cheese - beer and wine available. I go to get my fucking hair cut - the salon carries red and white wine. ..I hope someone can understand why a person may be committed to sobriety (I am taking naltrexone because I so badly want my life back and I cannot deal with the cravings on my own) and still put themselves in a high risk situation early in sobriety. I'm not saying it's smart or ideal but I can see how it happens. 
I was (and still am) able to keep wine in the house only because the bottles weren't open. I remember when my mom came by when I was four months in. I opened a bottle for her and ended up sending it home with her. Too dangerous to keep it once opened.
you are so RIGHT..thank you for the post...I almost went out around day 10 and luckily those plans fell through. thank GOD because only in hindsight could i see how short-sighted and stupid that wouldve been...thanks again for the post.
