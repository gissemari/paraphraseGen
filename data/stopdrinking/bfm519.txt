I've  attempted to quit many times. I quit for a year for my pregnancy the moment I was aware. It was so easy because I knew I had to for the best for my child. (A few years ago) However I'm having alot of trouble staying away from alcohol now...I drink at least 10 shots of vodka per day. I'm 27. I've been drinking for at least 9 years heavily.  (Not while pregnant)  750ml bottle of tequila used to last 2-3 days when I was about 19. Eventually I could only drink  clear alcohol. This started my path of 1.75L bottles of vodka.. 2x per week until now. ..I've been to urgent care emergency rooms had xrays and EKG done IV anxiety alcohol withdrawal medication and nausea/vomiting meds...I was on day 5 today and messed up..Last fall I just did cold turkey did 2 months and was totally fine somehow...I'm not sure what to do. I keep eating when I want to drink I'm not nearly overweight. Im 122-125 @ 5'8" ...I lost 15lb this year being sick from vomit. I keep drinking 10+ cups water as normal but I'm lacking something I feel...I have severe joint pain and exercise is a real struggle. I wonder if I can do something to help take my mind off alcohol that doesnt bring me serious pain.
