Two years ago I was coming off a bad relapse. I didn't think I could do it and I thought I was going to die at 22 years old. I had lost my best friend a few months before 1 month after his 23 birthday and on my 22 birthday. I never believed I could change but oh how I have changed. I have a family again more friends than I could ever imagine and a life filled with new passions like rock climbing and volunteering...People can change and life oh life gets amazing. If you are struggling today please please please know this is possible and your life will change in ways you could never imagine. Namaste

Congrats! 
Your two years gives hope to those who think they are "too young" to get sober.              .Thank you and congratulations.
Congratulations you are doing what I couldn't do when I was your age it took me until I was 27 to sting any time together. Good Job my friend. 
Thanks for the post man I'm waking up on day #2 after not missing a day for at least two months. I'm 22 right now Accounting/Real Estate double major with a decent (3.0) GPA but I'm scared shitless of life. One day at a time hopefully tomorrow morning I'll be on day #3.
Congrats
What an inspiration for me - great job!
Way to go! Keep it up! I got sober at 23 and have about 4.5 years now. It's totally possible to be young and sober. 
It is definitely possible to change to live to be happy and to be free.  Congratulations.
Rock on climb_on_rocks!
Fair play to you.  I agree that we can all change I know I have as well. Well done. K eep on climbing!
