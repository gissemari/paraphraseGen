I blew a 55 day streak yesterday. Trying to figure out what happened I came across Scott Stevens's book "Every Silver Lining has a Cloud" which I'm finding hugely helpful- I recommend it to anyone struggling with what he calls sobriety symptoms which he identifies as the effects of elevated cortisol (apparently nearly universal among alcoholics).
