Hello again. ..I was just coming up to 4 months sober when I was out down the pub it was a really sunny day and I just thought  fuck it I'll order a g&amp;t I can moderate it it'll be fine ... wrong. That ended up being mistake number one. Mistake number two was repeating that first mistake for just over a week. ..Worst thing is after the first day of drinking I woke up the next day with hangover anxiety and felt awful and knew it wasn't worth it and maybe I needed to do it to get rid of my illogical romanticised thoughts about alcohol. I had no desire to drink yet still ended up doing so many more times. ..Until a few days ago. I had a really really bad situation happen where I had a breakdown in public in front of complete strangers and two people I care about deeply. I was on a floor I had no idea where I was I couldn't move I couldn't speak and when I did speak nobody could understand what I was saying. I thought I was actually fading out and was going to die. It was a mess. Thankfully that was what needed to happen for it to click in my head that this relapse only has to last as long as I let it. And that stops now. ..Am I gutted I didn't make it to 4 months sober? Yes. Is it going to hold me back from doing better next time? No. Starting to realise that a relapse isn't the end of the world it's a common occurrence. Relapse can be a part of recovery as long as you're not relapsing to recover. Now I've gone back to drinking after the longest time I've been sober in years and seen the awful things it does to my body and my mind I'm good thanks. I'll take day one and start again over that any day. ..So there's my story. I'm not sure why I posted accountability more than likely. I hope everyone is having a wonderful evening. X

Relapses happen.  And you are correct - learn from it and try again.  Because you only fail if you *stop* trying...You can do this OP...IWNDWYT.
You got this! One set back doesn't reset the whole thing nor does it mean you're weak...I will not drink with you today.
