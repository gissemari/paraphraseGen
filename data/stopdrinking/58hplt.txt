Hi all .I'm only on day 5 but i know tonight is going to be a struggle the Packers play the Bears and watching the Packers is a big trigger for me any suggestions on how to avoid temptation? ..Thanks

Okay. Well as someone who is NOT a sports fan it really seems like maybe this is just a form of entertainment that is best avoided for awhile. You said it's a trigger so isn't that going to take your enjoyment out of the game?..Seems to me the same as avoiding other events like parties and bar hopping. I'm not saying NEVER watch a game again but maybe take a few weeks off?
I am on day 7 so we are very similar as far as time sober. What I'm doing is avoiding anything that is a known trigger. I won't have to do that forever I don't think but I think so early in sobriety I need to set myself up for success...I know that's probably not what you want to hear. :) but it's honestly the best advice I can give. Whatever you decide we are here for you and I will not drink with you today!
Well the obvious suggestion would be "avoid watching the Packers"...Would that mitigate or eliminate the temptation?..There's an aphorism that is time tested: "Dry People Places and Things"...Just for today I forgo ONE drink - The First One
Thanks for the pointers the Packers are just about everything to me I actually used to purposely not drink during the games because i wanted to remember clearly what had happened but as my drinking got worse it turned into another "event" i could use as an excuse for drinking. 
I made it through the game with an assist from cran ras La Croix. The temptation was there all the snapchats of friends drinking but i resisted and I'm so glad i did. I felt great during work didn't have the normal anxiety and headache.
