I relapsed last night. I do so well for like 3/4 days and then I think I can handle it again. And I can't. The ten beers I downed and the black out I experienced can attest to that. I'm really frustrated with myself and with the fact that I threw away my progress. I don't know why I keep thinking I can best this and still drink. I don't know why not drinking is so difficult. I get demoralized so easily by one thing or another and just say fuck it and drink. I want to break this cycle. Sober me has vision and plans and hopes and dreams drunk me lays in bed and hates themselves and berates themselves. Ugh. So here's to the millionth day one I will not drink with you today.

Trial and error has shown you repeatedly that going back to alcohol doesn't work for you...The good thing is you've got enough data now to know that...That data is not going to change after two or three days or three weeks or two months or 1099 days.  .Simple equation: some of us plus alcohol always equals blackout drinking...Start by not drinking today...And then when tomorrow is today don't drink today...And repeat...And don't do it alone. I went to AA and that worked wonders for me.

Realizing I can't moderate was a huge turning point for me. Once I accepted that I found that not drinking was actually easier. The book This Naked Mind helped me with the cravings.
