The first week I was great I can do this I kept telling myself. The last couple of days I've felt very anxious and irritable though. I'm doing "go sober for october" to raise money for cancer. I thought this would be a great extra incentive but now I'm telling myself ."It's still September just have a blow out"! I'm battling demons in my head constantly. As much as I think I want to I will not drink with you tonight

Stay strong and I will not drink with you tonight.
How about sober October + 10. 
I'm on 8 days since my last drink been drinking nearly every nighy for about 3 years and I feel exactly the same. The first week I felt unstopple like this would be a piece of cake but the last 2 nights have been difficult. My husband says if I go for the bottle he's walking. So I'm going to an AA meeting tomorrow whixh also has one at the same time for families who are dealing with alcoholic family members. I wish you the best of luck you're probably way stronger than I am. You got this. 
Don't turn back now. You've got this. It will pass and you'll feel great. 
I will not drink with you tonight!..What helps me is to strike a bargain with myself - I say "ok if you still really want to have a drink tomorrow you can. Just not tonight." Then tomorrow comes and I find I'm proud of another day in the bank and I have a renewed commitment to another day. For whatever reason the permanence / long-term commitment of saying I will never again have another drink (or not for a very long time) is too overwhelming. But one day at a time? I can make it one day. No promises about tomorrow. Just not today. ..You can do this!
