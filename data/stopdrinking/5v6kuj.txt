For the past year up until 3 weeks ago I was drinking 70-100 drinks a week... Over the last 13 days I've had exactly 1 drink and it's all due to nootropics and neurofeedback treatments...I'll go over the nootropics first. ..Get Through Withdraws With Agmatine Sulfate.....For anyone who is experiencing acute withdraws and is wondering how they're going to get through it I can't recommend Agmatine Sulfate enough...Here's my personal experience with Agmatine. 3 weeks ago I had intense DTs. headaches. Nauseau. Confusion. Hand tremors to the point where I couldn't type. I went home and took one dose of Agmatine dissolved in a glass of water... My withdraw symptoms disappeared almost 100%...My rudimentary understanding of why this works: Alcohol withdraw is caused by overactive glutamine receptors in your brain and Agmatine is a glutamine antagonist. ..Here are some studies they've done that show Agmatine attenuates alcohol withdraw:..1) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10628739.2) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20394743..Using Dihydromyricetin for Anti-intoxication (Over the counter naltrexone alternative).....After finding Agmatine I did a bit more research and came across this study. ..https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292407/..I bought some Dihydromyricetin off of amazon and tried it out. True to the study on the nights I took some and then had a drink the drink did nothing for me. I felt none of the typical "buzz" and felt no compulsion to drink after the first few sips...I have found that on nights where I have a particularly intense cravings for booze I take some dihydromyricetin and I'm not worried because I know that drinking after I take it won't get me drunk and it won't do the same things for me...Kicking the cravings with Neurofeedback.....Since I'm not a neuroscientist I'll try and keep my explanations as to why this works to a minimum. From what I can tell scientists have proven a relation between addictive behaviors and activity in a certain area of the brain. ..https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233284047_LORETA_Neurofeedback_for_Addiction_and_the_Possible_Neurophysiology_of_Psychological_Processes_Influenced_A_Case_Study_and_Region_of_Interest_Analysis_of_LORETA_Neurofeedback_in_Right_Anterior_Cingula..Neurofeedback is the process of retraining your brain to produce more of certain types of brain waves and less of others. ..From http://www.bmedreport.com/archives/6071 "How Effective Is Alpha-Theta Neurofeedback?.The Peniston Protocol and the Scott and Kaiser Modifications of the Peniston Protocol (discussed below) are effective treatments when defined as long term abstinence. Reports of approximately 50%   80% success inpatient (Burkett Cummins Dickson & Skolnick 2005; Scott & Kaiser 1998; Scott Kaiser Othmer & Sideroff 2005) and 70% success outpatient (Callaway & Bodenhamer-Davis in press) using various definitions of  treatment success   abstinence  and  relapse.  Participants that complete a Peniston Protocol program can experience the  Peniston Flu  an effect in which nearly 50% of subjects experience an allergic reaction to their abused substance (Demos 2005). This attests to the powerful effects that are possible with alpha-theta neurofeedback."..My personal experience: I started neurofeedback treatments with my doc 3 weeks ago. They begin with taking a QEEG brain map. That brain map is run against 3 databases of other "normal" brain maps to find out how yours differs...It turns out my brain doesn't naturally produce alpha waves which govern relaxation. And you know what artificially produces alpha waves... alcohol!..So my neurofeedback has been tailored to help my brain produce more alpha. During a session the doc puts 1 electrode on each ear and one on the top of my head. Turns on a program. She has it set to that when my brain produces the right amount of alpha waves a green pixelated guy on the screen runs and a marimba sound plays. No alpha waves no guy running no marimba sound. She says this works off of operant conditioning https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning#Neurobiological_correlates_of_operant_conditioning..I have found these neurofeedback sessions to be extremely effective. Within 10 minutes during the first session I felt a deep and abiding relaxation I had never felt while sober...I had been drinking 70-100 drinks a week for over a year before I started these treatments. ..And here is my drinking calendar since I started the treatments:.http://i.imgur.com/rWyOImp.jpg..I have gone into treatment sessions craving booze like no other and left with the cravings either gone or significantly reduced...Here's the craziest thing. This past friday I had a craving for booze. I went to the bar I had a single drink. It tasted weird gross I didn't have anymore. ..I don't think I've ever just had 1 drink. And certainly I've never went from one to none the next day in my previous attempts to stop drinking...Here are some more studies about neurofeedback:.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3650238/.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8801245..Hopefully this post finds someone in need. For me it's been a long road to come to all this info. Years. I had tried NA. I had tried AA. I had tried SMART. I had tried CBT...After my experience with neurofeedback I am firm in my belief that this will eventually be seen as a CURE to addiction. ..After so many years addiction I am happy to say I see my light at the end of the tunnel. My cravings are nearly 100% gone. I'm free of acute withdraw symptoms. I don't worry about having that first drink because I know it just doesn't do anything for me anymore...And for the first time I feel confident on my road to recovery because I have science I can point to to say this really WORKS...If you want to find a doc near you that does neurofeedback go to this site and find someone that is "BCN" certified. ..http://bcia.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1..Here's to many more SOBER DAYS. <3....

Awesome post - some excellent food for thought.
Some interesting info here...How long do you think this will be effective for you? I've found the tools I need to stay sober change with time. What I do now is very different that what I did two years ago.
