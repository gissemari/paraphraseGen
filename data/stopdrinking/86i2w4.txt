Randomly have been struggling this past week thinking about mistakes I've made in the past of course after drinking way too much. I don't want to reach for a bottle or anything (if anything it makes me want to stay away even more) but it just really holds me back. I just feel myself pulling away from the people who love and support me because I feel like I don't deserve them. Anyone else go through similar? ..Anyway you guys have no idea how much you've helped me this past year. Even if I don't post I come here and read when I'm not in a good place and it really really helps. Lots of love

Wear gloves and don't hit it too hard. Don't want you to break a knuckle...Gratz!
I've researched this kind of thing (of course!  I'm so curious about what the heck and why the heck I do stuff!).There is a good amount of humility involved in the ability to take a clear honest look at ourselves.  It's commendable you are able to do that!  Congratulations you have a conscience!  ..Shame is a healthy response that precipitates change.  Dwelling in the shame without making the change is missing the point.  The mechanism of shame works to induce a person to explore their motives actions abilities and character... and then explore favourable alternatives that will bring these more into alignment with the behaviours they really aspire to.  Then they act to create the changes.  ..I used to berate and isolate myself... it isn't productive... how can I contribute good to my circles of friends family and co-workers if I am demeaning myself?  There is a healthy balance in there and you deserve to use the gift of introspection to find yours and use it.  ..You have a rich life waiting and the inborn ability to uncover that in yourself! .It brings me great happiness to join you in not drinking today friend.  I wish you inner and outer peace and true contentment.         .
