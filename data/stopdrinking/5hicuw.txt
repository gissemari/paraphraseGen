I was sober for 4 months and relapsed and wanted to stop and go back cuz I was super in control of my life..eating healthy and super fit and had my routines and felt on top of my shit but after that I got into a deep depression and couldn't make myself get out of bed or clean or be normal so I was like fuck it I already fucked up and can't get back to normal so may as well keep partying cuz my life sucks right now and that's all that makes me feel anything but then after of course I feel horrible and want to die so I just don't know what to do. I want help and want to get better but get so depressed I have no motivation and just want to sleep...

Hey have you been doing sobriety on your own? Do you have a network of sober alcoholics that can support you?
