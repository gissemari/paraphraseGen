I'm ready to get sober and get my shit together. In no way is my badge accurate; I fully relapsed and stopped caring about sobriety. I was getting drunk every night on anything just like before...I haven't posted in many months because I was busy getting fucked up while fucking my life up in the process...I'm sick of feeling down on myself and constantly putting myself down for being an alcoholic. Sick of being recognized at the liquor store. I'm tired of lying and stealing and deceiving and pushing away those who are close to me...2019 is going to be different. It's a "New Year's Resolution" of mine. I'm defeated. You win Alcohol! You beat me! You knocked me into a multi-year coma! I've just woken up and now it's my turn to kick your fucking ass. I hate you Alcohol I fucking hate you!

I am with you!  IWNDWYT 
It didn't win you're just tired of playing with that good for nothing alcohol :) 
Sounds like to me you're powerless over alcohol and you're life becomes unmanageable while being an active alcoholic. Understand there's no more room in your life for alcohol anymore its done enough. You're right it won and that's fine with me too. Fuck alcohol.
