I'm posting here because I want to live a drug and alcohol free life.  I relapsed in late July after 50 some odd days of sobriety.  I will never stop trying until I succeed.  This is my struggle.  Thanks for reading.

What are you going to do differently this time?
Can you identify where the weak point was? Did you see it coming?
I struggled in the beginning but eventually I must have given up the fight.  It was just so difficult to stay drunk the whole time.  I changed my approach and really tried to stay sober the whole time.  It's working till today.  I had avail of the free help that is available almost everywhere.  Good luck with your struggle.  Keep up the good fight!
