The good news is I haven't slipped yet. ..I passed 70 days and didn't notice until the end of day 71. Day 71 itself was a killer   difficult issues came up I was struggling with my depression and I found myself in *that* space asking my mate if I was allowed to go and get the wine from the kitchen frustrated and angry because everyone else can drink and I can't and it's so fucking unfair. ..But I didn't drink. ..My health is still pretty wrecked and I'm still sleeping more of the day away than I'd like. But I am not drinking. I'm not even smoking now. ..I'm doing good and IWNDWYT

Great job on 74 days!..It can be very frustrating if we allow ourselves to feel like victims but now that I've had enough separation from it I see my former addict self as the real victim...And to make things easier to manage I asked my wife to simply not keep alcohol in the house so if she wants to drink she brings home only what she's going to have that night and there's no question about whether any of it is for me (it is not)...This way I am not constantly tempted in my own home/sanctuary plus I'm not putting her in the position of playing the cop/warden.  ..For the most part it has worked well.

Some days are still really hard but it sounds like you're doing really well. I found around the time you're at absolutely horrific myself but it's definitely better now..
