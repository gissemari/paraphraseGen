*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*...**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**...I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others..It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!.*****..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**....Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!.What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up..*****...**What this is:**...A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning..*****...**What this isn't:**...A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread..*****...    This post goes up at:.    US Night/Early Morning.    Europe Morning.    Asia and Australia Evening/Night...A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar..*****...Good morning sober friends! ..All the replies and pledges yesterday gave me goosebumps! (Or  chicken skin  in my language haha.) I find it truly wonderful to see how many brave people are here and how supportive and willing to change everyone is. It's great! You are great! ...I feel that it's a real process to accept that (and understand why) I became addicted to alcohol. What once began at 16 yrs old (that's what the legal drinking age over here was at that time) as something that was normal to do at parties and pubs developed into a nightmare when I became an adult. When truly bad life events happened in my life I couldn't cope anymore in a healthy way. Escaping and numbing where the only ways I knew how to deal with things. I became lost and stuck in an alcohol induced labyrinth. I've tried to cut corners bumped into dead ends tried jumping the hedges tried to cheat tried to find easy ways out tried blaming the darn labyrinth kicked the hedges sat numb on the ground and repeated these methods endlessly. I could never seem to find the exit. ...I needed to accept that I kept expecting different outcomes to the same numbing choices I made over and over again. I also had to accept that I knew the way out for a long time. I had to stop drinking. I knew it with every bottle I drank. I just had to have to courage to do it (again). It took all the strength I had left to pick up the phone last summer of 2018 to call my doctor and say:  I'm stuck. I need help with getting to the exit. I know where it is. I don't want to die in here  . I was exhausted en fed up. It takes one second to remind myself the horrors of last year and I can deal with anything I need to deal with today. Sober. Not always easy but it's the only way for me. This time I'm putting in the work. On all levels. I read many posts on here from people who are also stuck. It breaks my heart to see the pain and struggles. I know what it's like as I was stuck too. I wish everyone who is struggling today the strength to be done but I know it was a process for me too and I'm just like any other addict. We need to be ready and willing. Willing to give it all!! I'm giving it my all and I hope you are with me today! One day at a time. Have a good one!! The sun is going to be shining today in my little country :) Life is better on the sober side. ..IWNDWYT..Cato and cats.....
----------immediate responses--------

IWNDWYT.   
Thanks for doing the checkin Cato! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT Cato!
Day 2 here we come! IWNDWYT :D
IWNDWYT 
Thank you for the powerful post u/SilverCato ! You inspire me.  I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT. Just wrapped up my first week bring on day 8! 
Thank you for the post Cato very thought provoking. IWNDWYT
Life is indeed better on the sober side. Very honest post Cato! It will be my pleasure staying sober with you today - Monday April 8 2019. Be well &amp; be your awesome self!
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
Today my limbic system will tell me: "come on one will not hurt you. You are functional you are responsible you can moderate. Couple of beers after training feels so good yeah?". While my prefrontal cortex will be saying - "you cannot be sober even for one week this is not normal you have some dopamine-based issues you need to rewire your brain so even one will hurt"..So I'm making a pledge to myself: IWNDWYT..I really need to fix my brain.
Day 4. The first Monday. I don't need a drink or six after work. 
Thanks for the read. Happy to say I won't be drinking with you today. 
Have a nice week guys day 9for me
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today.
Good morning Cato and everyone else here at SD!..Today I will be leaving for a short holiday break.something I have been very much looking forward to. We will go hiking there's a sauna in the house lots of time to enjoy being around my family... ..The downside is that we used to have a drink all together every time before dinner. I feel scared that I will not be able to resist. I have already relapsed twice during holiday breaks...But here's for today: I will not drink and I'll be mindful when the craving hits me. 
Staying sober.
Iwndwyt. One day at a time..x
Had a horrible struggle yesterday with my drinking brain and I lost. Resetting my badge and hopping back on the train. I'm setting my intent this morning not to drink for 24 hours with you. See you guys again tomorrow :)
 IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT
Another day down and another ahead IWNDWYallT.
IWNDWYT. Great job hosting Cato I love your description of being lost in a labyrinth. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. 
Good morning.  Not going to drink alcohol today.
Not drinking today! Welcome to the check-in Cato. ..Really struggling today with the heat some frustration that feels unbearable. But a full day and I hope I'll keep my head down and cool. 
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in! 
No booze today!
It's April 7 and iiiiiiim just checkin I'm on youuuuu
I'm glad to be able to be here today not drinking with all of you  
Can't sleep tonight so checking in at 2:30am. On day 32 and still going strong! IWNDWYT!
Checking in IWNDWYT
Nope. Not today Poison..IWNDWYT..
Lets go IWNDWYT 
Things ain't going to plan but as long as I'm not drinking I'm just fine!!.IWNDWYT 
Count me in :)
Good morning /r/stopdrinking! I hope we're all as well as we can be this Monday morning. I had an odd weekend - I flew down to London for a gig and stayed the weekend but didn't much enjoy the experience. London by yourself without any plans is a very foreboding and lonely place and I found myself expending a lot of mental energy on not filling the time with alcohol. Didn't though! Filled it with vegetable sushi instead - there aren't any sushi places where I live so having a place on every second street was *amazing*. I'm now sat having my pre-work morning coffee and blasting Sia pop bangers at an uncomfortably loud volume. Back to normal life eh?..Have a wonderful time of it today sobernauts - IWNDWYT!
Good morning friends. I hope everyone had a lovely weekend. It's the start of a new week and once again I will not drink with you today... 
Iwndwyt.
IWNDWYT  
Fell off on Saturday but climbing right back on. Lots to think about and things to learn but feeling good. IWNDWYT.
Going to bed sober and Monday I will not drink either!
Hi everyone. IWNDWYT.
Happy Monday! IWNDWYT!
No booze is passing my lips! Here for another 24 hrs. IWNDWYT
Up and running for Monday morning in the UK.....a big 'hi' to all of you.  And I Will Not Drink With You Today   
I'm not drinking today!
Good morning from Alabama thank you for sharing this  this morning for me I really need to keep it fresh the hell I kept myself inside of for so many lost years and trying to escape for many of those years. Feels amazing to be on the other side of that wall but it takes a daily commitment to myself to be able to be free of it each day. Have a wonderful Monday.. Peace
I can finally sleep. I am going to see what I can do today regardless of how I feel. I am going to die anyway so might as well see if I can get out of this hole. Hope everyone has a good day!
I will not drink today.
I think in the battle between me and Monday I won :) so now into the evening sparkly water and dinner cooking segue. No booze for me today none tonight and I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either!.
I'm in. IWNDWYT  
IWND  WYT.

No drinking today
Good morning everyone. IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink today.
Super sleepy this morning bc I'm reading such a good book I didn't wanna put it down but I'm grateful for choosing to take pleasure in things that help rather than hurt me...Hope that you're treating yourselves right IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
Yesterday was the first day I really craved a drink. That's how it works for me easy in the beginning. Anywho it was fleeting and I recognized it for what it was. I didn't drink yesterday and I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.
Scared of another work week. Halfway through my workday today and its going alright. I do have extra therapy this week so that feels a bit more safe. But even if its scary and going to shit I will not drink today. 
Iwndwyt.
IWNDWYT
not drinking today
I won't drink today!
Thank you Cato for another beautiful post.  If I look at my drinking history honestly I think I always knew that I couldn't drink safely.  I've spent decades trying to stifle that thought.  IWNDWYT!
11 weeks today. I feel like my memory is getting better. I've been getting flashes of things I'd totally forgotten about. ..I'm also learning to be ok with my introversion. I used to force myself into lots of social situations then drank to cope with them but now I'm happy to turn down things or go home early without feeling bad about myself. 
I will not drink with you today.
Checking in this morning from Austin  TX. Being back in my native land must be very triggering because I had my first drinking dream in ages just now and it was vivid.  I will not drink with you today irl though. 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
No alcohol for me as come to find out I've still got a lot to live for.
Conscious decision for today: not drinking alcohol!    I m in ladies &amp; gentleman! 
I(did)NDWYT. Night all from Aus.  
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT 
Not today. Not today. Not today!!
Instead of drinking I will work on this every day to avoid slips (Sobriety Losing Its Priority)...My sober morning routine is starting to really feel like a routine rather than things I know I should be doing but don't always bother with.  Self-esteem workshop later...IWNDWYT :)
One day at a time. IWNDWYT 
Day 9 iwndwyt
Feeling fantastic. I definitely wont be drinking today. 
I'm giving it my all today Cato. Thank you for a beautiful post to wake up to. ..Good morning SD. IWNDWYT. 
Thanks for the great introduction to today's check-in Cato. Life is indeed better on the sober side .I will not drink with you today 
It's going to be a great day!!  IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
My body is no longer that of a human and neither is my soul. Im sick of people but i wont drink today. 
I used to think that alcohol made it easier for me to cope with day-to-day stresses but now I realize that it was actually handicapping me. Without booze I'm a fairly competent person. Why would I want to undermine that by drinking? IWNDWYT
Good Monday morning from Mississippi!..I will not drink with you today!!
Last night was hard I pulled up to the liquor store after a late shift and sat in the car five minutes waging war with myself. I did not want to get drunk did not want to loose today to a hangover (day off work today with lots of stuff planned even fun stuff) but I wanted the anxiety and pain to stop. Even for an hour. Whether it's a bad week from PAWS or just decades of emotions coming up as I catch up on years of emotional growth my drinking had me bypass yesterday was rough. Everything I have learned from this group helped me get home sober.stay sober five minutes to you get home. No one regrets the next morning choosing not to drink. Play the tape forward. Nothing changes if nothing changes. It's necessary to feel your pain in order to grow. Funny thing is as soon as I made it home the urge and cravings had passed. I let myself instead stay up late bingeing on my current Netflix pick grabbed some comfort foods and camped out under my blankets. Not sure how my moods will treat me today but glad I did not pick up last night. IWNDWYT 
Didn't drink with you today in Australia! Travel well everyone
Good Morning from a rainy NY! IWNDWYT 
Thank you for the inspiring intro Cato (and cats!) I'm grateful to not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking with you all today! 
IWNDWYT  
Checking in on this dreary Monday morning!  IWNDWYT!
Have a great week everyone!! IWNDWYT!    
Excited to have gotten through the weekend alcohol-free despite temptations.  Day 8 today!..I will not drink with any of you sober stars today!    
Day 13 - IWNDWYT
Happy Monday! Should be an awesome week. IWNDWYT!
Oh man I talked about step one at a meeting yesterday and got to hear a lot of good stuff. It's the stories and experiences of others that helps me accept that I too am an alcoholic and that it's okay because I'm here now. ..I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today!
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
Good morning Cato and SD friends.  ..Today is going to be brutal with two impossible work deadlines and also a work dinner - of course with tons of alcohol - that I dont have the time (work deadlines!!) or patience for    ..I'm sitting at my desk - doing a lot of deep breathing - before I dive in.  No matter what - I wont drink    tonight.  
IWNDWYT
Day one. My ex advised me to drop in on here so that's what I'm doing. Trying to fix my head. So. I shan't drink today. 
Moving in to week 2.  feeling great
I made it through a weekend trip and a concert without a drink! Pretty pleased about that. IWNDWYT
What a great analogy Cato! I didn't want to die in the maze either. And here I am with a bright shiny star for my first 30 days. It's high time I start making some other positive changes in my life and I know the effects will be amplified because I'm not drinking. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today!
Yesterday was the second time I went to a sporting event and didn't drink alcohol even though I was surrounded by people pounding down giant (and overpriced) beers.  I will not drink with you today!
All together .I will not drink with you today. .
I will not drink today! Drinking has become boring for me and it won't bring me anything good - only hangovers and scary blackouts. Bring on day 2!
Right here with ya!
IWNDWYT :)
I will not drink today!!!!
Thanks for the DCI Cato! Yesterday was a tough one for me. Warm weather and yard work really kicked in a craving and I wasn't prepared for it!  I went off my diet and ate girl scout cookies and cheese popcorn instead of drinking beers. So I'm checking in today to say Iwndwyt!.
Not drinking today  
Thanks for the inspiration Cato. IWNDWYT
Glorious sober Monday morning soberniks!  We made it through another weekend full of traps triggers and temptations.  This little blue worker hoist a cup of coffee in salute to our vigilance! Solidarity comrades! IWNDWYT 
A new week with new possibilities. IWNDWYT

It's the end of my Monday here in South Korea I did not drink and IWNDWYT (or in The next 24 hours). We got this!  
Good morning everyone. Thank you for your beautiful words Cato.  I will not drink with you today. 
Day number eight... feeling good! IWNDWYT!
Great opening post...Some things are going my way of late namely a new job and potentially a shot at a better one. No mucking things up with booze today.
Hi SilverCato! One week ago today was my day 1. After a few weeks of sobriety I decided to drink one evening. I woke up the next morning with a headache and remembered that alcohol makes you feel like crap! ..Anyway hitting up some meetings after work and hopefully getting some things done (finally). I will not drink with you today!! 
I am in again. This is a tie with my previous best 120 days free. I plan to keep going one day at a time. I will stay free from alcohol today. 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today. 
Not going to say it's easy because it isn't. But I'm still here and still going. IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT   
Just for today I will not drink.....&amp;#x200B;..It was a nice all too brief weekend away from home. An escape to a cabin near the water puzzles reading guitar movies and baking. No computer no alcohol no distractions...&amp;#x200B;..Did a trip like this last year and I did not fully unplug I brought my computer and whenever we went out to dine in the evenings I would have a glass or two of wine. Not heavy drinking but it was quite a different experience being fully present and not distracted this time around.
This will be my first day. I know I need to stop or this will continue to suck the life out of me.I will not drink today.
I won't drink today!  
iwndwyt
I will not drink today.
/u/silvercato thank you for hosting the check in..I have a cold as do my husband and baby but I am at work and I will not drink today!
One week and one day down. I will not drink on day nine either. Regardless of how sore the attic cleaning makes me. 
I will not drink today!
hey im here. been a while but im back and maybe i'll stay this time
Good morning from California!  Day 66 truly uncharted territory but I'm rolling along with the help of this sub.  Carry on everyone.  IWNDWYT    Gigi 
Starting week 3 today.  Best decision I've ever made. ..IWNDWYT!
Two weeks sober in the books! IWNDWYT 
My head is exploding and I am flying internationally tonight which is usually a great reason to get \*sloshed\*. Cannot fucking stand my husband when we travel he is a high maintenance disaster every. single. time...&amp;#x200B;..Buuuuuuuuuutttt that's no reason to drink is it now? IWNDYT
Headed towards two weeks of sobriety. No reason to derail today. I will not drink today.
Iwndwyt   
I've been climbing up this hill and then sliding back down for so long now... something feels different this time. I feel like it's actually coming from me not imposed from outside...I feel great and IWNDWYT.
Stressed out this morning but drinking will only make it worse so IWNDWYT
Thank you...I need this. I need something. I'm the very definition of a functional alcoholic and I keep saying "I'm going to stop drinking for X days" often not even making it a day or two. The two main casualties being my health and my relationship with the person I love the most. ..But I promise IWNDWYT.
I'm with you! IWNDWYT my friend. 
Not yesterday not today not tomorrow.
I will not drink today!!!..Thanks Cato. It's funny how unfamiliar the maze seems inside but how predictable and common it is once you stop. I've ran into the same dead ends.... moderation beer only only on weekends only when I go out but I failed and fell back to my same ways.... day drinking hiding the empties pounding the beer in the garage. Ugggg. I spent so much energy hiding my drinking. Not drinking is hard but I'm now living in the present which makes me happy. 
Afternoon SD IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT.....Peace
Great post u/SilverCato!..I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.
For today I absolutely will not be drinking. Thank you
IWNDWYT!
Good morning world! More truth to my wife last night at dinner after she asks about me not drinking for the last month. Feeling strong and supported!..IWNDWYT!!!
Will not drink today. Today is one week.
Thanks so much for your honest post. I remember all too well the insanity and insidiousness of the disease thinking each time I drank it would be different but getting the same result each time (in my case blackouts and horribly embarrassing situations). IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!!!!
Beginning of a new sober week - this one's going to be jam packed but iwndwyt!
Iwndwyt .
IWNDWYT 
Day 3. IWNDWYT
Feeling alive at 175- IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Good morning SD! One day at a time! So for today IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT
Pulled myself out of a funk yesterday by cleaning. Resetting for today and a phone screen for a promising job. Reminding myself that I have a great job now so a lot of this is beyond my control. Regardless of nerves iWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today

IWNDWYT
I will not drink today with all of you.
I will not drink today. ..Glad I found this community of strong people. 
i've lost 3 lbs in two weeks a beautiful side benefit of not guzzling six packs (besides not being thoroughly ill and hung over and regretting it).  i had 4 days off in a row and made it through w/o drinking.  IWNDWYT  
Iwndwyt
I will not drink with you today.

Day two here we go! Last night sucked trying to sleep but I expected that.  It's a beautiful day and I will not drink with you!
Not drinking today. 
IWNDWYT
Not today. IWNDWYT!
I like commenting in this thread just to see my badge number increase! Made it through another weekend without drinking. I work at a restaurant on the side where I can get a free beer at the end of each shift and so learning how to just go home instead of staying to have a beer is going to be one of the challenges. I was able to do it on Saturday AND Sunday this past weekend. Saying no to a free craft beer at the end of a long shift is tough to do but I had a kombucha instead. ..&amp;#x200B;..Felt great not to be hungover at all this weekend. Still really enjoying not drinking and feel even better about it each day. Best of luck to everyone! 
IWNDWYT 
Just finished my first full week so I'm happy to report that I will not drink with you today my eighth day!
Hi everyone good morning. I'm not drinking today...Thanks for posting your story. I can relate to it a lot.
I am really happy to see that (1) today. I had a really hard Saturday where craving were biting at me because of how nice it was outside but I resisted the first drink and made it through...This week is going to be insane however. Between multiple events I am going to my cat still being sick and a close friend of mine moving it is going to be highly stressful. Just trying to take it one day at a time though!..iwndwyt!
I will not drink today!
I am not drinking today!
9 days in. Feeling better already!
I will not drink today!
I definitely need some kind of accountability so I will not drink today. Thanks for this post! 
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you all today!!

Another beautiful day.  Not drinking today.

Day 190 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
Here's to day 2 of no drinking. Still feeling very anxious and depressed but I know things will get better with time.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT on day 3 just taking day by day. 
Happy Monday SD!..I am beyond happy today!  We are getting a puppy and she will be ready to come home right around Mother's Day!  She is sweet and tiny and I won't be allergic to her LOL  ..I won't drink with anybody today!
Not drinking today 
Check in Day #7# Had a wonderful sober weekend let's keep it going!
i will not drink with you today!
Working on lucky day 13! Joining the pledge. IWNDWYT
Feeling really good after not drinking all weekend. I missed the sober life so much. Today I will not drink!
IWNDWYT
11 days sober. The acute anxiety has eased although I still feel that constant bass pulse in my chest. Not feeling super strong at the moment.
Not drinking today.  Going to Vegas tomorrow.  Borderline terrified.  Also forgot my day count so posting here to check it.  :-)
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Thanks for hosting and sharing your story u/silvercato. ..I will not drink with you today.
Day 69! IWNDWYT
Day 2 for me. Work went better than I expected. Maybe I was expected to quit (tricky situation working for small startup where it is very up and down)...It would be nice to have a run of calm days in a row.
Iwndwyt! Have a good one
IWNDWYT.
Been struggling more lately with why I'm not drinking despite how shitty things were a mere 3 weeks ago and how I know that it will definitely NOT help me with all the difficulties I'm having to face right now (unemployment career change dwindling savings etc).  I started out wanting to make a commitment to 100 days then maybe 6 months then maybe a year.  I still do want that but I keep imagining a fun night out.  Uggh so frustrating.  I have a major 3 day project that I have to be alert and present for  which is motivation for now.  IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you all today. It'd be a super bummer if I did any day so I wont.
Great hosting /u/SilverCato!..I'm 2^7 days sober today.  Fun number for a computer nerd...Anyway I'm late to check in because I'm hitting the ground running today and gotta keep moving...IWNDWYT
I still have a hard time believing I've made it past 100 days. I'm on to day 113 now the urge to drink has been a bit more intense especially when travelling for work. I'm ready to keep crushing it. ..I will not drink with you today.
Got into a bad car accident Saturday morning and it's been stress ever since. I'm fine not sure about my car. Now I'm just playing the waiting game with the insurance company. Temptation was high this weekend but I didn't give in. IWNDWYT!
Holy moly Monday already! There's not enough time in the day to do all the stuff sober me wants to do! Have a great day SD IWNDWYT!
During different time periods there were different reasons for why I drank alcohol excessively. Moving states helped me to get some perspective about the drinking culture in the city I lived in previously but it still took more than three years after moving for me to make the decision to stop completely. I'll take my time to figure all this out but in the mean time IWNDWYT!
I am very happy to not be drinking today.
First day back to work in about 3 months. Mad stressed and anxious but because I want to live I will not drink with you today. Good luck everyone.
3 weeks and counting!
After 25 years of drinking I was stuck too Cato. It was so frustrating a vicious cycle. But 10 days ago I decided enough was enough and I left the cycle behind. I'm now stuck in a new and better way--to my decision to remain sober. And today I will not drink with you.
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Today is day one. This weekend I let my drinking affect my job performance. And that's always when I said I would be done. Here I am. One day at a time...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT.
 IWNDWYT
Sober since April 1st but I'm no fool to drink today as that day is known for. IWNDWYT. Thank you my friends stay strong.
Day 12 today! Two weeks soon! 21 days makes it a habit. Hitting 30 days now seems like a real possibility. When I stopped drinking 30 days seemed impossible. .Thank you for the inspiration...IWNDWY wonderful folks today.
I'm late to the party but I want to check in and pledge to remain sober with all of you wonderful people today.
I will not drink with you today!
I'm not drinking today
Hi Cato what a fabulous post. You write so beautifully and so clearly from the heart...You are an inspiration to me  ..Thank you so much for hosting.
Good afternoon. Heading in to my first dentist appointment in probably five years. I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. Its day 1. Going to be tough.
Im in.
Let's count this as day 1 shall we? Fell off last night but no matter how bad today gets just for today I am not drinking. I'm doing something else. ..Even if every fiber of my being wants to go on a rip roaring bender but not today. Today isn't going to be the next day I fall off.
I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind.
IWNDWYT and I didn't   
I will not drink today.
One week down. Today I ain't gonna drank!
New here on day 1.  Thanks for having me!
Che Kin in. I will not drink with any of you bunch today. Peace out n ting
I know this is what I want it's so hard though. I'm on day 2.IWNDWYT
Day 2.  Instead of constantly saying why I can't do it I'm going to say why I can stop drinking.
I will not drink with you today
Haven't posted in a while but that doesn't mean I haven't been pleased as punch to not drink with you fine folks in the meantime!
Boozed all weekend. Wasted it away. Killed the fifth of vodka when I woke up. Today I will not drink tonight
EFF MONDAYS!!! Despite the yucky day I had it's over. I have zero urge to drink and now I look forward to working out and doing homework. IWNDWYT! Yay for pink grapefruit Perrier   
I can promise not to drink for the next 24 hours.   .I have not drank alcohol for the last 2832 hours which amazes me.

I've been on and off for years now. My drinking has slowed down but I got a dui a month ago and was drinking and driving afterwards. 5 days ago after staying up all night because of a bender then having to go a full day at school I realized I needed to quit. I've been restless having shakes and plagued with head aches and body pains so IWNDWYT

checking in. hope everybody is doing well.
I don't know how to ask for help don't want to...Long story short my dad is an alcoholic and mentally fucked my family up..Don't like my dad but I'm just like him..Got all his bad habits and I hate my self for it..Soon I'll be 30 years old and I'm still terrified about finding someone I could love because I'm just as cold as my dad..I'm sorry but I'm drinking today. .Drinking makes my thoughts bearable...Tiny part of me tells me that this journey has a point. The other part is laughing.
IWNDWYT! (Or more accurately I didn't drink with you today!) (Yay!)

Hello all...Yes I too know that feeling of being stuck. My first drink I wad in trouble went into blackout woke full of remorse self pitty hatred and almost wished I could die. A few days latter I thought that was a nice feeling being intoxicated. I repeated the process. Each time drinking more and for longer and drinking faster. I thought I found the elixer of life. I was no longer a square peg in a round hole. It would be another 8 years till I made my first AA meeting. By then my job and drivers licence was gone. I gained a criminal record and debt. A total of 17 years and I was to barely draw a sober breath...Fast foward to today so this is not too long. I am just over 29 years sober. I am very happy and contented. I take 1 day at a time. I give time time. I keep it simple. I make the most of each day. I am responsible for my own happiness. I do not blame people places and things...I must have my hand out just as there were those there for me after my last drink. I was accepted for who I was as I was. Full of self pity and remorse etc. I can only say to all if I can come from near death to who I am today you to can...Just for today I will be sober with you. ..Your Friend John.
