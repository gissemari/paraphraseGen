My husband and I are both alcoholics.  Both of us have different help groups that we attend.  We have approached it very differently.  I would like to share a link because i think a lot of people feel the same was I do.  I have a sponsor but I really struggle with AA and the "GOD" thing.  I believe in science and that is that.  The link is a translation of the 12 steps for atheists  [https://aaagnostica.org/2015/07/26/rewriting-the-12-steps-for-atheists/](https://aaagnostica.org/2015/07/26/rewriting-the-12-steps-for-atheists/)  For me i find that the more literature i can get my hands on the better.  I have not been sober long but I have been in and out of the system a long time.  I have never got past step one...IWNDWYT - Love you all

Thanks for sharing this I found it really helpful. I love AA and think the spirit of the steps Is what is important but the word choices in them (and a lot of the Big Book frankly) can be off putting. I think what's laid out here really gets to the core universal message of the steps...IWNDWYT 
That was a good read thanks for sharing!..If you like a bit of science and 'Quit Lit' that is bang up-to-date here's a couple of titles I found helpful:..*This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace and her YouTube channel of the same name are both excellent.....[*Alcohol Explained*](http://alcoholexplained.com/about-alcohol-explained/) by William Porter is good too and pairs well with TNM.....Both well worth a look!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Thanks!
I loved this translation of the steps.
