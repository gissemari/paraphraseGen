I'll keep this short! .Basically I have been living at my parents for the last year and a half only had a job once and it didn't even last 3 months (due to drinking of course.) SO I haven't had money. But when I do I would buy alcohol. .I just got a fairly large chunk of money from my tax return. And I know having money is a challenge for me. I don't want to waste this money on booze this time. My birthday was June 2 and my dad gave me cash which I promptly threw away (it goes SO fast) on alcohol. ..So my question is for people with jobs and steady income do you find it more difficult to not drink when you know you have the money for it? And how do you deal with this? ..I've been keeping a journal reminding myself why I stopped what I can expect from not drinking and my parents both know of my struggle of having money and picking up. Some insight would be nice. I don't have any overwhelming cravings yet but I can't say I haven't had any at all. .I've thought about giving my parents my money for safekeeping but I want to be able to say NO and spend money on things that will improve my life rather than destroy it. ..Thanks for reading happy sober Friday!

I moved to a new city with enough money to drink for a long time. It scared me a lot so I know this feeling very well. Hmm you could put it into a (roth) IRA if you are in the US and start saving toward retirement. Or you could buy some new clothes treat yourself to a nice meal etc. There are lots of healthy ways to enjoy this that don't involve alcohol. Any ideas so far? :)
Just to give you an idea of how bad it can progress for me money didn't matter. Broke or not I'd find a way to get loaded. If I had $ I'd get more expensive alcohol and/or even go out to bars. When I didn't have it I'd buy the cheap stuff and drink at home alone. I had a series of credit cards I'd use pretty much only for booze. I maxed out a few. Sometimes when it came between eating and booze I'd choose booze. Thank God I don't have to live like that anymore. I actually paid off one of those credit cards a few weeks ago and I'm well on my way on paying off another one. Once I worked on myself and dealt with the issues that lead me to drink it didn't matter if I had money or not I simply didn't buy booze or drink. Now I'm in the best financial shape I've been in in years.  Something that helped me refrain from spending money on booze (or things I don't need) is to set up a savings account I can't touch. Every paycheck a big chunk goes straight to that. I leave only enough in my account to be able to live and not overspend.
