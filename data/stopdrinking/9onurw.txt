Hey..I've been drinking to deal with bad things in my life for almost ten years. I've tried to quit a few times but I kept relapsing. I keep imagining what life without alcohol looks like for me and I find it hard to say no. I've been feeling lonely and there has been a lot of stress in my life. Alcohol gave me a way to cope. I'm trying to adopt healthy strategies. I've sought help for myself. Still I struggle to put the bottle down for good. I'm going to try to go dry for a month. Cope without alcohol for a month and see where that leaves me. Hopefully better than with alcohol. I don't like feeling the way I do when I can't fall asleep at night or function during the days. I don't like feeling chained to my addiction. I just want to feel normal happy and healthy and get a good nights sleep. I want to find a way to turn off the days stresses without a stiff one. I want to try the sober version of me again. So here goes everything.

Welcome!..Many people go dry for a month and it answers all their questions about the relationship with alcohol!..I spoke to a counselor and went to recovery meetings...Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
