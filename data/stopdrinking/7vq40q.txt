Been so tempted to pick up where i left off almost 5 years ago. Depression is destroying my mind and spirit. I keep thinkin that drinking might make me feel happy again. I know it wont. I just wish i could feel that warmth and happiness once more. Im struggling and i dont know how to crawl my way out this time.

You doing ok?..I don't think drinking will help but talking to us might.  We're all ears...
I was happy for 31 days (sober) then drank and have felt anxious tired and low level self-hate since. If there's one thing drinking didn't do it was make me happy.
The thing about relapses is that unless you are lucky they last for a long time sometimes years. Do you want to drink that much? Won't that screw up your life? You mention:..&gt; I just wish i could feel that warmth and happiness once more...Will it really be *once* more?
