I ran into an old drinking buddy tonight while christmas shopping and all of the memories came back.  mostly the good ones.  I just got 6 months and this is the first time I've really really wanted to go back out.  I know I should call my sponsor but I don't want to bother her when I know she's at a fancy dinner for christmas.  I thought I would reach out here.  thanks.

Call your sponser. She will thank you!
Can you text your sponsor? I'm sure they wouldn't mind. ..I know seeing old buddies can be very triggering. I try to take a step back from the moment and think about what would really happen if I picked up a drink. So far every time I think about it the drink isn't worth it to me. 
For me thinking ahead to the aftermath is helpful. How would I feel tomorrow if I drank today? Not very good emotionally or physically. I like the other commenter's suggestion about taking a step back getting some space is helpful in giving oneself time to make a skillful wise decision. ..A useful exercise I engage in when I'm in a tough situation is this: I ask myself If I had a dear friend who was in my position who wrestling with the same thing I'm wrestling with what advice would I give that dear friend? Generally speaking the advice I would give so long as that advice comes from a place of wanting the best for my friend is the advice I should follow. ..Sending you good vibes. 
Stay strong...Six months is freakin awesome. Don't throw it away for anything...I too get nostalgic at times but have to realize the past is done and there are millions of better things in the present and future..
Call anyone you can. It's not worth it. Stay strong 
I want to be 6 months like you I am only at 52 days sober...  strength and courage. IWNDWYT
