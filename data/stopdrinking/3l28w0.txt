Hello all I have lurked for a bit while I contemplated kicking booze or not. Right now I am on day two and could just use an outlet to vent while I struggle. Last night wasn't too bad but today all I can think about is how I want a drink. My damn hands are shaking and I am so agitated. Luckily that seems to be the worst of it. ..I have tried stopping for a bit a few times before this was actually what made me realize how much of a problem it was. I never got past 7 days. ..Past few months I have been averaging a few IPA's and half a bottle to 3/4 of a bottle of bourbon or rye. I had cut back on the whiskey for a while only drinking 2-3 IPA's on average I was proud of myself and I lost 30 lbs with little effort. Inevitably I was back to bourbon. ..The most difficult thing for me to wrap my head around stopping to drink is I just can't imagine life without it. My hobby is craft beers I love finding new ones going out with people and talking about things over a drink. I don't even know what I'll do with my time if it doesn't involve drinking. The problem is that while I love craft beers it doesn't hit the spot and inevitably I am back to whiskey(which I also love but can't really say I am enjoying it after the first quarter of a bottle is gone). Often times I will go out with friends have a couple of drinks fine and then go home and drink to make up for the time lost. I know this lifestyle isn't sustainable but god it sounds so boring without. ..I don't really know where I am going with this wall of text but I just needed to type it out. Thanks guys for reading. You have a fantastic community and I love to see the support everyone gets.

Welcome! Thanks for posting. Your story sounds a lot like mine. Alcohol was such a big part of my social life for such a long time that I wasn't sure how to function around people without it. If that's how it stayed it might have been sustainable. But what happened with me and what you're saying has happened to you is that it stopped being a social habit. Going out with friends for a few then heading home to get the "real work" done was my modus operandi. What eventually happened was that it stopped being fun. But it was so insidious that I went for years without admitting that my drinking wasn't just for fun anymore. It was something I thought I needed. I couldn't imagine life without it...But there is life without those 2-3 IPAs and 3/4 of a bottle of bourbon. And it's a BETTER life. I'm still new at sobreity but it's the best decision I've ever made. I'm now able to exercise cook read watch TV/movies visit with friends go to concerts and a ton of other stuff and I'm present for everything and remember all of it. Sometimes it's been easy and sometimes it's been hard but SD has been a huge resource in helping me along this path. You can definitely do it and I recommend you start where I did - commit to not drinking today.
I used to be a wine and real ale enthusiast I was all into food pairing tasting notes etc. My hobbies and socialising invariably involved drinking. And that's if you got me on a good day. Mostly I was about slugging it down my neck as quickly as possible. I did try cutting back a bit and exercising but I'd always creep back to where I was and where I was was progressing over time - my tolerance raised and my body didn't seem to be handling it so well any more...I couldn't envisage a sober life when I began last September I kinda knew my drink train had come to its final station. I didn't know if I could do it or what being sober would be like. I saw others had done it so that gave me some hope. I hit my initial targets and chose to keep on going. ..It took more than four months for me to come to the place where I saw that I can be sober accept that I need to stay sober and discover that I want to stay sober...My life was not sustainable I'd let that train run for longer than I should have and I am very fortunate to have pulled through it. With sober time I was able to say goodbye to the habit and building new hobbies into my life. It's different the transition involved finding my feet but it's freeing not being tethered to booze a new chapeter. I have new hobbies I'm more active. Sparkling water is my substitute drink of choice...Finally - the withdrawals - [kindling](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_alcohol_withdrawal) is a thing they can get worse on successive withdrawals it's one of many reasons I only want to quit once! Great to have you on board!
