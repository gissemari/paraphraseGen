Felt isolated drinking feeling isolated now. Meaningful connections seem so long ago while remembering them only leads to feelings of self-pity. Fueling my anxiety even further...I'm still in university and I don't want to spend it going to meetings like my earlier years. That lead to me feeling disassociated from my peers. I suppose I do already finding myself with no invites due to being a blackout but that's nothing new...This isn't my first time getting sober and i'm not sure if it will be my last but i feel the same feeling I did when I was sober; very aware neurons firing and boredom creeping up. Nothing new I know I can deal with these it's just the isolation and lonliness that broke me...It broke me into getting sober then relapsing and now getting sober again. I convinced myself I'm an extrovert to justify my peer rejection. Fuck them they're the problem mentality. Fucking pride I need some humilty and something I can value in my life...Sobriety is not inherently valuable you're foolish to think so. It's that whole faith without works is dead thing. Sat in my room playing video games feeling like shit but trying to feel big at my realization im sober not suffering like those poor folks...Not sure if i want advice or I'm venting but feel free to comment..

I can relate to feelings of isolation. For me the thing to do is to reach out to someone in some way. Even if it's just giving a smile to the cashier at the supermarket. Calling or texting a friend is another option. Sometimes you get rejected or ignored sometimes you don't. The best thing for me is to help someone else. Gets me out of my head and into the world because sometimes locked in my head is not the best place to be.
