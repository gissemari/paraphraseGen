This is a little embarrassing to ask... I originally stopped drinking the first of January relapsed for a couple of days two weeks later but managed to stop right away. I've been drinking daily for several years but was lucky enough to not get withdrawals (I was averaging half of a 750ml bottle in the last few years)...It's still very early in my recovery but my anxiety has improved a lot. I can sleep normally and feel fine most of the day. The one thing that I haven't even thought about is sex. Is that normal early on? Maybe it's because I was drunk 99% of the time during sex and I associated alcohol with it? ..Still not drinking today! Thanks for reading.
