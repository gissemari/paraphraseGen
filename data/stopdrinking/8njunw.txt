After another misfortune reset here on Day 3 I am reflecting on how three's or a multiplicative of 3 are the big struggle milestones for me...Generally the first 2 weeks feel great and at 3 weeks I start to get too comfortable. I start to crave again and say why not?..If I get by that it's usually smooth sailing until 3 months. Same concept. Man I'm doing great! Or I am not satisfied/bored. That has happened a few times where I just say screw it my life is boring now(dumb)...Then 6 months then 9 and of course 12(just about my longest stretch). It is so easy as these 3's add up to look at them as "I'm fine" or give up. At least for me. Anyone else notice something similar?

Counting the days is one of my biggest triggers - I'll either think "Hey! I'm doing so good-just one tonight will be ok!" or I think "Shit - can't make it past 3 days - just one tonight and then I'll really try!" I find thinking of myself as "Living Sober" every day is the easiest.  I try not to count the days I'm "not drinking" - IWNDWYT
Do you think maybe part of it is psychosomatic now because you have had trouble on those days in the past ?
