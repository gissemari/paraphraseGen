Second sober weekend in a row and nothing exciting happened except I woke up early and felt amazing every day!  I've quit before for a couple months at a time (the longest I've managed for the last 10 years) but always relapse after one night I thought I could have a few that turn into benders that last weeks.  I feel stronger this time and have been reading his sub constantly. Another great bit of news is that New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday night this year ;) so good news for any of us that have to get up and go to work Monday!  I'm excited about that because I'll have to get up at 6:30 and I've already told several friends that I won't be drinking.   I relapsed last New Years :( .IWNDWYT!!

Awesome!    I've slipped after I lost the "have just one" argument in my head too.  ..Simple fact is that I cannot have "just one."  It's actually easier to commit fully to sobriety rather than to "try to moderate."   ..IWNDYT 
Great to hear! You are well on your way to your new sober life! Good for you!
&gt; nothing exciting happened except I woke up early and felt amazing every day!..That's pretty exciting actually. Good on ya! Happy to not drink with you today :)
I love reading this title vs. the "ugh how to get through the weekend"...not that I don't understand how tough it can be for those posters but I always just want to say...enjoy it! My weekends are lovely and full of family friends and/or quiet time...whatever I need :) Off to yoga right now! Keep sobering on IWNDWYT!.
