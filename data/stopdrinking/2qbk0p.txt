I'm not sure if you guys have heard this song before but seriously it's amazing. Granted I am a huge Eminem fan but even if you're not hopefully you'll still enjoy it. It feels like Em is talking directly to me rooting for me to push through the struggle and come out stronger on the other side. Especially helpful at this time of year. ..http://youtu.be/S8CQToLDaho..I love this sub and all of you. Merry Xmas :)

Great song. 
I love this song too.
I can relate to this. I've been known for my combacks. Eminem is incredibly talented. I don't listen to him on a regular basis but recognize him as one of the most talented artists of the last decade.
