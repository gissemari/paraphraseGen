So it was a friends 30th birthday party and I was going with my wife who's a normie who rarely drinks ever and a new friend from a PHP/IOP I've been attending for about a month and a half and I'm shocked how much of a breeze it was. Please know I'm not bragging about turning down this is just a reminder post at how much my internal struggle wasn't there. I got offered Long Islands right away by someone unaware of my sobriety and for a thousandth of a second I contemplated it and immediately kicked myself in the ass and politely refused. Gladly they had fresh 2 liters of soda (intended for mixers) so I treated myself to a few Cokes some pizza and ended up being in bed by 11:30. Best birthday party in a long while that I can actually remember. Thanks for reading stay strong and iwndwyt!
