I've been posting to this subreddit for what I think has been five years now under different handles. The longest I have been sober is six months. I am about to not be able to drink for two days because I am having a colonoscopy and endoscope. I honestly don't know if I will be able to stop tomorrow. I fully acknowledge that I am killing myself with booze and I don't know if I care...I keep hitting rock bottom and asking if it can get six feet deeper.
