I have just made it passed 2 weeks sober!..I'm nearly 30. For about 6 or 7 years I found excuses daily to drink at least a few beers a bottle of wine here and there during the week and then would go harder on the weekends. I never struggled feeling like I needed to drink during the day times but I found myself being unable to resist buying booze in the evenings drinking alone or with whoever was around. Sometimes I would make myself stop outside the liquor store knowing that daytime me would want to prevent night time me from going inside but mostly I would fail...I really started to hate my loss of willpower and the default night time mode of needing to be at least a bit drunk to feel satisfied that my night time was worthwhile before another day at work - what a thought process!..Well I really decided to commit to a long period of sobriety after many failed attempts. I told everyone close to me in order to have accountability with people and I asked them to not offer me alcohol - and now I am 16 days in and I already feel reconditioned about default night time mode - it's getting easier and easier by the day. Going to the store to buy booze is no longer an option to me especially with 16 days momentum behind me - I feel really good about it! ..I decided to try to keep this up until May and from that point I'm not sure where I wanna take it. I am considering if I want to use this period to retrain myself and change my relationship with alcohol but I realise it would be safer to commit to stop drinking permanently - I'm just not sure if that's right for me (I don't mean to sound insensitive to the many people on this subreddit for whom this *is* the right solution for them). Does anyone have experience with this? Advice appreciated!

I'm about the same age as you and with a similar story. For me I don't think about not drinking forever. I just think about not drinking today. As far as bad thoughts I just tell myself I will think about that negative thing later on because right now I'm focused on staying sober. 
My experience is so I'll lay off the drinking (3 months is my longest sober period) rattle for a week get healthy (diet/ exercise) achieve a relative sense of balance then (this is where I get it wrong) tell myself I'm in a good place right now and have dealt with that whole (increasingly) out of hand drinking episode I can go back to normal social and merry drinking Boom! A week 2 a month or whatever later I'm back to daily drinking feeling really shitty about myself this could go on for weeks or months and the cycle continues ad nauseam etc. Old habits die hard. I still sometimes wish I could keep it moderate but I guess I'm just hard wired this way. Plus it never used to make me feel extremely anxious in my teens and 20's but it's like when I turned 30 (I'm 33 now) the price of binge drinking just went up n i couldn't afford the fee. Well that's me I sincerely hope you can learn to moderate and enjoy it without it causing you to feel bad about yourself I sometimes wish I could too but I know from experience I can't do that any more. Love and best wishes.
