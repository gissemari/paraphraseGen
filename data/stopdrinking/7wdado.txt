Fell off the wagon. Hard. Drank every day for two straight weeks with lots of day drinking involved as well....Yesterday was day 1 again. Tremors sweating weird visual-type hallucinations where the edges of things appeared to "shiver". Last night I had horrific nightmares along with waking up completely drenched in sweat repeatedly. ...I'm only in my twenties. How could I have possibly let it get to this point? And I've been reading up on "kindling" meaning that I've irreversibly set myself up for more and worse withdrawals for the rest of my life from what I understand. ...I'm the only person I know who has ever even experienced withdrawals and this isn't even the only time I've experienced it. ...I just feel deeply ashamed of myself. I don't know what to do about that.

Try not to get frustrated.  The beginning of this journey can be godawful irritating.   ..Perhaps it's a good idea to consult a doctor before making another attempt.  If kindling is a possible issue then it would be wise to have some medical supervision.  ..You can do this.   
It is a disease it has a way it goes for all of us. Sadly (at first) the only cure is abstinence. But the easy part is that you only have to not drink today. And if you are successful today thank your god for the day. Tomorrow ask for another reprieve and repeat the other that night. ..They put together pretty quick if you are grateful every morning and evening for your sobriety. ..Alcoholism knows not boundaries Rich poor young old.......IWNDWYT 
Don't be ashamed NO ONE is perfect.  Be happy you are alive and can fight this.  It's a new day.  IWNDWYT.
