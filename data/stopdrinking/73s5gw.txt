Last night at work there were two moments where I was on the verge of relapse. I had a newer bartender training in and she wanted me to test a Long Island she had prepared. I was half way into reaching for a tasting straw before I caught myself. Then later in the evening one of our members left me a little wine left over from their decanter as a thank you for a wonderful evening and again my first instinct was to grab a glass. It was tough but I held strong and today I celebrate two weeks of sobriety! Thanks SD for all of your constant support and advice. I couldn't have gotten to this point without you! I will not be drinking with any of you today. :)
