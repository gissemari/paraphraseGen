Ended up relapsing by buying two casks before a party on the weekend - altogether it was around five bottle of shiraz over the course of two days. I'm taking prescription Lexapro at the moment but it's made the feelings of regretting stupid shit I did and said worse. not sure if it's worth sticking it out with the medication. I don't know. any advice would be welcome. Trying to make another push this week but it literally feels impossible to not drink something at the moment..I'm in my early twenties.

Hi sorry to hear that.  It feels bad now but in the long run will be better to forgive yourself and move on.  You did really well to last a week.  Next time you will last longer...When I slipped I thought that was it and it took me another year to stop again.  Now I'm back where I was a year ago.  I wish I had tried sooner.
7 days is impressive for people like us just try and power through. Drink lots of water eat well. You can do it again.
Small strides. If you can bag a week at a time try to one up yourself everyday past that. Just raise the bar by a day every day. If a week seems impossible just look at today. Then tomorrow look at only tomorrow. Work it day by day.
I relapsed really hard last week too. Pick yourself up and try again never stop trying even if you mess up. You can and will do it!
I only lasted four days. A week is great.
