Can believe how bad it was making me feel...No temptation with the free wine on the plane but was drifting in and out of thirsty daydreams in arrivals....It makes the whole experience so much easier. So much less stress...To anyone who is struggling at the moment be strong. Focus on getting yourself into bed sober at the end of today and waking up another day gained...IWNDWYT..
