As many of you may remember my wife's grandpa passed last Thursday morning. I love spending time with my in-laws and drinks are generally quite available and plentiful. I made it until FRI afternoon (which would have been day 4) before I relapsed. Thankfully I didn't get too terribly tanked but I remember FRI afternoon thinking "OK this is it last one" and before I knew it I had another. I was doing so well running and feeling great and I biffed it...However the clarity of FRI when I realized that I simply couldn't stop was eye opening. I'm glad I learned from the relapse and today is day 2 again. I will not drink today. Well wishes and prayers (if that's your thing) are welcome for the coming days. Another positive is that it's getting much easier to stop. Thanks for reading.
