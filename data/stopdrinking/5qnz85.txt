Friday's have been my relapse day and I just made it through my second one in a row sober...What's different?  Attending AA on Friday nights and medication (disulfiram and acamprosate)...Today I'm going to a noon mtg and spend the day cleaning my office...I'm grateful for today - sober and hangover free...Happy 24 everyone!

Congrats to no hangover Saturday!  Enjoy your day. 
Yay!! Way to go!
Great job!!! Friday's are tough!!!
Congrats! I just made it through my first sober Friday but Sunday is a more drinky day for me usually so I'm a bit apprehensive about tomorrow.
