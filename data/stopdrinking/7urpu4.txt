I've been sober for almost 200 days but I am afraid I won't make it to the 200. I'm spending a semester in Northern Ireland and on top of the stress of moving to a new place and trying to assimilate to a new culture other problems in my relationship and in my family life are giving me a lot of anxiety and drinking it away is more tempting than ever. Alcohol is abundant and seems to be part of the social culture here as well as more easily accessible than in the U.S. which adds another layer of difficulty for me. Does anyone have advice on how to resist drinking to deal with anxiety or being a non-drinker in a pub?

If I were in your position I would look into local AA meetings. Are you in a medium to large sized city? To me there is no substitute for in person support especially when you're isolated the way you are. I studied abroad and I look back and wonder what else I might have been able to see and do if I hadn't spent so much of it drunk. Don't be like me. Glad you're here!
Life on life's terms my dude. You are where you are right now and you can only control your own self. Changes are always hard (moving jobs relationships) but the real question is: how much do you want to stay sober? No matter how bad things are they were always worse when I was drinking and picking up the bottle would only make my shit now *worse*.  It's like the worst of both worlds. ..*It gets better*..I don't know what else you like to do but do that. I'm sure there are beautiful things to do and see in Ireland and if you spend the next three months drinking you'll do none of it. And if I had to bet regret it big time ..If you're into AA find a meeting. If not find a meeting. You don't have to love it but it's the same time investment as one single episode of House MD and it's certainly better than drinking or almost drinking. Maybe you never go back. Maybe you do. ..As for not drinking in a pub I've done it. I mean you just don't drink. There are  coping strategies  people use like tonic with lime or Odouls or whatever which can help with the  feeling  of just having a drink in your hand. Ultimately the best thing for me is just to set your intentions going into it. Do I have a reason to be here right now? If not what the hell am I doing? It's ok for me to hang out at bars if it's for a game a birthday party an event or whatever. But that old saying *Hang out at the barber long enough and you're gonna get a haircut* is true. ..
