Im getting close to day 60 and I had a counselling appointment on Tuesday where I updated my therapist about my progress. He said Im doing really well to have made it this far without a relapse on my first serious try. He said it was something like 15% could pull that off (he didn't have a source to reference just the top of his head) and made the analogy of how people play sports in school but most don't make it to the pros and said it's like you made it to the NBA like LeBron James! We both had a good laugh and we're like "yeah you're the LeBron James of sobriety!"..I don't have the actual stats and I don't consider myself anything special or better than any of you here by any means. I will admit it made me feel pretty good when he told me that but all of you no matter how many days or tries you go through making the effort to better yourselves makes you all superstars. I couldn't do it without reading your posts on good and bad days alike. Thanks and I will not be drinking with you today!
