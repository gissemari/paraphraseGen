Just sharing the gratitude. Will receive my 28 year coin tonight. This miracle from the man who could not manage 24 hours without drinking/using. ..Grateful for my sponsor (Ed A.) the big blue book Alcoholics Anonymous 12 simple steps my higher power and all the friends I've met along the way. Happy sober and free one day at a time...If you're struggling with sobriety find a meeting (AA NA CA Smart) do the work make the changes work for your recovery. There is help. There is hope. Rock bottom is a 6' deep hole in the cemetery. If you're not there yet you have a chance.

That is impressive.  Will you get just one coin or will they make change for you?  ..Two 10-year coins a 5 and a few 1-years ought to cover it.
Great advice.... going to Smart tonight for the first time...3 days clean and shooting the moon!.
