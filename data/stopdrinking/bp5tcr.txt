I've been on and off the subreddit for months now.  I've also been relapsing for that same amount of time.  I've been unhappy for a long time and I've been taking steps to try to fix that.  But the siren call of alcohol continues to drag me back.  Today I decided to make a big step.  Last night was my last relapse.  I'm of the Christian faith and take promises I make to God seriously.  Today I wrote out a solemn oath to God in my journal to never touch alcohol again.  He is the only person I won't break my promise to.  This entry in my journal will serve as a reminder to myself.
