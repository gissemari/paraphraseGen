Yesterday I made the decision to live the rest of my life sober can I truly count yesterday as a since day when I woke up still drunk? I think I will because yesterday was the day when I diverted up to the fact that I want just ruining my life but the lives of those around me. Yeah I'm the one that's ended up in the hospital because of my drinking but while I was lying in unconscious bliss there were people in the waiting room worried sick about me. When I got up and left the hospital because god damn it I don't have a drinking problem I have problems that make me drink! I left behind my responsibilities not only to my own health but to my friends and family who were left trying to find me...I'm not sure if I was trying to hurt myself in my own way or if I just wanted to hurt others to make myself feel better. All I know is I'm done with that life I know it'll be hard I struggled today when I went out to eat and there was an ad for a "crisp refreshing" beer and well how bad can ONE beer be? Well 5 years ago when I had my first real taste of alcohol and I didn't stop till the bottle was dry... It all started with one and now there are several bottles all begging me to finish them if I give in and have that one first drink again. So no I won't have that one drink I'll stay sober and sober ends with just one drink. ..I had a plan to stop by a bar on my way home for a beer tomorrow but I took that money and bought myself a new sketch pad because years ago I used to enjoy drawing. I want to stop wallowing in my own self pity (and vomit) and do something with my life and I can't if I pick up a bottle instead of a pencil a shot instead of a book. I want to overcome the last obstacle keeping me from being my best version and that obstacle is myself.

"I don't have a drink problem I have problems that make me drink" ..Thanks for writing this! I had forgotten (after only 18 days) about how often I said that almost word for word. I'm going for an initial consultation with an addiction treatment centre on Thursday  and it will be good to keep that in my head as what not to say..I love how you used the beer money for a sketch pad! I used to say to myself "this is too expensive I could get X drinks for this" completely ridiculous! I think I'll do it your way from now on! ..You have a great attitude! I will not drink with you today
Welcome back bro. Make sure you pour out any extra alcohol in your house no need to give the temptation a home. It'll feel good too. Remember try for one day at a time. Don't scare yourself by saying "forever" that's a long time. Tell yourself a day a week. I'm at that point now where forever is just fine but it wasn't always. good to see you back and sober hope the missus is doing well.
