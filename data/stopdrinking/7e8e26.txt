Hi all been off it for a few weeks now but struggling to keep a positive mind about it. Swmbo  keeps doubting that I can do it but I understand why because she had to put up with so much...So tempted but will stay strong. Fuck this is shit.

For me it was important to have people around me who understood what I was going through.  This is stuff 'normies' do not understand...I found this help in AA - there are other such programs now - Smart - refuge recovery etc.... you might try one or all of them...What is swmbo? asks the old fart who doesn't do acronyms well.
Lol She Who Must Be Obeyed (swmbo)   but she's a trooper to put up with me so far so its in jest
Congratulations on 28 days!..I found that making changes to my daily routines &amp; incorporating healthy habits help me staying motivated. I picked up walking started cooking again having meaningful conversations with hubby the list goes on. I also see a therapist  specialised in addictions.
