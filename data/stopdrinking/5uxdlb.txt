I'm not used to it and I'm struggling to cope with my emotions. Feels like I'm going crazy. I've been thinking about drugs and alcohol a lot when ever I get these overwhelming feelings particularly anger. ..Numbing my feelings would be so easy...Fuck it. I'm going to bed. Hope I feel better tomorrow!

.I don't think you're going crazy I think your brain and body are just still used to and expecting some substance to help it avoid those issues...I find it helpful when I feel intense emotions and consider using alcohol to cope to think about all the negative impacts that alcohol has had on my life and why I made a commitment to stay sober.

The anger seems to have subsided today. A good sleep can do wonders :)
