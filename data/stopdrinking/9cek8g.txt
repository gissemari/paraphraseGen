Feeling triggered to drink today. I think it has a lot to do with the fact it's a holiday weekend and I don't have to go to work tomorrow. Trying to play the tape forward. I've been working so hard and I know it's not worth it. Having a tough day this is hard.

Its not worth it. Put some ear buds in and go for a bike ride roller skating walking. Stay busy.
Me too tonight but will do whatever it takes not to currently dipping chocolate in coffee. Stay with it don't give up now
I try to remember: 'I've never regretted not drinking'. 
It's not worth it! IWNDWYT
HALT! are you hungry angry lonely or tired? Or in my case bored or out of habit?..Drinking won't be as fun as you think it will. It never is :(
Those off times can be the hardest. So many challenges have come from when I don't have to work the next day. It's like I don't know what to do with myself! Hopefully writing it out helped you I hope you can use this time you've earned to do something really good for yourself.
I'm feeling the same way but we got this
