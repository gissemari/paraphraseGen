I don't drink every day. I don't always drink to excess. Sometimes I don't even have the desire. ..I do have bipolar disorder and PTSD. I do take my meds. I do drink to escape. I do sometimes black out. ..I have been told I have a drinking problem. My SO says I'm better when I don't drink. I want to be better. More than anything I want to be normal. Normal in the sense that alcohol isn't a problem. Normal in the sense that I don't have PTSD and bipolar. Normal in the sense that the first 21 years of my life weren't filled with raging abusive parents and their sexually abusive friends (I'm 30 now.) ..I'll never get to that sense of normal. Therapy is weekly and has been going on for three years. I have made significant progress albeit slow and arduous. Recently I have been practicing radical acceptance. It's a struggle particularly when it comes to alcohol. Today is my day one. Not my first attempt just the first day of this one. ..How can I accept the fact that alcohol is beyond my control while still feeling good about who I am? I feel ashamed that I can't handle this. I feel ashamed for being unable to accept this limitation. I realize now I need this community. More than I ever thought I would. This is my public cry for help. Thank you for reading this and for all the help you've given to others. ..Note: I am an atheist but welcome words of wisdom and prayers. ..

Since giving up alcohol for an extended period I've been better abke to engage in therapy. It's been the best step I could have taken for my physical and mental health...When I first quit alcohol I did feel ashamed. But I focused on putting as much time as possible between me and my last drink and with time that shame dissolved. What replaced it was a pride in being sober and getting to discover my sober self. My life isn't perfect but I am ok I accept myself I try to treat myself with kindness. For me giving up alcohol is not a limitation it has freed me from my prison it's freed me to be me.
Welcome /u/DeterminedBiped to /r/stopdrinking -- I was able to stop drinking and get sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  As an atheist I did not find my belief (or rather my lack of belief) system a bar to recovery in AA.  Good luck to you.
Accepting the fact that alcohol was beyond my control and making a conscious decision to stop drinking *made* me feel good about who I am! I also have bipolar disorder and now that I'm not drinking and I'm on top of my illness I feel better than I ever have. Sounds like you are already halfway there on that front! So you probably already know that alcohol f*cks with our meds. Not drinking has made all the difference for me so far and I hope it will do the same for you. I pledge not to drink with you today!
