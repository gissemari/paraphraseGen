Here I sit reading all the post about people struggling and let me tell you the struggle is real. It's been 30 whole days since I had a beer. Longest streak ever since the beginning of my relationship with barley pops and fire water. I still think about it at times - beer commercials old habits things die hard. Every now and then when i'm getting into the retired beer fridge in the garage now strictly soda and water - I think about a cold one. I still have fleeting thoughts like "man this would be a good time to have a beer" but the thought still goes away when i remind myself that those days are over. I feel better mornings aren't so bad anymore I certainly get a lot more done outside on the weekends too. So that's my update. To all of you out there just starting your journey - i was there - it gets better trust me. And to all of you out there who have been on this path for awhile I'm right behind you letting the days added up by themselves. Thank you all for the words of wisdom and again - I will not drink with you today

I relate so much to your post. I won't drink with you tonight!
Nice post. Congratulations!
I raise my can of seltzer water to your 1 month! Cheers to you!
The first 30 were so so hard for me !!!!! Congrats !!!
Those thoughts keep coming. I had one today but they become fewer and farther between and easier to manage. I can now see something that triggers those thoughts recognize them for what they are and move on. Well done on a month. That's huge you're doing great!
