Sobriety is possible! One year ago today I asked for help. My loving family reached out to me and brought be back from the abyss. One day at a time. I've made it 365 days so far and I'm thankful everyday that I was able to make it one more. Believe people. If I can do it YOU CAN TOO! I know the struggle. Don't let the drink get you down. Happy hump day to you all!
