I have been not drinking for about 2 months with about 3 relapses and today was just another day when I have just about relapsed. I just got home totally angry hungry and frustrated and reached for the bottle of whisky I got from my friend about a week ago. Then I opened and I was looking for a glass but could not find any so I reached my top shelf to empty one of my glasses in which I keep coins and behind it was a .... chocolate bar. Haha. And at the moment I found it I was like - wait - that is actually what I am craving more. .. So I just laughed at myself. Come on I just ate the chocolate bar closed the bottle and now just sitting here and being like wow. I really knew why the chocolate bar was there. Hah.

YES!   Chocolate sounds way better anyway!    Nicely done! I won't drink with you today! 
Ooooh I just love this.  Really made me smile!..Good to have a stash of treats ... I love having lots of good options tucked in the fridge and pantry to help me sidetrack the 5 o'clock witching hour.
Well done! ..You know about HALT right? Since you identified hungry and angry I am guessing you must. But if not give it a google!
I used to rarely eat sweets and now I've found that they have been lifesavers lately! I don't even feel that guilty after eating them. lol
