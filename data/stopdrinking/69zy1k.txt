So I posted this elsewhere in a comment but I think everyone who even remotely considers relapsing should hear..."The worst thing in the world is a belly full of booze and a head full of AA."..This was said to me by one of my mentors early on and it sort of just stuck with me. I had a hard time starting it. I was hospitalized back in July after having seizures while trying to stop drinking - ICU for 7 days. Literally almost didn't make it out. Not fun...Came out and I STILL drank even with half-heartedly going to meetings. The longest stretch I had was 39 days until October but the last time I relapsed was a week after I got out of rehab. I was sitting there drinking straight from my bottle of whisky and it just clicked. I hated everything drinking brought me and it was no longer the crutch I thought it was and whatever method of self medication was done. I'm 28 right now I ended a 6 year relationship with my gf sold my brand new house that I had built and quit my job so I could start over completely. ..Once you see first hand in meetings the destruction and the lies you are sold via the media/friends/bars there's no going back. You will NEVER drink and enjoy it again. It's a ticking time bomb. Some people outlive that bomb and never see it but we don't get that luxury anymore...Y'all can do it!..Sorry for any typos I'm on mobile.

So true!  Thank you.  I feel every word of what you said especially what you said about once our eyes are open we can never go back. This gives me much comfort but also lots of regret as I wish my eyes were open before the last 20 years of damaging my brain and body.
Thank you for this!  My first two weeks were so exciting and now that life's back to its stressful yet boring self I find my mind wandering.....Hearing this balances it all out :)
