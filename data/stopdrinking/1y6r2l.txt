...the one who seems OK  he smiles all the time but stares off at nothing.  He jokes all the time  but under the surface is all alone with his turmoil.  That's me  I make people laugh  I take care of them. I feel like the worst piece of trash in the world  but I'll never let you see it.  Inside I'm screaming for help  the anxiety is killing me.  I love the idea of people  but being around them hurts.  All of the hell I created is my fault  I want to let it go but I can't seem to.  Every fucking day is like an eternity and I hate it.  Fuck!!!  ..I finally started going to an IOP after a relapse.  I finally allowed myself to be proud of that.  Things are getting better  but I just had to get that out of my system.  Thanks for being here  just knowing that at least you all won't judge me for this rant is comforting.

So I'm curious do you feel that you are unique?  'Cause I've got news for you my friend you are not!  You just described a significant part of myself.  Thank you for your honesty and sharing!!!  I needed to read that and be reminded of how I used to feel...Congrats on doing something new after your relapse.  Good luck.
Welcome back.  This is ok and you can make it.  I made it back after 15 years of continuous sobriety and a 7+ year relapse.  If I can do it you can do it.
