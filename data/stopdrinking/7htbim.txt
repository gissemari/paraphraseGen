I've struggled with alcohol for years. I managed to pull off 90 days sober two years ago but have struggled sense. Deciding to finally get back on the wagon for real this time.  Having some discomfort I don't remember having last time but I also went through a medical detox last time...Has anyone experienced these symptoms before?  I've also had difficulty sleeping. Profuse sweating and  trouble staying asleep which I know that's all normal...but the itchy feeling is driving me nuts...No matter how much this sucks I'm not drinking tonight.

Itchiness in my case was due to the fact that my liver couldn't function anymore and was putting toxins back into my body. I hope you will choose to see a doctor.
48 hours here now too. One minute I'm freezing the next time ROASTING. I'm super itchy bored irritable. Feels like I have the flu x a million...I've been googling and reading so much it's 100% normal. Your body is pissed because you took something away it was so used to. I've heard you're basically stuck like this for a few days but it will pass and be worth it. ..I've been watching funny movies and trying to keep busy. Taking it minute by minute...PM if you wanna chat!
Yup  think I just got past mine.   It sicks but it does pass.  Be sure tibsay hydrated and take care if your body  eat well  etc.   
I had never been itchy but I have had the difficulty breathing like I'm unable to get a full breath of air or air all the way into my lungs. I think it was withdrawal and anxiety it gets better and exercise helps  A LOT.
You might want to google Kindling Effect... Hard to breathe  is classic panic attack symptom which I used to get when flying before I practed CBT.  ..Medical supervision fir withdrawal is always a good choice...Looking forward to hearing from you!
