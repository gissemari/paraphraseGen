After 15 months sober I've landed myself a new job in a warewouse last week with tons of people working there and tons of drugs floating around. In addition to my alcoholism I struggled with drug problems in the past but within my forst week here I've already found two drug dealers. I've already lined up to purchase a few molly and some adderal but I'm also really itching to try and track down some opiates (my other doc). It's so weird to me that the second I start even thinking about getting ahold of one drug my mind instantly wanders to getting ahold of heroin or oxy.

These are deliberate decisions you're making. Are you sure this is what you want?
It sounds like your brain is lighting up with the idea of getting some kind of relief. Are there other (sober) ways you can find relief especially in the evenings after work?
