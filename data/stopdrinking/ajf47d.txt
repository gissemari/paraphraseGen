Hey all.  It's been a few days since I posted and I'm really just trying to keep myself accountable and stay involved here this sub has really been my main source of support during this time so I'm just posting when I can and soaking up all the encouragement I can get...&amp;#x200B;..Today is my 25th day without alcohol.  I won't lie this is still hard.  All of the difficult emotions and situations that I've created for myself because of my years of drinking are now enveloping me and my source of escape isn't there anymore to make me feel better (alcohol obviously).  Honestly the main struggle for me isn't so much the craving for alcohol anymore but it's having to face all these issues and negative feelings head-on like a real adult.  I'm still feeling the pain of losing my girlfriend of 5 years and feeling rejected and alone living in a new apartment and sleeping alone for the first time in years stressing about my living situation feeling extremely sad and not having the support and friend group that I wish I could have and just overall depression and painful negative thoughts.  These are all the things I used to be able to escape from so easily just one drink and it would all go away.  Somebody hurts you?  No big deal I'll just pop in the bar and I'll feel better.  Shitty day at work?  No big deal I'll just grab a mini-bottle from the store and down it real quick that'll cover up the feeling.  Now that I've made to conscious decision to stop entirely there's no more escape.  Just face it and deal with it like a man like everybody else does.  I haven't had to do that in basically my entire adult life (tomorrow I turn 31 drank every day since I was 22).  ..&amp;#x200B;..I know there are more positives than negatives in all of this and it takes a while to adjust to a new way of getting through life.  I don't feel sick and panicked all day I don't have to hide and keep my lies straight all day so I don't get caught I don't have to arrange my schedule around finding ways to drink without anyone knowing.  So much has changed for the better just in 25 days I feel better physically work is easier I'm going out and pursuing hobbies again I'm taking care of my appearance I started going to therapy and making doctors appointments I even started volunteering.  But I don't know I just feel like I'm doing everything you're supposed to do and I just feel stuck and sad and stressed and I'm not sure what's supposed to come next.  I know a huge part of this is due to the break-up I just can't seem to get it off my mind for even a second even when I'm busy.  I haven't been able to sleep all these racing thoughts just keep me up all night and I can't "put" myself to sleep anymore like I used to with alcohol.  Sorry if this is not the most encouraging post sometimes I just need to vent and this community always helps me so much.  Thanks to anyone who reads this I will not drink with all of you today.

Congrats on 25 days!  That's awesome!..It does sound like you're doing lots of good things and I'm proud of you for looking to avoid escaping into the bottle to solve your problems...You said something interesting: "Just face it and deal with it like a man".  That's a tad more macho than I generally skew but I'll roll with it and say back to you: "Real men use tools".  So what tools are you using to handle life as it comes at you?..Me?  I needed to get into a recovery program.  I tried various different kinds before settling on one that felt right for me.  I also do therapy and other things but having a program where I get to interact in person with people like myself has been quite a boon to my sobriety.  YMMV but I didn't see you mention it up above and I thought I'd just nudge you to at least try some if you haven't already...Also meditation.  That's helped me a TON.  I like Insight Timer as an app on my phone...Best of luck on your journey!  IWNDWYT
The first month is really hard even when you are doing all the right things...You didn't mention exercise so I will. That helped me so much with anxiety in the beginning...What I didn't know about in the beginning is meditation. It is a game changer. Especially for learning to shut down racing thoughts. Headspace is a good free app that is super helpful in getting started...Congratulations on making this positive change in your life and Happy Birthday! Eat some cake!!
