The alcohol demons are still lurking around. While awake and conscious alcohol is a NO-NO. But last night as I was sleeping I experienced such a surreal and vivid dream I thanked God i did not relapse when I woke up. As we all have a daily routine I was going through mine but this time instead of a sunny outside and well lit train station. The environment was dark and rainy the train station had nearly no power and the ambient was overall depressing. Straight out of a movie like as I opened my bag to pull something out I found two empty bottles of vodka instead &amp; a brand new one. Sadness overwhelmed me but I grabbed the new bottle popped it open and as soon as I put it to my mouth to take a sip *BOOM* I wake up in such a stressed state covered full of sweat as if I had just been drinking during the day. The alcohol demons are still trying to posses me. Don't let the temptations pull you back into this horrible addiction. Stay strong guys. IWNDWYT.

I had drinking dreams all through rehab 2 and a half weeks. A few days after I got out they mostly stopped but I do occasionally get another one here or there. ..Don't let it get to you. Remember that habits are hard to break but just because you dreamed it doesn't mean you actually did it irl and you don't have to. Stay strong. This too shall pass. IWNDWYT
Luckily I had those not very often and since about a year they're gone...IWNDWYT.
