So as the title suggests I made a big mistake when I relapsed the other night. I post somewhat regularly here but this is a new account. Long story short I woke up with no memory of driving home from the bar. That day I sat in my apartment all day and just watched TV. I still haven't found my phone. I went out once to look in my car and couldn't find it. ..So I went out to look in my car again the next day and I noticed it looks like I hit something on the side of my bumper (theres a sizable dent). I didn't notice it when I looked in my car for my phone earlier but I have to assume I hit something. Obviously I have no memory of hitting anything but my mind is awash with thoughts of what could have happened. ..I feel like the biggest piece of shit right now. What's done is done and I know I can't change whatever happened that night. All I can do now is choose to not pick up that first drink each day and live with whatever happens. I got a drunk in public once last year but that's the only thing I've ever been in trouble for regarding my drinking never mind numerous social regrets and terrible hangovers...I've had a rough year I'm trying to finish my last semester at college and my girlfriend whom I lived with broke up with me last fall. I'm an older student(relatively) because I took some time off and as a consequence don't really know anyone in school anymore. My GF was my only real support here and it's been hard without her. I feel like every time things start to look up in my life something I do comes a long and just takes a giant shit on all the good things that had been happening. .

Hey sorry you're going through a rough time. I usually drank at home so it has been a long time for me but when I was young I would sometimes drive drunk and for me looking back that is the scariest thing to think of what could have happened...I'm glad that you are safe though and here. For some people that can be a good wake up call. We are all here to support you if you feel like it is the time for you to quit. I have heard around here that quitting drinking alcohol didn't solve my problems but it made it possible to solve them and that's what I've found...I was so used to sitting and thinking of all the problems in my life that even still I'll sit and start feeling sorry for myself and making a list of everything wrong in my life and all the stuff I do wrong but nowadays that list gets shorter and shorter and I no longer wake up hating myself. Sometimes I start to and realize actually I've been doing pretty well lately - somehow not drinking has freed up lots more time and lots lots more energy and motivation to do stuff. I didn't think I ever would get there I used to cry every day! But here I am...So it can get better &lt;3 hope ya stick around let us know how you're doing.
Back in the day I would find a dent/ scratch/ chunk taken out of my car and immediately scour the news to make sure no one was looking for me... one day I watched the news to find out they were looking for a woman who basically mowed down a kid on a skateboard!  I lost my damn mind.  Thankfully she had a totally different car and personal description... ..This might be a good time to figure out what you can do to stay sober...
