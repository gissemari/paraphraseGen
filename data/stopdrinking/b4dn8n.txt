For those of you in your 12 to 24 months and especially those who've JUST stopped here is some info on PAWS...Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome are "very common lingering effects of withdrawal called "post-acute  withdrawal syndrome" (PAWS) which can seriously challenge sobriety.  These symptoms are a result of brain dysfunction caused by the brain  readjusting to being without alcohol and drugs. Recovery from PAWS  usually takes somewhere between six and 24 months." ..PAWS is real and explains why you may still feel like crap even though you've stopped poisoning yourself...I know when I got sober the first time I thought that I was going to feel better once the initial withdrawal was over and everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows.  BOY was I wrong!  That said I did feel considerably better than I did when I was using but still struggled for months after I got clean.  ..Thankfully a kind soul informed me about PAWS because I thought I was crazy or weak when my anxiety got worse I got more depressed I couldn't sleep (and when I did all I had was drug dreams) and was more lethargic than when I was drinking/using.   ..It makes sense to me now.  Beat yourself up for years and its going to take a long time for your body to reset itself. ..Below are a few links to info on PAWS I found to be helpful!..[https://www.smartrecovery.org/am-i-going-crazy/](https://www.smartrecovery.org/am-i-going-crazy/)..[https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/carty/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome](https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/articles/carty/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome)..[https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome)..[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/some-assembly-required/201505/detoxing-after-detox-the-perils-post-acute-withdrawal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/some-assembly-required/201505/detoxing-after-detox-the-perils-post-acute-withdrawal)..&amp;#x200B;..Knowledge is power!..I wish you all the best as you trudge the road to recovery!..Remember you can't do this alone and you don't have to.  ..Reach out get help stay sober get your life back - one day at a time...&amp;#x200B;

Good to know that makes me feel much better about myself. I doubt I'm alone in being impatient to see results. I constantly have to remind myself that it makes no sense to expect life to be sunshine and rainbows only months after getting sober. I quit drinking so that's it right?! Lol Thanks for sharing this! 
I haven't read the links yet but thank you for this- I'm wondering where my rainbows and unicorns have been for the past year.
I had a PAWS episode right around my 1 year mark...during which I asked myself if sobriety was worth it. Fortunately it passed in a few days.   
Thank you. I just came to search the sub for info about if the anhedonia/lethargy/anxiety I am experiencing is normal.. My house is a disaster worse than when I drank at least then I'd have bursts of energy and pick up my mess a bit. I am trying to do upgrading classes and can't focus and my work stress is overwhelming me greatly. Tough times. Hope things get better soon. 
This is in a way disheartening but being educated is much more important. About to be a week sober and a year seems unattainable but we just have to push forward and make it happen. IWNDWYT 
Okay I've read the links and I'm now convinced this is the source of my total lack of energy sober. I just wanted to see someone write the word "exhaustion" or "fatigue" associated with the early months of sobriety because there are so many posts about how people are totally killing it in the gym getting raises at work growing previously unsuspected superpowers discovering they're really a wizard like Harry - meanwhile I'm here like "should i just start drinking again so I can finish marathon training?" and deciding not to because even a relapse seems like TOO MUCH WORK and I'm kinda tired. At 8pm.  ..
This is such an important post!  Thank you!..My husband struggled with anhedonia so severely the first time he made a major attempt to quit drinking.  We didn't know anything about this type of depression or PAWS at that time.  He eventually went back to drinking heavily because it was so bleak.  He's been sober for 3+ years now and the PAWS never surfaced this time.  ..It's so good to know that it's "normal" and there is reason to stay sober and not lose hope.  Things may have gone so much differently had we known about this 10 years ago.
