Hey all..I haven't posted in a couple days but don't worry I am still strong!..I have just been busy with work and playing games at night. I have been playing a lot of Dark Souls to keep me busy instead of drinking. This game is much more enjoyable without being drunk since it is one of the hardest games out there right now being sober helps us play...Day 7 was particularly bad for cravings as I hadn't drank on friday or saturday night. The Sunday was tough...I struggled to make it to 6pm(when the liqour stores close) but make it I did. I just keep reminding myself that I don't need alcohol for anything its not helping me with work its not helping me with fitness or eating right and it certainly doesn't help with a high focus activity like gaming; which I love dearly. ..I will not drink today I say it every morning and every time I post here..

This is the way + a recovery meeting.
I used to game drunk but it is much better sober.  Since I bought the PS3 I had never played sober - the pattern was go home and game while getting slozzled.  Replaying games sober has been like watching a movie I forgot about or passed out during.  You get so much more out of them...I recently finished Ni No Kuni and now getting into Dragon's Dogma.  Dark Souls and Demon Souls are on my pile of shame to really start and give a decent try one day...Good luck in your continued sobriety.
Nicely done!  Enjoy a bit of D3 to relax myself...
