Visiting my brother and it's a family full of love and energy - and im feeling sorry for myself and need to shake it out. The sadness tightens my throat when i feel that i haven't managed to create any of this normal happiness for myself or anyone else. ..And then having a great time at a festival yesterday with my sober brother - we danced for six hours! And this morning he is so calm when the kids wake up at 5 and are jumping around excited that sojayn is here. ..I had a stepfamily for 8 yrs. I tried to create this ordinary happiness. I was a great parent and sober then. Now. Now im some bitter sad person who i don't want to be. I will not drink. I just don't like myself very much right now.

This too shall pass. Alcohol poisons our being and takes some time to be expelled.  You are worthy of love these kids are showing that maybe it's time to give yourself some love too.  If not now soon.
Hey sojayn I'm sorry that times are tough right now for you. I am also so proud of you and your sober journey...Through all the ups and downs of the last 4 months you have still put one sober foot in front of the other each day. That is amazing...You are sober you are young and you don't yet know what wonders this world has in store for you. Be gentle with yourself and as our friends on here say everyday one day at a time my friend the wonders of the world will unfold for you
