I've had issues with other substances and gambling. It took a while to realize the only times I relapse are when I'm drunk! Even though I can "handle" a few beers at home it leads to phone calls to go pick up. It's certainly realizing not only will I wake up with a hangover but $100 poorer and at some shady trap house.

Yes...well rather other addictions pile up on top of the alcohol one and they wind together reinforcing each other. Sex drugs and booze was the particular trifecta of fuckery that was destroying me.
Yes alcohol is not my DOC- it's my gateway. You're not alone. 
Leads me to uppers and downers. Without the use of alcohol I wouldn't use drugs.
Alcohol was by far my worst issue but almost every one with alcohol problems is prone to other addiction issues. Other drugs gambling even sex and food. Most have to be very cautious about picking up other vices after quitting alcohol.  Getting sober for me was the best decision I ever made but was only the start to working on the mess of problems I had drowned in the  booze.
Yes back in the heyday of online poker I'd often wake up from a blackout and think  oh shit  and go check the balance. .$0. Always $0. 
Yep booze liked to invite cocaine to the party.
Convinced I had a pill problem (which I did) so got treated for the pill problem and kept drinking. Uh oh now I have a crack problem. Got treated for the crack problem thought I was "cured" still drank still smoked crack. Took a while to realize the problem wasn't pills crack or even booze. The problem was me. 
I did notice that once I stopped smoking I no longer craved beer.  Then tequila moved in.
