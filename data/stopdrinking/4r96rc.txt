**Twelve thousand three hundred forty five days!** ..Several of you have alerted me that this day was coming. Kind of interesting to see consecutive numbers but I doubt there is any special meaning except it does make me stop and think about how grateful I am for another day of sobriety one with an interesting sequence. ..    Stay sober one day at a time;.    Don't die;.    You'll get there too!  ..StopDrinking is a place which helps me remember what it was like when I was struggling. It gives me hope when lives begin healing and joy when long-term recovery is achieved. This subreddit provides the opportunity to pay forward the help that has been so generously given to me. ..Love ya'

Super cool.  But reminds me of a resentment from last month when I glanced at my Ford's odometer in time to notice 123468!  A great friend (with 31) would offer up "Just be careful I hear the 33rd  year is the toughest of them all!".  Great milestone great inspiration and great service here on Reddit.  Congrats and thank you.
