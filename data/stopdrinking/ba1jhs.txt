I've been struggling with major digestive problems ever since I started drinking more heavily. I had IBS before I started drinking but it's so much worse now. It feels like my digestion is stuck on fast forward. I don't have diarrhoea exactly more like loose stools. I need to go to the toilet immediately after everything I eat. I also have terrible heartburn sometimes...With my IBS I also have symptoms like hot flashes cold chills ect. After I eat I often feel hot and uncomfortable and itchy. This also happens every time I try to sleep sober. So if I try to take a nap when I'm not drunk I feel hot itchy and uncomfortable very soon after laying down or even when nodding off in my chair. It's made trying to get some decent sleep while sober a nightmare. I've been to doctors and they've done as much as they can...I've tried to quit drinking before and the longest I've gone sober is a few months. It was a nightmare because my IBS didn't improve nor did my sleep. Being drunk actually gives me some relief from these problems but of course it wears off the next day...Can anyone relate to any of this?

Having IBS symptoms and recurrent cystitis were major factors in my stopping and I'm pleased to say nearly 4 weeks in that the symptoms have totally subsided. For ages I tried to kid myself it was something else causing the problems but I knew deep down it was alcohol. Sending you best wishes and hopes that you are able to find a way to get on your sober journey. 
I feel like everyone who drinks has more digestion issues than those who don't it's terrible for your GI system.  It took me a solid 3 weeks to notice any benefits of quitting and didn't really notice until like 2 months sober.
