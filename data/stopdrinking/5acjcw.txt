I saw a guy's post last week that showed him before and after getting sober.  I saw myself in him and I was tired of a lot of the things people complain about - making excuses for feeling crappy every morning always tired elevated liver enzymes (slightly) sweaty itchy etc.  I drink every day mostly because I enjoy the buzz and it's such a habit.  I typically drink 4 to 6 drinks a night then go to bed.  It's odd to me to go to sleep without a buzz.  ..I don't like the term "alcoholic" and I don't apply it to myself.  I have struggled with alcohol off and on for 15 or 20 years but it goes in cycles.  I would drink to self medicate for panic attacks then at one point poured the alcohol down the drain and didn't drink for three years.  I did fine drinking socially when I started again and didn't have a problem for many years.  I got into a bad circle of drinking depression panic self loathing etc.  I quit drinking at the behest of my therapist and stayed sober for maybe 2 years.  ..I started drinking socially and somewhat reluctantly again knowing I had problems with it getting out of control.  For a year now I've been drinking four or five times a week but daily for the last 6 months or so.  ..I drank Wed then was going to stop Thursday but ended up slamming some whiskey after the family went to bed.  That's when I stumbled onto this subreddit and decided to make a commitment to quit again.  ..The first couple days were tough.  I kept thinking I can just drink on the weekend and stay sober on the week nights but I know that isn't realistic so I'm three days sober now and looking forward to improved health and feeling better.

Welcome!  For me definitions aren't important.  If I feel I have a problem with alcohol that's enough.  Then I can be done with denying an identification with a certain population or justifying my continued behavior.  I have a problem with booze don't like the way I felt it was running my life.  Now I can take other actions to change things.  It sounds like you don't like the way you feel with alcohol and now you're taking action to change.  Good for you! 
Congratulations!
