I couldn't have done it without the stopdrinking chat at https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/..Seriously in person and online support communities are awesome. What I like about the online group is that I can access it when I can't get to a meeting (it's too late or I have a self imposed ban on leaving the house because if I do I might go to the liquor store)...The group has encouraged me during this self imposed ban and got me through some craving days...Relapse is not in my forecast. I am feeling really good even with 20 or so days sobriety. But if I do come close to relapse I am checking with the online group if I can't get a meeting.

I don't know what you're talking about. We're all terrible people in chat.
Keep it up.  Online + real life = a solid combination for staying sober.
Good for you /u/deedeethecat!
