I'm attending a networking event I've never gone to sober. I don't struggle with wanting to drink in bars but I do struggle with feeling nervous and anxious and self conscious without drinking. It's a networking event and I'm trying to focus on presenting myself proudly and clearly which I can do best while sober. Just...feel like it's going to be a challenge without that "social lubricant".

No one said this was going to be without challenges right? Strap on those boxing gloves son. 
You've faced many challenges over the past 72 days. Just remember that you were able to succeed and overcome each and every one of those challenges!..This is just another challenge. Think of it as a growth opportunity!
You can do this thing!  I feel sort of like Dale Carnegie or Zig Ziglar here but the old "people love a good listener they love to talk about themselves" helps me in those situations...Good luck -- and let us know how it goes?
