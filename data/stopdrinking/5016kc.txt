Hello..I recently relapsed. 4 months ago alcohol almost killed me. I knew I had a problem for a long time but that was the last straw. I went 6 weeks with no hiccups and relapsed then 7 weeks and relapsed. Now I'm back at it. I went to the same Aa meeting every day for two weeks. The group was supportive and I can see why it is so beneficial to so many. However the thought of sharing was so nerve racking I couldn't bring myself to share and I didn't go this morning. Is there a way to stay sober without going to meetings?  Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

There are many different paths to sobriety. I am only using this sub as my support group. I am also doing some reading on sobriety and doing some meditation...I'm an extremely introverted person. Group activities just aren't for me. However if I begin to have trouble then I might explore AA or perhaps SMART Recovery meetings.
Hey /u/Pmead47 -- why do you think you relapsed?  Knowing that might help us better think about your question.
I got sober with the help of this sub. Starting out all I did was read read read read every day/night when I was feeling any sort of urges. There was so much to check out. I got involved slowly with the community posting and commenting as well.
