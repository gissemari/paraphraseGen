I can't believe I'm almost to 150. It really isn't that hard anymore. I've been out with my friends and wife to bars and other gathering and just didn't drink. Someone asks me and I just a say "I'm good."  There's questions sometimes and I tell them PTSD and drinking just didn't mix. Most people get it and don't question it. I'm loving life and wouldn't trade it for anything. I've wanted to drink on occasion but I look forward and nothing good comes out of it. I'm healthy happy and just doing well. Work is better and people notice it. There's been some bad things happen since I stopped drinking but I didn't run to the bottle. I dealt with it and got past it. My wife likes me again and my kids like being around me. I can't believe I wasted so much time drinking. So much time not being able to sleep and dreading the morning. ..If you're struggling and reading this I swear you can stop!  You have to find what works for you. AA didn't work for me but it might for you. Life can be good.  I'm not going to lie the first few weeks fucking sucks!  All you'll want to do is drink but it you can will yourself past the beginning you'll love yourself. Get help because doing it on your own probably won't work. I'm no veteran at this sober thing but where I'm at now compared to a year ago is night and day. ..Lat thing how the hell do I turn flair on with the new Reddit app?

I needed to read this tonight. And then I opened up SD and there it was. Imagine that. Thank you for posting. 
Congrats on 150. As to the flair I started seeing the number of days people have as soon as I installed the new version of the app. It looks like you need to enable flair on the normal website before it'll show up in the app though.
