Same here but damn I am sleeping 10 hours a night! At 66 I am sleeping away my life.

Congrats! Smashing it. ..I'm almost there too. Enjoying being more aware of who I am again. Feels like such a short amount of time has passed since it looked like such far away milestone...Not drinking today and totally into it. Cheers.
Congrats. It gets easier with time.
Way to go!!
Congratulations - that is a HUGE milestone.  IWNDWYT!
Congratulations!  One day at a time!
I find the ones I'm closer to in days sober are the most inspiring to me! Good job and thanks for not drinking with me today!

Hell yes! 
Congrats! I am at 120 days next week...Lost 25lbs got a gym membership and am shocked at the amount of money in my bank account- Severely underestimated how much I was spending on beer...It only gets better so hang in there!
