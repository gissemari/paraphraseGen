I've been 10 days in before. This feels different because I feel like I have the support to make it past the inevitable temptation and stresses that have caused my relapses before. I love you guys. :)

You can do it one day at a time.  
Nice - isn't it great having a support system?  SD is great...Congrats on 10 days!
Keep at it you are past the worst of it! I'm still having struggles of my own but that first two weeks is HARD! You've got this!
Ten days is killer! Over the worst as you know. SD is a literal lifesaver...Congrats!
