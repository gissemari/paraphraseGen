Hi guys..I used to drink wine to take mind off the worries of the day and let go. Since I have stopped drinking I have to a large degree ended up focusing on work and attaining career-related goals such as promotion etc. I find myself having hard times letting go of work thoughts am putting a lot of pressure on myself and feel that everything needs to happen NOW. People around me are generally more relaxed and I hate them for that because they are not on my timeline. I try to hide it but it's hard work in itself. I used to be more relaxed and go to yoga take longer dog walks but recently I am not even able to do that. I COULD make time to do all of that but I don't WANT to relax and take a break because I'd rather "get everything done" or find some other overachiever-type work activities to invest it. Then I find myself getting angry that noone really cares.  Looking for tips and advice to stress management and how to quiet my mind.

Hi I totally relate to what you're saying. I am very impatient with life in general I want things to happen 'NOW" and I tend to swing between being a 'go-getter' to not giving a fuck about anything and feeling like there is no point to life so whats the use?... I have an overactive mind... I am well aware of that so I have found an app called 'Headspace' which is a guided meditation app Im finding it is helping me deal with stress anxiety a bit more although I still have good and bad days. Give it a try its free for the first 10 sessions then its about $80 US. I am really enjoying it and I do it without fail every morning. 
I second the meditation- you can head to /r/meditation and /r/mindfulness and check them out. You can search YouTube for guided meditation and a number of videos will come up. Two of my favorite meditation guides are: Suzanne Robichaud and Michael Sealey - it's not a silver bullet as it takes discipline and focus but it's well worth it!!
