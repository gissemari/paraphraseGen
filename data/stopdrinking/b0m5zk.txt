Sorry this is a long post!..I've read a number of books on trying to quit or cut down. Below is what I've written to read to myself whenever that familiar urge comes in. I've read a lot of different tips for handling urges I've found it's the craving that I mindlessly succumb to that I really struggle with and my hope is that the below will help me through. It's really a brain dump from myself so excuse any incoherence poor grammer etc. It's a personal message to myself but all of you always share some really interesting and useful insights to get through this journey so thought I'd share in case parts of it are useful or can be used to write your own personal one specific to you all...FYI Much of below is a combo of The Naked Mind Easy way and Drink less in 7 days..Much love fellow SD'ers!..&amp;#x200B;..\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------..&amp;#x200B;..The what why and how on handling this oh so frequent urge ..**What is it **..You think it's the drink and the fun/reward it bring Really it's just the elation you feel when you give into it as the inner conflict and the battle to change is delayed for another day...**Why is it** ..Many things but 2 in particular .....1. Endorphin release. Body has by habit got used to that release. Equates it as joy/excitement/fun but really it isn't any of those things. ..2. Silences the inner critic. Atm your sub-conscious and conscious are in conflict and the flight or fight part inherent in all of us knows that a drink is the habit and method you've used in the past to run from that critic so is the first thing it thinks of to placate the critis. The first drink ends the conflict (releases the endorphin) you're now allowed to drink and the tap is turned on to drink as much as you want. it is a misplaced sense of relief...**What you need to think about.** ..You need to be present that urge when it comes needs to be thought about not succumbed to without thought bring it into conscious...      You're not a 'hic. It's a habit you've got into. By being present and aware of above you can if you choose drink and stop when you've had enough or can choose to not drink without it feeling like a sacrifice..      You need to build the good habits first. Listen to the hypnotherapy recording for Drink less in 7 days read this over and over and r/stopdrinking. Understand the two points above deeply about what that urge is and what drinking is.      You've delayed the battle at least 1500 time since you realised your issue. Now you need to know it's not a battle at all it's a simple choice and a choice that you're happy to make based on what you know and have learnt. .      Just because it's a Friday/Saturday why does that mean drinking excessively. Friday night means you lose your Saturday morning minimum and same for Sat night and Sun morning. That's time better spent playing with kids. Instead the evening can be watching an awesome movie tv show video game get in bed and listen to that album you love read a book pick up your slr and photography again. There's so much more to do!.      What is it really  solo party's it's damage.    	  Damage to your body vital organs weight increase.    	  Damage to your mind endorphins and pleasure centres have been remapped. .    	  It's tiredness.    	  It does not make the evening better. Play it forward.    		  The first one is a relief not pleasure. Just to get that feeling but really it's the top two points in why is it.    		  Then it's go time no more conflict taps are on evening is now staring blindly at a screen with the highlight refilling the drink until your fully in oblivion..    		  Don't remember or enjoy shows/movies as don't get absorbed/engaged into them. Can't even remember them the next day.    		  Don't enjoy video games as mind has been switched off again see above.    		  During the night its missing the calls from your kids who needed you for something.    		  The next day its pain lethargy late arrival into work. .    		  In years it's going to be the awareness you drifted through life rather than achieving true objectives and aims.. The increase in seratonin.      Social .    	  You don't engage in conversation unless hand has something in it.    	  People will sense you're not in the conversation they're right.    	  Solo is the issue for you though it does nothing but damage. Social is very occasional and do have control it's the additional drinks after (solo) that is the issue at these events. You don't need them or enjoy them really. ..**What to get excited about ** ..1. Short term a. You won't wake up next day aware your one day along to permanent damage i. You won't regret not having drank more the previous day ..2. You will lose weight you already eat and drink non-alch drinks well empty liquid calories will be gone! ..3. Your inner self will be happier and filled with pride. Look at what you are and what you've become and before it's too late. No more of that conflict. True increase in confidence ..4. No more next day lethargy ..5. You will likely do more exercise you will be physically be going towards where you want to be. ..6. You will be the person you want to be a. Achieve personal goals ..7. You will be the husband you want to be. Attentive patient a friend and a post to be leaned on. ..8. You will be the father you want to be a. Fun inspiring educational downright silly and full of energy...9. You will be truly alive..&amp;#x200B;..Do you still want that drink? ..Did you succumb?..It's fine get up again and keep going it doesn't matter. You don't have a problem when you have a solution. Next time get all of above back into your conscious because you got this.
