Last night at work I suddenly had the desire to go to the bar afterwards. It was a beautiful evening not too hot or cold the sun was setting and all my brain could fixate on was how nice it would be to get a whiskey and sit on a patio with a cigarette. I had to keep fighting my thoughts after all I'm at a week now! Why would I quit now? ..Anyway once I was done with work I was still struggling with myself so I went outside smoked a cigarette and read the posts on here and suddenly that whiskey on the patio seemed like a really stupid idea. ..This is all just to say thank you to everyone here I'm still on my sober journey because of you all. ..Fuck zero days! I won't drink with you today
