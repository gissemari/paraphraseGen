Hey there folks. I had an interesting discussion after a group session with a gentleman who has a few issues with the AA schema...His key points were: ..* the process just does not work and alluded to studies indicating this..* There is too much emphasis placed on negativity of the individual (you are a horrible alcoholic and that's all you will ever be UNLESS you do this). The whole natures of the shares are just constant reinforcement of the negativity..* The group is akin to a cult. Where if you find ways that help you resolve your drinking you were not a "true" alcoholic. If you fail and relapse you obviously weren't following the program well enough. Etc etc. *I actually can relate to this a bit it can feel quite cult like at times*.* It's a money making scheme. *I don't quite believe this but I really haven't done any research one way or another*..He said alot of other things but it was quite in the rant mode (actually came off a bit like a fundamentalist actually) so it didn't really sink it. He told me to do some of my own research saying that something called the **Orange Papers** had a lot of information highlighting the flaws of the AA system...I have had my doubts about the AA process but as a I am very cerebral person I am more than willing to entertain multiple different lines of thought and make my decision after I have done my own searching...What I wanted from this post was to perhaps generate some discussion about alternatives to AA thoughts on AA in general Pros and Cons of AA etc etc...Please please please note I have no stake either way in what I think is "right" or "wrong". I just want to hear opinions and thoughts from people with longer term sobriety than I. I do this in order to better develop my plans and goals for long term sobriety when I leave rehab...Thanks.

Alright. I've been thinking far too much lately about the VERSUS stuff and the "opinions" people have about ways to get and stay sober...I've come to a point where conversations like this I find repetitive and I'm don't find them useful for my sobriety...We aren't a debating society. We are a recovery community. If it works for YOU if YOU want to work it then work it...When it comes down to it we can find faults in anything because we are ourselves faulty because we're humans and we're creating things that will never be perfect...Getting cerebral about getting sober didn't work for me. Getting too concerned about aspects of AA didn't work for me drove me crazy. ..The AA banter on this sub sometimes really gets to me! And as a mod here I feel sort of ashamed saying that. But I'm stepping out of my mod shoes tonight. This post bugged me. ..Are you sober today? OK how did you do that? Cool. Let's see what challenges tomorrow brings and let's use a bunch of tools to stay sober then also. ../endrant /modshoesback
I know that AA doesn't work for me but I'm not a fan of the Orange Papers either. I think that the Orange Papers made some valid criticisms about the program but I was turned off by the fact that it  greatly exaggerates the situation - it is obviously written by someone with a grudge. I think criticism of AA is important but it needs to be fair - I don't think the Orange Papers website is fair. ..The reality is that AA does not work for everyone and I would go so far as to say that it might even work against some people - it did for me. Haven't said that it is good that is there for the people who need this type of support. It's also important to keep in mind that none of other approaches to recovery are perfect either. 
The best way to find out about AA is to go to a few (many) meetings...If it works it works; if it doesnt try something else.  :)
Studies do show however that people who do all 12 steps and get a sponsee have  a 3x chance staying sober than any other way. Most studies don't look at ALL 12 steps. ...Can't link Cruz on my phone but pm me and I'll send it when I get home
If this whole AA debate I would have last year I would have been "against AA". But now that I have done my research got a sponsor found a group I like and had a spiritual awakening I can say that AA is one of the best things that I have found for recovery.
I think that AA is a little different depending on where you are. And that it works best when you have a desire to stop. However there are open meetings for those without a desire to stop and I believe that AA can benefit anyone not just the alcoholic. .My favorite thing about AA is that it admits to not holding a monopoly on recovery. It talks about it in the literature and my sponsor tells me it all the time. If you find a way to stay sober outside of AA good for you. The thing to remember is to keep doing what works for you. I have a few friends who have found sobriety outside of AA. It works for them AA works for me. .Another thing I love is that it repeatedly tells you to come to your own conclusions in the literature. You don't think you're an alcoholic? Try some controlled drinking. Have a hard time with the god thing? Believe in your own conception whatever it may be or don't. (I don't) Even in the steps step 3 made a decision it doesn't say that your decision has to be yes. I've been told that sometimes that decision is no and you just move on. .Everyone works it there own way. I appreciate that. And AA is the only place that I've ever gone where I've actually felt like I had a place. .
There is a counter site called Green Papers. Basically it would be near impossible to do a statistical analysis on any program. If you really want to investigate alternatives I would recommend the book Sober for Good which looks at the many ways that successfully sober people used to get that way. 
AA worked for me - I was not an easy nut to crack...It does not work for everybody - if you aren't ready/ don't want to quit  for example...AA is far from perfect but it is amazing to sit in a room and realize most of us would have been dead years ago.  I did a rough calculation at my sat meeting - 40 people. Maybe 350 years sobriety. Range 6 days to 35 years...About the cerebral person thing - been there done that.  I can overthink with the best of them.  PhD in rationalization...**AA says it is a simple program for complicated people.**..AA has the advantage of being almost everywhere and where I am it is not particularly religious and tolerates openly agnostic members just as I tolerate those who talk of prayer..."Don't tell me what to do" is my mantra. Don't think I would have lasted this long in a cult.  But note: individual meetings can vary and there are assholes among us some of whom think they are pretty special.  Run into one of them and your perception will be warped.
I applaud your inquisitiveness.  There have been many similar posts in this sub on this topic from whch you may gain some additional information.  I have not yet read the Orange Papers but am currently reading [More Revealed](http://morerevealed.com/mr/table-of-contents.html).  When reading such documents or getting direct opinions I suggest keeping an eye open for axes to grind (from all parties).  FWIW I don't detect many axes in M.R. so far.  ..
Be forewarned that this is a longish post...I have been posting on this reddit for a little while and have explicitly stated the difficulties I have with AA.  .  .&gt;the process just does not work and alluded to studies indicating this.  .  .This is a tricky statement.  What does *work* mean in the context of AA.  For many it is as simple as ensuring that they do not pick up a drink that day.  For some it means that they have contented sobriety. For others it is the fulfillment of *The Promises*. .  .I have no question that AA seems to achieve these aims for some people. My difficulty is in why it produces those results.  I think that the support network the notion of being accountable for not drinking (in a loose sense) to someone other than yourself the talk therapy of fellowship/sharing and finally the introspection that *The Steps* provide are what really drives the program. All of these can be accomplished outside of AA.  Additionally non 12-step groups usually drop the whole spiritual notion.  ..&gt;There is too much emphasis placed on negativity of the individual (you are a horrible alcoholic and that's all you will ever be UNLESS you do this). The whole natures of the shares are just constant reinforcement of the negativity.  .  .This is definitely a large problem.  AA promotes (and I use that word deliberately) the notion that Alcoholism is a disease.  This notion has permeated a great many levels of the recovery movement.  However this is not as open and shut as it appears.  See this [link](http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/Controversies/Is-Alcoholism-a-Disease.html) for another point of view.  .  .The whole notion of powerlessness coupled with *one drink is too many a thousand not enough* creates a way for alcoholics to avoid responsibility for their current condition.  It seems to state that "Oh I'm an alcoholic because I have an *allergy" or a disease. I was just born that way.  .  .This may make it easier for the recovering alcoholic to begin their recovery without personal self-loathing.  However I am not sure that simply stating that you are an alcoholic because of the length and amount of your drinking the amount of damage you have done socially and personally and your own failure to modify this behaviour would not be just as good. It might sting but it might be closer to the truth.  .  .&gt;The group is akin to a cult. Where if you find ways that help you resolve your drinking you were not a "true" alcoholic. If you fail and relapse you obviously weren't following the program well enough. Etc etc. I actually can relate to this a bit it can feel quite cult like at times  .  .There are definite cult like aspects to the program. I speak from experience as I spent 2 years in my late teens involved with Scientology.  I am fully cognizant of how cults operate.  .  .I have found two elements in AA that are common to all cults.  The first is the way that language is used. We see this in the appropriation of a term to fit the ideology.  In AA the term alcoholic holds special status. An alcoholic is someone who cannot control their drinking once they start.  Conversely there is the notion that if you manage to get sober using another method then perhaps you were not really an alcoholic.  It takes the term and gives it new boundaries that are specific to AA.  .  .The other common element in cults is that they internally define what *works* and what doesn't.  Success is often just a simple  declarative (i.e. I've been in the program for a month and I've not been drinking and feel better).  There is almost no external verification involved nor are there any objective benchmarks (non-AA defined) that can be studied.  .  .Conversely any failure is laid at the feet of the alcoholic.  The alcoholic failed to get a sponsor did not go to enough meetings did not thoroughly work the steps etc.  There is *never* any sense that perhaps the steps or AA itself is flawed.  The hostility that often accompanies those who **openly** criticize the program (especially during sharing) points to the *infallible* status of AA's methods and literature (Big Book 12 and 12).  .  .Please note I am *not* saying that AA is a cult.  However I have experienced subtle coercion that leads one to the conformity of the message that is presented at almost all meetings.  ..Finally I think that **all** alcohol recovery methods should be subject to scrutiny. There are billions of dollars spent annually around the world to deal with the problem of alcohol.  There is the rationale that "any treatment is better than no treatment". This is coupled with the social invocation that alcoholics *must* be treated for their addiction.  This is seen as a social good for the alcoholic those whom the alcoholic touches and the public good both fiscally and socially.  .  .Please note that I understand that this reddit is for those of us who wish to stop drinking. It is a valuable resource and support.  However this desire does not mean an abandonment of critical awareness.  ..There is no one solution and some may seemingly provide barriers to those wishing to stop drinking.  .  .If you wish to go to AA then go to a few meetings.  If it does not seem appropriate for you or that you are having negative reactions that might be interfering with your continued sobriety then check out other alternatives.  We are fortunate that there have been a great number of people who have recognized the need for alternatives. They took risk often against the prevailing wisdom and provided structures and methods for other alcoholics to follow.  .  .I applaud your willingness to examine all options. I sincerely hope that you will find the necessary supports and resources that will allow you long term sobriety.......  
I don't think it will make a blind bit of difference to your friend what ever you tell him. Spiritual growth comes from within not from without. All I know is that I'm not God and Spiritual growth keeps me sober  - I can't speak for anyone else and can't pursuade anyone else to think like me all I can do is be a good example of sober living. Maybe the best thing you can do for your friend is be a good example to...Good luck. - Couple of good books you might want to read as a Cerebral person - "Not God" and "Spirituality of Imperfection" both by Ernest Kurtz. 
I can't really speak to AA as I have not attended a meeting but it works for some people and that's great.  If you're looking for an alternative that's still group-oriented there's SMART (http://www.smartrecovery.org) which has materials online and both IRL and online meetings.  Some people have had success by reading Carr's Easy Way to Control Alcohol (located in sidebar).

For two years AA was my rock. I went to meetings at least once a day and usually twice. That was what I needed then: a rigorous step by step course to follow. I needed to be held accountable and have that support and even peer pressure...I couldn't have gotten sober without AA...That said after about 2 1/2 years I noticed that meetings were bringing me down; I felt worse after meetings instead of better. It wasn't because of any of the above reasons though. Honestly it just hurt too much to see people go in and out...I had sponsees but I wanted to help everyone and I couldn't. I was being drained instead of filled...I haven't been to a meeting in several years now but I also have not had or wanted to have a drink. It was AA that put me in the right place. Now I have to stay here. BUT I NEEDED IT FIRST...And if I do find myself having a rough time I'll go to a meeting. It's like putting my brain on "reset." I am not against AA and I would never tell anyone not to attend a meeting. It took those years in AA to find out what to do and I couldn't do it otherwise.
