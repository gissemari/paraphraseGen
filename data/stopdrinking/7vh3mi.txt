I'm trying to figure out exactly how to say what I want to say and frankly to figure out if it even matters...Do any of you have experiences with a loved one who have weird perceptions about addiction or abuse because of their past experiences with another loved one who struggled with drug or alcohol abuse/addiction?..My wife's parents have both struggled with addiction. Her mom is an active alcoholic and her father has struggled with cocaine and crack during her lifetime. Neither of her parents have ever sought treatment and its clear that their addictions have had negative impacts on their family. Her parents have long since divorced. Her siblings are more vocal about the negative impacts that their parents addictions have caused them. My wife doesnt really talk about it...I was talking with her about my sobriety the other day. Something I have been doing more frequently because there is a nagging feeling pulling at my consciousness all the time that my wife does not understand my sobriety why I got sober and why it is important to me. I was telling her about a tattoo idea I have and we got to talking about rock bottom. And she laughed at me and told me I had not hit a rock bottom. ..Right away I thought she was doing this to be mean but now I am starting to think- maybe- this wasn't meant to be an insult to me and it is more of a reflection on her experiences with addiction...Her parents once were really successful had nice jobs had a nice house in the suburbs and my wife and her brother and sister led pretty charmed lives. Now her dad lives in my basement and her mom lives with her new husband's mom. They both have okay jobs but no savings and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. ..I dont really know what this means. Is this a big deal? Is this something she needs to address or is it just something that belongs where my wife has kept it in the past?..My biggest worry is the threat to my own sobriety. I am worried that she will convince me at some point that my drinking wasn't "that bad" and I will relapse. ..I told her that rock bottom is where you choose to stop digging. When she laughed and told me that I dont know what rock bottom looks like I asked if she would rather that I find out before I chose to stop. She said no. Admittedly I am still hurt by this. I am grappling with why this even matters. I chose sobriety. I dont need to justify it to anyone else but me. I just hope I can always stay strong and vigilant and not succumb to the perception of others that my sobriety is an over reaction to something that was not serious.

What I have found is that there will be some things I feel and experience related to alcohol and the process of stopping drinking that I will not be able to get other people to understand they can't know what it means to me because they can't know what I felt. When it happens especially with my SO it can be difficult but I've learned to kind of think of it as something to be grateful for. I'm glad she can't understand the low I was at or the feeling of wanting to stop more than anything in the world but just can't do it and end up at the store buying more. I'm not sure how I would think about your particular situation but maybe that idea can help you I know that's tough and can feel like your struggles are being put down or made to seem little I think it's just that people try to relate things to what they know. 
Hey there! What you're saying about her reaction and family history makes sense. I know people who grew up in dysfunction and they think it's just the norm. Would your wife be open to going to al anon meetings? It may help her understand what you're going through a bit more.
