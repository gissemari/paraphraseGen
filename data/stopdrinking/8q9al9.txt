I was a heavy drinker on and off for seven years. Stopped a little over two weeks ago. My drinking was mostly driven by my social life and my social life often centered around drinking. The last few days I've been having dreams that I'm out drinking with friends and then I wake up and my first thought is "Shit! I did it again!" before realizing that it's just a dream. There's a strange part of me that feels like I relapsed due to having mentally given in in my dreams even though I didn't physically consume alcohol. Maybe that's a carryover from my religious upbringing when I would be shameful for even having dreams about sex. Anyone ever experienced something similar?

I'd be astonished if anyone *didn't* experience drinking dreams in the early days it's practically ubiquitous!..Check out [this entry in the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_does_anyone_else_have_dreams_about_drinking.3F) about it to set your mind at rest... it's nothing to worry about just one of those things that happens.....Keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I had one of these dreams the other night. Freaked me out so much that I woke up.
