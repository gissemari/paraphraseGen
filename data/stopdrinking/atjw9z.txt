Was talking to a colleague this morning and he said he's taking the day off because one of his closest friends of many decades took his own life out of the blue. Apparently he was an alcoholic and had relapsed. ..This poison is so insidious that it gets in our head and convinces us to keep taking it that its okay. I have been on the suicidal end of things many many times have acted on it when drunk..for whatever reason I am here today sober alive. I will not drink with you today. ..RIP fellow alcoholic. Fuck that poison and the tricks it plays on minds.  If you relapse I know and feel the pain of your guilt. Please reach out to another alcoholic in recovery. Life gets bearable and you are not alone.

It's a dark path being an addict/alcoholic. . I admit that I have thought about suicide on multiple occasions during my recovery but thankfully never followed through. ..IWNDWYT
