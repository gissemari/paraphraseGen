I relapsed AGAIN but I want a life - I am so unhappy when I drink and I cannot manage my own life. Today is day 1. I feel absolutely awful physically. I will not drink with you today.

Good luck friend! I am in your corner! You can do this! I won't be drinking with you today!

I will not drink with you tonight! 
Good luck and I hope you will feel better real soon! Sending you my love and support xx
I am going through exactly the same thing. Just a few days ahead of you and I can say I feel amazing! It's so worth the agony to come out on the other side feeling great. Congratulations!
You can do it. Nothing is ruined just jump back on the wagon.
