I just dont wanna be judged... I'm a severe alcoholic and I relapsed being thrown back into the restuarant industry made me drink again. ..Yesterday I vomited blood again. I'm not seeking help cause I have an underlying issue anyway (my stomach sphincter doesn't close so it causes fluid to travel back into my esophagus cause I was born 6 weeks prematurely) to me it's like a nosebleed. It happens but if it continues then it makes it a real problem and I will seek emergency care....Tomorrow I go on a big 3 day adventure. I'm scared I will have issues that alcohol won't be able to cure. ..I'm on the path to quitting. But the detox will immobilize me for a week. I can't do that at this moment. I have to drink or I have to quit work (the industry is very strict) and I have to pay my bills or be homeless. Clearly I have to stay functional and work. I have so much to deal with.. I know this is a deadly habit. I just wanted to share it cause I cant tell anyone in my life :/..

The taper method works for a lot of people who are unable to stop due to life situations such as yours. I've done it myself. It take a conscious effort to systematically cut back on the amount you consume however I found it to work for me when going back to rehab was not an option...You're not without aid in quitting drinking you are your best resource. When I did the taper I made a plan and stuck to it. It was hard and at times discouraging because I was still drinking on a daily basis however it eased me back to a normal state and I was able to readjust my life (again) to keep full on relase a non option.
Love brkwake's post! I've heard substance abuse is a huge problem in service industries. You can do this!!! IWNDWYT 
Glad you're here...My mind lies to me.  ..Regularly...It says "you can do either 'X' or you can do 'Y' ".  ..It presents me with a dichotomy.  Choose between **only** two things....    ..That's a lie...There are always more than two choices...Here's what I see:.."I want to quit **BUT** detox will immobilize me".."I have to drink **OR** I have to quit work".."I have to pay bills **OR** be homeless"..Based on these logics there's only one path  -  drink so I can work so I can pay bills and have a place to live...Are those the only two choices in each dichotomy?  ..I think not...There are infinite options for each of the 3 "dilemmas" that your mind has constructed...Can you think of some?
