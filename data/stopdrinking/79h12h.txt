Hi all. First time posting here. I have 5 years sobriety and go to meetings once a week. My sponsor who I've had the whole time has stopped going to meetings and we are more friends now. I'm struggling because I know I'm not spiritually fit right now and want to reconnect with the program more. My plan is to up my meetings and I've been considering getting a new sponsor or a sponsee. Every time I go to her with something AA related she answers and then moves on. No greater conversations or inquiry. I can't figure out if it's me or that I need something more... thoughts and experiences. I won't drink today!!

I think you've answered your own question. You want a sponsor who is capable of having deep conversations about sobriety but your sponsor prefers to give brief answers then move on. She may not be a bad sponsor for someone else but it seems she is not the right sponsor for you.
I'm not the same person I was 5 years ago. I've found that different people come in an out of my life to teach me different lessons. I keep them as friends just sometimes not as close. Great job on the time.
Hmmmm.  .Sounds like an outgrow to me..Meaning - I think you have outgrown your.sponsor yes. .You can with love find a new one and let this one.just be a friend...Sounds like you are serious about advocating for .growth in your sobriety and I think you called.this one correctly...Just my 2 cents...Keep close - run in the middle of the pack..I know I am!   And keep posting :)..
