At 28 years old I have struggled with alcoholism at this point for so long that I can't really remember it not being a problem. I started drinking as an early teen partially to cope with problems at home partially to drown out some surgical stuff I was going through and I wonder now if partially because of my genetics as I'm 3/4 Naive American adopted off of a reservation...With that pity party out of the way let me also day I have spent the last ten years fully and terribly aware I had a problem. I quit drinking after being arrested on my twenty first birthday. That quit may have lasted a few weeks...Fast forward a few years to twenty seven. A semi functional alcoholic who had tried on and off for years too finally give it up. Engaged to literally the perfect person for me. We've been through hell together for over two years and I love her even more now than when we met...I gave it up for a little over four months to be my best for her for me for us. Four of the best in my life. I really thought I had it kicked or at least was well on my way. Then I crashed...Doesn't really matter why now. Life stuff. ..I crashed hard and spent the last three months really spiraling down. Smoking heavy drinking heavy but with no joy. Feeling like shit with every sip hating myself for drinking while I bought the bottle. ..Then I got sick. Really sick. Almost died from pneumonia after a stupid injury. It's been five days since I had a drink only because I've been too fucking sick to go get booze...But I realized today it's a gift. A huge gift. This put a full stop to my shitty self destructive behavior and it got me five days under my belt grudging or not...I'm not letting this go. This one almost got me and the next one.... I don't want there to be a next one. So today I will not drink. And tomorrow I'm thinking that's a good plan to stick with...Thanks for being here SD. I've mostly just lurked until now but this sub has been a huge inspiration. Thanks today for letting me vent.

Glad you are with us and still alive.  Some don't make it back.  I'm glad you see this as a gift and hope you make the most of it.  What's your next step?
But what about dealing with alcohol?
