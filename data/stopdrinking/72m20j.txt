So I finally got a badge! It took some time because I didn t trust myself or find myself "worthy" if that makes any sense. After lurking I ve been participating for two and a half months now and during that time I ve met more support and understanding than during the ten years that I ve been struggling on and off with drinking. Thank you every single SDer for making this community what it is!

I have also got my day one smiley and yes it feels great :).I will not drink with you today.
Hey SaintHomer you've written some things here I've found very helpful. Glad you're here now "officially!"..This may sound funny but while I don't ever want to repeat my first week of not drinking I nonetheless miss the smiley-faced badge a little. It's so friendly! I just can't stay mad whenever I see it...I won't drink with you today. Keep on keeping on!
I got my smiley too! Smiley bros :D Let's do this thing.
