Drinking was (sometimes) enjoyable in the moment and in the short term it seemed to relieve some of my anxiety and depression. ..However over time it was one step forward and two steps back. ..Lately I've been battling anxiety depression and other negative feelings.  Sometimes they make me want to drink. ..However drinking is a net loss and it's not going to make a single thing in my life better. It will only delay my need to deal with reality. ..I'm here. I'm sober. I'm feeling all the feelings. I'm struggling. I'm grateful. ..IWNDWYT

Nurture your new life. Treat it as you would your child to protect and defend from toxic influences.
