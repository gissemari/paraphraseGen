Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! The week is half way over although if you're in US you might be looking at a [long weekend](http://i.imgur.com/18Vron9.jpg).  It's going to be [Thanksgiving](http://i.imgur.com/vpMPHCh.png) pretty soon here.  And if [turkey](http://i.imgur.com/TkW9UKp.jpg) is not your thing I hope you have [fun](http://i.imgur.com/v5i1MaA.jpg) however you [celebrate](http://i.imgur.com/JgW6b52.jpg). ..Whoo! WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** I have been very proactive this last week.  It's been very busy rough and bumpy lately.  By being assertive when issues arise I've found I experience less anxiety than my usual route of avoid and isolate.  Particularly I'm being more assertive about seeking out new job opportunities and even if these opportunities don't pan out I'm getting the ball rolling and that feels great.    ..**Struggle:**  While I am seeking new opportunities I have to keep up a good face at my other two jobs.  I have been feeling stagnant and stale in my positions for a while and the stress of one job is really running high due to holidays and winter sickness and all the fun stuff that comes with direct service work.  After work tonight I had the passing thought of  I NEED a drink  but of course drinking does not make what causes the stress go away. I'm going to try and stay positive and use my dissatisfaction as a motivator for some much needed change in my life.  ..**General Chat:** Holiday or weekend plans?  What's coming up for you?  I do have to work through the weekend but I'm also attending a dinner with my partner.  I haven't met their family yet not sure what to expect and it's causing me a bit of anxiety.  I haven't had to navigate another's family gathering in a long while.  Whether the meal turns out [wonderful](http://i.imgur.com/ZJJmuHo.jpg) or [not quite so wonderful](http://i.imgur.com/ABJM3Pt.png) I'm thankful to spend time with someone I really care about.

Thanks.  Today is my quit day.  I've been spying on you all picking up some great gems of knowledge.  Yesterday I was terrified but today I am excited. 
Lovely and this Thanksgiving I have so much to be grateful for especially this community.
Triumph: had a real break through in my improvisation class this week..Struggle: started to KonMari the house the chaos is ridiculous...General chat: I get to see my brother this weekend! Excited! He lives interstate so it's a real treat.
**Triumph**: I am getting back on board with active recovery through reading and self-reflection. I was starting to self-medicate with food instead of booze and realized that every time I feel an urge to avoid my life it's an opportunity to stay still and listen to my needs giving me that growth imperative to changing my life for the better...**Struggle**: I'm still struggling to really find connection in the recovery community. I think I'm too impatient and not giving enough of myself. I want new friends who inspire me RIGHT NOW. ..**Chat**: Looking forward to visiting Seattle for the first time and meeting up with my cousins to celebrate Thanksgiving. We've never done this before and are excited to have fun together as adults. I'm excited to just get out of town for a bit. New sights yay! Good luck with the family gathering. I haven't had to navigate that for a while either. Happy Thanksgiving! I am grateful for your continuation of this post /u/pandapuddles!
How does everyone work so hard all the time? I just want to give up.
Things are going pretty good right now. That's certainly a triumph but also a struggle. Little stuff seems so much bigger and its easy to focus on that and miss everything else...Have a great holiday if you're celebrating!
Triumph: I'm powering through the last couple of weeks of classes regardless of the complete lack of interest/motivation. In the past I would have just dropped the classes with a plan to retake them later- sober me realizes my transcript doesn't deserve that beating and at 28 I don't really have a "later" I'm already past my prime haha. ..Struggle: Cravings have come back and it's getting a little harder to play that tape forward. I have not asked my husband to pick up wine on his way home but I've almost been tempted to by my own thoughts. I plan on getting back to a healthier lifestyle and am already working on getting my sleep schedule back on track since the cravings often come late at night. ..General Chat: I don't really have holiday plans other than to wrap some papers up and study for finals since my spouse will be working every other day of the week/weekend. I'm sure TG day I'll do crafts with my kid while my husband cooks something but we're not planning anything with the rest of the family or going all out with the food this year. I hope everyone else's week whether they celebrate or not is a great one!
Triumph:  I have been social in ways I have never imagined possible.  Making so many friends in recovery this week (esp the weekend) whereas before I would be drinking at home hating everyone (esp hating people in recovery :) )..Struggle:  I saw an ex gf that I lost because of my drinking.  She distanced herself from me because of the toxic world that I created around me with alcohol.  Lot's of heartache :(..Chat:  Canada here so Thanksgiving already done.  Going to enjoy the recent snowfall up north...Happy 24 everyone!
**Triumph**: Successfully fought off invitations to drink pitchers of sangria at lunch this weekend. ..**Struggle**: Work is stressful. I used to enjoy drinking to forget but now I struggle with remembering every detail of my work life at home all the time...**General Chat**: I will be spending Thanksgiving with my family. It is our first Thanksgiving without my mom and I've already been feeling more sad over the last few weeks just thinking about the holidays without her. At least I know I won't have an embarrassing breakdown due to too much wine. If I do it will be raw emotion which is good I think.
I love this.....**Triumph:** I've stayed sober for one week. not a single panic attack sleepless night or hangover in sight. huzzah!!! it is painfully obvious how drinking exacerbates my anxiety. ..**Struggle:** during the eight years we've been together my husband and I have loved to go on date nights to our local sushi joint - we always share draft Sapporo and hot sake then walk home with that lovely warm belly and buzz giddy like teenagers in love. we're traveling to Japan in three weeks for our honeymoon. I'm so excited but also having a really hard time visualizing what this is going to look like in sobriety. I feel like we're losing a small piece of our ritual. it really isn't the end of the world and I'll be fine but I'm sad about it. trying to stay in today and not project into the future...**Chat:** because I have bad anxiety around travel and crowds (pray for me in Tokyo) I always fly to my parents' in San Diego on Thanksgiving day and back home on Monday. the airports are waaayyyy less crowded. it doesn't really matter when we eat so my family has our big Thanksgiving dinner on Friday instead. just this small shift in schedule makes the trip and our moods much lighter. highly recommended :) ..hope you all have a beautiful holiday! 
Triumph: for the first time ever I'm cooking the bird for my family. I was able to buy it and all the ingredients and start making some side dishes. Being the only one in the family that can actually cook I don't know why they never asked me to do it before. I never wanted to because thanksgiving and Xmas were both days that I was extremely hung over. Tomorrow morning I'm getting up at 7 am and headed to my aunts house to start helping with the preparations. ..Struggle: fucking Reynolds plastic turkey bags. 25 pounds my ass. I bought a box with two bags in it to brine my turkey in. The first bag ripped  when I poured the brine in it. The second one was already torn on both sides when I pulled it out of the box. So back to the grocery store where those are the only bags that could actually fit a turkey in it. So double bagged in a stock pot with the turkey placed very gently into it and the brine poured very slowly and I finally have a turkey thats brining. 
triumph: last night was the first time being around everybody enjoying beer and offering it to me. I honestly had no real urge to partake. ..Struggle: haven't been able to focus as much at work as I did last week. It was almost like I had a sort of manic energy. It's probably just the long weekend looming but the motivation is just not there to stay super busy...General: looking forward to overeating and relaxing all weekend. 
Can't wait to wake up tomorrow NOT hungover and watch the parade and help cook dinner! 
Hey what's up?..Triump:.Today's my 2 week milestone. I have been SO Productive this last week.  At work and at home. It's friggin amazing. ..With feeling productive comes a big boost in feeling some Self Worth...Thanksgiving coming up..i'm the designated driver home (2 hours highway) so I'll be dry!...
