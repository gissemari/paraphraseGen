I had my third relapse dream the other night but this one was different than the last two...The last two I woke up thinking "oh no what did I do?" And coming to the realization that I didn't drink and it wasn't real...The other night the dream kept going. It included all of me drinking then going to sleep waking up feeling pissed then hopping back on the horse not drinking that day...It felt so different waking up with confidence instead of fear and that sense of you got this. Just thought I'd share

Sounds like your dream was a sign of being at ease with yourself. 
I've been sober for 4 years and I still have those.  If fact I had one last night where I was hungover in my dream and woke up actually feeling hung over for about a minute...Crazy how the brain can do that to you.
