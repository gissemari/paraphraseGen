I know I have a problem. I've tried to stop before made it months so I can say to myself I've been "successful"...&amp;#x200B;..But since I keep relapsing I know I need some help. I've tried online therapy (face to face isn't feasible with my current situation).  I've (sort of) talked with my wife but only while drinking. Once I stop i clam up. Lately I tried the /stopdrinking online chat and some aa-online chat but both have rules about only participating while sober so I left...&amp;#x200B;..Has anyone else faced the same? Any ideas? Thanks for your help...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;

Just gotta stick with it man - usually a catastrophic event inspires people to go the distance in quitting
Take a bunch of notes when you've been drinking. Write down your biggest fears and concerns and things you want to improve....why you want a change...Then read it to whomever you are trying to seek help from when you're not under the influence. It'll not only remind you why you want to stop it'll give you less of a chance to push it off to the side as "eh maybe I was overreacting because I was drunk."..I had a similar thing with therapy/depression. By the time my face to face session would roll around I'd have made it through the week and felt less overwhelmed so it was hard to put myself back in the spot where everything felt so heavy. I took some notes at my lowest points and that ended up being a good jumping off point...Just a suggestion.
Reading and writing really helped me.  I am not so great at in person communication though I'm working at that.  I've come to discover that it seems that I'm better at communicating with *myself* by writing too.  I write down my goals the what the how the why.  I read a lot too. Memoirs articles blogs. *This Naked Mind* was a very helpful book for me.  
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post.
