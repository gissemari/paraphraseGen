I see so many of you struggling with your addiction and I wonder how do you feel about religions such as Islam and Judaism and their strict restrictions on alcohol? Do you feel there is any wisdom behind this? Also im not here to impose religon onto you guys just interested in hearing your take on it. Peace

I appreciate the poetry. I don't have to a believer to find beauty in religious texts. Change however has to come from the inside and shall not be forced upon.
That is a really interesting question! What pain might have been spared so many if we'd paid attention to these warnings. And I believe religious texts can foster change from within.
After working in over 30 countries I can say that people will find a way to drink regardless of what the prevailing religion says about it. Also I believe in the idea that the easiest way to generate interest in something is to make it taboo. 
Do Islam and Judaism help you not drink?
Am not a member of any religion - try not to judge.
I think if you replace the word alcohol with the word cocaine or marijuana in any conversation you have about why the drug alcohol should be a legal drug you will see the glaring bullsh** we tell ourselves about the drug alcohol much more clearly.
