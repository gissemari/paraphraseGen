Hey friends! So I'm on day 3 of sobriety and I am starting to really struggle. I've been smoking the ole' ganja to alleviate boredom and kill anxiety while I go through this phase but I don't really want to do that tonight. ..I'm dealing with a lot of anger and boredom right now; I can't be around people because I get sick of them really quickly but everything is so uninteresting without alcohol. I'm fighting the urge but I'm just so angry and struggling to get through the day. ..The shakes are continuing a little but physical symptoms have mostly stopped. Any advice on how I can get through today?

I'm on day 3 too and the boredom is brutal. I'm going to lift weights and try to tire myself out. ..I'm just remembering that being hammered is worse than being bored. 
I found the first day and the third day to be the hardest thus far. The fourth day was strangely calm. I think I took 3 hot showers and watched mindless shows on Netflix to get through. Put the third day behind you and you won't have to do it again. By day 6 the thought of drinking was out of my mind for the most part (but that carries it's own dangers). 
STAY BUSY!  This will be my motto tonight as I wrap up day 3.  My plan is to help kids with homework do not go to brewery fix dinner do not go to brewery take the girls xmas shopping do not stop at brewery on way home wrap gifts brewery is closed so don't go to walgreens for wine girls to bed binge watch shameless. STAY BUSY!
I have to same problem. I lost my job and my broke up with my girlfriend.  I moved to a new city and am bored out of my mind.  It's tough. I AM A HERMIT CREATURE NOW!.
Stay hydrated eat well and try to sleep. For me it took a good couple weeks to start feeling normal again.
