----------immediate responses--------

I know a lot about it. ...it's the path I chose to sobriety. ...it works...
I have never heard of it.  Right now I am doing nothing but hesitant to go to AA.  The book is called Rational Recovery?  Who is the author?
I have heard of it and visited the website..I actually want to discover more about it but simply forgot..I guess I will get the book..Thanks for reminding me!
Rational recovery is a for-profit outfit run by a guy by the name of Jack Trimpey. Together with several others they formed a secular support group back in the early 90s. However jack and the others disagreed about whether the new enterprise should be a charity or a for-profit business and the group split in two. Jack kept Rational Recovery and the others formed SMART Recovery...SMART is a secular science based nonprofit (free meetings) with nearly 2500 meetings every week and something like 30 online. I am a facilitator for SMART and love the program. If you like Rational Recovery you might want to check out SMART--RR has no meetings only the books and I think he sells dvds too.
