So I stayed sober Saturday night and went to my first aa meeting Sunday morning at the beach. ..When I arrived I was seriously considering just walking away. I mean I don't know any of these people they probably have it worse than I do what if someone recognizes me? These were just a few thoughts racing through my mind. Eventually I said fuck it I walked 3 miles to get here let me see what it has to offer and if it's weird I'll never come back. ..I was surprised to see people my age with alcohol/addict issues but it was comforting at the same time. I honestly hated saying "Hi my name is beckbristow89 I'm an alcoholic". But after everyone said this line so many times it gets easier to accept. ..Everyone had really interesting stories and spoke briefly. I really enjoyed this part of the meeting. The prayers were weird (I didn't know any of them) and holding hands was also odd. ..By the end of the session I felt better knowing there were people who had dealt with darker demons than I had to deal with. Some older couples approached me and told me that they wish they started coming to AA at my age because they wouldn't have wasted so many years on alcohol. Overall I'm glad I went and I'll be going back next weekend. I can't say for certain that it's something I'll do every single weekend but it's a start. ..Just a note to everyone. Before going to a meeting I thought I would be the youngest person in the group (26) I thought it would be an embarrassing ordeal and that I would be a complete misfit.  Needless to say I really didn't want to go at all. After 6 months of staying sober and eventually relapsing I came back to this subreddit and someone asked  "okay what are you going to do differently this time?" I urge anyone who's had a similar problem quitting alone to try something different and check out a meeting...I want to thank everyone here for inspiring me to go to a meeting and for being so positive. ..Edit: I'm also not 100% sure about how to get a sponsor. I think they might have mentioned it at the end but I have no idea how that works at all.

How to get a sponsor: Hearing something someone says in a meeting and you can relate. Ask them to be your sponsor. You now have a sponsor. I got sober at 25 who cares if you're the youngest in the meeting? I love it I didn't have to waste so many years of my life. You stick around this program and work these steps and life can get pretty amazing!
I was kind of weird to get a sponsor that was a lot older then me I told that to another guy i go to meetings with and he said he would be mine.  It's been a short amount of time but we try to go to atleast one meeting together sometimes two.  Chat on the phone and work the steps.  It's nice because we have a good amount of stuff in common.  Find a sponsor who can be your mentor.
