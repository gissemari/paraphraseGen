Coinciding with my divorce surely helps the association but my quitting alcohol is eerily similar to a heartache after a breakup.  People have mentioned things like actual withdrawal from oxytocin during breakups which makes a lot of sense to us drug addicts. ..The early stages intense cravings begging and pleading to do anything to have them back even though it's not meant to be(relapse) falsely promising to change (illusion of moderation?) intensely mood swinging from positivity and crying(I had a lot of bipolar depression and mania for a while still slightly do) seeing your ex  move on so easily it seems unfair(other people enjoying alcohol responsibly) and then the slow burn as days go by and your heart aches a little less (cease of withdrawals lessened cravings) until eventually you don't check your social media to stalk your ex you go days without thinking of them (stop counting sober days)...I still miss my wife(more so the facade she provided). I still miss alcohol (another facade it wasn't the booze making me happy) But not nearly as fucking much as over a year ago and when they come those feelings pass easily without anxiety or tears no dwelling or depression at whats lost. Nothing more than remembering an old friend in school you lost touch with or a pet that passed long ago. . .TL;DR Early sobriety is hard early on post-breakups are hard. You can do it. We've all survived breakups and moved on and you can move on from your marriage to alcohol too. ..Happy new year if you stop today you can basically watch the world celebrate your year of sobriety next January :).

I too have made the comparison with a breakup (for me with an abusive girlfriend) but never a so detailed analysis. Great points!! I will not drink with you today :)
