I definitely knew that I was drinking to numb out and escape. Now I am starting to realize the extent and I know I need to feel the things and find better ways to cope but wow is it scary! I'm having a hard time because I expected more support from my husband but it is something either he can't or won't give. Best case scenario is that he just doesn't "get it" as he can have a beer or two and stop. Worst case is that he isn't willing to support me in the ways I need. I feel like it's the latter; when I started to open up to him about my drinking his response was basically "well its your thing so you need to take care of it". Even though I am struggling today I will not drink it will not make anything any better!

I learned that I shouldn't look to those I had harmed for support...I went to meetings and got tools and support!
I actually feel the same way with my wife. ..No one gets it other than other people who've gone/going through it...I do it solely for ME and the benefits radiate to everyone around me all by itself. That's how I look at it anyway.
