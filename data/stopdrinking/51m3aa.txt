Tell me to exercise some control. .Look at me and alcohol. .I mean holy mackerel. .Assaulted me both blistering and tactical. .Expecting me to be sober .Simply stopped being practical. .Soul gave up and went on sabbatical. .Tell me this is barely factual. .What the hell is that about. .End results are tantamount. .Can no longer simply stand around.Arms behind my back tied abound..In solitaire my breath the only sound. .A Viking ship in flames. .I guess I'm gonna drown.  .With this ship .at least I never took one more sip. .Impair my judgement. .Fuck you alcohol. ..Jason (5 years sober in March :))
