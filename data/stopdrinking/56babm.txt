Let's look on the bright side...* I've been sober 12 of the last 14 days. That is HUGE progress for me. I can't undo the relapses but I can celebrate and appreciate the 12 days. .* Today's hangover sucks but I know it will be the last one. I'm determined to never go through this again. .* I've faced a few of the problems I've been ignoring. There's still plenty more to work on but I feel less stressed about the things I have managed to deal with and I feel like I can stay on top of those things going forward. I also know the rest will get addressed in time..* My dog is much happier getting the attention and exercise she needs. .* I've lost 6 pounds and saved close to  100 by not buying my typical amounts of wine and spirits. .* Overall I've made a lot more good decisions than bad ones. A couple of bad nights doesn't get to take that away from me. .* I still have faith I can do this. I'm not giving up...Anyway onwards and upwards. Cheers to not drinking!

Keep the faith. Will not drink with you today.
You got this! One day at a time. 
Totally identify! Before my current stretch i did 6 days followed by a big night out. I actually considered it big progress because I had a huge hangover after 10 drinks. It was progress because for the previous 2 months I was so drunk every day that 10 drinks wouldn't even give me a hangover. One day at a time you got this!
Spot on!!!!
