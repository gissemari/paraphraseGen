Good evening SDers! Haven't posted for a few days but I'm still going strong on my sobriety journey. It's been three weeks since my last alcoholic drink so tomorrow will mark three weeks sober. I've done 23 meetings and it's been great I've met so many amazing people and to be honest I feel like I've come home. Like AA is what I have been meant to do all along. I'm not gonna lie though I'm bloody tired! But it's keeping me going with the not drinking so I'm determined to get my 90 meetings in 90 days done which is what the recommend. I also met with a sponsor yesterday and we have agreed she's going to take me through the 12 steps so i'm really looking forward to it. I feel like i'm floating off my 'pink cloud' a little bit as time is going on and while I still don't WANT to drink the urges are creeping in here and there so I think for me i need to start the steps asap and do the work to ensure i don't relapse. I also need to come on here a bit more again too as this community has helped me so very much and it's amazing how the cravings came on when I didn't post for a bit the support from all of you is immeasurable xx...I'm really proud of myself for what I've achieved over the last three weeks and I cannot remember the last time I felt proud of myself for ANYTHING. Long may it continue! ..IWNDWYT xxx
