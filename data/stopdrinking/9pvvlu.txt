A day at a time simply. That's it...I feel as though it's gotten a bit easier although as I commented on the daily check in this morning I did really have to fight an urge to have a drink with dinner last night. I don't regularly check in here and wouldn't have even noticed I'm at 1000 days if I hadn't posted about that struggle...I'm sober with you all today and grateful I've made it to this milestone!..Enjoy your day!

# Congrats  [u/Done2016v2](https://www.reddit.com/user/Done2016v2)!..# ..# I agree quitting drinking is by far the best decision I ever made in my 55 years around the sun...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..  FTZ!
Well done! I wonder if the urges EVER disappear??.
Congratulations on your daily success story winning. 
Congratulations! That's a lot of sober days :). I posted on this board earlier and noticed 726 days by my name. I immediately thought that was wrong (too high a number). Then I remembered that my two-year anniversary is coming up and did the math. ..I will not drink with you today. 
You are ascending!
Well done my friend...Here a little celebration. ..                                        ..Hang in. And yes it does over time get easier. However I believe if there is 1 thing worse than hard times for us. It is good times. ..When we struggle we are aware and fighting. Easy times we let our guard down...Take a cricket team. They are on last day need 250 runs. They will come out fighting and may win...Same team. Need only 50 runs. Easy done. Come out relaxed. Before they know it they have lost 6 wickets. Down to tail lenders and need 35 runs. They loose...You are a winner. Hang in.  ..1 day at a time is my corner stone. ..Just for today I will be sober with you. ..Your Friend John         
Congrats!
I envy you...amazing
