Hi. I'm a 29 year old male and have attempted to quit drinking several times before. The longest I ever went was 9 months and I felt great. My biggest issue is how self-sabotaging drinking is for me. Every time I go out I drink far too much and make poor decisions such as using drugs. And it's never just one night. The way my drinking is patterned involves binge drinking for at least 3 days consecutively. I struggle with depression and anxiety issues which are all aggravated after a weekend bender. Sometimes though alcohol is the only way I know how to cope with my emotions. My goal is to be 6 months sober by my 30th birthday and I know it's going to be hard but hopefully I can get some support through this community. I really just want to reach my optimal self once again and rid myself of the poor reputation that drinking has given me.
