Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Guess what day it is? [GUESS GUESS GUESS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc6WDloo-Qo)!!..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I'm rocking my health and fitness game this week. I'm feeling a little off-kilter about other stuff (see below) and it's like my brain knows that keeping up with exercise and healthy behaviors will keep me strong and balanced. Being fit and exercising has so many tangible emotional and visual benefits and I'm enjoying the hell out of all of them. ..**Struggle**: Some things from my drinking past are reaching out to try and poke their stupid pointy fingers into my current and happy life. It's really been bugging me and I'm starting to think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm slowly coming up on my one-year anniversary. For most people this would be an awesome and happy occasion but for me it's pregnant with sadness and shame because I've been there before and relapsed terribly on day 366. I'm scared about it and I'm afraid it's just going to get worse in the next month and a half. I know I'm probably assigning it too much meaning but either way it's affecting me and I don't like it. ..**General Chat**: Let's help the white belts out with some Tips for Summer Sobriety!(TM) How do you get through vacations family picnics barbecues pool days and beach trips sober? I like to be the person who bring the new-to-you and fancy fizzy soda waters. I also have no qualms about getting up and walking away from situations for a bit if that's what I need to do. Do you have events coming up? What's your plan for enjoying them sober? ..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**triumph** I'm alive...**struggle** school is ridiculous. Can't get to the gym as much. Leg is fucked from running in bad shoes. Fighting in my class...**general chat** let me be enough.
**triumph:** I'm sober - over 9 months sober.  What the actual fuck?  That's a full term pregnancy.  ..**struggle:** Drama drama drama drama drama at work.  Lots of bad shit going down.  The negative and pessimistic narcissistic side of me is in a bad place right now.  I always feel like I am "due" for one of those "Oh hey life gets shitty when you're sober and you have to deal with it sober" moments and I don't know what I would do if I were to lose my job.  Trying to just take this one day at time put one foot in front of the other work hard and do the best I ca and STAY OUT OF THE DRAMA AND GOSSIP...**general chat:** I hate the summer.  I know I am in the minority but fuck the heat fuck the humidity and fuck bugs.  
Triumph - felt like I had an awakening moment in the shower this morning where I realized how much time I'll gain by not drinking. Not just health but full days of sobriety that would have otherwise been a blur. ..Struggle - how will I explain to future dates that I don't drink? I don't want to scare them off by admitting I'm an alcoholic right off the bat but I don't want to lie either. ..General chat - raining in SF! We need it!
Triumph: Felt criticized by someone at work spoke up for myself &amp; felt better.  I am not always on the right side of 'speaking up' but this time it seemed to go ok. ..Struggle: hard time socializing.  I'm just not into the old ways of being which is good and bad. Trying to be patient with myself....as a shy person socializing is always hard. I invited a few people to come swim with me last night and nobody said yes to my invite so I just felt stupid/vulnerable for putting myself out there without success. ..General chat: Reading!! Which I had not been doing much of lately feels good to get immersed in a book. Just read "Mountains Beyond Mountains" nothing like reading about Haiti to put things in perspective in the U.S. Also love reading about someone who has such a passion for his work it's inspiring. I am about halfway through the Kite Runner ( interesting I've never read fiction set in Afghanistan before). Also picked up a couple books about creativity/personal skills since I'm feeling like I want some inspiration around both those topics.  ....
**Triumph:** - 6 days is the longest I've gone without drinking in probably 10 years! I feel like I've emerged from a big veg-out phase in my life...**Struggle:** - It's almost embarrassing to admit but quitting hasn't come with any significant challenges so far. I just feel better and get more done / have more fun. Will not let my guard down though...**General Chat:** - What do you all have going on this summer? My regional version of the burning man festival has been canceled due to permit woes with the county. Now I have some extra time and money I think a good long backpacking trip is in order..
**Triumph**: I am falling in love with running. ALSO I just now got back my grades from my first year at graduate school and I have a GPA that should put me in the top 10 of my class!! I can't believe how lucky I am considering I drank myself to sleep every single day. I am imagining what I can do sober...**Struggle**: My job is stressful as hell and its been busy. But I can't even manage to complain considering how great this week has been otherwise...**General Chat**: I cannot believe I managed to succeed -- even *excel* in school considering my habits. I drank 10-15 beers a day just to numb my brain and sedate myself. Sure I worked hard during the daytime when I was sober/hungover. But I've limited my potential for too long. I am *unbelievably* lucky to have succeeded in school while I was actively hurting myself; now its time to succeed now that I'm looking out for my health. 
Triumph: tomorrow I will be 30 years old. Quite a milestone if you ask me. My twenties are over and I'm ready to start taking shit a little more seriously thanks to sobriety. ..Struggle: cravings have been hitting me pretty hard lately. I think it's the warm weather also I bought a ps4 so I've been gaming a lot lately. That used to be my big excuse to drink. ..General Chat: getting through the summer is going to be tough for me but I'm just going to take it one day at a time. I know I need to keep working out and riding the bike and I just have to make plans for myself that get me out of the house which sucks in the humid hot summer weather. 
Dude!  You're rocking it!  I think it's great that you're aware of previous stumbles but try not to let it consume you!  You've got a better support system in place this time around -- use it!..**Triumph**: Life has been great lately.  I'm breaking out of my slump on the tennis court.  My wife and I have been getting along wonderfully.  We celebrated our anniversary over the weekend and I went all out: brunch spent the day at the barn with her took our out to a nice dinner got an engraved frame of a picture of us...**Struggle**: With everything going on listed in my Triumph I've been tired lately.  It's taking away from my focus while at work.  But these things usually don't last long...**General Chat**: I like Cake's plan for "getting up and walking away from situations for a bit".  I'll even decline invitations to events if I feel threatened.  For example my wife is going on a trip to Rome this Fall.  She will be busy with work 90% of the time so I'll be staying home.  "Old JBH" would have been happy to spend hours and hours in Italian bars.  But "New JBH" things having that much idle time by myself in a huge city is a Bad Idea^TM.
**Triumph:** Alcohol hasn't been on my mind as much the last few days. I'm starting to really enjoy being sober...**Struggle:** I'm coming down with a cold which used to be an excuse for me to drink screwdrivers all day. I'm not too worried but it is a trigger [against which I have not yet been tested](https://youtu.be/eDZor0UVNOc?t=45)...**General Chat:** I'm lucky in that my parents and my dad's side of the family are teetotalers. When I'm at an event where there is alcohol I make it a point to keep some kind of soft drink in my hand at all times. This keeps my hands and mouth busy cuts down on people offering me drinks and gives me an obvious excuse if someone does offer. I also pack a water bottle in case there are no non-alcoholic options available.
**Triumph**: I bought a bike. Like a really nice bike. One of those bikes I can take on 30 mile rides up the coast and feel like I'm not wasting a day because this bike is like a stallion that needs to be ridden. I am so excited!..**Struggle**: My old ways have come back to bite me. Someone paid me to complete a project I never completed it and now I have to deal with trying to complete it 7 months later for a person who now isn't responding to *me*. I'm scared to call them. I don't want to do this. I keep putting it off. Why do I keep putting it off?! I just need to suck it up... Oh and I think I might be getting shin splints...**General Chat**: Summer plans... well I'm just going to try to hang out with sober people as much as possible. Maybe I'll make a summer goal that if I end up spending time with friends who drink and we're doing something where drinks are present I'll come out to them as a non-drinker. How I explain that will depend on the person but I'd like to establish that for myself. I don't want people to think I still drink. I don't want to drink. I'm done.
**Triumph:** I haven't had a drink in 40 days!  My counter takes a while to update due to timezones or something.  Anyway hell yeah!  At this point my cravings are few and far between and don't last long and are very low in intensity. I think I may actually beat this...**Struggle:** Still dealing with a kind of injury that I sustained 2 weeks ago.  While out walking I sort of aggrivated my hernia surgery site so I've had to take it easy which sucks because I love walking.  ..**General Chat** : I live on a reserve and yesterday we signed up to receive money from a settlement with the government.  As a result I'll be receiving $15000 next week.  The old me would've bought a shit-tonne of booze but now I have the certainty that I will not drink a dime of that money... unless I buy Welch's grape juice lol.  
Triumph: my wife and son still love me and I bought a nice pair of running shoes yesterday. ..Struggle: I just don't know how to socialize or maintain a network of friends. ..General: I didn't like that last episode of game of thrones I feel like they're just trying to be shocking now. 
**Triumph**: New (to me) car I am pretty happy with.  Dealing with tension and unhappiness with my boyfriend with less manic (omg I have to drink NOW) moments.  Having been writing a bit more and feeling more creative.  Heck have just been being more proactive about getting shit done in general (Need an eye appointment? Call RIGHT NOW instead of putting it off for weeks and weeks and weeks)...**Struggle**:There is such unhappiness in my house.  BF says he is leaving soon but he is broke so I don't see how that is happening.  More and more my being sober and his drinking is becoming a contention point between us.  I am tired of being lied to brushed off told to "calm down" and always coming in second to alcohol.  I'm certain these behaviors were always there but before I was happy enough to ignore them by drinking myself.  I am constantly second guessing myself as to whether I am even a worthwhile person or if I am justified in being angry with the way he treats me...**General Chat**: I'm still too new to not drinking to know what to do in those situations mostly I avoid them.  Last night BF went down to the docks and drank beers at at BBQ on a house boat.  Even though I was mad about the situation (he was there drinking for 7 hours straight took my car after I asked him NOT to because I knew he'd be drinking) part of me still felt like I was missing out on something.
Triumph: I feel like I have mentally set in for a long haul of not drinking...Struggle: I feel like I should be ecstatic when in actuality I hate it. I hate the process and I hate the changes that are going on in my body. I have no drive or motivation to get up and out there socially or for physical exercise. I feel like I hate myself and I wonder how my fiance can stick around with little talk from me and no physicality. ..General Chat: Stick with it. The biggest fear is not knowing what the fuck is going to happen next (thus this whole one day at a time business). That fear will go away and you will settle back down into a grind. Life will even out.
**Triumph:** I've finally made steps towards joining the community here and reaching out for help when I need it. I'm also currently pushing a record of days sober w/exercise. Every day is breaking new ground and that's tremendously exciting...**Struggle:** I still catch myself thinking about drinking every day. I'm not too worried about the week but the weekend scares me. This weekend coming up (the second) is historically the one that pretty much always breaks me. I'm trying really hard not to let that happen this time recognizing this fact...**General chat:** Just a thank you to the community here you've been a real source of inspiration..
**Triumph:** Things are still going well. ..**Struggle:** Had mild depression last week. I took care of it and identified some of the contributing factors. They are work related so I'll have to be aware of them and try to minimize them when possible...**Tips for Summer Sobriety:** I'm a big planner. If there is an event I am worried about I'll make a list of all the challenges or uncomfortable situations I anticipate. Then I can come up with strategies for handling them. I tend to catastrophize so my list of problems (so far) has always been longer than what I actually encounter. 
**Triumph:** Back at it. Feeling good. Cleaned my house. Life is starting to feel like it used to. ..**Struggle:** Sleeping. Oh my god sleeping. I don't have issues falling asleep but my sleep is a mess. Crazy drinking dreams and nightmares. Waking up EXHAUSTED. I don't work till 1:00pm and I got out of bed today at 12:50pm cause I was so exhausted. I'm guessing this is just the joys of getting sober after a long binge so I'm excited for it to get better. Also work. Work struggles forever. Fuck work. ..**General Chat:** Got nothing for ya head back to camp. 
Triumph:  Working through day 3.  I know I can do this...Struggle: Work sucks lots a changes and "reasons" to drink.  Not doin' it!..General Chat;  Looking forward to a week long mission trip to help others starting Saturday where it will be IMPOSSIBLE for me to drink. :-) 
**Triumph**: I travelled to two face-to-face SMART recovery meetings this week (my first meeting was last week)...**Struggle**: Neither meeting happened. One was cancelled one either doesn't exist or I didn't find it. I've been assured that I'm not an alcoholic by my husband (whatever). I've a wedding this weekend (sober plan)...**General chat**: maybe I'm better off in the virtual world :) Still going to try again next week and I'm at least 50% confident it'll happen! Not drinking today or any other day.
Triumph: The day is over half over and I haven't had a drink yet \o/.Struggle: I really want to drink..Tips please!
Triumph: I am getting help to make positive changes and trying to stop beating myself up for the mistakes I've made so I can learn from them...Struggle: finding ways to fill my time to keep myself busy now that I am not passing out drunk on my couch every night...General: anyone want to share some motivational/ inspirational songs to help get through these tough times?.Happy hump day!!!

Triump: I'm sober and made it through yesterday. Yesterday I had the hardest day I've had since I quit it was worse than day one - but I didn't drink. ..Struggle: Sadly my husband is dying unless a miracle happens. ..General chat: I saw a quote the other day saying  Only in the darkness can you see the stars.  I'm getting a pretty good idea who the stars are in my life because of what out little family is going though. It's a little shocking how few there are but man do they shine brightly. 
*triumph:* I've received a scholarship an invitation to the honor society and an acceptance letter to my university of choice!! I cant wait for the fall semester. Im overjoyed. Sobriety and hardwork pay off more than I could have imagined. ..*struggle:* since I've gotten sober it's become apparent that I'm an extreme perfectionist. While it can be a positive attribute as it pushes me to constantly be better theres a point where it can become crippling. I find myself saying "when I look like this I'll be happy" or 'when I reach this point I'll be happy" and struggle with finding happiness in the present. I've actively been working on this and would appreciate any insight or advice anyone has to offer.  ..*general chat:* I went to the Buddhist Recovery Meeting that was suggested tonight on the sub. It was really pleasant. Has anyone else incorporated buddhist teachings in their recovery?
