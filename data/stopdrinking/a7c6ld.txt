Today I won't drink.  I'll try to be a good man to my wife a good dad to my daughters a good brother to my sister bring my best to work and trust in God...Oldest daughter home from college lots of drama in her life with roommates and relationships.  She struggles with OCD germaphopia and exzema.  So hard to hear her troubles and give her ideas that she doesn't seem to listen to.  So hard to not be frustrated at her choices and ways that she handles her situations.  Maybe she is a mini-me :-/.

That you care is what matters. You're doing better than you think - I'm sure your daughter notices your attention. Sober on!
