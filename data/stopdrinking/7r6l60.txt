I had six months sober and I have drank two times since I relapsed. The first time was a six pack - threw up. The second time was 3 beers - I got sick. I used to be able to drink 12 beers without a problem and I used to enjoy it. Now I just feel dull and sick when i drink...I have enough depression from winter... I don't need a depressant making me feel worse. ..I just got a call from an AA buddy. He kind of brought me back to some sort of sanity. Said to get back into meetings and see my doctor about antidepressants. Said my friends can't wait to see me again. My best idea was quit my job (which I did this morning) and move to Thailand. I now feel like a crazy person...Thanks AA buddy... I'll get to a meeting tonight even though I'd rather do anything else..

Wow big decisions exciting times! It's also good to hear that upon relapse you just feel dull and sick. I'll keep your experience in mind when I feel that twinge.
