The post says it all. Drinking is something I have recently been struggling with (within the last 6 months) I've made it one day record is 8 days. However I can't get to 8 again if I dont get 1. I was able to take librium finally to help maybe ease things along I'm hoping by Tuesday when I return to work I will feel loads better.

You will do my friend. Just keep going. 24 hours by 24 hours! It is harder to get sober than to stay sober. Get to Tuesday and you will be getting past the worst. Keep going.
Great job!! We are here for you! One hour at a time. Drink a lot of h20 CV try to eat well and get some fresh air. You will not regret  it! IWNDWYT!! 
You got this! The first few days are rough but I recommend being very kind and compassionate with yourself (I ate lots of sugar and vegged on the couch much more than usual for those first few days) and keep in mind why you are doing this. Freedom from alcohol is so amazing. Sobriety truly delivers what alcohol promises! Increased happiness clarity better skin more money and more is in your future!! You just gotta get through the next few days and then you have the pink cloud to look forward to! :)
Rooting for you my friend. I have faith that you will crush your prior record and keep going. Sober on! IWNDWYT
