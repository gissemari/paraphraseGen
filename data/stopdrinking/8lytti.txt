I know this is a common topic in recovery but I'm really struggling with it tonight. ..My wife was a saint while I treated her like garbage (and I did) . Now that I'm sober the tables have turned. I know this isn't healthy....Is there a level of abuse you have to take after you get sober or was that part of the problem in the first place? Thanks for listening I will not drink with you today.

I learned there are questions that you just don't want to pose to a bunch of alcoholics. We don't have the best track record in personal relationships. There are some questions that are best asked of a trained certified therapist. 
Not related to alcohol but I'll be open about this in case it helps with perspective. ..I cheated on my husband and decided to try and make things right on his terms if that's what he wanted. I was sure I was the problem (I mean I cheated what kind of asshole was I). Well over the next couple of years it became clear that nothing I could do would earn forgiveness. There was nothing but anger left and the only thing I could do to make things  better  was to take the abuse indefinitely. ..I was close to killing myself when I finally chose to separate from him and he wasn't a good person anymore. Maybe he never was. As I've spent the last few years since his death unpacking everything I see that things were broken before I ever cheated. I was already being abused. And I was being a shitty person too don't get me wrong. We were toxic and terrible for each other. ..I really wish we had decided to go to couples counseling as soon as I cheated. Maybe things would have gotten better. Maybe things would have ended way sooner. Either way I would have known that I didn't have to pay for my crimes by being an emotional punching bag. You don't owe it to anyone to stand still while they beat you down. ..IWNDWYT
