Anyone have a long period of sobriety broken by a relapse that they had a difficult road coming back from and regret? It would be helpful for this first-time quitter to hear and motivate me against relapsing.  Thanks.

Relapse doesn't have to be an option!  My longest sober before  a relapse was 90 days and even that was pretty soul crushing to come back from.  There have been some recent posts about long time sober relapses.  check out: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2whkpv/665_days_back_at_day_1/ for one persons thoughts.  ..People like to say that alcoholism is progressive even when you're not drinking its a quick road back to where you left off.  They say that its much easier to *stay in* shape then *get in* shape and I think the same holds true for sobriety!
Check out /u/coolcrosby's Saturday Share.  Saturday Shares are linked in the sidebar.  That is if you think losing a million bucks and ending up in federal prison would be sufficient motivators for ya.  
Been quitting for over 25 years. My last time out lasted for almost 9 years. This was after 5 years sober. Don't ever get soft. Don't ever let your guard down. All this was in the past and I can't change it...I'm thankful i didn't drink today.
Wow you're doing great at 415 days..As you can see from my badge I haven't been sober that long and this was my first serious attempt...But after reading up on the kindling effect I REALLY don't want to relapse. It seems everything gets much worse. It's pretty frightening:/
Search coolcrosbys dry people dry places thread..My most memorable relapse that was years long is posted in that thread..( I would link it but work is crazy today)
