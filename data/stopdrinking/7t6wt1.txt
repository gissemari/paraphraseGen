So I relapsed again last night after 4 days which for me was an achievement usually just takes a day or two. I was feeling really good starting to get some pep back in my step. Work was going well for a change. It's really surprising how quickly you can bounce back from putting poison down your throat for 2 years. But I f* it up...It always starts with just one drink. Just one. I tell myself it'll be the only one that I've done good the past few days and I'll limit at one. I'm a fool for thinking that would be the case. That one drink has led to 35 extra pounds drunken rants anger at my partner yelling at neighbors a car crash last year (no one hurt no dui. i was f* lucky) and last week a visit to the ER cause the hangover felt like a heart attack...This has to stop. I want my old life. I used to be an exercise fanatic did some sport literally every day. Sorry for the rant just needed to vent. Next time I see that bottle I'm going to remind myself that it took just one to make more regrets than I can count.

It helps to have a plan.  Do you have one?   ..There are a lot of tools out there to employ such as recovery programs like AA or SMART medicines like antabuse support groups like here etc.  ..The beginning is the hardest part but there are ways to make it easier and to get airborne so to speak.   
Rant away we're here for you. Playing the Tape Forward really helps me to remind me where  just that one drink can take me . Talk over with your partner where a drink can take you both...it always helps me to say the words and give them life. To acknowledge them. Good to seek doctor's guidance. ..I will not drink with y'all today and I support you in joining me if you and/or your partner would like to join me.
