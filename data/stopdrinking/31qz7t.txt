My husband is a pretty serious pothead.  He smokes as soon as he gets home from work every day and all day on the weekends. I can't remember the last stretch of time we spent together when he wasn't stoned. Like alcohol weed can be used to turn the life's volume down to numb the bad parts at the cost of really experiencing the good ones. It insulates at the cost of isolating an individual...I don't get high but I've never had a problem with other people doing it. But lately I'm worried that his reliance on it isn't for the purpose of  enjoying things more  but it's because he's afraid to live without it. I drink just to catch up. It's not fun anymore and I do it because I feel like I have to...I've discussed that I'm concerned about him and the amount he smokes but the conversation always turns into an argument. I support him but he's not willing to cut back because he doesn't think he has a problem. 10 years ago he went to rehab to deal with his dependence on weed (exclusively) but relapsed as soon as he got out. I realize this his substance abuse has *partially* influenced mine and I want to help both of us learn to live without...Has anyone dealt with a similar experience? Other than voicing my concern how else can I help him? Many thanks.

r/stopdrinking is for helping the drinker moderate or quit drinking.  I suggest checking out /r/alanon for support for a loved one that has a substance abuse problem.
It is good you are concerned about your partners using however.....**Your drinking is your own responsibility**.You drink because you want to not to "catch up with him"..If you want to stay sober you have to own that. If he wants to stop the pot he will. This is his issue not yours...If he was to turn it around and say your drinking makes him smoke that would also be a bullshit copout.Every adult is responsible for only their own substance use.
