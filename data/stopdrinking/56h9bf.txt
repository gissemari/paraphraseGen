If you read my post from yesterday you know my brother relapsed on heroin yesterday as I was going through day two . He's currently in a psychiatric unit on suicide watch . I'm going home to be with my family  but no matter how hard that is  I will not drink today . I want to stay sober for me  and for my brother .

Dear Redmermaid. I'll be not drinking with you and sending you some vibes from across the ocean. Stay strong. But mostly stay at peace.
Being sober during this  difficult time is a great gift you are giving your family.
Sending you and your family strength and positive energy.  I will not drink with you today. 
God bless you both. 
Whew. Good for you for being present for his struggle and for your family. They are lucky to have you. Good luck and I'll stay sober with you today.
I was hoping for an update from you (this is the first chance I had to check in).  I'm glad to be not drinking with you today.
