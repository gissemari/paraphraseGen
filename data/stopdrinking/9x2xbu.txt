I've had the honor to celebrate 100 days multiple times I think around 3 to 4 times. Longest streak was around 500 days being sober...This time it's different. In the past I've simply forced myself not to drink or kept myself busy with activities. This worked fine at the beginning but always ended in a relapse. Relapses aren't bad they can happen and I don't feel ashamed. I've always tried to learn from them and this time I had enough and kicked myself to something I've avoided like hell...I've joined my first therapy session to work on the reasons WHY I was drinking. I'm dealing with a form of social anxiety called  Avoidant personality disorder (APD) which is an enduring pattern of behavior related to social inhibition feelings of inadequacy and sensitivity to rejection that causes problems in work situations and relationships. https://www.verywellmind.com/avoidant-personality-disorder-4172959..So now I'm understanding why I was drinking and working on making it better I feel like I have an answer. ..Why did you drink?

Hey it's so noticeable when it's the different sobriety isn't it! I say this as someone who also had streaks and relapses like you i can feel the change from grimmly (is that a word?) not drinking to actively seeking an alcohol free lifestyle. You put it brilliantly. ..Thanks for sharing your diagnosis - i read the link and in light of that it is brave of you to be so vulnerable socially here - so big props for that! ..I have many mental twists which without treatment make alcohol seem like a viable option. Then once i do drink - basic biology takes over - i do not metabolise alcohol - it cuts off any exectutive function i may have gained through therapy - and i behave without dignity or safety. ..So the trick for me is similar to what your journey looks like. Actively identifying why in drink - and bless AA but "because i am an alcoholic" wasn't enough. It turns out I have Adhd (i was so skeptical but research and time have convinced me) so i literally "forget" all the techniques and training many year of therapy had tried to teach me. ..The other diagnosis i have which is why i was seeking treatment to begin with is ptsd. And in the somewhat black and white worlds that humans so love to be in the psych community thought i was drinking to numb that. They weren't totally wrong. ..Nor was it wrong that alcohol warped my thoughts into thinking it was a solution to depression rather than a cause. ..Nor was it wrong that adhd meant i give into impulsive thinking too easily. ..Not was it wrong that alcoholism is genetic and i have a disease. ..But i need and this sobriety is teaching me to move beyond black and white thinking. Move beyond labels and just do all the things. So i do research like you. I do therapy. I do adhd coach. I do recovery meetings. I do all the things. ..Because humans (i am) a complex complicated hot mess. And for me not to drink i need a combination of resources otherwise the sensitive rejection prone part of me (which it sounds like you have experienced) can easily find a problem with one suggested pathway and give up. ..Now i am here listening to people like yourself and learning that if one label or action doesnt suit keep looking and find another one. ..Because i drank because i was overwhelmed. I was out of other ideas and my brain and spirit needed nourishment. Alcohol didn't actually give that. But you did today. ..Your bravery is contagious and i thank you. Not drinking with you means i am in quality company - leading the way by showing vulnerable strength and i thank you for that. Very helpful and i hope your day is amazing!! 
Congratulations on 100! Me too.  :) ..Thanks for sharing @ APD. I've been trying to dig a little deeper into this as I'm struggling with social anxiety primarily in the work environment...Onward!!! ..
