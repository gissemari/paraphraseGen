Just wanted to chime in. I was trying to Taper  myself off. Turned into a nightmare. Made the toughest decision of my life and I'm at the ER now. I cannot explain how simple and professional it is. If you are struggling please just get help. They've dealt with it a million times.

I don't understand how people who need to taper can taper. Well done for looking after yourself. Where I live if you seek help it gets put on your public record like a sex offender! A google search comes up with substance addiction against your name. I wish so much I could get some professional help without ruining my career prospects. Good luck to you
I'm not sure why but I've gotten a little tear in my eye reading your post.  Perhaps because I'm 20 years older than you and wish I had done what you're doing when I was 27.  I've been where you are and I know that these posts are helpful to read. It helped me so much to see how many others were struggling along with me.  I also know that I couldn't quit  until I was so tired and really ready.  ..Perhaps this trip to the ER is not here to assure you that you are doing the right thing or that you are there because you're supposed to be.  Maybe this is just a glimpse into your future. An opportunity maybe to see things in a different light.  Justification is something we all are really really great at and I bet you're no different.  Ask some questions of yourself. How did I get here? Is this what I want from now on? How much longer can I keep this up before this trip turns into the next one? Will I get myself to the ER next time or will I be brought here under less fortunate circumstances?..This is a tough fight.  Get to a meeting when you get out. Come here often and read these stories of struggle success sometimes failure and then success again.  I hope the best for you. The road is bumpy but the destination is worth the trip.  Sorry for the long post...you struck a chord with me tonight. I will not drink with you tonight.
A few months ago I wound up in the ER.  Then the ICU.  I spent a weekend there before I was put in a "normal" hospital room and released a day later...&gt; If you are struggling please just get help. ..And when you do find yourself in this situation be honest about your alcohol use.  Every single doctor I met with (and I counted 8) were very appreciative of the fact that I laid it all on the line.  They can't treat you if they don't know what's wrong...Good on you for getting help.  Welcome to the future.
