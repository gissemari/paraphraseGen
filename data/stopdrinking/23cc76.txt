I'm just putting this here to remind me later of the struggle I'm having. The only reason I'm sober now is because it's good Friday and literally nothing is open. I made the decision to drink but I simply don't have that option as the stores are shut. I'm on a knife edge.

A near miss is a success. It's all a matter of perspective...Sometimes we simply have white-knuckle days. Stay sober for today...Someone in this sub once told me that even though they had 100s of days (might have been 1000s) sober it really came down to about 15 really tough ones. ..Hang in there and good luck!
Whatever is behind the urge is the thing to focus on. If you're like me the idea of drinking was just a default disguising something else. Feeling anything at all could manifest as the desire to drink. Normal human emotion was unfamiliar. My habit had been a pretty effective avoidance tool.
The stores may be shut but there are always AA meetings open...Good luck
Think it through - What will a drink give you?  Yes you will be taller better looking have more money and be more intelligent but besides that?..Hey since you have some money I know this guy a clerk in a bank in Nigeria....
So when are you getting to your next meeting and getting around other recovering people in real life?  You don't have to struggle alone.  You can instead not struggle with others.  I know it's scary but it's life saving.
