Today has been interesting for me I'm posting for no reason other than to take part in a post on SD today that's what has kept me sober and I got scared because I had a few rough days and nights (nightmares/relapse dreams) and it's messing with my head. The support that I get from this sub is amazing I'm so thankful to have found this sub and gave it a go. This has been my longest stretch in sobriety ever I'm quite anxious a lot still always have been but I'm doing alright. Today because I'm sober I was able to buy myself some new glasses (eyes not mugs js.) ordinarily all my money would go to alcohol and addictions.  I'm just grateful to be here and be sober today. Thank you SD for keeping me out of a bottle today.

That's great!! It feels so nice to have money to spend on worthwhile things. I would blow so much on booze and then be cheap about the important things. It totally messed up my priorities. Keep up the great work!
