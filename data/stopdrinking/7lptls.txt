As the title states I drank last night!  Not going to say relapse cause that's a terrible word.  I drank a bit didn't get drunk got a buzz.  Still fell terrible and have to start all over. Please forgive me.

No need to ask for forgiveness.  You're back in here and honest.  That's good.  Take it easy on yourself.  It's hard to stay sober.
I am really glad you're back! I think badge requests are in the sidebar maybe? IWNDWYT!
Glad you are right back here.  Be gentle to yourself -- this is hard work but you me all of us here are worth it.  I'm proud you came right back and proud to not drink with you today..
Glad you're back. Don't let this trip you up I've fallen off so many times. It doesn't have to become anything more than a slip and all your good work wasn't erased. 
Thank you for you support. 
You fell down happy to see you right back here resetting. You are stronger than you know. I will not drink with you today. Hugs.
i ve tried so many times that it is hard even to count them..But i am not giving up.We all fall but what is of importance is our choice of wanting to get up again
Lose the battle win the war. Relax. Guilt and shame get you nothing because they change nothing. Just get back up and try again. 
Thanks for the motivation bud.
