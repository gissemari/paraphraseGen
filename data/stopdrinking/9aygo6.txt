Told people including my daughter I was done drinking. In the past aside from posting here it's been a private struggle. No one in my life really knows what a problem it is for me. Until now.

Well done - what a big step. I hope it's lifted a weight off. Big hug Jules
It's been hard for me to be honest with my loved ones about my problem and struggle. It gets better. The world keeps spinning and things just fall into place. 
Disclose your issues at your own pace. Not all of my family knows of my struggles. IWNDWYT!.
I told myself no one knew. Turned out the ones who knew me best did know and didn't need me to tell them. The ones I tried to leave out of the loop were the "casuals" we all have in the peripheries of our lives. People such as my nearby neighbors who'd wrinkle their noses at the smell of alcohol on my breath at 10AM. Or even earlier. ..It still pains me to realize even they knew. It further pains me to know that my alcohol addiction illness call it what you will was *so obvious* to everyone. Except me.
