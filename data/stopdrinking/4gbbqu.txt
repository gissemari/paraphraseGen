Hi everyone! Queen of the relapse here. I went to rehab in November and I've relapsed 7 times since February. I will end up dying or losing my family if I don't change my life. 5 days feels great but I'm still dealing with the repercussions of my actions which mainly has to do with my 25 year old daughter. She's found me drunk 4 out of the 7 times. I don't have a lot of freedom so I'm not able to attend meetings for a while but I will check in here as much as possible. I don't work so I have a lot of down time. This time around I will take things one day at a time instead of making grand plans for the future like before. I'm glad to be here and sober.

Be proud of yourself for 5 days of not drinking . Keep trying. Keep trying. Keep trying...Don't pick up today and your daughter won't find you drunk today. 
Thank you! Meant to type 15 year old not 25.
