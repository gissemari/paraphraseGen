I feel the worst I've felt in my entire life. Last night I thought I could have a few drinks to "relax". As always the drinks turned into too many. And an embarrassing night followed worst ever. Why do the relapses get worse and worse? .Can't even write it here don't even remember a lot of it...Awake now and the first feeling is that I want to die. No one deserves me in their lives. Not my parents. Not my boyfriend. Not my siblings..I am an embarrassment...I don't know what to do with myself. I apologized obviously...I'm lost. I'm scared of life. I don't want to be myself. ..I really don't understand why I had to drink. I had a great day watched a movie and spent time with loved ones. I have a good life with supportive people around me who deserve better. ..I want to cut everyone out of my life. I am a burden. ..
