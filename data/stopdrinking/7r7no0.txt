Three days now and I have had time to think and read. I never thought of myself as being a victim of alcohol since my childhood but now I know that alcohol doesn't just hurt the alcoholic person but also the people close to them. I am trying my best to keep sober but I feel it's the hardest when the people around you don't see the problem and the struggle inside of you. I remember very little from Sunday night but the things I do remember I am ashamed of.

I'm glad you're here! You've taken the first steps and I'm inspired by the start you've made.  It sounds like you have identified alcohol as a problem in your life and that is major...No one around me ever told me to stop drinking or that I had a problem. I rarely had serious hangovers I held down a job (sometimes barely but I did) I was a decent husband and father. But I knew even if I won small battles here and there alcohol was ever-so-slowly winning the war. .What's more I know I can be better without alcohol. So I quit for me. So I can be better at what is important to me - being a Dad a husband a professional. Even if family friends and coworkers didn't see the problem they will benefit from sober me anyways...I also think getting sober might improve my surfing. That's no good to anyone except me and that's cool too. :-)..Grab a badge and stick around! SD is a great place.
