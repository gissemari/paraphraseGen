I was feeling pretty stuck in life. Many of my friends thought I had it made with good paying jobs my own house great friends and being in awesome bands. But I was miserable. The work environments were soul crushing even though I enjoyed a lot of the work and met some amazing friends. Every single day I left work and brought home a 6 pack to drink by myself. I wasn't able to get around seasonal affective disorder brought on by gloomy weather over half the year. I felt completely stuck in a life that was merely ok. As time passed I felt the rust building and the moss growing impeding my former agility in life. I needed a hard reboot and being drunk or hung over all the time didn't set me up to make the effort..I finally started my sober journey at the end of 2016 and experienced a few long streaks and relapses. This time I'm in it to win it. I'm 216 days in with an awesome sober girlfriend who just moved with me to a new city where I have a new job I'm thrilled about. I'm open with her about my challenges with alcohol and she is very supportive..All is new again. The moss is drying and flaking off and the joints are getting oiled again. It's not easy and I never could have gotten this far while drinking. I'm getting flashes of excitement for life again and the further I go the more frequent and lasting they become. I've still got a lot of work to do on myself. But I believe life can be beautiful again. .I wouldn't be at this point without /r/stopdrinking. My sincerest thanks and love to you all..
