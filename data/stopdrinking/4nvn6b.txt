I know it's common and I've seen it before but this was my first close friend since getting sober to relapse. It really upsets me. He went to a wake for another friend who just died of addiction and I guess he took a drink. Now he is off and running...I've been talking and writing about it and taking the right actions so that it doesn't interfere with my own recovery. Nevertheless he was a person who helped me tremendously these past months and it makes me uncertain of everything in my program. Maybe that's a good thing I don't know. Just had to vent and ask for you all to keep him in your prayers.

Both him and you I will pray for.  This disease sucks.    Relapse and death are a part of this disease but they are NOT a part of recovery.  In the text from the fellowship for which I belong (AA) it says on page 98 "Burn into the consciousness of every man that he can get well regardless of anyone."..As sad as it is to have your close friend relapse you DO NOT have to follow down that same path.  Be that beacon of recovery that he can come back to when he is ready.  Great job on 3 months.  That's amazing
The longer your stay sober the more frequently you will see this. This is a chronic disease where relapse happens. Hopefully your friend makes it back before too much damage. Some do and some do not.
): Thinking of your friend and hoping he finds sobriety again soon.
I am keeping all in my thoughts and prayers. Please try to stay vigilant 92 days is a great accomplishment friend.
