Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: After a lifetime of being a total workaholic I'm learning how to relax and treat myself well.  It's OK for me to sit and do things I enjoy I don't need to be productive in some fashion each waking hour of my day.  Relaxation kicks ass!..Struggle: Old negative thoughts come back "Why are you sitting still?  You should be at the gym you're going to get fat again.  No-one will care about you if you're not producing"  Loving myself is tough but it's worth it...General chat: More snow less spring.  I need warmth!..Have a great 24 hours folks!

Yay for Wednesday! This is the day I get to meet with my sponsor and spend an hour talking about myself. Hey as a mother of 4 this is a luxury in my life no matter how uncomfortable it can get at times...Triumph: Everyone in my house is healthy at the moment. This is huge for a family of 6 when everyone else around us is sick with colds flu etc...Struggle: My emotional eating is making it difficult to button pants. Sigh. I'm not overweight but man this muffin top I've got going on is killing me. I thought we LOST weight when we got sober?!..General chat: I planted seeds in my garden on Sat and am frustrated that nothing green has peeked up yet. Um hello impatient one!
Struggle: I had a lousy birthday I was sick I got depressed..Triumph: I'm learning how to cope with things like the above in a healthier way. I feel bad it's temporary drinking won't help. ..General chat: If time is money why have I never had to pay a time bill? 
Wednesday started off great. After getting to my 7:30am meeting I am off to work. (Employable!!!). Got a great meeting tonight and keeping my anxiety under control.  Talking with my sponsor a lot this week. I have court on Friday.  I am trying to get custody of my children back.  Turning it all over. It will be as it is supposed to be.  
Thanks for doing this NMBP..**Triumph**: I hit a milestone today: I've lost 50 pounds since July.  I'm 8 away from what's on my driver's license and 18 away from my goal!  I'm starting a Krav Maga class tonight that I'm really excited about too (which should help me reach my goal).  I've been in several "drinking" situations and they've been non-issues for me.  I'm just a person that doesn't drink...**Struggle**: I've got nothing... Sorry folks -- I'm feeling pretty good...**General chat**: I can't wait for Spring.  I've been riding my bike when we get glimpses of nice weather but I'm sitting here polishing my tennis racket waiting for the sun to clear (no not really)..
Triumph: 60 days today.  Yay me...Struggle: having trouble eating healthy.  ..General chat:  on vacation right now.  Daughter got sick so we might head home early.
Struggle: Was in the hospital for two days with chest pain - they gave me nitro paste which caused a real bad headache and then gave me opiates AND a benzo after I requested just an Advil for my head.  ..Triumph: Have meditated twice a day for 20 minutes.  Only focusing on my breathing and becoming rather good at it...General: Increased visitation is on the table and i'll have to get a drug test...I'd test positive I'm sure from the hospital's call to give me narcotics. Dang it.
Triumph: Got good news from my doctor that my knee will not need surgery or physical therapy...Struggle: Selling my condo has been this epic nine month process that is still ongoing. My condo is where I did my worst drinking and I have strong negative feelings about it. Just want to move on...General: Chairing a meeting tonight so have that to look forward to.
Triumph: I'm engaged. Can't believe it. Holy hell!..Struggle: Applying to grad school is ego deflating and humbling. ..General chat: Life is pretty fucking great.

Triumph: out of the blue my SO told me she was so proud of me and gave me a kiss. Good feelings!..Struggle: been trying to get a handle on my economic status. very depressing. feeling a lot of frustration of the years i've thrown away and the amount of projects i haven't done...General chat: smoking is pretty gross without drinking. thinking about giving it up..Have a great 24 hours yourself NMBP and the rest of you!
Triumph: Didn't take advantage being alone in the house last night to get smashed as I normally might with that opportunity. Go me...Struggle: Wednesday evening has always been our 'mid-week treat' get a bit (quite) drunk evening. This is my first sober Wednesday in *years*. Feeling a bit antsy hence this post...General chat: First post here. Not had a drink since Saturday. I'm more of a binge drinker than an 'every day' drinker so 3 days without drinking isn't unheard of for me but I don't remember the last time I went longer. Tonight makes 4. Trying to come up with something fun to do on Friday night that being my usual night to **really** get twatted.
Triumph: First day with no hangover! I ran for half an hour on the treadmill and didn't feel like I was struggling for breath like I usually would!.Struggle: I feel my grip on sobriety is tenuous at best. It's one day at a time I know but the thought is intimidating..General Chat: really looking forward to tasting some good food tonight!.
Hello everyone! .Triumph: 77 days=11 weeks=21% of a year=how far I have come. .Struggle: Keeping busy on these cold snowy grey nights when I can't go out and golf or garden or walk in the sunshine. Spring needs to get here now!.General Chat: Check out "Living Sober Sucks" website and book and blog......... this guy rocks!!.Thanks to everyone for being here! My day wouldn't be complete anymore without a visit here to see my numbers accumulating and insights from all of you. 
Triumph: Got to class got grades back that I aced a midterm got emails for two second round interviews for my dream job an set them up for next week and got to work today on time...Struggle: boyfriend of nine-months also in my home group broke up with me last night out of the blue. He's a couple of years more sober than me and having a rough time but I thought we were doing well. I'm completely off guard can't eat just feel like running and crying and running and sleeping. ..Triumph: I still took care of my responsibilities even though I feel like I want to quit everything. And I have so many amazing female friends in the program. 
Struggle: She ain't coming back...Triumph: She ain't coming back...Struggle: Kids...Chat: Clarity in getting there at least is good. 
i totally feel you on the relaxation front. i find it's important to let myself enjoy hanging out in my bedroom/apartment all day if that's what i feel like doing just watching tv and reading or whatever. i think of it as time to let myself relax and recharge. treat yo self!..triumph: went to my first meeting in 2 years. it was first one i've attended while in this current 5-month-stretch of boozelessness. after 2 weeks of feeling depressed wanting to drink and having dark feelings the warmth and positivity of the meeting was exactly what i needed. everyone was welcoming. the speakers were beautifully and powerfully moving and just through sharing their experiences. it was such a privilege to be able to listen and relate to. i found i identified with all 3 speakers despite their different specific experiences. everyone at the meeting was very friendly but not overly pushy or invasive the snacks were tasty the coffee was hot there was a cigarette break halfway through. i plan on going to this meeting every week and also checking out other meetings throughout the week in my city. i woke up today happy to be alive and happy to be sober and that's all that matters. i know that any day if i need it AA has my back...struggle: as always i'm a little behind with my schoolwork. but i'm working hard and have waaay better attendance than ever before! ..general chat: for those of you who like reading famous peoples' addiction/recovery stories and memoirs as i do i strongly suggest "American on Purpose" Craig Ferguson's memoir which i just finished. it is not only laugh-out-loud funny and engaging but he (who has openly praised AA) frankly retells and examines his long history with alcohol from when he was a kid growing up in scotland to being young and in a punk band and recounts his whole journey to becoming an aspiring comedian in New York City. i think most people have seen this awesome monologue by him since i feel like it's posted here frequently but i can't share it enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZVWIELHQQY.
