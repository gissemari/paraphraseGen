Feels so refreshing! Those things don't control me anymore. I see a lot of posts on here saying rather than thinking about being 'sober' they just tell themselves "I don't drink (smoke)". This is a good mindset to have. ..I just want to shoot some motivation out there to those who may be struggling. You can do it! Keep your head up it gets easier!
