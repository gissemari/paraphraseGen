After struggling the past few weeks this resonated with me a lot tonight. (Disclaimer: not my words source unknown).."You don't get over an addiction by stopping using. You recover by creating a new life where it is easier to not use. If you don't create a new life then all the factors that brought you to your addiction will catch up with you again."

This makes so much sense to me 
Thanks for sharing .I've got some new things to include into my life to stay away from the ditch!
So true.  Once you change your lifestyle good things begin to fall in place and occupy your time and mind; leaving no room for the bad things. 
Thanks for sharing! Just what I need to hear this evening  
Nothing changes unless I change it...
Yes!!! I think this is why I'm having so much success this time around. That and I've finally given up the idea of moderating :)
Thank you! This is 100% true. It doesn't happen over night but work at it every day.
Reminds me of the whole "to get to the other side you have to lose site of the shore" thing. I probably massacred that quote as it's been while since ive seen it. 
This is a great quote.
   
My take on this:  You don't quit drinking - you begin to LIVE SOBER!.IWNDWYT
Excellent words of wisdom. Thanks for sharing
