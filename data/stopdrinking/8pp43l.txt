(Rambly text warning ahead)..I didn't follow Anthony Bourdain very closely although I knew who he was. His death has affected me today more than I thought it would. I keep thinking about it and then I logged on here and saw that many people are talking about his relationship with alcohol. I read that Kate Spade was also battling alcoholism before she committed suicide. ..Why is alcohol abuse so rampant among those with depression? Is it the depression causing one to self-medicate or the booze causing one to feel depressed? I feel like it's a little of both. I know it was for me. I started drinking because it made my depression recede even if just a few hours of inebriation but then the longer-term effects of having alcohol in my system made me more depressed. ..These recent high-profile suicides have also reminded me of the fact that material success and gain don't necessarily solve our problems. How we experience life is an internal process and while wealth and status can make certain things *easier* I suspect that it's also exchanging one type of stress for another. Ultimately we have to find our own satisfaction and meaning in life from inside ourselves. A nice house or a well-paying job isn't going to make everything bad just 'go away'; unfortunately I think that equating material success with happiness is prevalent in this very capitalistic Western culture. ..I've been depressed for most of my life and due either to past trauma genetics or just luck of the draw I've also dealt with increasingly incapacitating amounts of anxiety as I get older. Quitting drinking a little over a month ago has done more than anything else to bring that anxiety and depression down to levels where I can start putting energy into actual recovery and growth rather than just basic struggling survival. It didn't magically cure me but it's made things so much better. ..I started using alcohol to escape from my issues but by the end it was clearly only exacerbating them. I became actively suicidal while drinking; I had letters written and a plan in place and in February I was going to enact my plan. Luckily the sober sane part of myself hidden way deep down there decided to go to my scheduled therapy session before ending it and that saved my life. I started to connect the dots then the turbulence I experienced while using alcohol and I think that's about when I started lurking on this sub. I had a few half-assed attempts at quitting in March and April and then I started my current attempt at the end of April and so far I'm still here both sober and alive which is not something I ever really expected. ..I don't know quite why I'm writing all this other than I feel kind of sad today and grateful for my life as it is now sober and I want to remember how bad alcohol made me feel and how much I wanted it anyways. It's been a huge struggle of my life...If you are struggling with suicidal thoughts please know that people care about you and you are not alone. PLEASE reach out for help. If you're in the US you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. ..If you are looking for a therapist or want to go to a therapist but are nervous or have questions I can also try to share any helpful aspects my own experience of therapy; my therapist 100% has saved my life and I would not be sober or here today without them. I am also in school studying clinical psychology (ironic?) and while I cannot offer any advice I can point you towards some helpful online resources. ....
