For years I have struggled with alcoholism. At first I would drink on weekends but even the very first time drinking I was a complete mess. I drink to excess every single time. Usually I go a solid month sometimes even two with no drinking. Then I get comfortable or think I can control it. I always end up shit faced for 3-5 days at a time. The hangovers are brutal and I try to taper off but I always end up drunk again. I have a wonderful life I have caring and loving friends and family. They all hate my drinking and I hate disappointing them. I have been sober nearly a year in the past. I know I can do it. I just dont. I always fail. I am so sick of this. I honestly love sobriety I enjoy life I enjoy my friendships I dont know what I have to do to freaking stop. I am 29 years old I cant keep living this way. It isnt living.

Welcome. What made the difference for me was seeking out help in real life. Have you tried any sort of meeting? There are lots of options these days. Glad you're here. 
I couldn't stay sober without surrounding myself with a support system. I started by getting a therapist went to rehab outpatient treatment and got involved in AA. This support system taught me how to have the sober happy life I have today...Does this saying apply?..&gt; When it is more difficult to suffer.&gt; .&gt; Thank to change;.&gt; .&gt; We will change.
