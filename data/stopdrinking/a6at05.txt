I had some solid laughs with people I hadn't seen in a while  but I felt more disconnected from folks as the night went on. ..I saw a bunch of people I used to love hanging out at the club and was so dissapointed how fucked up saucer eyed and self absorbed they all were. My friend who's a photographer and sober was there and a delight.  Made me realise that having something to do like photography would make the situation more fun...I kept thinking how I wanted to connect these people i loved but couldn't.  No one was.  I used to think drunken nights out were where i made some of my best friends. Thats bullshit. Its over coffee and dog walks and phone calls and over dinner that happens. ..Anyways I'm off to bed as i am a commitment machine now and am helping friends open a gallery tomorrow!!! .Night guys.  I hope your Fridays were satisfying and iwndwyt

A gallery opening! How cool! Hope it goes smoothly. ..My Friday is shaping up to be my favorite kind: cozy. I'm fighting off a mild cold but I have many remedies at my disposal: a heated blanket a good book and ginger tea. ..IWNDWYT!
