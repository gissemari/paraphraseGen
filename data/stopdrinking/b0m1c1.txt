So I'm currently battling a cold which doesn't help me in terms of feeling sorry for myself but I feel as though I need to get this out...I relapsed on psychedelic drugs in the quest for  spiritual attainment . At first it seemed ok doing it once every two weeks. I've just proved to myself that I cannot take anything safely as I plugged a load of 4-Aco-DMT yesterday with no real control over it. It also put me on my bloody arse. I have absolutely no idea what happened for three hours just felt as though I'd been poisoned. It's back on me. Waking up with the thoughts of using drugs - just this time it's not opiates/cocaine/amphetamine it's fucking LSD/2C-E/DMT   what a bizarre concept. ..I was struggling to admit it was a relapse taking mushrooms for the first time last month. But I've been unfocused and unable to concentrate on things as I've been obsessing over these psychedelic drugs. ..Ah well. I guess I did some testing and realised that I am very much still an addict. I need to stop this before it gets worse. I still have a bunch of 2C-E and DMT left. I chucked the 4-aco-DMT. I need to get rid of the rest but I have this stupid idea in that I should just take them and not order any more so that I've experienced them and that's that. What do you guys think? ..I need to get honest with my sponsor and start working a program again. It worked for me in the past. Why can't it work again? ..

I do the same thing with weed. "I'll just finish this cartridge and then won't buy a new one" and then I end up getting a new one.....I had to reframe it as why would I bother taking this when I know it's only bringing me negatives? The fear of 'wasting money' or something is the addiction gremlin talking. Maybe give it away?
First well done on 3.5 years! That's a lot of life!..What's the point of finishing what you have? ..Because you already paid for it?  Taking it or throwing it away won't change that...Because it's there?  A bottle of cleaning product is there and would mess with your brain but you don't drink it...Because you want to go big one last time?  How will you feel after that it was worth it or worse than what you're feeling now?..Because you're good at rationalizing?  This is the one that made it take so very long for me to finally get sober...Good luck friend.
