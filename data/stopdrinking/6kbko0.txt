I cut off my really bad drinking friends about 9 months before I stopped for good. I'm not sure why I think I knew they we're trouble and it was only really two friends that I have done it with. ..This girl who I'm seeing tomorrow is a nice person and I know she struggles with alcohol dependency she hasn't said it to me but its plain to see. ..Anyway she is a masseuse and I really felt like getting a massage tomorrow as a part of my "Treat Yo Self 100" I could have gone elsewhere but I am a creature of comfortability and I know her and her space well. ..Does anyone have any advice on this it will be in the morning so I will take her a coffee. But I want to be open with her when she asks me why I haven't been intouch for so long usually I make up an excuse that I've been busy but I think I will be honest with her and say that I felt like I was drinking too much and I had to take a step back. .Does anyone have any advice on saying these things without hurting feelings or coming off as preachy?.The thing is that I know she will understand because I know she has the same party girl ways as I did.

I don't see that neither hurting nor preachy. You are leading your life and taking any step it needs. If she is 'normal' she will understand. If not - well that's her problem :-D
I think it is ok to say that. Just make it about you- you wanted to quit you needed a break from booze etc and I can't see her taking it too hard. ..God I would die for a massage. 
I don't see that as preachy at all.  You're saying YOU were drinking too much and needed some time.   You're not saying SHE is drinking too much or that you needed time away from her specifically.  I think that the way you're framing it is just fine.
