I've been drinking pretty heavily for the past three years but moderately heavy for a year before that. I used to be healthy. I was at the right weight for my body. I worked out twice a day (half hour in the mornings and a half hour in the evenings) at home. I used to be able to just drink one or two drinks and feel like that was way more than enough and now it's not like that. And let me clarify my  drinks  aren't wine or beer. They are hard alcohol. Whiskey bourbon vodka rum. So for the past two years I've probably been at about 5 drinks a night. Maybe 3 or 4 on a  light  weeknight and perhaps 6 on a heavier weekend. Or more depending on if I was doing some day drinking on the weekend...Increasingly my depression has gotten worse. Worse to the point where it has affected my life. I've dealt with depression all my life. I've been on medication before and have done therapy a number of times throughout my life but for the longest time I just didn't need any of it. I was good. ..But now I'm not. And I've been going back and forth with things to get me where I need to be. Should I do this should I do that? I've started taking a ton of vitamins and supplements again just to make sure my body and brain has what they needs but I've been having a lot of anxiety. One manifestation is the absolute freak out moment I have when trying to swallow these pills. My heart starts racing my body feels light my vision gets dark. A couple of times the pills have gotten stuck and my brain's immediate reaction is Okay this is it. You're going to die taking vitamins. But I'm still taking them as I can. Every pill requires about five minutes prep time which consists of drinking a lot of water to wet my throat and talking myself into the fact that yes I CAN swallow. I have not forgotten...So I have vitamins going for me but with them anxiety...But I've also realized that alcohol isn't the problem it worsens the problem but it isn't the for real deep seeded problem. Alcohol is the symptom of my problem. Depression is a symptom of my problem (which is also probably the antecedent of my relationship with alcohol but they're still both symptoms). My weight worsened by alcohol is also a symptom. My lessening self-esteem also worsened by alcohol is also a symptom. My stress worsened by alcohol is also a symptom. So now that I see that most of the things that aren't working for me are symptoms of my actual problem I have to get to the root cause and then learn to fix it. ..What have I found so far? ..I'm a perfectionist and a people pleasure so naturally I'm stressed out. Beyond the telling. I can't seem to not care about ANYTHING which is to say that I care so much about everything and I cannot let things go. But even that is a symptom. So what's the root cause of the stress and having to care about everything?..I think it's trust. I cannot trust anyone to do anything that needs to be done. I cannot trust anyone to take care of themselves let alone help take care of me. I think this stems a little from childhood in which I felt abandoned and focused to care about grown-up things and take care of parents in a certain way but I don't want to dwell so much on that. I feel like I've had time to accept that chapter in my life. What I think it stems from now is that I had a husband who didn't help with anything. He gaslighted me into thinking something was wrong with me when in fact it was his addictions that caused the pain and suffering. I think my divorce which was and is a good thing ultimately led me down the path of having to accept that all of it is my burden and no matter what people said no one was going to be there to help me shoulder them. ..I picked a partner who wasn't a good partner and who chose various drugs before me the kids the housework the emotional labor and struggles. I had to be the one to get the job the take care of the kids to keep the job to clean the messes to help him to put myself last. And I think I got use to it. I think stress and feeling like the sole pack animal/work horse became the normal. Even though it wasn't the life I'd wanted it was the life I had and I couldn't change it (at least that's how I felt back then)...And so I treated it with a little alcohol. Then I got a divorce and then I treaded it with a lot of alcohol. ..There's no reason for me to drink anymore. I might still be stressed but I have people who CAN help me with all the burden of being a single mother and my kids are getting older now and can help themselves. Drinking just became easy. It became not just the treatment of my stress and sadness it became a  treat  for me like when you get a piece of candy at school for getting a 100% on your homework or when your grandmother gave you a cookie for helping her wash the dishes. But instead of cookies or candies it was just another drink so my brain can take a break after doing all that physical mental and emotional labor. Just one more before bed because I was good and did every single thing asked and required of me (and a ton of stuff no one asked me to do but I knew needed to be done). I give so much to others that I'm going to give myself the luxury of this drink and the next one...But here's the thing alcohol stresses my body. Alcohol stresses my mind. Alcohol stresses my emotions. Alcohol makes me paranoid and tired and has been stealing my sense of purpose for a long time. It's placated me but not helped me to grow. It  relaxed  me by not taking away my stress but by putting it off for a few hours...I'm getting older. I've passed a milestone age so to speak. I've never cared much about growing older. I've never been scared of it or sought to defy age in any way but I hate looking at myself in the mirror. I haven't allowed my picture to be taken since about 2015. I used to take selfies simply so my kids would have a visual record of me when they get older and might want one but now I don't. I hate how I look and feel and it's been easier to just drink away those feelings. And if they would just stay away I wouldn't mind but every morning they flood back to me in stronger and stronger waves...I've known for a long time that there would be no way to shed the fifty pounds I've put on while continuing to drink. I've known for a long time that the fifty pounds didn't come from not exercising or from not eating right (I still exercise 3-5 times a week and I have a pretty clean diet); it came from the booze which arrests the processing of the food by storing it as fat as my body focused all its attention to removing the poisonous alcohol. I've known for a long time that alcohol kills cells indiscriminately and dehydrates everything and that drinking it would do the same to my internal organs/cells. I've known that it's made me look old and made me sound stupid and gotten in the way of my drive and passion for self-improvement. I've known it has made me a not good role model for my kids (even though they would deny it I don't think I could ever be the best role model while clutching several glasses of whiskey every night in front of them)...I've known all that stuff but I still chose to drink. Why? Why as I'm typing this cannot I not tell myself that all those things sum up to something I don't need ever again? Why can I not just say  I'll never drink again ?..Well I guess the point of the SD subreddit is not to say  I'll never drink again  but to say  I will not drink with you tonight.  And I think I can do that. I did that for a while until one time I didn't and then I haven't posted IWNDWYT since in fear of breaking the promise to myself and to everyone else who pledged...I didn't drink last night. I have no plans to drink tonight. But I don't want a badge because it makes me feel like I'll mess it up and have to cause someone else to do more work and reset a badge. Or if it's a bot I'll have to took at my reset number as another failure and burden...I feel like all this depression and anxiety my increased concentration on what drinking actually is (and my not wanting to drink) is actually leading me to where I need to go and be. I can see myself sober and drinking my smoothies again and being at my ideal weight and not caring about the bottle in the alcohol cabinet. And not worrying about what if something happens to one of my kids at night and the alcohol hasn't left my system enough for me to be able to drive them to the hospital. ..I do know that I have to get it under control. This anxiety and depression has got to go. This life is nowhere near my best life or my best self. Drinking makes me unhappy and I know deep down that I'm a HAPPY person so how can I do something that makes me unhappy and be happy?. I have to stop drinking. I have to do the things that support my life. Meditation. Reading. Focusing on health. Petting my dogs. Hugging my kids. Drinking water. Eating healthful foods. Moving my body. Sitting in the sunshine. Learning to let go...Today is Monday 4/1/2019. I will not drink today. I did it yesterday. I can do it today too. ..Just needed to submit this in a semi-public forum so that it doesn't just exist in my head... At the end of the day our recovery must be based not on shame or perfectionism or the need to impress others but on our willingness to be kind to ourselves.  = Erica Spiegelman  Rewired: A Bold New Approach to Addiction and Recovery..TL;DR: Meandering thoughts of someone who is trying comes up with solutions everyone already knew.
