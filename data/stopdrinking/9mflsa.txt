I have been an alcoholic and seriel cheater for a few years now. My husband has put up with all of this countless time but a few months ago he had enough and we have been seperated since. I KNEW I had to get sober and start living a better life. Unfortunately last week a few triggers (putting my cat down feeling in limbo while staying with my folks in the home where I was abused by a sibling as a child wondering if my husband and I would get back together feeling guilt from the past) got the better of me and I stopped taking my mental health meds and drank. I had been staying at his place for a few days because he was out of town and someone needed to stay with our daughter. I was sloppy in the way I hid the bottle (left the cap behind) and when he asked me about it I lied. After a few repitions of the lie within the same conversation I told myself that I just had to tell the truth so I did. I was already feeling low enough about my decline and I didn't want to further dissappoint him but I will tell you what the lies made things even worse between us. Before this conversation he was torn as to whether or not he wanted a divorce but after it he has made up his mind to continue forward with it...&amp;#x200B;..What are my next steps? Well I have an appointment with a therapist who specializes in CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) to help address the lying betrayal and drinking I am back on my meds have a great support system in my family started exercising again and will be going to more AA meetings. I am also moving forward with getting my own place so I am not in limbo so I can feel like I have a home. I CAN ONLY move forward. Thank you all for being here!
