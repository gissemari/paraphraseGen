Hey everybody I just had a few random things I wanted to talk about I'm not sure they merit their own post so if you would like to add some randomness of your own feel free. Here's what I got...1. I'm quitting smoking my quit day was supposed to be tomorrow but I'm down to one smoke  so I'm just going to quit early instead of going and buying another pack. I've quit before so I know I can do it but I also know it is going to be hard as hell. I really want to feel the full effects of not drinking. I feel great but I imagine I'll feel even better once I kick the cancer sticks. I know this belongs on another sub but they've showed me no love so far...2. I just started listening to podcasts I know I'm way behind the times. Anyway I've been listening to [The Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/) and it has been really helpful to me. For those who don't know it centers around creative people discussing their experiences with addiction and mental illness depression anxiety all that fun stuff. I've only listened to three episodes but all of them have been entertaining and really informative and have had something positive that has stuck with me...3. I decided to start exercising regularly. I have a bad back and a bad shoulder so I looked online and found some low-impact exercises. I decided to try some today to fine tune my workout routine and I was emotionally devastated when it became obvious the toll all the neglect from drinking had on my body. I used to be an athlete and a pretty damn good one not anymore grandma exercises killed me. I may never be that jock guy again but I'm not going to let it bring me down I'm just going to be the best sajjr I can be. Don't laugh if you see some big dude doing girl push-ups in the park it may be me...4. Lastly I went out Friday night and had a great time. I didn't touch a drop of alcohol and that was the first time I ever set foot in a bar and not left at least buzzed. We ended up at a gentleman's club and I will say that strippers seem to lose a little bit of their luster when I'm sober. I keep looking at them and thinking that poor girl must be struggling with addiction like me. I guess I've been reading too much self helpy stuff or maybe just enough. .
