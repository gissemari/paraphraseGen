I just found my wife's Reddit account which I guess I've always kind of known but never really went through her profile until tonight...I just wanted to say thank you for your incredible support of her this last month. I just learned that she frequents this sub and without you all we would not being heading into month two of her sobriety so strong. After a relapse and a very difficult couple of weeks for us I'm thankful for this community and your support of her. Ive really learned a lot reading through some of her posts and comments and am really thankful for the advice and encouragement you have given her along the way. ..I just wanted to come here and say thank you. I really don't have words to tell you how meaningful that little community has been for us.

We are all here to help! This is a safe space for everyone and I hope your wife is okay with sharing this part of her journey with you. Best of luck to you both!
Not sure how I feel about this. I hope your wife doesn't think you have violated her trust. Obviously I have no idea who she is but I see posts where people share their fears and shortcomings in a way they might not feel comfortable with their spouse. If you want your wife to be successful keep in mind that recovery is deeply personal and that the people I see that get the best results have to come to the conclusion that they are doing this for themselves. Every time I tried to quit for someone else or to try and save a relationship I failed. ..Good luck to both of you.
