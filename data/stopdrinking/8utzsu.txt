My roommate and I invite coworkers over for parties every few weeks but to be frank the core group he invites is made up of bitter and judgemental folks. ..Drinking used to make these people tolerable but I would feel somehow awkward and alienated by them as my jokes and stories never seemed to land as well as usual etc... ..Being 1 week sober from booze and pot really revealed to me who these people are. Quietly sipping coffee in the background I heard them shit on everyone from their boss (understandable) to our coworkers to even the janitors and lower ranking people in our office...You truly have to be insecure to make fun of someone for being trapped in a shitty job and I can only guess it stems from insecurity in themselves...To get to my point my main struggle is detachment and alienation from others. When I had drank around these people I felt judged isolated and had to skip the gym in the morning to recover. As a result I was in worse shape had less money and my main insecurities had been reinforced. ..Instead I saw these people for who they are went to bed early and crushed a morning workout after enjoying some iced black STOK cold brew coffee...This was a real win for me and a bit of an eye-opener. ..

Maybe this party needs to find a new home so you get yours back.  Good job on 1 week.
Some people are just.... the worst! With their spikey energy vibes. I prefer people with more of a wave type vibe! I woulda told them to kick rocks. Lol hope today is better!..IWNDWYT
