Is it a bad idea to ask friends to help keep you accountable? I have two friends in particular who I find myself out with a lot and therefore drink the most with currently. These are women I consider real friends not bar friends (I have those too). I talk myself into drinking when I spend time with them at our usual places that serve alcohol (and food). Like my most recent relapse (badge isn't current). ..So I feel like I either need to avoid these places completely for awhile but risk isolating myself or have a frank conversation with them about my desire to stop drinking and ask for their help. If they knew my battle maybe I'd be less likely to partake. ..But it's not their problem to solve so feels selfish. And I don't want them to feel awkward about their drinking. Anyone have thoughts or experiences to share?..

I'm interested in hearing the answers you get.... especially from those more experienced than myself...30 years of drinking and I could never get past a week sober when I told my friends and family I was stopping. They were always there for my relapses...I recently made it 55 days in one stretch and have been mostly sober since June 2017 as a result of not  talking my power away  as an old friend used to say. ..I don't talk about it except for here on SD and with my wife. If anyone asks my answers are sticky nonchalant. It's too valuable and I'm too vulnerable to put the ball in anyone's court but my own. My wife understands so I can talk to her. It's otherwise strictly personal...I don't go to bars or hang out with drinkers much but I don't avoid them either. I went to a family dinner last night. They've enjoyed my lack of self control for years. I think it builds their confidence. I'm kind of like the one they go to when they want to get hammered and talk things out. There are other complex psychological angles. I didn't drink. It was disorienting because I had slipped just a couple of nights before. My mind was swimming in circles for a few minutes while they offered fine wine brought home from their travels overseas. I'm so happy I didn't fall in...I will not drink with you tonight!
I've tried to keep my struggle private from those who are still drinking until I'm more secure in my sobriety. Consciously or not I think even "supportive" people get uncomfortable when you tell them you're trying to quit and they're still drinking. It's just human nature...I'm terrible with accountability to being with but I've found AA to be a good place to go where people understand how rigorous you need to be to get sober. Drinkers don't know about cravings and triggers (at least not consciously) and those who've fought the good fight do...I believe that at the end of the day I ultimately have to be accountable to myself alone. I won't always have friends but I'll have to live with myself until the day I die and there will always be booze.
