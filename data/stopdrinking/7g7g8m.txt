I am happy because I'm not scared. I have friends who will appreciate it. I have no desire to drink it. What's not to be happy about?! :) I don't want to sound complacent I know not every day will be this triumphant but damn I feel good today  ..Edit: colleague does not know of my struggle and does not need to gift was for Christmas

I get it!  I just got a big bottle of wine at Thanksgiving and I packed it up along with fresh eggs and some homemade snacks and gave it to my neighbors.
