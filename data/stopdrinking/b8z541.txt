Pretty sure this is an old AA gem quote but I heard it for the first time yesterday on [The Unruffled Podcast](http://www.theunruffled.com/the-unruffled-podcast). It's a keeper! So many of us struggle with residual shame from our drinking and it also speaks to those of us with crappy childhood memories we numbed with alcohol. ..Hearing those words spoken just about knocked me out of my chair at lunch yesterday. I hope it helps someone else. IWNDWYT.

Ya know...I've been reallllllly struggling with this lately and had a bit of a meltdown yesterday and I'm so happy you posted this. Quitting drinking was easy in comparison to trying to accept the guilt leftover from the past. Thank you. You helped me out today.
Wow!  Thank you for sharing this.  As a career drinker and almost 30 days sober  this is the absolute hardest part.   I have a lifetime of shameful behavior that I can't help but think about.   I have the rest of my life to adopt different behaviors. IWNDWYT!!!!..
