It's looking like I'm a chronic relapser I've reached out to a therapist in regards to a small group DBT program. Any insight/info would be much appreciated...Thanks as always SD this place is a beacon of positivity (usually I would say that sarcastically but for real).

I am in DBT group therapy. I originally went there for my mood disorder but my first thought when I got there was  they should be using this for addiction!  of course they do there's just not enough supply for the demand where I live...DBT is so much about impulse control &amp; dealing with difficult feelings two things that are huge in substance use disorder. I have no doubt DBT is helping me stay sober &amp; apply the techniques daily. I highly recommend it!!..There's some good resources on /dbtselfhelp here.
