I misheard some lyrics to a song on the radio (see title) but I think I like my misheard version better. I can't even find the song that the lyrics are was similar to but once I "heard" this it definitely resonated with me and is my new mantra...All the effort that it took to keep the alcohol in supply make sure I could get a drink (or many) in the evening getting upset when I couldn't get enough drinks and all that effort had I spent working on happiness I would be far better off. I struggle with dealing with my regrets and this is another one regret I have to deal with. But I'm far better off now not drinking to have a chance to deal with it rather than ignoring it and drowning my regret. I have a chance...I will not drink with you tonight.

I am sorry about the regretful feelings although I completely relate.  I have been feeling deeply regretful lately but I felt a bit better finally yesterday.  It seemed like I turned the corner a bit.  I thought to myself avoiding that regretful feeling could go on forever.  I would rather deal with remorse than deal with the physical and emotional hell I was putting myself through constantly.  IWNDWYT!
