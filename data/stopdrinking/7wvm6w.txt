I almost had a month down but relapsed on Thursday. Which continued until yesterday. I'm feeling pretty down but trying to get back on the wagon and fight for my life again. Alcohol has caused all my problems in life and I've realized I drank because of those problems. Just some quotes or words of encouragement will be greatly appreciated. Thanks and IWNDWYT

It's impressive how quickly you stopped after your relapse. It keep drinking for a good amount of time if I relapsed. That's why I don't do it.
