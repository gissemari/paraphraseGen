When I was first getting clean I had a good support group a job and just a lot of help. Now I've relapsed and need to move to another city am broke and honestly am unsure to turn to IRL when things get tough. I'm sure I'm going to rely on this sub a lot to make it through.

I'm the same. My relationship has completely broken down I'm broke and no one trusts me anymore. It's always darkest before the dawn it's hard to think about it that way but it gives me comfort sometimes. Just take the positives from each day. I went to a meeting there felt much better than if I did without. 
I travel regularly. There are meetings virtually anywhere I go .... towns cities other countries...I have a built-in family that welcomes me as soon as I show up and embraces me...I get IRL support!..Tried meetings?
Have you tried an AA meeting before? I would suggest checking out one in your city. Get a sponsor you can connect with and work the steps with them. Good luck in your recovery :)
