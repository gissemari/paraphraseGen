I previously could manage getting sober by tapering with beer but it stopped working for me I think my tolerance increased and I end  up super dehydrated and I loose my appetite. Last time I quit I went to the doctor who gave me a few milligrams of etizolam to take 0.5 mg 3 times a day. I was scared as hell to get addicted to it so I only took it for the first two days and I was back to normal. So this time I started getting bad delirium tremens and I am currently using it to get through the delirium but I am worried I will need it more frequently this time. It is working but I don't like feeling that I am on something - still it is better than turning back to alcohol. I need to reset my badge.

Man I'm sorry to hear you're struggling.   Have you thought about in patient detox?
Have you gotten prescriptions for this before? I usually stop getting dt's after 2 nights sleep but they've never been too terrible unless I take medicine to help me sleep
