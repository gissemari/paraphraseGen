[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** Because I drank for so many years and made such a mess of everything it's taking a long time to pull my life back out of the toilet. But I just landed an excellent freelancing gig -- better than I ever had while I was drinking. Of course I am thrilled to have some income but even more gratifying is the sense that I am slowly after more than a year and a half starting to put my life back together...**Struggle:** I was using a sharp woodcutting tool and it slipped. I accidentally cut a deep wound my hand and had to go to the hospital and get stitches. It goes to show that I can still have stupid accidents even while stone-cold sober. ..**General:** Presidents' Day Fun Fact: When Rutherford B. Hayes was president he would not allow liquor in the White House after he was horrified by people's behavior while they were drinking wine at his first presidential reception. Because of the ban on booze at the White House his wife was known as  Lemonade Lucy.  From now on I would like to be known as  Mocktail Mary. .
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: Gathered the courage to admit I have a problem. I've sought help from a therapist and SD. Big step for me...Struggle: In a long-distance relationship and my partner has mental health issues as well more serious than mine. She's being as responsible as possible but the worry and pain of separation are really overwhelming at times...General: Goddamn Reddit can be a nasty place. SD is lovely no regrets making a special account just for SD. Sending waves of gratitude to all of you wonderful supportive people here.
What up!..Triumph: I rehomed two of my goats today to someone who will be using them for therapy not only for himself but for autistic children as well. Goats have a hierarchy in their herds and these two (mother and daughter) were at the bottom of the totem pole but now they're queens of their castle in a great new home :)..Struggle: I think my Philosophy professor doesn't like me. Well I don't think he likes any of us. Everyone I talk to says he leaves similar feedback on their papers and such. He's a confusing man and the coursework is... different for someone going into a mechanical engineering major. Too much guesswork for me. My newly sober brain is a little fuzzy as well which doesn't make this easier...General: The world is a confused and convoluted place that's hard to navigate. Why would I make it more difficult on myself by drinking? Why add to the confusion and chaos?
Triumph:  A bit hard to think of one but being back here is good so I guess catching my relapse before it got out of hand....Struggle:  Aside from relapsing my cat has been worryingly unwell and it has hit me hard. Waiting for test results is horrible. He is ok in himself though and with meds is pain free so it's only me suffering. Bloody cats! ...General:  My cat is Houdini reincarnated. I locked the cat flap (vet's orders) built a fortress around it including multiple booby traps designed to make scary crashing noises if disturbed. I came downstairs this morning and he is gone. Fortress swept aside. There is going to be a strong worded conversation with him later. ..
**Triumph:** I've calculated my income for this tax year and I'm 50% up on last year which is putting me in a place where I can invest back into the business to strengthen my processes and marketing. I've no doubt that being sober has helped me achieve this...**Struggle:** My band is in a competition this weekend which means rehearsals most nights and little time for relaxation. I'm glad it's only once a year.....**General:** Booze-free Bone has a certain ring to it... 
**Triumph:** I got a new cat! And he and my other cat are getting along swimmingly even though they haven't known each other that long. They're cuddling and everything! I am SOOOOOOO happy about it! ..**Struggle:** My life is very much in limbo right now. I am up for a really big job that would *change my life* as well as balancing a bunch of incoming freelance work (lmao of course things get busy as I'm up for an opportunity that would make it harder to do that work). ..I definitely exited the pink cloud and I'm dealing with the messes--particularly interpersonal messes--I made before getting sober. It's only the start of what needs to be done but I'm doing it. Turns out having boundaries is hard. Turns out standing up for myself is harder. It has provided a better understanding of why I drank while dealing with this sort of thing but I'm grateful that I am present to get through it--because otherwise I would feel a lot *worse* about the circumstances...**General:** I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcuI6K9daIw) for the first time the other day and I cannot stop watching it (and dying of laughter).  ..
**Triumph:** 9 days sober! I know it says 8 but I submitted my request at a weird hour. Everything has been going way better been hitting the gym regularly and looking better already. I started up school after about a 10 year hiatus last year about a year ago I came to terms with the fact that I had a problem. Took me a year with many attempts to quit and have doubled my current record!..**Struggle:** The bad habits that I developed while drinking are still sticking around. Sleep schedule is still fucked but at least I am just tired and not tired *and* hung over. ..**General:** Very positive attitude for the future. Thinking about quitting my weekend job at a bar/restaurant less money but I'll actually get some days off to go out and really feel SOBER.
Triumph:  Made it a week!  8 days now and feeling good for the most part...Struggle:  Having issues with my tolerance (of people) level...General:  I get to go on vacation next week!  We are getting out of the Snowpacolypse that we are currently living in and going to soak up the sun in the desert by some hot springs.  
I have decided not to drink today.
Triumph:   This is the first time I've seen a Day 2 sober in longer than I can remember. ..Struggle:  Breaking the daily habit. Cravings. ..General:   So glad to be here with all of you.  I will not drink today!  Can't wait to log in tomorrow and see a little "3" next to my name.  
**Triumph:** Passed an arbitrary milestone. I'm both amazed and proud. I found a lot of help here on SD to get there...**Struggle:** I'm in the middle of an intense period of work. Sleep deprived and stressed but doing OK. I know I can regain balance soon...**General:** My friends who used to automatically order me beers or whiskey at restaurants now automatically get me ginger ale.
Triumph: What's up 8 months! 8 is my all time favorite lucky number I'm really thrilled to see my 8 star today :) ..Struggle: I don't eat animals or things that come from animals it's my own choice and I'm happy with that choice. But I had a bit of a mental break down the other day where I was nearly in tears because I wanted normal pizza with real cheese on it and chicken wings made out of chickens and a 12 pack to wash it all down. Why can't I be a normal person?!? I got over it I'm ok with my choices again and I'm pretty sure normal people don't drink 12 packs on Sunday afternoons anyways. ..General: Haha Mocktail Mary! I love nicknames it's like a form of endearment to me. I don't think my brother has called me by my real name in 20 years it's always Sis or Lemur (like I'm lame) or Ruckus or whatever pops into his head to call me by :) 
Triumph...I'm getting my finances in order and am planning ahead for the year. I've never done this before! ..Struggle ..I'm skint and it's rubbish. But it'll be worth it when I get out of debt in a million years time! ...General .I've just learnt that goats have a hierarchy in their herds!!   
Triumph. I stopped eating junk food at the same time I quit booze and I feel great. It's starting to finally feel semi natural to do things like shopping for groceries without hitting the chips aisle. ..Struggle. I got a good grade on a final paper the other day. I had written a paper about the discrimination against men in the field I'm in. Being in the final stretch of my education grades are starting to matter especially because it shows whether I'm on the right path in terms of how I'll do my bachelor project in a few months. Anyway after receiving my grade my first instinct was to grab my phone to call my grandmother. We lost her in October and it's really starting to dawn on me that I'll never get to share a big moment with her again and I'm really missing her. ..General. It's sunny and 7 degrees (Celsius). They're predicting large amounts of snow later this week. What a strange winter. 
Triumph: Waking up early today and feeling pretty good. And pretty soon I'm off to the second day of my new job!.Struggle: Staying sober once nighttime comes around and finding a good way to wind down tonight. Definitely open to suggestions!.General: Feeling pretty positive right now and looking forward to checking in with all of you later.
Triumph:  I am in the state of mind I haven't really fully been before.  I want to 100% stop drinking...Struggle: What finally got me do this point is a lost relationship.  It is tearing me apart on a daily basis.  I want to go back and redo so much but I can't.   I keep taking each day and can only make myself better.  Maybe things will change after I do...I cry alot...General: Glad I found SD.  Cheers to another not drinking day.
Almost to 2 weeks after 15+ years of daily drinking -- been traveling for work and in airports for almost half of this time. Proud of myself as I usually drink like a fish on the planes in the bars and at the hotels. I will not drink with you today. 
Triumph: making it to day 9; the longest I've been sober in years!..Struggle: my girlfriend is wanting to cut back on her own drinking but is finding it harder than I currently am. I don't know how to help her...General: I'm enjoying the stories and comeradery of SD and I'm very happy I came out of lurking and joined this community. 
Triumph: 50 days! Also taking big steps in my mental and physical health through all sorts of therapy. ..Struggle: Isolating myself from social gatherings with friends. I'm hopeful that one day I'll be able to go out and not think constantly about drinking.. .General: Just about to start marathon training. Since I ran my first last year hungover and basically just on alcohol fumes I'm hoping to beat my 4:20 time. I'm curious as to what this body can do properly fueled and healthy!
Hi SD!..Triumph: my partner (I guess it's fianc  now!) and I successfully booked our wedding venue. It's affordable and in a state park for August of this year. I'm excited about having gotten it-- it's got a stream and aspen trees and shade. ..Struggle: we're deciding what to do about having alcohol at the reception. The venue only allows 3.2% alcohol and I think it would be okay for me since I love my life sober but it is weird to provide it and not drink it. I haven't been in a brewery or liquor store since I got sober. Plus my dad is also an alcoholic who had a lot more experience relapsing so that's a factor too. ..General: I am busy as ever at work but it's great to feel needed!
Congrats on 650 days u/sfgirlmary!!! I hope the freelancing gig goes well and that your hand heels quickly...Triumph:    I'm finally getting back into work-mode and learning that MY life doesn't need to stop because of issues at home. Oh and my blood pressure is down to 112/72!!!!! Sobriety ROCKS!..Struggle:    I'm wondering if and when I'll ever be in a relationship again. I waited a year got sober adhered to dry people/dry places...and now I'm just kind of...in limbo. Huh...General:     I received the most beautiful package of gifts from a very very dear sober friend in celebration of my recent 1 year of sobriety. It contained wonderful things that ALOT of thought went into - each item was picked just for me. The card and message were lovely! I cried. It's things like this that strengthen my sobriety and make it all worthwhile! I love my sober friend :). 
Triumph - went out last night to one of my favorite restaurants with a good friend I haven't seen in years - we had so many fun wild nights - I drank sparkling water all night. .Struggle:  I wanted a drink more than anything last night.General: Woke up this morning with no regrets or fear.  Getting stronger everyday.  Have never felt or looked better!  SD has been a godsend to me and I am very thankful! 
Triumph:  Won a 3-set tennis match against a better player (at least initially) who was drinking beer between sets!  once I saw that I knew I _HAD_ to win that match &amp; would if we got it to 3rd &amp; did!..Struggle:  Focusing/prioritizing increased energy!  I feel like I need to make up for years of lost time/relationships/productivity (which I do) but it's easy to get overwhelmed &amp; frustrated.....General:  Saw Joe Walsh last summer - at one point between songs he said:  "I once got drunk for thirty years..."  I can relate...
Day 8 heading into 9 and feeling some great traction. I won't be drinking with you today.
Triumph: I got called for another phase of a job interview I passed the first two phases and this is the last part. Before I would have been filled with anxiety and self doubt now I know I can nail it. .Struggle: I had to get a LLETZ (LEEP for my US friends) procedure yesterday. I felt pretty sorry for myself and I got this overwhelming urge for a g&amp;t and cigarette. I mean I could feel the craving like a wave from my toes to my head! I had to pace around the house to try and shake it. .General: we have a storm coming called Doris - who names these things?
Triumph: spending more time studying ..Struggle: trying to get out of my own head and stop worrying about challenges that will arise in the future. Need to find alternatives to drinking which is a challenge as I feel every 20 something year old just wants to drink but they don't have alcoholic tendencies as I do...General: a lot of exciting news in the NBA. Great for me as im a huge basketball and football fan (NFL not college)
day zero again.  I only got trashed because I was bored. 
[removed]
**Triumph**: 4 days sober...**Struggle**: This has been more difficult than I imagined it would be. My partner and most of my friends drink regularly and most activities revolve around drinking. I'm afraid it will be so easy to give in and "just have the one." But I'll try to remind myself of all the multi-day hangovers and missed days of work. I don't want to continue doing that to my body...I'm struggling with hypothyroidism and liver damage is a big concern. Hopefully being sober will help me not feel like shit always. ..**General**:I've lurked here for a few weeks and I want to say that this sub has made it easier to work up the courage to quit. Thanks ya'll. ..I'm looking forward to not drinking with all of you!
triumph: back on the wagon :) just had a nice weekend in the mountains. i drank but didn't get out of control or sick or anything. still it affected my mood in the following days. so i'm happy to be sober again now...struggle: i really need to start a gym regimen!!! it's intimidating!..general: i'm watching the bachelor and it's super boring.
**Triumph:** I am yesterday +1 day sober.**Struggle:** Last night I had a full blown whoa is me nobody can help me all is lost drove to the store and was going to buy a sixer and have one. Or two or say fuck it all. Call in the next day and go for it. Bought a steak bag of taters loaf of bread pecan pie Weber grill and made a whoa is me dinner instead. Thought I was past this shit but the range of emotion is wider then ever. .**General:** My oldest kiddo's birthday is 2-22 so he has always enjoyed the day off before and mattress sales on his special day. Turned 22. He is two months sober from opiates which has a survival rate similar to ebola stricken cave diving so I am glad to have him here. 
Triumph: I have an excellent relationship with my daughter and love myself in an authentic way for the first time in my life. .Struggle: I just discovered the correlation between ovulation and craving. This makes for a few extra hard days a month- but at least I know when they're coming!.General: Looking forward to watching the new Maya Angelou doc.
Triumph: 1 week. That is a big deal for me. I have been getting out of control for a long time now. I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. ..Struggle: dealing with being alone all day in a town where I don't know anybody. We moved her for my wife's work and it is in the middle of nowhere...General: Pinball Wizard was written to please a music critic that would not give The Doors a good review. .
Triumph: I woke up early and exercised/walked my dog in the morning even though it was raining and I was tired. ..Struggle: My ex has been using my card info to pay for his gym membership the past 4 months and it triggered a lot of resentment I have toward him. I hadn't thought about him for a while and it's annoying he popped back up for some shady BS like this. ..General: Only 65 more days until I visit my current bf in Switzerland! Hopefully by then we will have a plan to live on the same continent again haha  
Not drinking for two days. Its been a trouble but its allright....
Triumph: Last day of work today at my old job. There were some tears (mostly mine). A former patient of mine who has advanced dementia saw me in the hallway and drew me to him in a spontaneous hug. He didn't know today was my last day and I didn't tell him then but he squeezed my hand and said "Go enjoy the rest of your life." Yep. I cried...Struggle: After a hiking trip out west I start a new position at a different facility. Their expectations are high and I am nervous about living up to those lofty expectations...General: Yeah so upcoming hiking trip to Zion. My husband is obsessively checking the weather a few times a day. Me? Don't care! Rain shine snow sleet...the landscape will be different and that's just what I need right now!
That's awesome. You just buy them from a special pet store? No license or anything needed? 
Triumph: Work wanted me to change schedules to another that is very inconvenient. I managed to actually say No- but compromised as well by offering to take a split shift- to cover the hours they needed and see my family.  I am a sponsor- and my recent sponsored moved away. I decided to get online and see I could help anyone out in the rooms. Turned teh stress of MIL's 1st surgery into a positive by helping others..Struggle; My husband's birth mother had heart surgery today and most of tonight- hospital acquired infection from a scary recent surgery. We are 7 states away.   ..General: Take what you need by giving of yourself.
