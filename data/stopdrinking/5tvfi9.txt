Even though my sleep schedule has improved a bit even though I'm an emotional roller coaster when my insane brain isn't being distracted 100% of the time. Even though work goes fine but as soon as the idle time presents itself the devil comes to play...I still have not drank because despite all that it's easier this way. I'm just struggling with massive anxiety when I have time that needs to be filled with activities. ..In my mind I think "Ok I have several hours and random things I should do. Instead I just procrastinate while the anxiety builds. Pacing the house for hours while listening to Spotify become common place...At least I'm not drinking. I've started reading the naked mind and have three months of pre paid talkspace therapy to help out. I still fear going back to AA for some reason. This sub is amazing but I feel like for my sobriety I need some more human contact because I naturally isolate and was a 100% home drinker...I remember it always being the hardest in the beginning...Thanks guys :)

That's the hardest part for me. I was the opposite though. I stopped at the bar EVERY night on the way home. I ended up knowing the bar staff and regulars better than most my family/friends. They became my friends. Going home after work without the social interaction with people has been nearly impossible. 
Good luck to you. I have the same issues with constantly moving and thinking. Meditation works really well for me - just simple stuff - 10 minutes of guided meditation a day. It always amazes me when stillness makes for more stillness in my mind instead of making a massive urge to do more.
