i found out my estranged father died on the 2nd of january. i haven't spoken to him in two years. i haven't seen him in 10 years. he was an alcoholic and i found out he was very close to being homeless. i have been trying to stop drinking for a long time. i've gotten much better in terms of frequency but still have issues with binging. i have probably reset my badge 20 times. i haven't drank since i found out my father died and i really would like to make this time stick as the reason i didn't have a relationship with him was because of alcohol. i also don't want to end up like that. i am going on a trip this week to pick up his belongings from a strange place/person and spread his ashes in the rocky mountains. i am struggling but i know that no matter what happens drinking is not going to make anything better. when i come back i am going to find a therapist to help me with my feelings and alcohol recovery. i know this is going to be an extremely difficult week but i am finally ready to do what it takes to be sober.

I cannot imagine doing this alone. Do you have anyone to share this burden with you?
8 days is great
Internet hug I'm glad to hear you are ready and willing to do this sober. Drinking won't make anything better and we want you here with us :)
