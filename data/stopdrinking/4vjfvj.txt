I made it through the weekend without a drink.  That may not sound like much but I had some incredibly strong urges on Fri and Sat.  ..It really helped to share my struggles with my girlfriend  who I love very much. Simply vocalizing my feelings was a great help and her wonderful support gave me strength...I will not drink with all of you great people Today!!
