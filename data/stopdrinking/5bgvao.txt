Hey all. Going back at it with day one. On Friday I drank a litre of vodka and told my girlfriend and mum that I wanted to die. Yesterday I physically fought my roommate to go out and kill myself. He showed up just two minutes before I planned to leave. I'm physically dependent on alcohol now but can't afford to go to detox. I'm just hoping the withdrawal isn't too bad and if it starts to feel serious I'll nurse a beer (how I detoxed last time). I'm 24 hours with no alcohol now. I was sober for a year and a half and have been in relapse for three months. I got 5weeks in a hospital crushed finances destroyed self worth and seriously fucked up health. I don't remember the last time I didn't feel either drunk or hungover. Ah well good luck to the rest of you and wish you all a safe and sober 24.

What are your plans to protect yourself from alcohol?                    .I saw a doctor and was given medicine to make withdrawal safer. The money saved from not drinking can pay for an office call. ..Kudos for 1 day!
I am so sorry you were hurting that way while drinking..I am VERY grateful you didn't go through with your suicidal thoughts..I am also VERY grateful you are back posting here...You are in my thoughts I hope you will forgive yourself...and find the faith in yourself to keep moving forward...I believe in you I look forward to things improving for you...
