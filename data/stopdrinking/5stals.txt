Not really sure why it hasn't been a bad morning.  The last 7 days have been relatively easy to get through and didn't really have any cravings.  Feeling pretty good actually...All of a sudden this morning all I can think about is walking into the break room and grabbing the bottle of vodka that I know is sitting on our fridge.  I literally have to tell myself every 3 seconds to calm the fuck down...Anyway just needed to put that into words for some reason thanks for reading.

I'm feeling much the same way. Just keep telling yourself that this is temporary and that that good feeling will return.
Ditto day 7 was rough and now I am having the urges again on day 9. Guess I just haven't really started seeing the benefits of sobriety. The relationships alcohol has ruined are still ruined instead of waking up hung over or groggy I am just flat out tired due to the trouble sleeping that has started since I quit. Just have to realize it going to take time to see the true improvements physically mentally and spiritually. Stay strong we will get through this. I will not drink with you today. 
I'm on day 8 too and I'm feeling the same way. I had a few fleeting thoughts about returning my soda bottles so I could buy a cheap pint of vodka. But instead I put on Netflix and logged on here. We can get through this. It'll be worth it. I will not drink with you today! 
Day 5 here and having my first bad cravings. I won't crack but I'm failing to distract myself either. Every. Single. Thing. Is a trigger. Stay strong. I won't drink with you today.
