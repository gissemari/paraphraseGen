During this relapse of around 8 months I told myself I could moderate. And so many times I only had a couple. You all know how that goes. By the end I was losing control more often than not. Yeah I had a couple of blackouts made an ass of myself missed several days of work due to hangovers worried my friends and family. By the end I had pain in the area of my liver nearly every day and was too sick to participate in any activities during weekend days. ..That demon in my head that other "me" is trying to tell me it wasn't so bad. AA says it always gets worse? This wasn't anywhere near as bad as the last time I quit. No legal problems public urination loss of relationships. And it was only a few months. And I didn't even drink in front of most of my friends most people didn't even know! ..In my mind somehow I wasn't *really* drinking. I stayed home and mostly didn't bother anyone. I've worked hard to keep a casual attitude about this little experiment...why make a big deal of it now?..I'm writing this down so I can see how ridiculous it is. I'm hoping to take some of the power away from this fractured narrative. I'm lucky that I didn't have to go down any further this time. I'm grateful to have this forum to help me.

Ah yes...the clever cunning deceitful Voice of Addiction. The Voice is one tricky bastard.
Listen to your liver. It speaks the truth.
&gt; *I'm writing this down so I can see how ridiculous it is.*..Good plan I like it...I know if I started drinking again I would probably have successful control for a while. But I'm sure within a few months I'd be back to daily drinking 8+ drinks.
I'm glad you are here for support. This part that you wrote is "really" Drinking. You have the freedom to not make it any worse moving forward:..&gt;I had a couple of blackouts made an ass of myself missed several days of work due to hangovers worried my friends and family.

**It's not alcoholwasm.. it's alcoholism**..I like that one because it does always stay.  This is a thing there is no cure for.  If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it does it still make a sound.    I will not be drinking today.  
I don't know how relevant this is for you but there's a great quote from the movie Candy about addiction:.."When you can stop you don't want to. When you want to stop you can't." Casper..From what you've outlined I suspect that if you're honest with yourself you fall into the latter category. It's your life and your choice you can be an addict and accept the consequences I know I've done it for years. I also know it doesn't feel like it but it is a choice you may have genes and life events against you but can choose not to drink...Try to take this latest relapse as part of your process to getting to place where you don't need alcohol in your life..Well done on making the choice to not drink and for the time so far. Good luck moving forward.
