This time feels different...I've reset my badge multiple times changed my username etc..etc..It's only been a couple of days but I am serious this time. I've decided to give up the fact that I know nothing..and swallow what I think I know about everything. (which I think is a huge part of my continual relapses) What I will do differently this time is be more present make my sobriety my number one priority and just start being there for others eventually because that is where I get a lot of my confidence from. I need to start changing my actions and my thoughts will follow I've surrendered to fact I can't trust my mind. I'm tired of the agression anger hopelessness and selfishness I have been wallowing in. I'm taking a tough love aproach to myself and finally once again be a person whose practices what they preach and quit lying to myself.

Hey right on man. I know one really weird thing I had to change about my routine for me when I entered early sobriety was exactly what you talk about and that's being open to possibly being wrong about a lot of things.   I found myself considering trying things that I never imagined myself doing like praying meditating volunteering my time going to AA meetings and just generally trying new things. Don't let these things scare you at first they helped me a ton. I tried quitting way to many times with just self-hatred for my previous actions and in the end it just wasn't sustainable. Good luck!
Good luck!
