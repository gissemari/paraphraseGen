Does anyone ever feel triggered by songs? I was just relaxing to some Kenny Chesney and the lyrics are a big trigger for me on weak days. Sun the sea and cold beer...sigh. I remind myself I can have the sun the sea and a mocktail & still be just as happy...Sometimes I struggle with the "feeling uptight" and wanting to just "let loose."

Ehh sometimes I remember certain songs I listened to when I was smoking with friends or using other substances but I just kind of think about the fun I had but also remember that it did lead to bad consequences. I pretty much just leave it at that.
I stay away from those type of songs. No need to feed into society's addiction to alcohol. I have come to believe alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs of them all.
