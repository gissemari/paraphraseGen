I am a girl and walking home at night alone is already an adventure. But last night we had a Christmas party at my job and I completely lost it. I realised this morning that I have a problem. I want to stop drinking and need some tips so my chances of relapse will be smaller.

Here's one of the things I do.....Every morning before my feet hit the ground I promise myself I'm not going to drink today. I speak the words. I repeat that promise to myself a few minutes later in the bathroom mirror. I speak the words again. Then while I'm having my morning coffee I browse /r/stopdrinking and I make the pledge again this time with about 150 or 200 other folks in the Daily 24 Hour Pledge. [Here's today's.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wwz8a/daily_checkin_tuesday_december_15/)..Each time I make my promise I visualize my success just like the elite athletes do. I picture myself going to work going to meetings and lunch coming home after work (that's a big one) doing chores and running errands having dinner etc. all without drinking. I check back to /r/stopdrinking about eight or ten times a day. I read other people's stories I offer them encouragement and support and I often write about my own journey to see what they might have to say about it...Welcome to SD!
Welcome /u/iamasparklyunicorn to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  Good luck to you.
Realization is a huge moment now one day at a time friend. You can do this!
Fellow lady here -- I'm embarrassed to say I did this many times and it wasn't the mental kick in the pants that it should have been.  Kudos to you for recognizing the red flags.
hi and welcome! I'm also a woman and about a month ago I did exactly this for the seven billionth time. (approximately.)..it took decades for me to realize my problem and admit that I really wanted to get better. "forever" is daunting so I'm taking it one day at a time. this sub has become a positive fixture in my life. there is a ton of great advice here shared struggles and support. I highly recommend committing to a day of sobriety in each morning's check-in thread. ..I'm open with my husband about my journey and struggles which helps us both. he doesn't drink much and I doubt my sobriety would be successful if he did. I also find lots of things to focus on other than alcohol: reading hiking/walking cleaning the house playing music interesting teas and NA mixed drinks writing/calling friends and family... when an urge comes I remind myself that it will pass. when the guilt and shame of past misdeeds weigh on my mind I try to stay compassionate toward myself and focus on how I can change *today*...I hope you stick around! you can do this if you want to stop.
