I can't believe I'm an alcoholic. I just never thought I would be in this situation. My mother was a severe alcoholic drinking since she was 12 or so. She eventually met my dad but was a full blown alcoholic. He took to a treatment facility nicknamed "ralphing hills" where they forced you to drink until you threw up then made you drink more. She could never smell Scotch again without gagging. ..She ended up with severe pancrititis and didn't think she'd pull through in her 20s. She did and kept on drinking and smoking. She was drinking by 8am everyday and smoking 2 packs a day. As I grew up I swore I'd never do this behavior. I was so disappointed in her. I didn't understand why she would do this to herself and her family. She tried committing suicide a few times when I was a teen she got 3 DUIs and eventually was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She passed about a year after diagnosis at 50 years old. ..It's scary now that I'm 30 and I've been modeling some of this behavior. Alcoholism is a constant struggle a disease that I wouldn't wish on anyone. Keep your heads strong I know I'll keep trying. Here's to day 2.

Congrats on day 2.  With all that on your plate i think it is so great that you have 2 days sober.  I wish you the best and am  sending you a big hug.  Best of luck to you.
My drinking was really scary towards the end. I was relieved when someone told me that I never had to drink again. 
I completely empathize. My mom is an alcoholic and no disrespect to alcoholic moms on this subreddit but it really wreaked havoc on my childhood...And yet here I am. Also an alcoholic. It is actually help me build compassion and empathy for her. &amp; I feel proud to break the cycle.
I was so sure I'd never be like my mom either. Oops. Let's be sober today shall we?
