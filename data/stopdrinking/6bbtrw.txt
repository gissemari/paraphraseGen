First off I want to say that there's no way I'd have gotten even as far as I have without seeing my therapist for the last couple of years. I was in a descending spiral of booze and pills from the age of 21 until 35 and in the two years have managed for the first time to really understand why I drink to take positive steps to get better to maintain motivation after relapses. It's been slow sometimes frustratingly so -- but in the last 365 I've probably been sober for almost half of them which while not perfect by any means is something that would have seemed impossible just a few years back...But man seeing him is draining and I often find myself wanting to ease myself back into normal life by drinking after sessions. Doesn't help that the bus drops me off right in front of my favorite watering hole just long enough for me to lose sight of my priorities and talk myself into going inside...Anyway. That's all. I'm seeing him in three and a half hours.

Oh I hear you man. Just the other night I told a friend that when I take risks in my performances I feel really weird and uncomfortable and want to stop doing it. His response? "haha...sounds like that means you should keep doing it!" I have a feeling he's right...I'm trying to lean into the discomfort a little bit. After all discomfort is why I drank so much in the first place. I'd rather just take a nap or something these days. :)
