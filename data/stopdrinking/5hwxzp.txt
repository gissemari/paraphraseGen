Good morning everyone. Long time lurker first time poster...This week I will have to confront one of my biggest fears of sobriety...returning to work. ..Quick backstory I was heavily drinking for about a year. It started as a way to relax after long stressful days at work it quickly escalated into drinking all day every day just to get through the day. Even when the days weren't stressful I needed it just to maintain. It didn't matter if I was at work at home running errands out with my wife I needed it... I knew I had a problem but because I never let anyone else know what I was doing I had no one to reach out to and could not do it on my own. I thought I was doing a good job hiding it but the day I always feared finally came to be someone reported my behavior and I was given the choice to enter a company monitored program to get clean or be terminated...I took the company program and feel I have made huge strides. I've stayed clean have had limited cravings and overall just feel much healthier physically and mentally...However this week is the big day...after about 14 weeks out of work I must return and face everyone. I don't think I've mentioned yet I'm also their manager. ..I keep going back and forth on how to handle the situation. Part of me would love to just walk in drop the "I was out for medical reasons" and hide behind HIPPA laws to take the easy way out. But as their manager I don't see how that will build any trust with my team. There's nothing authentic about it. Obviously SOMEONE knew about my actions otherwise it wouldn't have been reported and thinking back on it after the "fog" has lifted I don't see how all of them couldn't have seen it. Not to mention I know if I don't come clean I'll likely be very active in my own head wondering what they think they know what they're saying and overanalyzing every potentially snarky remark...On the flip side though I don't know if I'm prepared to let it all out yet. I still feel shame about my actions and I struggle with the stigma that surrounds alcoholism. If it's as simple as me just letting it out and everyone being understanding I'd probably be fine. But I don't know what I'd do if I encountered any pushback or people questioning my actions. I know not everyone is going to be as supportive as my family counselors and AA groups have been...My employees are a group that has been through alot. They've had four managers in the last year. Most of them have stuck through it all but I know before I got there they were already having trust issues with management given how bad the turnover has been. I definitely did not help that with my actions which led to me being put out of work.....Counselors have mainly advised just to say what I feel comfortable saying. One counselor took it a step farther to say just to briefly touch on why I was gone but avoid specifics. My boss suggested just to keep it vague and use phrases like "bad choices" and "mistakes I made" rather than admitting but that seems insulting to those who know...Ugh. I don't know. I know I've overanalyzed this way too long. All the worst case scenarios I can come up with are probably never going to happen and aren't even that bad. But I can't help but continue to freak out about it...I'm sure this is all over the place. I just needed to get it out there and I am much better at communicating through written words than speaking in front of a group. If anyone has advice wisdom words of encouragement whatever to share please do. ..Thanks for reading.

I am also a manager of a great team and let them down when I was in the process of getting separated so I can relate.  If I were you I would just say that you needed to take that time to focus on some challenges you were having with your personal life and health.  I don't think you need to share all the details and they probably know anyway.  You could say something to acknowledge that you weren't able to perform up to your standards before you had your break but you're looking forward to supporting them the way they deserve now that you're back and maybe that you appreciate them keeping all the balls in the air while you were out.  I'm sure it wasn't easy for them.  So in other words I would focus on acknowledging how my actions impacted them but try to provide some reassurance that things will improve.  But you should not feel embarrassed at all for taking the time you needed to work on your sobriety.  So many people struggle with the same issues but don't have the motivation or resources to get help.  That's great that your work was able to support you with that program although I'm sure it wasn't welcome news when you found out!  In a few hours this work day will be over and this will be past you and then tomorrow will be like any other day.  Good luck!
I don't think there is a "wrong" way to handle this. Whatever you feel comfortable with is the best way to proceed...You did/do have an illness. This illness affected your work. Nobody needs any more information than that IMHO. ..You will make it up to your team by being 100% present from here on out...I will not drink with you today my friend.
