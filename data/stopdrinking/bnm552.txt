Over 2 weeks sober now and I'm really struggling with feeling detached from my husband and kids. Sure I'm mentally feeling more clear not being hungover and I'm definitely sleeping better. But far out... I think I'm having that classic  fronting up to reality' feeling. .Hb and I are getting through a pretty stressful time with him finishing a masters degree this month and we're about to start building a house. We've been griping at each other more than usual. But I can't shake this feeling that I just CANT STAND TO BE AROUND HIM/THEM. .I'm feeling like a truly awful human right now. .It's Mother's Day today too. I'm hiding in my bedroom avoiding dealing with anyone. ..I don't really know if there's anything to say other than part of me really wishes I could numb away this crappy feeling. But a bigger part of me is resolute that I won't/can't. Guess I'm stuck with my crappy emotions today. ..Thanks for reading *sigh*

Congrats on 17 days! You are changing in so many ways right now. Now is not the time to be making any important decisions. Give your sobriety time because it take it to sort lots of things out. I numbed my feelings for so many years that it has taken me time to really feel them again and see reality again. You will get through this and be happier for it! IWNDWYT
It took me about a month to start warming up to everything and everyone but really hit a stride in months 3/4. I'm closer with my wife and kids than probably ever before now. ..Have you seen a doctor and brought up these feelings?
