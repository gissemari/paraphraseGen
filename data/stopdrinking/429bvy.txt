I'm located in the Mid-Atlantic which is currently getting hammered by snow. Often times there is a large association of substance use with winter storms or other occurrences that require people to remain home-bound...From a clinical standpoint I was surprised when the counselors at an extended recovery program I attend mentioned that their largest attrition rates follow closely after a winter storm. The fact that there is not only a number of relapses but there is a number of individuals who fail to return to recovery is frightening...So if you're stuck at home now or will be in the future make a plan and have some numbers handy (if you're alone). Try to segment your day (1 hour reading 1 hour TV etc.) to break up the monotony. Most importantly when you get through the storm don't put your recovery aside and keep a good schedule for at least a few days until everything is 'normal.'..Good luck!.Cross post from /r/nomore12steps

This is a great reminder that I can't let the cold me a reason to ski meetings. Let's all stick in this together.
