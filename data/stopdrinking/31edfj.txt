Hi all been a while since I posted been very busy with normal life stuffs but I'm still alive and still sober. Right now I think I've reached a point where I no longer identify myself as being anything alcohol-related (alcoholic/reformed-alcoholic/whatever). I just don't care about anything related to alcohol at all anymore. Maybe someday that will change and I'll be back here crying for help but right now life is good and I'm just a normal (hah!) person who happens not to drink anymore and everyone in my life is cool with that. ..I hope everyone here is healthy and peaceful and enjoying their sobriety and for those struggling to get there time really does smooth over the rough edges. Only advice I can give is do whatever works for you and remember to breathe. ..Peace and love!

Sounds great. I think it is a very healthy thing to get past the labels and get on with life.
