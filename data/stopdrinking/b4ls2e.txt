When I got my second DUI almost 8 years ago I gave myself a choice: get my license back or quit drinking. For many years I chose to continue drinking and adapted to life without driving...Now that I've been sober for almost 8 months I'm starting to think about getting my license back. If I make it to a year I might consider the possibility more seriously. ..I've found so much freedom in sobriety now that I'm not drunk or hungover all the time. It would be nice to have the freedom to travel to visit friends stop having to take the bus or walk to work or to go for a drive just about anywhere on a warm summer day with the windows down. ..Most days I barely think about drinking but I feel a little scared and anxious at the thought about driving again. What if I relapse? ..So I am going to focus on not drinking today since that's what's helped me get to where I am right now. ..

Your drives will lead you to better fun exciting destinations and not to the drinking holes. That is my wish for you. I appreciate your reservations until 365 for consideration. You make me proud! IWNDWYT
