I'm struggling I have a friend in ICU right now. For the first few days I was the only person to visit him as his family doesn't really care. He has had depression and pushed away most people close to him. He wasn't the best friend to me since he was going through so much but I never let him push me away. I have well managed depression/anxiety...but this week has really been hard. I spent the morning at the hospital. I cancelled all my obligations for today. For this afternoon I plan to take a hot shower attempt the gym and maybe read a book. I have so much anxiety for him. Thank you for reading my post. I will not drink with you tonight.

You are an amazing friend/person. I hope you know that. 
I will not drink with you this evening I hope you manage some rest take care
How sad.  Thanks for sharing.  I won't drink with you tonight.
I second that you are an awesome friend and he is very lucky to have you. And also to be in a place where he is hopefully most likely to receive the best care possible. Try to take some comfort from the fact that you really are doing everything you can and be good to yourself. I hope he recovers as much and as quickly as possible and I am not drinking with you!
