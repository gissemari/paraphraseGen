Over the last several years I have struggled with depression and anxiety. I used alcohol multiple times per week for years to cope with my issues but it just made things dramatically worse. I acted irrationally hostile and impulsively. I hurt and took advantage of many people I cared about because I was only concerned with myself. I never consciously wanted to be that person; that's just the loop I was stuck in at the time...Alcohol to calm anxiety -&gt; anxiety worse when hung over and tired -&gt; take caffeine to wake up - &gt; become extremely anxious -&gt; drink to calm down and repeat. Not to mention how it impacted my diet exercise work and social life...Today marks 200 days without a drop of alcohol. I've also reduced my caffeine intake to one or two days per week. My mental health has significantly improved. I'm much more calm &amp; collected than ever before. I consider how my actions impact others and work to improve myself daily. It has not always been easy but it has definitely been worth it...If you're struggling with an addiction do not hesitate to reach out for help. Speak to someone you trust; a therapist medical professional or support groups. Read a book on the subject or read and share your own stories on reddit.com/r/stopdrinking (this worked for me)...Whatever you do don't just ignore your problem and let the addiction ball roll into the abyss. Break the cycle if only for a minute; an hour; a day. You owe it to yourself to be the best version of you and you deserve to be happy. Take action even if it's baby steps or just admitting that you have a problem in the first place. Being honest with yourself and about your situation is the key.

*don't just ignore your problem and let the addiction ball roll into the abyss.*..This is everything.  Thanks for the reminder.
Congratulations! ..I was never a selfish person until I drank. Drinking made me so so selfish. And anxious and depressed. ..I like being sober and having a clear head and having the confidence and ability to just be me kind compassionate and caring. Thats just who I am.
Congratulations buddy. A lot or your pre-sobriety is very familiar to me and I can agree with the difference it makes.  Stay strong and keep going!..I will not drink with you today.
Congratulations- so good to hear about your success. You will be inspiring others today. ..I also recently realised that I cope with stress and pressure so much better now.  We are going through a very tough time at work right now and a colleague recently asked me how I am able to be so calm and relaxed.  I never imagined this would be one of the benefits - I just figured I'd be healthier and have less of a belly :-)..I
