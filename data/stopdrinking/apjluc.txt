Hi All..I have been here a few times in the past but not for awhile. I had always found it so supportive so I'm back. Here is why I've decided to come back...Last night after drinking with SO we got into an argument which has become more frequent and typical lately. He essentially said to me that I have been mean and vindictive to him but it's only when I'm drinking. And that hit me like a ton of bricks. That's not who I think I am and absolutely not the kind of wife I want to be. How could I be emotionally abusing someone I love so much? So the only solution I can think of is to completely quit drinking...I'm not asking him to quit drinking. This has to be a thing I'm doing for myself and my marriage. Historically he drinks significantly less when I'm not. But I know it's going to be a struggle because we often enable each other or make excuses for each other. He is supportive of my decision and he has his own separate issues with alcohol. The comments have already been made suggesting cutting out specific things or making excuses for other extenuating circumstances. I know this all comes from a supportive place and he is much better at moderation than I am I guess I just needed to vent about it..Anyway thanks for reading.

I totally feel where you're coming from here. Being the partner my SO deserves is a large part of why I don't drink any more and why I don't plan to. I was occasionally mean but much more often I was just completely absent. Not just detached but so far away that I might as well have not even been there. Of course there were a thousand other reasons I needed to quit but this one has given my sobriety a lot of life. Hurting myself is easy...hurting my SO is the worst thing I can do..  I'm glad you've got your husband's support. I enlisted my SO's support early in the process and it's been extremely helpful. She also still drinks and I can tell sometimes she wishes I was able to enjoy some wine with her or go out and get silly. But my honesty with her in the beginning about how hard it was to quit has kept her firmly in my corner even if she's baffled by the idea that one drink could be a bad idea. .  Best of luck to you on your journey!
