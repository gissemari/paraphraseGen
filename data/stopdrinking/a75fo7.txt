Might be a trigger for some but it does shed a lot of light on how alcoholism has been an issue in this country for a very long time. The movement wasn't just puritanical but saw that men were abusive couldn't provide for their families and were prone to mental health issues when drinking took control of their lives. ..I'm not advocating for it to be illegal again it's just interesting to watch this series as someone who has struggled with a drinking problem.

Wow thanks for letting me know! I will give it a watch.
The motivations behind prohibition are fascinating. Incorrectly placed on only the availability of booze but it was a big cornerstone of the same women who organized the suffrage movement. Abuse family abandonment and illness were the big concerns for them. ..As an alcoholic though I'd be pretty determined to find it wherever I could get it if I was still active in my addiction. 
Good to know. Will check it out!!
