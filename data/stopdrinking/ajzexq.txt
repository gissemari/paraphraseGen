One of my biggest struggles with any length of sobriety usually comes from a sense of finality- this crushing sense of ZOMG I WILL NEVER EVER EVER be able to drink again EVER. I come here to re-center back to that one day at a time thinking and found a huge grounding sentiment that I wish I could appropriately credit:.."Why would I worry today about what drink I'm going to have with my dinner when I'm 65?" ..These little reality checks are so helpful to me so if you have your own version of one day at a time to share it would be much appreciated to stick in the vault.

I guess it's related in an obscure way: I've never gotten up in the morning and wish I'd gotten drunk the night before.
"I have never had a problem that could not be made worse by drinking." Peace
Another reditter wrote this recently "Drinking is a way to pass life not engage and live it."
In the morning I ask myself if I want to get drunk today. The answer has always been no.
For me it's trying to remind myself that the  future  I'm stressing about isn't real. It's just a product of my brain. What's real is today the 24 hours right in front of me. And I'm not gonna drink. ..  If tomorrow does come this guy has a mofuggin Chip to collect!
I like to tell myself that maybe tomorrow I can but for today I'll try something different. Always tomorrow. Not today.
I can't get to day (goal) without getting thru day (today).
