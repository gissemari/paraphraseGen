I've been lurking here for a while. I want to say thank you for this subreddit. It's been part of my recovery. It's given me a safe place to hang out when I can't to an AA meeting on any given day...This is my fourth or fifth shot at sobriety. But this time feels really different. I'm sober because I want to be instead of doing it for others and I've been feeling really great lately. It's kind of amazing because my life is still as chaotic and stressful as it was when I started drinking to blackout but I'm serene and happy. That was never the case with my previous attempts...Relapses are evil. But in my case I think I had to go pretty far down to finally wake up and admit that I am most definitely an alcoholic...So I'm done lurking. Thanks for the badge. :-)
