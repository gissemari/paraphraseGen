I woke up at 4 pm. Work was cancelled today. I waited till 7 pm to start my 12 taper beers. It is odd that my body is getting so used to the new schedule. At just a few over my taper. I felt really hungover. I was kind of scared. This is my body telling me. Yes you need to stay at 12 until you can go lower. You need to stop. I find it kind of comical that right now I am struggling not to drink more. I find myself telling myself yes it will make you feel better. Yes it will make things more interesting. Yes it will make your existence better. My real self tells me that it will not. So we are looking at 4 days of work and then 1 day of being stupid. I cannot afford to drop. I must continue. I must taper. I can do this. I have begun to do this. I will do this. Once again I hope everyone is doing alright. This is just another update on my situation. Thank you for all of your support.

Tapering is very very hard because it requires us to control something we have no control over. It does work (I tapered) but it's not fun. In retrospect I think I would've been better off going to a doctor and getting the necessary help to quit cold turkey. Just a thought. All the best to you. 
Think about all the money you spend on beer. Even cutting down you must be saving some cash. An office visit and some medication doesn't cost that much. Your life is worth it. This doesn't have to be so difficult. ..And many thanks for the update. 
There is free or low-cost help out there. I'm seriously worried about you.
