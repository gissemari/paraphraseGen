Just spent an hour on the phone past midnight over here talking to my best friend. About how I'm struggling to cope with learning all of what happened while I was in a coma how devastated my friends and family were but mostly the hell my mum is still going through with my dad's out of control drinking. ..This is so stupid but I was watching a soap earlier it was centred around a funeral of a teenager and how utterly broken their mother was by his death. I so nearly put my own mother through that she had to consider my funeral she went through the worst experience of her life. ..I started anti depressants again last week so far they are definitely helping me sleep but I still end up sitting alone late at night (it's now 2am) thinking about everything. I started crying so hard watching that funeral episode I threw up haven't done that since I was in hospital. ..I haven't been tempted to drink I'm very thankful for that. I have a new routine every day I go to the Spanish cafe on my road and have a coffee. Across from where I sit (outside in the sunshine!) is the AA meeting hall. There's an AA logo on the door. I stare at it drink coffee and read this forum on my phone. I wonder what people would think if they could read my mind as I sit there. I'm out of work at the moment signed off sick as I'm still too weak so going there gives me a reason to dress and make myself presentableI put on nice make up a pretty sundress jewellery. I'm trying to be normal. If people could tell how damaged I am and how I'm clinging on so hard to stay healthy and sober...this is so hard...I'm sorry to rant I'm writing this more for me to get it out than anything else selfishly. I'm really hoping the meds start lifting my mood soon and I must do something about my diet I'm not hungry after being fed by feeding tube for so long my stomach has shrunk so a cup of milk feels like a full meal.  I've lost 5lbs in 4 days 80lbs since becoming sober in Feb. It's great right now as I'm overweight but I can't control it and it won't be long before I'll have to. ..Sorry my head is full had to make some room.

Good for you getting out and about.  I know when I hit major depression it's so hard to make my self get out of the house.  Just getting clean and ready and out by other people is really great even if you don't feel it right now.  Being critically ill can make people very depressed the sense of loss of control.  I know when I feel that vulnerable and down that it takes awhile to get all the way back and functional.  My appetite and strength increase as my depression goes down.  You have been through a lot congratulations on being sober.  It gets better!
Why not go into that meeting one day? You'll find people who understand what youre going through. What really helped me was physical exercise. I would just make sure I went for a walk everyday even for only 15 minutes and it would help my mood. Good luck to you Missendi!
