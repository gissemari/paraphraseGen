I hadn't had the ability to stop drinking for years. As a person with bipolar It fuelled my depressions and added fire to my mania. When I was taking my medications at night with a bottle of wine (after I had already finished another bottle previous to that) it hardly ever crossed my mind that I was drinking too much. That was until I started feeling sick all the time. The pains in my sides. The awful nights of barely consistent sleep. The time I fell down the stairs.....I finally admitted to myself that I was probably going to die from alcoholism - or I was going to kill myself - and that I was okay with it. As the depression I was in got deeper so did the drinking. Until I couldn't think of anything other than drinking and death. ..So instead I called my Dr. and he told me to go to the hospital right away. I spent the last two weeks in a psychiatric ward. I receiving treatment for my bipolarism got my medications under control started attending both AA (non-religious) as well as separate substance abuse group. And as per most wards I got to spend a lot of time doing crafts. ;)..It's an everyday struggle that I'm glad to take. I carry my 24 hour white chip around in my pocket and it reminds me how grateful I am that I got help...TL;DR 2 weeks today!.
