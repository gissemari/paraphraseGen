[When I hit 1000 days I shared a wall of text if anyone wants to read it here it is. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4l5fym/1000_days_a_look_back_at_my_life_wall_of_text)..At 10am today my phone pinged with a calendar event I thought I knew what it was; opening my phone I thought I would be reminded of the race I had later today but no the calendar entry was for 2000 days sober. I sat down the second I read it and just couldn't believe it I knew I'd been sober for a while but it only seems like a few months ago I hit 1000 days...During this time I've become a running coach I've completed my first marathon (Sunday just gone) I have ran in over 30 races both on road and trail all due to the fact that I wanted to prove to myself that I could. I've learnt that I'm not as emotionally stunted as I thought I was that I can allow myself to have a better relationship with friends and family if I just let them in instead of pushing everything away and keeping it hidden. ..In the last 1000 days so much has changed me and the girl who got me sober have separated and I'm now living on my own we've got a couple of dogs I'm part way to getting my running coach qualification I'm in the best shape I've even been in me and my daughter get on great I've got savings in the bank but that monster is still there right in the back of my head. No amount of running new friends positive changes to my lifestyle will get it out and I'm okay with that. But this isn't a post about how I feel I'll never be a belt I classify myself as a fully recovered alcoholic or how I'm sure that the risk of me becoming addicted to painkillers again has passed...This is a post to say to everyone who is just starting out on their journey to sobriety that it's okay to be scared it's okay to worry and wonder if you're gonna fall over or have bad days where you think it's all going to shit. It is those days that proves just how strong we can be we can take hold of that voice in the back of our heads and say 'No not today I want to win and god damn I'm going to'. I can tell you that even now more than 5 years in I'm am still fighting those demons all the time but it is the strength we have together not alone that proves to the world that we can change! I want you to look yourself in the face and tell you that they will not win you will. No matter how much it sucks or how much you think fuck it all I'm gonna drink I want to just stop for 5 seconds take a deep breath and think about what you're capable of when you put your mind to it...I will not drink with you today nor tomorrow nor ever again...Until the next milestone my friends.

I needed this today. Thank you!..&amp;#x200B;..Congrats on 2000 days!! And on absolutely rocking at life!
2000 days is a huge effort and something for a lot of us to aim for. Well done :)
I'm very worried and scared and wondering if I can/will do this so I appreciate you mentioning that it is okay to feel that way. And great to see that you made it so far. I can't imagine the amount of days and moments you passed through being worried or scared. After 5 or 6 months of working to pull myself back up I can't believe things are still this hard. So I'm glad to see it gets easier and I'm glad to see that it actually can be done. Very happy for you nice job!!
Incredible. ..I'm a bit of a noob with the zeal of the converted. I constantly tell people "OK you're now starting your path of not drinking remember to fill your time." Is this good advice? ..&amp;#x200B;
