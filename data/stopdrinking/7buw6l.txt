Today if officially the longest I have gone without a drink since I started drinking over 13 years ago. I relapsed on July 4th after 64 completely dry days which was my longest streak up until now. I didn't think I would have the strength to start again so soon but I did. Now I'm back to each new day being the longest I've been without alcohol...I know that the number of dry days shouldn't be my main focus; I take one day at a time. But what is great is the fact that I keep trying. 2017 has been a major year for me in terms of not drinking. I've made 4 attempts at quitting since Jan 1st. Combined I have over 6 months without drinking this year. That's HUGE for me! ..Looking forward to spending the rest of 2017 sober!

Congrats!
Congratulations! I get what you're saying. Different  various aspects of this sobriety business seem more significant at certain times. ..Not drinking with you today!!
Holidays are the toughest.  Let's get through Thanksgiving and Christmas together.  I will not drink with you today.
Congratulations! I'm proud of you too! 
This is what I'm doing. Second time heading towards 47 Days. I was kind of disappointed and had a really hard time quitting again but I looked at the calendar and am so impressed I see a month and a half twice in one year which is a miracle.
