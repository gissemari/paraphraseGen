I've had a super busy day and all I can think of is a swift whisky.

Hang in there :) .... .I tried at the beginning to feel grateful for all such thoughts and see them as an opportunity to practice not drinking...somehow I imagined that one day the cravings would hit me hard because of a loss or challenge that seemed too insurmountable sober and I thought every craving I had lived through beforehand when I had more strength would help me in that future day. That day has yet to come but I'm sure it will. 
Wouldn't be just one for me sure it would be some kind of release but so are many things. 
You can do this!  Do you ever do anything else to relax besides drink?  If not now might be a great time to explore some new options.
This is why I stick to AA...No matter how awful I feel I can hit a meeting or get feedback from my network...Easier to do this with a team.
