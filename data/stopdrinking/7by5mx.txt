My last drink was on October 10 2011. Things have come a long way. I met and married my wife had a daughter that will be two in January bought a home got a job that I'm happy at and so much else to be grateful for. ..Every day has been a little easier than the last. I don't have many serious thoughts about drinking anymore. Sometimes nowI wonder what the attraction was in the first place- which seems impossible after how hard i found it to stop. I struggled with alcoholism for years- from my teens until my thirties. I know from experience the destruction that is waiting for me if I have that first drink. As long as I stay sober things get a little better every day and it all builds on the days weeks and months before. I never want to go through those first days of sobriety again but I am somehow thankful for the humility and kindness toward others that the struggle of recovery has helped me learn. I'm thankful for all the support that I have gotten from others in recovery here in SD in AA and anywhere else that I've found people that were also trying to make sense of life after alcohol. ..Not much else to say but I've posted here on SD every year on or around my sober birthday and I don't want to break the tradition! Thanks!
