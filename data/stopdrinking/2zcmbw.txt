I have now been sober for two weeks. Odly the struggle for me is not the alcohol. Every other time I tried to quit I had to avoid going to the store after noon or 1pm. I had to a ois going to the store alone at all cost. But this time I feel different. I don't quite see things the same. I don't crave it at all. I am at odds with my substance. I don't feel drawn to thd liqueur isle. And I don't get that " Ooh  beet sounds good." feeling  anymore. I am angry with alcohol. Sound silly I know. But I am sick of being controlled and I'm taking me back. I had my first AA meeting yesterday and now I have a book to read. So if I don't keep my posts current and updated for the next couple of days that's why. Thanks /f/stopdrinking for encouraging me and empowering me with the courage to start the path to autonomy.

Thanks for posting this because I was thinking about this the other night. Every time I see a beer or drink I actually get angry. It's like looking at another person that wronged you for so long in disgust. ..Congrats on 2 weeks! 
Also just hit two weeks. I feel the same way about it. I drive by multiple liquor stores every day and don't even think about stopping. Congratulations on two weeks! We got this.
