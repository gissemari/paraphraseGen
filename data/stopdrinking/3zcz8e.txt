I'm an avid and detailed dreamer. I expected relapse dreams. (Side note: has anyone ever heard the Mike Doughty song "I'm Still Drinking in my Dreams"? Accurate. [here's a link to a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTUAkBRat6c) all I could find on youtube)...Anyway I expected the dreams; I've had two this week and they don't worry me or bother me overmuch. What I didn't expect was the accompanying anxiety over having to reset my badge. ..I love SD. I love being part of a community from my hair to my toes all the way down to my subconscious...Not drinking today - no matter what I do tonight in my dreams.

I kind of enjoy that immense relief I get when I realize I haven't relapsed that it was only a dream. It reminds me of how devastated I would be if I threw my sobriety away.
This place is pretty darn special isn't it?
