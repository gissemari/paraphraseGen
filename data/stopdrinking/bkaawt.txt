I've read the line: rock bottom is when you put down the shovel. I read it many times and one I can relate to. I was a great drunk. No one knew my wife suspected but does not know the depths that I sank to emotionally. I stood on the edge of the abyss ready to jump in and willfully lose myself to alcohol. Instead I walked away. Thanks to SD and my wife. Now I struggle with how to live a sober life but it's a struggle that I embrace. ..Thanks to all your love and support SD.

Well done to you. ..I really like that line. It's so true yet never thought of it like that. Makes me feel powerful. Needed to read this today. ..Thank you.
That line is what changed it for me. Rock bottom is where you stop digging. Don't know why that clicked I think it gave me the understanding that you can stop before you lose it all.  Thanks for sharing!
Oh I too want to jump in and willfully lose myself into the abyss of alcohol. Sigh it's just not worth it.
What's SD?
