I haven't been here for weeks. Mainly because I've been drinking again and didn't have the courage to look at anything here. I'm a mess and the break up has made it even worse..

You need to regain balance without the aid of alcohol or other drugs. Breakups suck and alcohol won't change that. But you can find something that's more important in the grand scheme of things. Sports work hobby religion... Whatever works for you. You need to figure it out yourself. ..Just stay away from alcohol from now on. Take whatever you have at home and pour it down the drain. Don't go to a bar. Don't drink with friends. **You don't need alcohol** because it cannot help you. Only you can help yourself. Try to stop worrying about the breakup. It's not the end of the world. You'll find someone else in the future. 
I feel your pain. I recently got out of a long term relationship and used alcohol heavily to cope. I used alcohol extensively before as well. Just know that you are not alone through this fight and do your very best to take it one day at a time. 
My girlfriend left me over a year ago because of my drinking. I tried to stop at first but drank myself into oblivion to get over it. It didn't help. I miss her exactly the same today and last time I saw her. Drinking never helped anything I just wanted to die. The only thing that helped me was going to AA meetings. Stay strong
