I've had lots of sober holidays so I don't have any struggle in terms of giving a crap about drinking...This holiday I am particularly grateful for sobriety because my husband's grandmother had a major stroke on Christmas Day.  I am in the healthcare field - while I am not a medical person I know enough to be able to translate medicalese for the lay person.  I have been able to spend lots of time in the hospital for the last 3 days and have been able to help with communication re medical information with all the extended family...I'm especially grateful to have the opportunity to just sit in the hospital and hold my husbands hand...I've been through this already with both my grandparents and so glad to be able to offer my experience strength hope and a quiet presence and kind attention to these lovely people and my wonderful husband who has given so much love to me...If I was drinking or indulging in other addictive behaviors I would not be in a position to give of myself generously which I think is all that really matters in the end during tough times.

That's one of the things I've enjoyed the most about being sober. Actually being in the right state to BE there and offer myself when needed. I missed a lot of opportunities activities and events all because I was too inebriated to go. Congrats for being strong and offering your love. Pray everything works out well for you and your family. 
This is such a powerful post about mature sobriety at the holidays.  Thanks /u/algohn for showing the way.  Hang in there pal.
You sound like a rock. I'm sorry to hear there has been an illness in your family.
