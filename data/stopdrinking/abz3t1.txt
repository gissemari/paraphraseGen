Day 1 wasn't as bad as I imagined. I had a hard time falling asleep had some mild shakes sweating and kept waking up throughout the night. I am starting to get anxious. There is a 30 minute window when I could grab a drink after work tonight. I may stay late at work again to to avoid this window of time. I plan on staying strong and I  will not drink with you today.

Hang in there the first few days are the hardest!..Keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Do what you have to do to beat back the temptation.  I know you can do it.  IWNDWYT.
Google Campral to stop drinking! I swear by this medication. 
For me the first week was hell physically speaking.  Once I got through that I was able to tackle the more deep-seated issues.  .
You can do it!   Just stay focused on getting through the next hour.  And drink lots of water take your vitamins and get some exercise.    You got this.
