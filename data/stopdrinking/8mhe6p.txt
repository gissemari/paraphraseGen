In the late hours and early mornings...I creep...on here for my nightly and daily motivation.  No one knows but you guys this interesting collection of all of us that have come together in support when those around us aren't enough.  I am going on two months now and there are days that are a struggle.  Such as all of the new "firsts." First concert first party first day at the beach with friends first cookout...they all feel like new experiences and they are scary because I have to address why there's not a drink in my hand at every turn and hoping that I continue to be strong enough not to pick one up. I think I was so good at hiding my problem that even my husband doesn't understand my need to stop and I haven't admitted to him the seriousness of it. I just said I am taking a break and my struggle is internalized. I didn't mention all of the hidden alcohol over the years that I was drinking to every glass of wine that he actually saw.  So I turn to you guys.  Thanks for being there!

Thanks for sharing! Stay strong :)
So many firsts! Weddings. Holidays. Birthdays. I'm traveling to San Francisco this summer...flying is going to be a BIG one for me. After every first I always come out on the other side and realize "Uh...that wasn't so bad." The worst part about it was the anxiety in between my ears.
The anxiety about the first sober everything is crazy! First sober flight? Waaaaaaay better than any drink flight I had ever had. I still get that little twinge of anxiety but it's so much more manageable as my number of days sober grows...Cheers to many sober firsts this summer! It's going to be amazing!
