I've dabbled in AA but it never really stuck.  I really enjoy being around people struggling with addiction issues like myself but something about the vibe of the few I went to in the past didn't really compel me to stick with it...Recently I started getting that as my therapist puts it "stinkin' thinkin'".  I decided to check out a few more meetings recently.  They were alright and now I know it's something that I really do need in a way in my recovery.  Felt good to go but not great...Today? Went to a women's/LGBT meeting and oh my gosh I finally found it!  We talked about the 11th step and instead of hearing everyone talk about God it was Earth and the Universe.  For prayer most people talked about working in their garden and minfulness.  There's no Lords Prayer at the end just the Serenity Prayer.  ..If you're in an area with a lot of meetings don't give up! You might be lucky enough to eventually stumble upon that meeting for you! I finally feel like I can start my recovery journey with a group of people and I am so excited!

Took me a while to find my two "tribes" but they're great!
ound my tribe too with an OMAGOD group. That group reminds me of SD but IRL lol. We do the "I am responsible" thing at the end  Glad you found something that jives with you...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg).
That's great! Keep coming (or is it going?) back! 
There is a meeting out there for everyone. Mine is the agnostic/atheist AA.  
This is great news! I've been to a few AA meetings in my time and although I've enjoyed them I've never really found one that 'clicked' and never found any strong connections within them which I feel has always lead me to drinking...I am going to try a SMART meetings on Monday and then get to more meetings throughout the weekend. 
 Congratulations. This is truly worth celebrating!
Thanks I'll be checking this out tomorrow
