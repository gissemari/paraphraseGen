** Day 2 **..After a mostly sleepless night I have made it into day 2 of sobriety. I have taken days off every other week or so for a while so this is not entirely new territory for me. The part I struggle with is stopping myself from rewarding my  good behavior  with a drink tonight. ..I guess I have always known I had a drinking problem but I had amazing ways of lying to myself and convincing myself otherwise. I am 26 and would exercise around 5 times a week and kept in good shape (could have been great if it wasn't for all the booze). I had a good paying job and amazing girlfriend and supportive family; but was still finding myself stopping by the store every night to pick up a 12 pack or a fifth of liquor. ..I never got the full hung-over feeling that most others suffer from. I would not be bed ridden all day if I had drunk too much the night before. At the time I thought this was a great trait to have but now I see it just added to my addiction. ..Its almost painful typing this out because I am finally faced with the fact that I actually do have a problem.  Thinking back on all of the red flags in my past that I just brushed under the rug. At the time I thought nothing was wrong and was sure no one else had a clue but now I get so embarrassed just thinking about it. ..When my girlfriend left me I knew I needed a change in my life. I quit my job and moved to Central America to run a restaurant and surf. I thought I would be able to reconnect with nature and this change in environment would break me of my old habits and old drinking buddies. I did not anticipate the amount of free time I would have on my hands when we would shut down the restaurant for rainy season. ..So here I am in the jungle drinking more then I ever have trying to feed this black hole that won't be filled. I knew it was getting out of control last month when I would drink and not be happy smoke weed to try to enhance it but that wasn't enough then I would get some coke and see if that was what I needed but I still felt like something was missing. ..Nearly every night I was drinking until I was physically unable to drink anymore or would run out of alcohol. I would try to force my self in bed early after a few drinks but then would pry myself out of bed and go pound some more liquor. As I would wake up each morning in a fog and go check the damage I had done to the liquor bottle I realized I needed to  slow down ....Every morning I would wake up with my head pounding ashamed thinking  it's ok you just had a wild night and you are not going to drink today  but every night as the sunset I would find myself making another excuse to start drinking again. ...Drinking has been such a big part of my life for so long that I am unable to see how I would live an exciting life with out it. I feel like I need it to reduce my social anxiety and it helps me meet new and interesting people. What I am realizing now is it's stunting my social growth and these  new and interesting people  are just fellow drunks that I don't feel judged by. ..I think I was scared to admit to myself the truth for so long because I didn't want to imagine living my life with out being able to drink. I still have not told anyone that I struggle so much with addiction and am trying to sober up. I feel that if I tell my family/friends and I am unsuccessful in quitting or figure out a way to cut back significantly they will always judge me any time I have a drink. ..I know that I have so much more I can accomplish in life if I just put the booze down and focus. So this is day 2 I am nervous but I am excited that I have finally accepted things about myself that I have been trying to hide for so long. ....(Probably will have to delete this soon too scared someone will track it back to me)

I am not going to drink TODAY (or tonight) no matter what happens good or bad.  If I were at all in doubt about my resolve I would be in an AA meeting or hanging on the IRC chat with the great SDers there.
&gt;The part I struggle with is stopping myself from rewarding my  good behavior  with a drink tonight...I overcame this problem after I read Allen Carr's Easyway and accepted that drinking is no reward. Alcohol is a powerful poison that damaged my body mind relationships education career and finances and provided zero benefits in my life. I may as well hit myself in the head with a hammer to reward good behavior.
Hello and kudos for starting this journey. AA meetings helped me "put the booze down and focus". Give it a try. 
So I have made it through day 2. It was actually much harder then I thought because I was invited to go grill out at a friends house. I decided to turn that down knowing the temptation to drink would be to high. Looking foward to day 3!
