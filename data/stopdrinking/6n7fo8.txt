Hi all! I was sober for two months and even got to the point where I wasn't thinking about drinking at all for days. I relapsed last week and it's been harder than ever since. ..I was so positive the first time around when I decided I really needed to stop letting alcohol control my life but this time I can't seem to get past even one day. Is it always harder after you relapse? Does anyone have any advice?
