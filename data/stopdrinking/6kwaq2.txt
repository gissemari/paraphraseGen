Possibly triggering if you're affected by self harm. Stay safe!..*..*..*..*.So I had a rough night in terms of self harm. Usually getting drunk goes hand in hand with self harm and vice versa. If I'm not already drunk when I self harm I'd surely get drunk on my way to the doctor to get my wounds checked...But tonight I didn't drink. Not before not after not even on my way to the ER. Now it's 1am over here I'll try to sleep and I'm sober...So tonight wasn't quite as good as I wish it had been and relapsing is is always bad but it could have been much worse. I'll focus on one addiction at a time..I don't need to reset my badge and I surely won't drink with you all today!..Edit: spelling and stuff

Sending lots of love and support your way there friend keep at it.  One step at a time one foot in front of the other.  Before you know it you'll have covered a journey much farther than you ever thought possible ..Keep at it!  Don't be too hard on yourself we all have our struggles
I guess everyone here is guilty of self harm in the guise of alcoholism. I'm sending out some positive energy and good thoughts for you my friend...I will not drink with you today.
