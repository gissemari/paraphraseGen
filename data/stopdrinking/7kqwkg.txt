I did something that makes me feel horrible about myself for probably the 500th time. I missed an obligation for school that I know is going to upset someone and possibly cost me down the line. Last drank yesterday (last drunk Saturday/Sunday morning when I woke up). Not drinking today. Damn it. I feel so anxious and guilty now. Shame is a big part of my why I ever chose to drink in the first place but I feel bad on the inside when I do this kind of shit. Shame-spiral. This isn't too bad considering I have two DUIs from 2010/2011 and have driven drunk a few times since then.

To quote the check-in of today:..&gt; You're not going to master the rest of your life in one day. Just relax. Master the day. Then just keep doing that every day...Quitting from cigarettes to drinking often involves relapses. It's part of the process. ..There are lots of wins here:..* You have an internal conviction that *this is not a good course of action*.* You actively adjust your follow-up behavior to change your course.* Any dry day still counts and still forms the majority.* You get to know yourself and the traps this road is lined with..You got this. Just keep coming back to it. Practice makes perfect.
