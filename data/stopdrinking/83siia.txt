In the past I have always looked forward to the time change in the fall. I have spent many late mornings waking up completely hungover and just dying for the sun to go down; I suppose the brighter it was the clearer it was to see that I had a serious problem. Because of this I was always happy to see the time fall back an hour during the winter leaving the sun to set around five. This year I am sober and am really excited about the extra hour of sunlight- more bicycle rides more walks more woodworking more life. ..For those who are struggling remember to take it a day at a time and eventually the days will become so enjoyable that you stop counting them.

I wish we would do away with DST. It serves no purpose in the year 2018. None at all.
