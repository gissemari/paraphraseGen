Previous attempts to quit were unsuccessful because I tried to keep it a secret.  This time it feels different.  After my earlier post about seeking treatment and admitting that I am an alcoholic I had lunch with my mom and sister and I shared with them my journey and the fact that I am an alcoholic.  There were tears and support.  The next day I had my assessment for outpatient treatment.  This weekend I sent a text to my entire family admitting my alcoholism.  The message went to my sister brother in laws and adult nieces and nephews.  Within minutes I received phone calls from my nephews and offered their support love and respect.  I heard from everyone.  I also shared with a few close friends.  Today I filed for short term disability with my company and had a good conversation with my boss.  ..I have had moments of great anxiety too.  Last night I spoke before a group honoring survivors of the Holocaust here in Kansas City.  It was the day after the Pittsburgh shootings.  It was tough.  I just imagined my struggle pales to their journey.  The anxiety was almost crippling.  As I was rehearsing my remarks my mind was begging me to go to the bars in the back of the room for a drink. gave in by getting a San Pelligrino water.  When the evening ended I was so relieved.  I also felt a great sense of accomplishment...This time I am facing things directly and reaching out for help.  Thank you and I won't drink with you today.
