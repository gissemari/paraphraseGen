It's been 5 days since I've drank or took drugs.  I'm in my 2nd night of insomnia.  My sober friends tell me it will take some time to get to a place where I will sleep through the night.  ..I'm struggling now with so much anxiety.   I'm going to a meeting at 7:30am which I know will help.  I also have a job interview at 3pm that I'm not 100% ready for and that is also giving me anxiety. I'm also coming to the realization that the people I used to party with don't seem to give 2 shits about me.  I see now that I was only being used because I always bought beer and drugs for everyone.  Now that I'm not around anymore... silence...  it's a real shitty feeling...Anyway I'm definitely not going to drink today or anything else for that matter. I realize now that the drugs and drinking were just masking feelings but my emotions are so high right now.  I'm feeling very low and worthless.  I know it will pass I just hope it happens sooner than later because I feel like I am dying inside
