Hey guys!! Hey guys!! [Happy Wednesday](http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/53621867.jpg)! ..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. For a little inspiration [peep the remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs5QJi-dX-4). ..**Triumph**: [Well since you asked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3evu2t/cake_for_all/) :)..**Struggle**: I have three IRL people I can *really* talk to about my struggles with sobriety. It's so amazing and wonderful to have them and I get so much out of our conversations. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be that open and honest with everyone in my life. A year ago it would have been inconceivable to consider bringing more people into my "circle of trust." Now I'm wondering if that isn't exactly what I need right now. ..**General Chat**: I'm enjoying spending time each day thinking about one little thing in my life that I'm grateful for. Today after a morning run through what felt like a [warm wet swamp](https://uncivilpeasants.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/8rblg.jpg?w=490&h=538) it's air conditioning. And cold water that comes directly out of the fridge. What near-invisible thing are you grateful for today?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Struggle** I've been battling a strange stomach flu. Finally up and about today but it's been quite painful. ..**Triumph** 2 more weeks of class. So close I can taste it! Heading to Mexico for 10 days of surfing! ..**General chat** it's going to be weird without /u/cake_or_radish in the sidebar 
**Triumph** I hit 11 weeks which is crazy. I had my biggest disappointment in sobriety yesterday (see below) and didn't even consider drinking. That's the first time in my adult life I had a problem/disappointment without drinking.  That's huge. ..**Struggle** I was up for a promotion.  There were only two of us going for it.  They gave it to the other guy. My pride has taken a massive hit.  It'll be ok but I'm really disappointed. ..**General Chat** I'm getting really into the whole AA thing lately  which is really surprising. I was *so* anti everything about AA - reinforcing that I'm powerless the idea of a higher power meetings with people I thought I was better than  etc... Well now I'm taking what works for me and leaving the rest and loving it.  I look forward to the meetings.  I got a sponsor who is so nice and funny.  He actually texted me when I finished work asking if I survived being back at work since finding out about the promotion (see struggle above) - so nice that there's someone looking out for me!
**Struggle** Still don't know for sure if I offended or alienated anyone around me during my last episode this past weekend.  Still see cool guys in movies with confidence and money and booze in hand all of which I want...**Triumph** Saved a surprising amount of money when going out to dinner by not having drinks...**General Chat** Uh how about that Eurozone crisis?
**Triumph:** I am sober on my 18th day which may be the second longest period since the early 90s. The best part is I am really working a different plan this isn't just a random lottery win. I am feeling my motivation to do things and improve my life return...**Struggle:** I am not really feeling it. I wake up tired and uninspired. The hours right before and immediately after the end of work have seen some cravings but I keep working my new plan and going to bed sober...**General chat:** I am enjoying the clarity of mind and the return of motivation. I have to keep myself reeled in though. I have had a tendency to expand past and forget what's getting me here. I can work hard and exercise but only after I have my eyes and mind firmly fixed on sobriety as the foundation. Other than that it is a cool summer morning the window is open and the skies are blue.
I love these posts and it is sometimes a struggle to figure out what to say which makes it even more important. ..**Triumph:** A post yesterday got me to thinking about karma. I was lying in bed this morning thinking about it. I'm not thinking cosmic reward but more "We get out of life what we put into it." What I invest in is what I will get back. For me it brings me some comfort and guidance.  ..**Struggle:** That little voice in my head reads the Triumph above and says "How's that for some Zen bullshit?" ..**General Chat:** I spent about a month in Ukraine about 10 years ago. I enjoyed it but also came to appreciate a lot of little things like air conditioning coffee that was brewed not having to spend an hour going over Russian vocabulary to go to the market and strangely enough - sliced bread. We take a lot for granted at times and it is always good to reflect on what we have. 
**Triumph** It's been 3 weeks since I started this (with the exception of a 1 day relapse). Between not drinking and cleaning up my diet my blood pressure has gone from the Red Alert Danger Zone to the Code Yellow Warning Zone. And I'm down 8 pounds. Seeing physical results is a huge motivation for me right now...**Struggle** Living with an SO who still drinks. He's very supportive and encouraging of my decision (when he's sober) but at the same time I think he misses his drinking partner. Trying to establish boundaries but it seems to all go out the window once he's started drinking :/..**General Chat** A small thing that I'm grateful for... fizzy water! I enjoy normal water too but Polar Strawberry Watermelon seltzer has become my nightly treat. 
**Struggle**: Now that some of the high from not drinking has passed I need to address some underlying issues. This is where I usually get stuck. I need to set aside some time each day to focus on moving forward towards the things I feel are important to change. Worried I won't get there...**Triumph**: Took myself out to dinner for the first time since I stopped drinking which used to include a couple of drinks. It was more difficult than I thought so won't be doing it again soon but I stayed sober.OH AND GOLD STAR TODAY YAY!..**Chat**: Struggling with my feelings for my girlfriend. She's a wonderful supportive person whom I really like and it's a healthy relationship. But my feelings aren't getting any stronger beyond affection and we've been dating nearly a year. Trying to decide if I should cut it off for both of our sakes (she's in love with me but knows I'm not feeling as strongly and is accepting of it right now). ..I'm currently appreciating a comfy bedroom in a beautiful house - very grateful for my living situation! 
Struggle: I have to go out to breakfast solo cuz no ones free and I need real food. I used to work in a restaurant; idk why I think this is embarrassing .Triumph: I'm not giving up and keeping a more positive attitude thru challenges. What's the point of thinking Ugh this will never get better instead of Hey life's hard let's get through this the only way out is thru. And i reached out to my mom for help..General chat: I'm hungry; food has becoming very important time now that it's the only thing I ingest.
**Triumph:** I set a goal for myself to cycle 1000 km this season (I did 667 km last year) as of yesterday I've done 1121 km so I'm raising my goal to 2000. I've rekindled the passion I used to have for cycling and it feels great!..**Struggle:** I had some weird nerve pain going on with a filling I had done recently and I have pain in my jaw/neck. I got it fixed yesterday but my neck still hurts...**General Chat:** I'm off work next week and heading up to my cabin really looking forward to it!
One week ago today I had had 3/4 of a bottle of wine by 6:30 a.m. and later went out got a 1.5 litre of wine and just sat there sucking it up. That was it for me. Next day I knew I had to stop-was in the Slough of Despond. White-knuckling the withdrawal and eventually ended up in the ER on SUNDAY (FOUR days later-thought I'd be out of the woods by then!) with my BP at 164/100. So...today in comparison to LAST Wednesday is the difference between Hell and Heaven. SO happy to be in Heaven today :)
Oops guess I didn't follow the format but I won't repeat my story-will just try to get it right (reading things properly might help doy) next time. 
**Triumph:** I think I'm starting to figure out which meetings I'd like going to on a regular basis. Multiple meetings a week feels important right now and I actually don't feel bad about it which is cool. They help me feel like I'm not the only crazy person in the world and that I'm not crazy at all just lost right now and maybe there's a path for me after all. Also last night my SO forgave me for the fucked up things I did drunk and seemed to be truly wanting to not hold resentment towards me. He was very concerned about me and said that like he just wants me to be at peace and even if he ends up not in my life or if I don't live with him (things that have been causing conflict between us) that he can accept that. Anyway. The triumph there is that I didn't go "aw what the fuck ever you don't mean it you'll change your mind I don't deserve this I should just gtfo" I can see that I have someone here who cares about me getting better and is trying to be mature and supportive and my first impulse was not to self-sabotage. It was just to be grateful. ..**Struggle:** Think I want a sponsor but don't know how that works what if we don't get along like I thought we would what if I can't open up or I let them down. I need to register for school and I *was* super hopeful and excited about this but now I'm afraid what if I can't do homework because of suicidal thoughts or something... I'll logic myself back though I'm just being dramatic and scared. ..**General Chat:** I just finished The Penultimate Truth by Philip K Dick and holy shit it's one of my all time favorites now. I got another book by Ursula K LeGuin called The Telling. I'm kinda on a dystopian /post apocalyptic/sci fi thing this year actually I think that's just my favorite genre. I'm just super excited to be reading again. If anyone has any book suggestions that would be cool. 
**Triumph**  I went to my first spin class last night!  I haven't done any physical activity remotely that strenuous in oh I don't know...10 years?  It meant pushing past my anxiety getting out of my comfort zone and doing something new with a roomful of strangers (except the friend that brought me).  I felt really self conscious about being so out of shape but I surprised myself by keeping up with the rest of the group for over half the workout.  ..**Struggle**  Food.  I've finally realized that I've been substituting evening binge drinking with evening binge eating.  I'd be open to any advice on this topic if you've got it.  I read a few old posts from this sub that were helpful already...**General Chat**  I think I'm ready to take the plunge and go to my first AA meeting.  How common is it for people to go to their first meeting after having months of sobriety under their belt?  Any words of wisdom about going for the first time?.
**Triumph:** My GF and I moved in to a place big enough for her one and my two children. We are all going to meet my parents in Sep. 1st Time since 2006 all my sibling will be in one place and 1st time ever our kids will meet each other.    .**Struggle:** Anger management. I really struggle with finding middle ground I am either not angry at all or irate quickly. I'm not scary mad anymore but its annoying to everyone around me including myself. Phases like these seem to come and go though.    .**General Chat:** Can't wait for football season all I will say is it is a good time to be a Buckeye fan:) 
Struggle: Detoxing sucks. I haven't been able to put a full nights sleep together since Sunday. ..Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday I'm not going to drink today. Small steps for now...Glad you guys are here. I have a hard time speaking in public so its nice to be able to write and read as opposed to be speak. Though I'd like to be able to speak at meetings eventually. ..
**TRIUMPH** I'm all set to go back to school to finish my associate's degree- finally sober and actually *ready* to commit to my education!..**STRUGGLE** I've been dealing with chronic pain in my lady business for quite some time. My doctor recommended that I have a hysterectomy which is all set for a week from Friday! However my work is not being super supportive so I'm waiting to hear from HR about my recovery time off needs. That's pretty stressful but I'm still not drinking!..**GENERAL CHAT** We had a couple of wonderful overcast/rainy days here in Portland over the weekend. It's set to return to high '90's today but I'm ready for it. Plus we have a realtor coming in a week to talk about listing our house so we may be moving back to the hometown sooner than expected which I'm very excited about! And it's only 19 days until my sober anniversary!..Hope everyone is doing well on this lovely summer day.
yup
**Triumph**: I was in the shower this morning and suddenly thought "I haven't thought about drinking today." I'm not sure what's weirder that I happened to think that out of the blue or that I've apparently been thinking of alcohol first thing in the morning for so long that it's noticeable when I don't...**Struggle**: I'm having a horrible time pain-wise for some reason this week. My joints keep swelling and my lower back is *killing* me (and back pain is one thing I've never really had to deal with). I'm actually surprised that I'm not craving a drink more than I am. It is giving me little thoughts of "what's the point" though which are fortunately pretty easily quashed at this point...**General Chat** I'm starting to see a huge difference in how I perceive and use time. For the longest time I've been frustrated with trying to figure out how I can simultaneously do *nothing* and also somehow have no time whatsoever to do anything else. It seems like time is starting to stretch out the clearer my head gets. And not just when I have a drink in my hand but all the time. I just don't feel overwhelmed by literally everything around me. It feels a little weird honestly.
**Triumph:** Things are good. Making some progress on house and work projects...**Struggle:** I seem to have developed allergies this summer. I don't react well to antihistamines--I've had a full blown allergic reaction to one and others keep me wired. My sleep is suffering...**Chat:** I'm working on expressing my gratitude out loud and to other people. Today' I'm grateful that that is a struggle I can work on.
.**Triumph**: 999 Days sober today!!!!!..**Struggle**: Eating healthy and exercising. Time to lose all that weight from the past few years.
**Triumph:** Waking up isn't an hour-long muddle through several cups of coffee and I'm up and about with just a glass of water.  ..**Struggle:**  Falling asleep has been difficult and staying asleep is even more so given all the restless dreams and nightmares.   ..**Chat:** I really like the taste of coffee now that it's not a wild careening hop from depressants all evening to stimulants all day.  I have started appreciating the nuanced taste of coffee and savour it more even as I crave less of it.
**Struggle:** My weight continues to be a major struggle; I am especially confused that after not drinking for 100 days (and all the eating the went along with my drinking during and especially after) I have lost 0 lbs.  I'm going to the gym 2-3 days a week which isn't enough but my heart is not in it.&amp;nbsp;..**Triumph:** 100 days of sobriety! Generally feeling more balanced and at peace.  Having huge successes at work..&amp;nbsp;..**General Chat:** From time-to-time I still feel the urge to drink but do not feel the desire if that makes sense.  It's like an instinct to drink under certain (many) circumstances such as being very a happy very sad etc.  As time goes on I find myself reflecting on what being drunk feels like and I can honestly say I'm losing connection with why I would want that.
**Triumph**: I've completed 30 days without a drink! In that time I've come to realize just how bad my depression and anxiety are. Without the distraction of alcohol I'm slowly getting to know myself and am beginning to learn how to best manage my issues. ...**Struggle**: Now that the 30 days are complete I'm not quite sure what to do with myself. I'm heading off on a camping trip this long weekend and will be surrounded by booze. Part of me is entertaining the thought of having a beer or two per night. The other part of me thinks I need to maintain my sobriety. Feeling quite lost....**General Chat**: Today I'm grateful to be alive.

**Triumph:** I've been gradually adding to my "tool box" and now it includes - full honesty with close loved ones and some friends becoming actively involved with the /sd community a new counselor a friend who has been sober for ten years to act as my "sponsor" and today I will be ordering the SMART handbook. Honesty feels good man and so does finally finally beginning to *work* on this problem. What I've done this time around is different. I did not give up drinking this time; I began working on recovery with a passion. ..**Struggle:** I'm a bit focused on this new road in my life. I am having trouble balancing my work demands because right now all I want to do is read learn discuss and take "me-time" to be kind to myself as I start to heal. I've been really tired (catching up for years of disturbed sleep cycles?) and letting myself sleep if I need to. But with this comes less productivity right now. I feel like I am neglecting my work. ..**General Chat:** I'd just like to thank the moderators of this forum for all their **hard work** and skillful approach to this forum. Your level of dedication is very apparent. I for one recognize all the work you all put into assisting this community and I just want to say thank you for your patience consistency humor and honesty. 
I'm grateful for [Hope](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wHd-PLgKlbs).
**Triumph**: I've completed 11 days without a sip of booze. I relapsed a few weeks ago after going about a month without drinking. Back then I felt deep in mind that I would eventually drink again. I was faintly holding on to my drinking life. This time I am 100% done. I have no desire to go back to being a drunk. Reading Stop Drinking Now by Allen Carr helped. My new sponsor and AA help (even though I'm an atheist). This subreddit helps out tremendously as well. I'm feeling good...**Struggle**: Right now I hate my job the traffic I have to sit in twice a day and the place where I live. My wife has no desire to move anytime soon but I'm dying to get back out west to Colorado or Montana. I've also been suffering from horrible allergies this week (can't breathe out of either nostril) so I'm grateful for overall good health when I'm like this. ..**General Chat**: I am so excited to be doing the proper steps to stay sober this time around. I've always taken half measures. This time no sir. I am excited about seeing Phish sober this weekend.
**Triumph:**  I am pass 3 months of no drinking. Over 40 days no smoking weed.  Deciding not to do these things (and other unhealthy choices) is becoming easier more my normal.  My new partner is supportive and encouraging and had on a few occasions talked me through mild cravings and framed it in a manner that made me feel silly for wanting to break my sobriety.  In general I am inspired by being around a person who is active and fit and doing really cool things.  The whole surrounding yourself by people you want to be like is totally true...**Struggle:**  One of my two jobs is really draining me.  Having two part time jobs rather than one full time job is more draining in general: having to juggle the schedule of two employers having to switch professional roles often in the same day having to move around my hours whenever one job has an event or I need to cover more hours for my boss.  I feel like I am wasting my potential at both my jobs.  I'm a smart lady getting my Master's would be relatively easy.  I would excel at a job where I actually used my brain more often had challenges to over come... instead I argue with board members who have no real clue what social justice means and I get paid to hang out on reddit.  I didn't get an interview for a job I really thought I wanted and looking for other jobs hasn't turned much up.  Whenever I think about applying to grad schools I get overwhelmed and my low self esteem rears it's ugly head and I just don't have the discipline or motivation I need for that right now...**General Chat:**Despite the frustrations with my job I am grateful to have jobs right now.  Even though I don't get paid as much as my just as competent peers I have money in the bank.  I am not struggling to pay bills or eat or have somewhere comfortable to sleep.  I don't even worry about these things.  I can even spend money on fun things without too much second guessing.  So often it's easy to forget to be grateful for these things because we are trained to look for the negative.  I'm doing okay guys and I am so grateful for that.

Triumph: I can already feel myself getting back in shape and overall feeling better. Not as drowsy annoyed etc. whether it's because the no drinking or because I'm getting stuff done I'm happy. ..Struggle: being home alone with a bottle in the freezer because of guests/my dad it's a little rough. I can feel myself pulling towards it...General chat: I'm on a craft right now working and am happy with where I am and where I'm going. Last night I was bored but didn't want to drink. My family is good and healthy. Life's good!
I am having a very bad day. I'm not going to drink but I can see myself slowly becoming obese and it scares/depresses me. I don't want to end up wheeling around on a scooter but I don't know how to stick to a diet. I can abstain from alcohol just fine but if I had to take a shot every day to survive I would probably be dead of cirrhosis by now. I have to eat so I don't know how I can manage moderation when I am quite clearly an "all or nothing" personality. That's my Wednesday. Sorry if it isn't very drinking related but it's what I'm dealing with today.

I can't believe how well things have been going for me since I stopped drinking. I just got offered a job that is perfect for me and is the first step towards starting my career. Feeling so fortunate to have clarity. I know I would have never been so proactive when I was using. 
**Triumph**: I bought a heart rate/ activity monitor a couple of weeks ago.  I've been exercising a lot more and I've noticed that I'm recovering a lot faster than I did in the past when I would grab a beer after getting home from the gym...**Struggle**: My entire workplace is going out to a bar for some mandatory fun tonight it'll be my first night out all year.  I really don't feel like explaining why I'm not drinking to these people hopefully I can just sneak off early before they get pushy with it...**General Chat**: I am grateful for sidewalk etiquette.
**Triumph**: Received my first promotion at work! It's not a pay increase but they typically don't move people up this fast to my new role until a year or two on the job. Very proud of myself and my manager pulled me aside and said she's very impressed with me. Also 450 days today so woop woop!..**Struggle**: Fighting a major cold this week and I do not want to call in my first sick day so early on at my new job. Powered through a rough few days but I'm starting to feel better today. ..**General**: I'm really grateful for my inner peace these days. I feel a lot more centered. Lot of crazyness in the past 5 weeks but I'm settling into my groove.
