Today I got a message from my cousin Bethany. She said "Hey girl just wanted to let you know that I'm really proud of how hard you are working to get your life back on track! You rock and I LOVE YOU!!!" .I had confided in her last month when I was on vacation that I had struggled with alcoholism and I was newly sober. She had no idea that it had become such a huge problem in my life. I told her about the legal troubles I had been in and updated her when my case was finally closed (just a couple weeks ago yay!!). Having support is awesome!

Awesome.  I'm so glad you have a supportive family!
That's the best!
Congrats kid! That's a hell of a message to get!
Nice!
This is a true friend and not a drinking buddy.  Having support is the foundation of my recovery.  I can't stay sober alone.
That's so nice. All I get is "when are you going to start drinking again??" Lol. 
Nice...Hey everyone: can you think of someone that could use an awesome text?
Woo hoo!! I'm glad see has your back shalee. That's awesome! 
That's awesome. It really shows when we start making changes - glad you have people in your life who are behind that!
