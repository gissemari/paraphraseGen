I've been sober for up to 90 days in the past year and was sober for around 40 days January and February; however I have had a tough time getting past one week since that first week in February when I last relapsed.  As I expect is common the weekends are tough and the temptation to drink is very strong.  I actually made my choice not to drink the hard way on Friday morning by taking an Antabuse.  That "saves" me for something like three or four days.  I struggle with feeling bad about taking that route but if the result is staying sober I have to let that go.  So with the option more or less off the table I remain very anxious and basically depressed.  I feel bad that my wife has to struggle through this with me especially considering the grace with which she does...Anyway I just wanted to share.

Good to hear from you. If it takes Antabuse then what the heck? Use Antabuse.  I'm impressed with your 90 days!  BTW do you have anything you did before to deal with the anxiety?
