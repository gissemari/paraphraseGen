I was going to wait to post a progress picture for my 90 days or 100 days but I stumbled across a picture of myself yesterday that made me cry. I didn't even recognize that person. I spent the entirety of my life as a skinny person up until a few years ago when I ballooned out to 200lbs. Years of battling depression and anxiety with alcohol and other substances finally caught up to me. I struggled and spent 6 months sober in 2016 relapsed am back up to 90 days and DOZENS of 2 week stints in between. 2 years ago vs today:..http://imgur.com/0YOD9jd...http://imgur.com/iRV5nyX...**What I've lost:** 50lbs and a million pounds of regret/shame/guilt/self loathing/etc. ...**What I've gained:** All the confidence! I go to the gym 4 times a week my hair is wet from going swimming earlier today when I didn't even own a bathing suit for years. I'm starting university in September when I didn't even have my high school diploma this time last year. I have a vision and goal for the future when suicide seemed like the only option for so long before. My life is starting to feel whole again and SD is such a huge source of strength for me. Mucho love SD I will not drink with you today! <3.
