Hey everyone I just wanted to make a quick post after reaching the 4 week mark mainly to thank everyone here for doing what they do. ..During the first few days of not drinking this sub was such an important part of making me feel like I wasn't alone and showing to me that so many others go through the same struggles with alcohol that I do. I will never again underestimate the power of a supportive community! ..Since giving up drinking I have had to face many situations that I haven't faced sober in YEARS including: performing at a club with a bar (I'm a musician); doing trivia at the bar with my friends; Halloween; Fridays; Saturdays; man you name it. But because of the support of my wife my parents my family and friends and all of the stories you guys share here I have been able to stay sober for longer than I ever have since I started drinking. ..So once again: THANK YOU ALL! Keep sharing your stories advice questions and struggles because I know a lot of lurkers like me really depend on it...Now I just need to figure out how to wean myself off of all the damn CANDY I've been eating for the last month... Yeesh.

Huge congrats! And yeah I ate 2 large bags of candy just today. Those sour patch kids have an evil hold on me!
