Seems like a lot to me! ..Stopping drinking has been one of if not the best life choice I've made thus far. My business has boomed as a result of my new found (constantly improving) ability to focus. I'm painting again something I haven't done since high school... Sobriety at least for me is the key to health wealth and happiness. Like everyone I'm still a work in progress. I'm battling a nasty cell phone addiction that I don't quite know what to do about. My work necessitates constant phone usage so that's a cyclical battle. ..I'm vigilant about monitoring my fields for a relapse beast so to speak. If ever I get a craving I break it down to get at the root of what's causing it. In addition to being booze free 250 days I'm cigarette free something like 340 days. ..Anyway. That's me. Can't wait for 365! Stay dry!

Congrats! Breaking it down is what I do too. When those feelings pop up my process is rewind to the root rethink/reconsider then react appropriately if I do all that there will be no relapse and I can relax! ..*This thought was brought to you by the letter "R"*
Wow mega-congrats!
congrats amazing how the add up....
Great work! Now go put your phone down and go outside and play :)
hell yeah!!
Really great news to hear. I quit nicotine myself 15 years ago without any relapses however it took many many attempts. Now I am struggling with alcohol. What I would like to ask you is what did you find harder to quit alcohol or cigarettes?
I quit booze and cigs at the same time 6 months ago and it's stories like this that h ve helped me get to where I am now. Truly inspirational...Focus on getting through just each day and that 365 will soon roll round!..
&gt;If ever I get a craving I break it down to get at the root of what's causing it...This helps me a lot.
