besides my relapse I have about 19 sober months in the past 2 years 18 of which were consecutive.  When I was drinking I would avoid doctors and dentists like the plague. Last year I had a full checkup and my bloodwork and blood pressure were perfect.  I went to the eye doctor and got much needed glasses.  I went to my pap and mammogram on time.  I am a breast cancer survivor and the mammogram sends me spiraling into so much anxiety I would postpone it until my doctor started to get impatient with me.  I just went to my dentist and got a perfect checkup. He looked at me and said...Hey garden I thought you dropped off the face of the earth. I also made an appointment with an ent bcs my ear has bothered me on and off for a year. I feel so good and sober and healthy today. Alcohol robbed me of the ability to take care of myself.  I always dreaded the worse.  Without the daily anxiety I can see things clearly and have much better coping skills when it comes to taking care of myself!  Happy Sober Healthy Thursday everyone!!
