I'm in a hotel tonight. Nothing special - just a hotel off the highway in America...But I was here once before in early January. I was only a couple days sober then and being on the road for work was always where I slipped up. But I didn't that night. I tried my best to be kind to myself and resist the temptation to drink knowing I'd be proud of myself in the morning...And here I am back in the same place and not a moment has gone by in those 5+ months where I was not sober...It's a proud feeling and I wanted to celebrate it with you tonight. Those who know me around here know I also struggle with depression - but not tonight. I'm smiling tonight. Thanks SD. It's every bit worth the fight it took to get here.
