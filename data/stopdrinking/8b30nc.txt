Today I finally ended it with my husband of a year and a half.  We're separating but we both know it's done-zo.  ..When I relapsed hard in November and had to go to detox my husband was not very supportive and I went to my folks' house when I got out rather than back home.  Since then I had a few stints back at our house but always got so stressed out that I ended up back at my parents'.  My husband is a great guy.  But he's honestly a big ole' kid.  When I quit my toxic job he couldn't support us financially and refused to look for extra work to help us get by while I got well...It's the best for both of us.  It's been an emotional day.  But this is a step towards recovery.  ..IWNDWYT!

Best of luck. I was married when I quit drinking.  We tried to make it work afterwards but I had changed too much and she lost her drinking buddy. It took us almost 3 years to agree to part ways. If you can remain civil it is in everyone's best interest. I don't recommend ex-sex. ..IWNDWYT 
Hope it all goes civilly and amicably!!! IWNDWYT!
Sometimes taking care of ourselves is the hardest thing to do. Stay strong. IWNDWYT
