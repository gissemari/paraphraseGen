Hey! It DOES get better! Make sure to stay well fed and hydrated. In my early days I ate and ate. Kept my brain from thinking about other things! 
It really does get better ............be kind to yourself ! ..and eat all the chocolate :)........... thats what I am doing !!
Goodness yes it definitely gets better!..Like a *lot* better... I wouldn't have believed it either......Early sobriety can be an uphill struggle for sure but getting the right knowledge tools and *support* made all the difference for me.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....If whatever you've tried so far hasn't quite done the trick try something different and keep trying!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
it does get better for sure! hang in there. it gets easier too. ..i'd say after a month the urges were much farther and fewer between and now i only have the occasional bad day as opposed to having to cling by my fingernails to every sober half hour whilst muttering 'this too shall pass' and stalking this sub relentlessly. :)..you can do it. i tried to figure my triggers so that i could do a better job of overcoming them but also come to terms with the fact that I AM JUST NOT DOING THAT SHIT ANYMORE no matter the excuse/occasion...all the best to you. stick with it. lots of hugs and i am not drinking with you today.
