This isn't my first time making it to day 7 but it feels great to be here. Yesterday was a struggle I had an unexpected day off so was home alone. I found that being in a situation (home alone and playing games) really put me in the mood to drink. I stopped playing and took the dog out for a walk instead...I've been reading the big book every day and journaling as well. I like setting daily goals to try and keep me on my path. I'm glad to be a week sober and look forward to taking it another day tomorrow...IWNDWYT

Congrats! 
You can do it. You do not have to drink.
