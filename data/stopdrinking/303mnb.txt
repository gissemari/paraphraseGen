On the bright side for the first time ever I made it 19 days! And I do plan on making a full month for April. Why did I relapse? Who knows I did so well and fought off urges that questioned everything but a small slip up is all it takes. For the record I made it to 19 days (march 2nd to march 21st). I'm on a very hard bender right now and holy shit the terrible neck/headaches are unbearable and motive to stop again before I get used to my old ways. I just wanted to let this community know that I'm transparent and honest. I own up to this and I'm ashamed that I never truly earned that (3)..

I'm losing control. I did so well. I'm truly lost again.
What did you do to stop in the first place? What kind of support system do you have setup around you?
We all fall. Every single person on this sub has fallen many multiple times (including me). But as long as you stay committed to wanting to try to stop I ain't gonna judge you...How did you make it to 19 days before and what are you going to do differently this time to build upon that now?
I recently fell myself. For me it's really easy at first but after a few weeks or more I start think things will be different and I can moderate. After proving to myself twice now that I CAN NOT moderate I think I'm finally learning my lesson. Hang in there and use this as a learning experience and start again.
