I stopped drinking for 17 days and relapsed. I really need the support but I'm nervous about walking in on my first AA meeting. Any one have any good tips for my first visit or perhaps a recommendation on where to go in NYC? I am a 22 year old female living in the LES.

There are so many AA meetings in the city to choose from.  I tied a couple in my area - Murray Hill.  I also went to an agnostic AA on Houston which had a very good vibe...Go to a few to find a good that works for you.  ...People are easy going and you don't have to do anything you don't feel comfortable with.  Just go with an open mind...All the best!
