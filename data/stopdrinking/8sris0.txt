Let me start by saying I've never been in this situation. I've been around the program for 8 years and I've always been the one in her spot so this is weird for me...Last night my girlfriend called me around 8 and told me she drank. She's less than a month from her year it hit me like a ton of bricks. Although I can't say it was a total shock because lately she's been off and from what I could see in "relapse mode". Isolating cutting back on meetings and not reaching out. Also not wanting to see me as much. Again this is normally me. It took me a long time to get to where I am but I've done that dance plenty of times. This is her first attempt. ..We've been together for about 9 months getting together in early sobriety. Not recommended of course but it is what it is and it's worked fine otherwise. ..This morning she texted me and told me she is going to meet her sponsor at the meeting tonight. It makes me happy to hear that. I don't want to leave her but I know if she continues down that path I'll have to. For my own sobriety...With all that said how can I support her without acting like a sponsor or pushing her? What is your guy's experience with this? This is my first time being on this end... ..Thank you for reading.

You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon. It's a group for people who love an alcoholic and they will be better able to give you support. Or you might try r/scienceandkindness. It's another great sub for loved ones dealing with someone else's addiction issues.
Alanon is a good idea and from my own experience what I appreciate the most from my wife is that she listens to me and also let's me know how much she appreciates what I am doing.It goes along way for me.
Just a thought: could you ask your girlfriend what she needs from you right now?
