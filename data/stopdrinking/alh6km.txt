I want to sit her down and tell her to ask me anything about my addiction with no holds bar. She has never struggled with any substance abuse but does understand anxiety and depression. . I feel like this could either be amazing or terrible. Has anyone done like this with any level of success? Also partners of alcoholics do you think this would help?

I am not clear why you want to do this. If you are sober it might just make her uncomfortable. If you are still drinking  it is asking a lot to expect her to understand. Are you doing this for her or yourself? If it isn't something she has asked for I don't see how it benefits her. 
If your day count is accurate you probably should hold off on any sudden moves.   I'd suggest sending her to alanon in your community
