Monday I will have 6 months without a drink. My life has completely turned around in these past 6 months. I've nerve been happier. ..My girlfriend is pushing the idea of getting a sponsor on me. I've never been one to talk about my problems or open up to a   stranger. ..What do you all think?

Your girlfriend probably knows you better than any of us.  Do you trust her intuition?
It can't hurt.  You never know when you'll need an ear or have a rough time.  Also they may be a stranger at first but they won't be for long and they have probably been through similar experiences.  
Kudos for six months! Your girlfriend is probably scared about relapse. Maybe she understands as I learned that there is more to recovery than just not drinking. Having a sponsor and working the steps resulted in personal growth and insight which I would not have found anywhere else. You don't have to share what you are uncomfortable sharing. By going to meetings I got to know folks in AA and they were no longer "strangers".

your own brain got you into this mess and although you have cleared up some in order to get to the reason you drank you will need a sponsor.  Being sober takes action.  everyday  at  least for me  a sponsor can put you on that path show you what they did and have invaluable insight that you otherwise would have missed.   
Well do you go to AA? Sponsorship is an AA thing.
