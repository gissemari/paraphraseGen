I'm nearing three weeks without a drink and I can't remember having to deal with as much grief as I've been through these past few days  ..Last Thursday I had to fire a friend/co-worker due to his incompetence and laziness at the workplace.  It was tough for me because he was my friend before we became co-workers and I got him the job.  Now it seems we are neither.  This was at Job A.  ..Job B: Today I had to fire another person not a friend though.  I caught him stealing money out of the cash register after I had counted out for the night.  It's my small (struggling) business so I take it very seriously when I can't trust an employee.  He was my "Sunday" guy which was the only day I had off each week.  Now I'll be filling that slot and have zero days off until I find someone trustworthy.  75+ hours/week can take its toll.  ..It makes me just want to get numb tonight and forget about all this but I won't.  I feel like I'm being tested and so far I'm confident that I will pass but I just can't remember having to deal with so much bullshit when I was drinking.  Maybe I was too drunk to care?  Or maybe its because my emotions are out of whack right now while I'm adjusting.  Whatever it is I feel that I'm handling it as well as I can but I just hope things level out again soon.    ..I just had to vent.

I see it from another angle actually.  ..If you were not in recovery but still acting on your alcoholism could you have had the clarity to know that your friend had to go?  I think the feeling of being hungover as an alcoholic AND having to fire your friend would have been rougher.  You were generous to get him a job but you only had a chance to open the door what he did on the other side was on him.  ..I understand the urge to appease the stress with booze but as many will tell you that is only going to make a long week longer and more difficult...Stay strong and when you get through this you'll be able to remember that if you got through a day like today dry you can get through a day like tomorrow dry.  &lt;3
A drink - or twenty will not help here...Good for you for standing up for yourself  twice even when it would have been easier to let it slide...And yeah you were probably too drunk to care..  This is better.
