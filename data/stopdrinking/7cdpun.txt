Quit smoking weed 3 months ago. This is the third time i have done it. Each time i switch to alcohol. At first it only took me two 40oz every other day to take away the anxiety..Now i buy a 750 ml of rum every day.... ..Not only is this a drain on my bank account but i know my body is changing. A baby is on the way in june but i know that wont change anything i have to change for myself...I accepted i was an alchoholic a couple months ago thats why i joined this subreddit. Each day is a struggle to quit. Its so easy to make my way to the liquor store. ..There is so much more to say but i dont want to bore people. But i guess i posted this just to admit this to the community for the first time. Not sure if i will drink tomorrow but it is my goal to finally say i will not drink with you today. ..I have read so many suggestions but i thought that acrually saying this to this subreddit may give me more motavation...Good job to everyone that has quit and those that have not i understand. Stay strong everyone. We can do it...Let me know if anyone wants to talk. Its nice not to feel alone..

Welcome!  I hope you find your Day 1.  You can do it.  Best wishes..
FWIW I picked my day one about two weeks before it came. I knew I had a social event I wanted to drink at the day before and after that I wanted to start my journey. I'm also expecting twins. I can't take care of them drinking and I'm not going to do a very good job hungover so getting healthy or close to it before they come is a big motivator for me. I'm still quitting for me but also for them. 
Today is where it starts!..You'll never feel alone here.
