So my on and off significant other gave me the final ultimatum. After struggling for the past year and a half with my alcoholism he finally had enough. He told me it was it or him. I've wanted this for myself for so long but it's just been incredibly hard. I know I need to do this for me and my life but is it okay to want to do this for our relationship too?

I say it totally is ok. For me it was when I heard my son say "Is Dad drunk?" that I knew things had to change. I didn't want that life for him that father for him. So I did what I had to do. Of course it has been great for me and I appreciate it and keep it going in part because of me but the initial kick and some continuing motivation came from him...You can do it!
I gave up smoking in 2002 due to a negative comment from someone I was in a relationship with and it was one of the best things I've ever done even though it (relationship) didn't last. I'm fairly newly sober and my relationships (with everyone not just SO) just get better and better mainly due to feeling much calmer. IWNDWYT.
