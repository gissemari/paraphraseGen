Having an addicted family sucks. I wish I believed in god so I could pray for some strength right now. To support him to keep off drinking myself..Will you guys not drink with me today? My heart kinda hurts. :(

I have a relative that broke up with his girlfriend and part of the reason (he said) was her public drunken rant about him being an addict. He said he has not been on dope in a long time. He was alert and seemed sober. This was in daytime. At night he was nodding on heroin. He's the type that does maintenance dose during the day and works and then does the big dose at night. 
I'm very sorry to hear this. I'm glad you're sober to be an example of strength for your brother. I wish you both the best.
Addiction is extra hard I think when we battle it both internally and externally. I'm sorry about your brother. I'm not drinking with you today.
Sending you strength. I'm so sorry that's happening.
Sending you positive energy and not drinking with you today
I will not drink with you today and will be send positive thoughts your way &lt;3
Not drinking with you today.  Hoping all the best for you and him. 
This is why I love this community! Good luck to you fam I know it's hard to be there for family when you're an addict to. Be skrong so many hugs to you friend.
