Hey everyone I just wanted to stop by and check in. I had a great weekend visiting my best friend while while out of town for the ND State AA round up. The main speaker was amazing! ..I was hesitant to stand up during the Sobriety count down as I really didn't want to stand up for 2 days sober (realized after I was actually only 1 day technically) and got my 4th copy of the Big Book. I am happy I did as I got a lot of people coming up to me after the speaker who wanted to wish me luck and congratulating me on starting (starting over but those not from my home town didn't know it was because of a 1 evening relapse). ..Anyway I just wanted to check in and let everyone know that I had a great sober weekend and things are feeling even better this start It has only been 3 days but I am doubling my efforts in AA and here at /sd. Thanks everyone and have a great Monday!
