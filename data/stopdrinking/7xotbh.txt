I had to make some changes to reiterate to myself that I am in sobriety and a recovering alcoholic. My brain tries to tell me otherwise. I just implemented this system where my new tabs in Chrome automatically bring me to SD and tomorrow I will try intherooms.com ..I had to add a Chrome extension to change the tab: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/replace-new-tab-page/cnkhddihkmmiiclaipbaaelfojkmlkja/related..Just a thought if anyone is struggling to keep at this and make the extra effort to seek out help. ..IWNDWYT

I switched to the Chrome Momentum extension which lets me set a priority for every day.  It has a daily quote and I like it.  This is also a great idea.  I swear it is the little things that express our intentions.
