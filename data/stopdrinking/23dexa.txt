I saw another post on relapse today and it reminded me of some good information I got while in Intensive Outpatient Therapy. ..There is a specific series of thoughts or mindsets that precede a relapse.  My therapists stated that for alcoholics this process can happen over a couple hours or a couple days or in just a few minutes.  Here's the list: .. .Step 1: Unhealthy emotions..Step 2: Denial..Step 3: Compulsive behaviours..Step 4: Triggers..Step 5: Interior chaos..Step 6: Exterior turmoil..Step 7: Loss of control..Step 8: Addictive thinking ..Step 9: High-risk situations..Step 10: RELAPSE..Step 11: Aftermath of relapse..Sources: http://hamrah.co/en/pages/11-stages-of-relapse/..http://www.tgorski.com/gorski_articles/understanding_relapse.htm..This research was done by Terry Gorski.  From what I can tell it's a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy kind of approach so hopefully this will be beneficial to everyone...Science bitches!!! ;)

Wow. You just described the last 10 years of my life. 
Science indeed!
Saved and thanks!
Thanks much!  I am a fan of Gorski. Learning the stages of relapse and recognizing triggers can prevent actually picking up. Relapse starts before we actually drink. ..Gorski's relapse prevention applies to people who have an established period of sobriety not those in the early stages of sobriety called "early abstinence". 
OY addictive thinking.  It's in too many areas of my life.
Interesting.
Nice. This is good to keep in mind TeddyPeep. Thanks for sharing it.
Wow number 1 hit close to home. I just punched my couch an hour ago because I got stressed. That's clearly crazy. I'm glad you posted this. I needed to reevaluate myself.
