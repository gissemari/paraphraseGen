Glad you are here and this was yet another step in the journey!  I won't drink with you today and much love.
Great job coming back so quickly. I'll join you in not drinking today.
For me the shame was worse than the hangover. I just beat myself up so bad the only way I could forget my shame was to drink again and forget for a few hours . Vicious cycle..I choose me and my mental health over alcohol. I don't want to be that person who hates herself anymore. I want to be the person who works out eats healthy gets stuff done on days off and feels good. ..I won't drink with you today!
Glad you are back!  I will not drink with you today.
