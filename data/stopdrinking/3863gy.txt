I relapsed friday and saturday. I was sober nearly 3 months before that and got to the point that I didn't think about alcohol at all. It was nice...Now I'm struggling to make it another 24 hours. If I don't make it it's going to get harder to get sobriety back. I'll be losing some things I've acquired the past few months...The simple joys of coffee nature Game of Thrones etc are all dead to me. Can't concentrate on anything but the struggle. =(
