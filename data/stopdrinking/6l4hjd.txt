Hey everyone I'm currently in the midst of a very aggressive relapse. I had been sober for a while after an unfortunate suicide attempt but have recently fallen back on old habits...I've been to meetings tried the 12 steps hiked meditated picked up needlepoint you name it. But nothing has stuck and I inevitably relapse...I recently ran across an article that said there were a few medications that might help but I haven't had much luck finding testimonies or relatable experiences...I'm hoping someone here has I want to stop drinking and I feel bad I may need more than just willpower.

There are no medications that will make you stop drinking. The best bet for you is some kind formal treatment. That may be an inpatient stay or outpatient rehab. Therapy might help and if you work see if your employer has some kind of Employee Assistance Program. All that being said medication can help. I've been on naloxone in the past and it helps with cravings. The pills are taken orally daily. I found the injectable version Vivitrol to be better because a nurse gives you an injection and it's a slow release version of Naloxone that lasts a month and you don't have to think about it and you can't skip it. Antabuse works totally differently in that it literally makes you pretty violently sick if you ingest alcohol so is a deterrent. Again you have to take it every day but other than making you sick if you drink it doesn't do anything to help you not want to drink. With naloxone you could still drink but it doesn't give you pleasure to do so (it blocks the opioid receptors in the brain that produce the pleasurable feeling from drinking). I would talk to you doctor about naloxone/vivitrol but before getting any of these you need to have routine blood work done to check your liver function. No medications are a silver bullet though they are just one more tool in the tool belt that help while you are working on other things in treatment. Hope that helps I'd be happy to tell you more about any options I've tried 'em all. Best of luck getting the help you need. 
Yes there are medications that can help. Talk with your doctor.
