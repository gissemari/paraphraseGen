I have such an important week coming up I must stay strong. Having such a hard time not to drink it all away. I will try not to drink with you guys.

Don't do it! Booze won't help a damn thing. ..I won't drink with you! 
patting myself on the back with a six-pack was extremely counter productive...it gets easier and likely sooner rather than later.....you can do it.
I know how that feels.  It will pass go out call a friend or just do something!!
Glad you're here. Often when I am struggling I try to envision the future. Having "a" drink sure sounds fun in the moment but that will inevitably lead me to getting drunk potentially embarrassing myself and dealing with a hangover and anxiety the next day. It's always tempting for me to drink when I have a stressful week but 100% of the time it only makes that week worse...The reason my badge is at only a few days is because I drank way too much during the week last week. Being hungover at work was AWFUL. Sober mornings are so much more pleasant and productive. ..Are there other activities you could do to relieve your stress maybe exercise or relaxing with a feel good movie?
Play the tape forward.  What happened last time?  Surf the urge.  Get up do something.  Walk swing your arms and deep breathe.  You got this.  Make a list of the pros and cons.  Every day you make it alcohol will fade further and further back from your mind and pretty soon you won't think of it.  When you see others getting stupid from drinking you'll feel sorry for them and be so glad you quit.  I won't drink with you today.
