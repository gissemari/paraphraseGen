For the past 3 years I was getting drunk every night. One time I took a two day break. Another time I didn't drink for a day. But the rest was mostly black out drunks every night. Whole TV series were lost to the great elixir (sorry Stranger Things). I had the usual panic about what might happen if I suddenly quit. Tapering didn't work for me. My job was in serious jeopardy. We all know the drill. ..About 2 months ago I took the plunge and stopped drinking cold on a Sunday and stayed clean all week. But I got drunk twice on the next weekend. Then I didn't during the next week. Then I got drunk once on the following weekend. Same thing the next week. Friday nights were a tough one to get through. But two weeks back I didn't drink during the weekend. Then I did the same thing again. And I won't be drinking this weekend. And it won't even be hard. ..I guess I just think that laying down some smaller rules and sticking to them works for some of us. For me it was about being ashamed of how badly I'd done at work. Having holocaust hangovers everyday is terrible for performance. And I always felt bad and crazy. So I just took it one day at a time with the simple goal of staying sober during the week. Then my goal became just one drunk on the weekend and then none. I don't have that heavy craving for it. I've lost the taste. I feel great (I used to smoke a ton of cigs when I drank so I quit those too) I look way better and I'm 1000 times happier. ..So maybe - and I hope I'm not being irresponsible here - if you're struggling with the enormity of quitting completely you can set up smaller goals. They're not much easier certainly but just tackle a week and then two weeks and then more. I might drink sometime later but the critical point is that I don't want to. I think that's the final destination. Being a drunk is as much about the addiction as it is about the state of your life. One thing feeds the other. Now I spend my evenings playing hell out of guitar taking Jiu Jitsu classes going to local Meetups and reading books. I feel strong and engaged with the world again. I've got my passion back. *I'm* back. ..Anyway. That's what worked for me and the plan is to keep going down this path. Not because I have to but because it feels right and natural and I want to. I still can't fucking believe that I tripped and fell into alcoholic world for three years but I did. Then I climbed out of it. Am climbing. It's perhaps a different path to sanity than what is typically recommended but. Worked for me.

Thank you for your share.  I think there is room for everyone's process to be recognised and explored.  I am an all or nothing type so for me tapering would not have worked but I am glad it is working for you. I too had to give up the cigs at the same time a cigarette or 25 went well with a bottle or two of wine every night for lots of years.  Congratulations on stopping both in the same time span.  I think you are made of some pretty strong stuff... I am more jelly like in my commitments 
I love reading posts like this because it shows people that there is no one "right" method.....As for "Holocust Hangovers"- you really hit the nail on the head with that one! UGH...
