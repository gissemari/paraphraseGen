Hey guys.I posted last week about how I was one week sober and I was excited about my new life.  Now I am two weeks into this and for the most part I am doing fine and I haven't had any actual day to day issues.  However I am starting to feel a little bit of struggle here.  My friend's wedding is coming up in August and I am a little stressed about it.  I am marrying them and am already a bit nervous about the entire day.  I feel like I will end up wanting a drink in order to calm my nerves before I go up and speak in front of everybody and then I know I'll want a drink to celebrate with all my friends.  I am starting to realize that these kinds of things are going to happen.  I am going to be in situations where I'll want to celebrate and I'll feel out of place with all my drunk friends and family.  I just don't really know how I am going to handle this situation.  I think I am mostly just hoping that by the time the wedding comes around I will have been just under 2 months sober and it'll just come easy to me.  But I fear that won't be as much the case.  ..I guess I am just looking for a little advice on how to overcome the desire to drink when you're in a setting like a wedding.  I am not used to this and I don't know how to handle that situation.

Hello again. Posting when you have questions is an excellent idea. First of all the wedding is a month away. Try not to project that far into the future. By then you will have even more sobriety under your belt and will likely feel more confident. Staying focused on the present today will serve you well at this stage of sobriety. ..Weddings can be stressful in early sobriety. I always have a drink in hand so people aren't constantly offering. I have my own transportation so I can leave when I'm ready. Stepping outside for fresh air is helpful. I go into every day with the decision no to drink no matter what. I also plan to enjoy myself by talking with people and dancing. In addition people at AA meetings who have been through similar situations offer their suggestions.

I am not used to this and I don't know how to handle that situation...As my friend /u/SOmuch2learn already pointed out: one day at a time don't get anxious about future events.  It's borrowing from tomorrow when our focus should be on today.  But how do I handle today?  I make a decision when I first wake up not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad all day and also no matter who where or why.  When I make the morning decision alcohol is not an option for the entire day.  Plus I can consolidate my sober decision with AA recovery.
