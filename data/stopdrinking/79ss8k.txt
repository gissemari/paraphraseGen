As I posted earlier I drank a bit less than a third of a bottle of beer today. I buckled and got a six pack of a 9.5%. Realized after a few nasty sips that heck I don't want this this won't help. Dumped the open bottle. And the other five. And a bottle of boilo (whiskey) I've been unable to part with (I had a 60 day stretch before my relapse two weeks ago and still never dumped it)...I am on the fence about a badge reset but regardless I feel like today was huge for me. I've never been able to "get off at the exit" once booze is purchased. Nothing could make me stop. And certainly nothing could make me dump 15 bucks of Sour Monkey after already having a few sips. ..But how I feel now sober and okay with my feelings is worth more than 15 bucks. (I'll try not to remind myself that I could've subscribed to WoW for a month with that booze money)...I think learning to stop the pattern at any stage of the game - even if you already had a first sip - is golden. And to not let the streak breaking get in your head. My alcoholic brain likes to say well hell you screwed up your badge so might as well get hammered. But that's not the case. ..I will not drink with you tonight and I wish strength to anyone who came hella close to caving today. .

Good job on dumping out the booze.  Whether you need a badge reset is totally up to you.  
Hey buddy hang in there...It took me countless efforts to make it stick...Just focusing on not having the first drink is what I do.
Your life is worth a heck of a lot more than 15 bucks..Good choice!!!..Here's your seat - stick around a while. :)
