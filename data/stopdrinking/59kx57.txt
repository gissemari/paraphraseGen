I'm 21 years old and have been sober now since the 12th of September. I had my first drink when I was 15 years old at a party my drink of choice was vodka. Since then I drank on and off until I turned 18 the legal age here in Ireland. I began drinking more and more because it was so easy to get. I only drank spirits mixed with fizzy drinks (usually cheap vodka and coke or jagermeister and coke). Not only was I drinking alcohol by the bucket load but also taking in fizzy drinks too and as a result I pilled on A LOT of weight. I usually drank until I ran out of money if I was out or if I was drinking at home until I passed out most of my drinking was done at home and would become more and more frequent. The longest I've ever gone without drinking since I turned 18 was maybe 3 or 4 months which was this year although I started again back in June. I am fortunate enough to not get hangovers giving me more of an incentive to drink knowing I wouldn't wake up the next day in pieces. I loved the social aspect of drinking too going to the pub with friendsgetting completely hammered and doing the same thing next week. The amount I was drinking and the frequency was not healthy whatsoever. A month ago (11th of September) I got myself a bottle of Jagermeister watched some wrestling and ordered myself some Dominos. Everything else is very blurry after that but the next day I woke up feeling insanely sick. After hours of trying to suppress it I ended up puking my guts up in my bathroom to the point where I physically couldn't breath and it scared me. I had a look at myself in the mirror eye and nose running noticing all the weight I had pilled on in the last few years and having a moment of clarity and shame. I realized this is not who I want to be and was ashamed of myself for letting myself get into this state. Sure I was a happy drunk who never got hangovers but my drinking had become so frequent that I was doing more damage to myself then anything. I haven't drank since that day and am doing my best to stay sober and not get into situations where I am around drink because I don't want to give into temptation. As a 21 year old man in a country known for it's casual drinking and coming from a family with alcoholics it's hard. I want nothing more then to proudly say "I am one year sober today" but constant peer pressure makes me doubt myself. I know if I put my mind to this I can achieve this but I still struggle. My friends from work go out most nights drinking and I feel excluded because I know myself if I end up going I'm going to end up drinking. Since I quit drinking last month I've been in 2 situations where I've had the opportunity to drink but chose not to the most recent being at a concert with friends where at one point my friend was even offering to buy me a drink because he missed drinking with me. I'm going to a surprise party tomorrow for a friend where drink will be flowing and don't want to let myself down and having to start from scratch. I didn't want to make this a really long post but I wanted to share my story and my current circumstances and hopefully can stay on the right path!

I remember going through a similar stage with my own commitment and pressure from old friends to "return to the fold". I made sure they knew I didn't judge them but for me I had to stop. If we were going to continue to hang out together they needed to accept me for who I am now. Some got on board and we still hang out some just could not adapt and I not longer see them. ..Every person has their own journey and if I learned anything it is that I owe it to the person in the mirror to give them the very best life I can.
