After six months of a struggling limping sort of sobriety (where I'd really really want to drink every night I found myself alone) I finally gave up in November.  Drank for a couple of weeks and probably would have kept on drinking hard through the winter as I usually do.  November 30 became my new day one - it had to be since I had a doctor's appointment on December 3 and I wanted to have a few days dry before that.  Pride y'know...December 3rd was when I started medication for the first time in my life - a mood stabilizer and an anti-depressant.  The latter didn't work at all for me - I had to cut back and finally drop that after a few weeks - but the former has been a life-changer.  It's more than just feeling calmer and more stable; I don't need to drink.  I don't want to drink.  (To add to that I'm not supposed to drink with this.  By itself that probably wouldn't be enough of a deterrent - I used to mix all kinds of unwise things with alcohol - but it's a good reminder all the same.)  It's changed the way I feel about and react to my problems...I'm exercising again engaged in my hobbies and keeping up my personal and professional responsibilities.  Therapy would be a good accompaniment to medical treatment but it's just too expensive at the moment.  Maybe someday...The truth is I've felt better about my sobriety for the last month than I did for any similar amount of time last year - back then I felt every high and low with excruciating clarity and wanted to bury it all in oblivion.  For me willpower just wasn't enough to sustain me because I have an underlying illness.  I needed to take another step toward a diagnosis and treatment and I'm so glad I did...IWNDWYT.
