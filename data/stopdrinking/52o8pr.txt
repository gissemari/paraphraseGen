*Theme:* Philosophy / Epicureanism..*Quote:* Nothing is enough for whom enough is too little. - Epicurus..*What I get from it:* I love the simplicity of this heuristic...It brings to mind a struggle that a lot of people who are trying to moderate drinking go through -- why can't I stop at X number of drinks?..I experienced a major change in thinking when I realized that no amount other than zero would be enough alcohol for me. I didn't stop drinking immediately after this but I started considering any amount of alcohol over the line for me and something I didn't want to do. And I stopped shortly after that...This idea continues to serve me well in other facets of my life -- for example how much food is enough and how much food am I consuming? How big is the gap? If there's a huge one I've found something to work on...(little early tonight as I've gotta go)

Great quote and analysis!
This is a lovely quote. Thank you for sharing.
Great quote. Started me thinking about contentment. I will never be content with just one beer but I can be content with none. Thanks.
