Hey everyone. ..I hope I'm posting this in the correct place. I never post on reddit but spend a lot of time browsing.  .I almost made it two weeks without drinking and it felt incredible. It was difficult but every day that I lasted without drinking felt like a staggering victory in my aspiration to be better. Last night my housemates decided to have a few drinks and my immediate impulse was to drink. I couldn't think of any reason not to so I did. It feels like I've undone about two weeks worth of effort and I guess I'm just wondering how other people in similar situations have handled the impulses that come early in their decision to stop drinking. ..Thanks.....
