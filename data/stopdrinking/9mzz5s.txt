Hello all. I'm just going to get straight to it:..1. Do all withdrawals seem to come with seizures? I am terrified of experiencing one. I cannot afford to detox professionally so I'm really looking to hear from folks who may have quit with no seizure activity. ..2. I have a leftover prescription of Xanax (low dose). Do you think that would be helpful?..3. Any tips on how to tell my SO about my problem? I have vaguely brought it up in the past but I've been lying about how much I'm actually struggling. He is already supporting me through a tough time (unemployment) so I feel like this would just make things ten times worse. Is it ever possible to recover in secret?..For perspective I have been majorly binge drinking every other day for almost 2 years. I have awful hangovers but as soon as I feel better I go drinking again. I am OVER it and I want my life back! I don't want to drink anymore. I want to know who I am and I want to remember things!..Thanks y'all. ..

Hi. Unfortunately your post includes asking for medical advice (concerning seizures and also medication -- Xanax) so it has been removed. If you would care to make another post about your SO you are welcome to.
