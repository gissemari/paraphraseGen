Howdy Pardners..**Background:** This is my first post on r/stopdrinking. In September of 2012 I decided that I would stop drinking on Jan 1 2013. I had been drinking regularly for the past 14 years or so. My struggle with alcohol is that although I typically only drink one day a week I'm often not able to control/stop myself. I end up getting way too drunk and frequently being an asshole and occasionally partaking in some pretty risky behaviors. My drinking had gotten to the point where even when I would go out and have 2-3 beers without any incident I would feel pretty ashamed of myself the next day...**Question:** So with all that in mind what is the difference between controlling drinking vs stopping all together? Personally I feel like I've been trying to control my drinking for years now to no avail which has led me to stop all together. What have your experiences been with control vs stopping?..***(Thanks for making this reddit happen. I had no idea it existed until today and I look forward to learning more from all of you)***

lol. I'm in the same boat complete with 1/1/13 resolution. I thought it would be EZPZ but Friday night rolls around and I find myself craving despite the usual next day regrets a few drinks. Liquor stores are closed so no dice but I'm asking myself if I'll be able to resist again tomorrow. For me there is the only control is as much as I want and having a couple makes me want more every time. I'm tired of feeling regrets and being an asshole while drinking. I wonder sometimes which is the real me? Are my boundaries artificial and stripped away when drunk or are they real and deactivated while drunk?..Anyway good luck I think I'm going to need it as well!
You basically already answered your own question. Controlling drinking is what normal social drinkers are able to do. They don't even understand why some of us cannot stop once we start. A couple of drinks and that's enough for some lucky people. ..You've tried and failed to control your drinking. It doesn't matter what you label this situation. Is this alcoholism? Does it really matter? Whatever you call it you and alcohol have an abusive relationship. It is like a love affair gone bad. At least that's how it felt for me. Alcohol turned on me betrayed me. I could not count on it to provide a fun yet safe evening anymore. ..That being said when chocolate or peanut butter causes an allergic miserable reaction we stop eating it or suffer the consequences. The same can be said for alcohol. Doesn't that make sense? 
Some people go through rough periods or phases in their lives where they drink too much. They take steps to get it under control they change their environment change their habits change something - whatever - and they manage to regain control &amp; go back to drinking occasionally or normally...But other people - I'll call them "alcoholics" just to make it easier to talk about - they go through the same stuff.  They try to manage their drinking every which way they can think of but they're unable to do so. Or at least unable to do so with any ease.  For these people quitting altogether is the only sane option...A wise man once said "I can't both control and enjoy my drinking; I can only do one or the other."  I feel the same way.  The amount of effort it takes me to control my drinking just isn't worth it.  *Could* I do it if I wanted to?  Part of me thinks so. Part of me will always think so.  But in years &amp; years of trying I haven't managed to pull it off. So that part of me is clearly *insane* right?..Doesn't that tell you something about me?  The very fact that part of me still thinks I could drink if I wanted to despite all evidence to the contrary must mean that I'm the type of person who shouldn't drink at all right?..Think of it in terms of tomatoes.  If eating one tomato caused you to black out ruin relationships miss work puke your guts out etc how many would you eat in the future?  How hard would you fight to keep tomatoes in your life?  ..Edit: I didn't even answer your question. The difference between the people looking to control their drinking and those looking to stop altogether usually turns out to be that the ones looking to control it still haven't figured out that they're in group #2.
I was on the "CONTROL IT" wagon for 13 years. I am an alcoholic! Control was not possible still would not be possible today. A normal drinker does not have to control their drinking they just naturally don't have to much. They don't even think about it. If you feel you need to control your drinking that should be a sign of a problem. Take action to fix it.
