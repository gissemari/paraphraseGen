I'm feeling proud of me for getting my drinking under control.  Two years ago I drank up to a half bottle of wine every day.  Stopping was really really hard.  I toughed it out without any alcohol for several months &amp; fought through cravings that hit me out of the blue.  I re-introduced alcohol &amp; set the goal of drinking one day a month.  A drinking day means 1-3 small glasses of wine.  I decided to keep track of my drinking days on a calendar in 2017 &amp; I find it keeps me accountable to me.  I had 16 drinking days in 2017 &amp; learned that I can't drink just because I'm on vacation.  No drinking days yet in 2018 but as I write this I really want a glass of wine.  Thankfully there is none in my house.  ..You guys have supported me for two years.  You're my only support really.  I didn't feel like I needed or wanted AA or a therapist to gain control over my drinking but I needed something.  This group provided that something.  Thank you.  I know there are many here who struggle much harder with alcohol than I did &amp; do.  I want you to know how grateful I am that you are here for me too.

You are fortunate to battle your cravings for two years and remain under control with only a few drinking days...Congratulations!   IWNDWYT
so .... what do you think? is it harder to drink one day a month or not at all?
