Today I slept in. Normally sleeping in on the weekends was the result of my coma\-like hangover. A gult\-ridden shameful "here I go wasting another perfectly good day" event that would make me feel like such a failure. On those days getting my kids breakfast was such a chore. I would pray that they wouldnt ask me to take them anywhere so I could lay on the sofa for as much of the day as possible. ..Today was different. Allowing myself to sleep in was a blissful treat to myself. I had a long week and deserved a break. When we all did finally get up I made my kids a great breakfast and we had a lazy wonderful nothing "special"  yet special in every way day. ..Having experienced being in the depths of despair due to my struggle with alcohol has really given me the appreciation for the little things like this. It may seem insignificant but being truly present to experience these things are just one of the many gifts that sobriety has given me. ..This group gave me the support to achieve this. Thank you all.

Beautiful.  ..To me these little things are truly the big things in life.  I spent a lot of my younger days working myself up for the "big events" and whether drinking-related or not they were often a letdown in some way (probably due to my over-inflated expectations)...Now on the other side of the arc I reflect back and what really matters to me is the simple everyday things -- and like you say being present and clear-minded to savor and appreciate them.  For me it's things like morning coffee a nice walk.  Most of all it's time with people and keeping connections strong.  And sobriety is key to that...Congrats sobermamma.  .
