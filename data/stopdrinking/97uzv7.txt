Don't Feed the Booze Goblin!..Try some of the [videos about Overcoming Cravings](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=this+naked+mind+cravings) from the *This Naked Mind* YouTube channel... I found them really helpful.....Every craving will always pass every time and eventually they fade away altogether.....What else can you find to do tonight to distract yourself?..Stay strong! All you have to do is make it through until bedtime and dodge just that first drink.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Just wait a half hour and see how you feel.  I know my urges seem to come at specific times and it's more like force of habit to go out and shop. Try to occupy your brain/body doing something.  :)
Like it's been shared a craving will self destruct if given a bit of time. I noticed thought that if I made sure I was eating correctly and doing a bit of exercise that they would be much shorter and not come as often. Good luck friend!IWNDWYT! 
Thanks everyone it's dulled off now still there but disappearing. IWNDWYT
