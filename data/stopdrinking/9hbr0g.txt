Just thought I'd share if it'd maybe help you too. Eminem very publicly struggled with addiction and relapsed multiple times. He's a happy sober man these days. This song really speaks to realizing how deep into it you are and breaking out of it and getting your swagger back. In fact it joins me during almost all workouts now by manual addition. ..I'm getting my swagger back and hopefully you are too! ..[Talkin' 2 Myself - Eminem](https://youtu.be/MNY7fQSWfSw)

I'm a big fan of music and while slim shady the epic marshall mathers has a storied personal life I measure him as a singer/songwriter because that's what separates him from me.  Hahahahaha I wish!  No I love songs like this in fact I have a number of examples...Gogol Bordello "Alcohol" - Folk..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfQDAWJaN34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfQDAWJaN34)..Pink "Sober" - Pop..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfetD-kmSZQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfetD-kmSZQ)..Blekbala Mujik "Drangkinbala" - Reggae..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fvsrJUnCbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fvsrJUnCbE)..Not drinking with y'all tonight.
