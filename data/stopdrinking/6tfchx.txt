Was on probation for two years. In that time I didn't drink a drop. I became happy with my sober lifestyle AA substance abuse counseling. But I just got off two weeks ago and I feel like I'm sinking back into my old ways. ..Anyone gone through probation sober only to start back up (regrettably) after they got off? How did you change to be sober with out any legal incentive again? Struggling hard here.

You need to stop drinking for you not because someone else told you to. Do you want to stop? If so don't drink today. You can always drink tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and tell us how you feel.
Glad you're here!..I finally realized that it wasn't *lack of willpower* as my issue but rather *Lack of In Real Life Support*.  That's all I needed!..I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources support and fellowship to first stop drinking and then to live sober...Now I just forgo ONE drink today - The First One..Never been happier!
