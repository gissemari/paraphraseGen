Hey all!..In the past year once I started taking medication my hangovers became much worse. Even a couple of beers will make my head hurt which never happened before. And if you're like me a morning beer can *temporarily* allay the pain but can often lead to continuing to drink the rest of the day blah blah cycle starts over...A little advice that's helped me: chamomile tea activates the same system as alcohol & benzos (used to treat DTs) except without the health detriments and withdrawal symptoms - duh! In fact it has helped to alleviate my withdrawal symptoms (headaches difficulty sleeping anxiety mild shakiness etc) and helps to curb urges once the hangover is gone. About 3 cups and most of my pain is alleviated...I know this may not work for everyone and it certainly depends on your drinking habits but hangovers are a real struggle for me so I thought I'd share. **DISCLAIMER:** If you even *think* you're having DTs GO TO THE E.R.! Chamomile will not save you!..Stay strong y'all.

Chamomile is my best friend! I didn't know why I'd gravitated towards it. I still drink like 4 cups of it a day lol! I had no idea it affected the same area of the brain...the more you learn!
Teas with valerian root have a similar affect. I like to drink sleepytime extra it's the most palatable. Very calming!
I could not possibly have an opinion on this.
I did the chamomile tea and sleepy time teas in the beginning. Now I sip on sparkling water because I like the carbonation burn in my throat.
