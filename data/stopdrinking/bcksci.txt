So I'm looking for some feedback here about whether or not I'm being unreasonable about something.  Not directly related to my alcoholism but inextricably intertwined in it nonetheless.  My husband travels a lot for work.  We have two kids (ages 8 and almost 6).  Both kids have some behavior challenges.  Nothing severe but it's often exhausting dealing with both of them alone for long periods of time.  I work full time at a demanding job.  At every real "grown-up" job my husband has ever had he's always had trouble maintaining work life balance.  His job before this one really required a lot of travel.  The current one (which he got after almost a year of unemployment after being laid off) has ended up requiring a horrendous amount of travel.  He loves his current job. When interviewing for the job he was told he would pick his own work.  One person he interviewed with said he hadn't traveled at all in the last 4-5 months.  My husband has traveled every single month since starting.  Often many times a month for entire weeks at a time. He often leaves on a Sunday is gone all week and returns late Friday night.  Sometimes he then turns around and leaves the very next Sunday (only having Saturday at home with us) and leaves again for a week.  During Feb. he traveled 22 out of 28 days in the month.  I went to treatment in January of 2017 after relapsing during a period of very heavy work travel for him at his old job.  I have since relapsed a few times twice recently both during periods when he's been traveling a lot.  Don't think I am suggesting this is his fault.  It is not.  I am responsible for my own choices.  Period.  But anyone can see that being left alone with our children and a full-time job so much is extremely hard on me.  Sometime in February (when remember he traveled 22 of 28 days) he promised not to take anymore travel without discussing it with me first.  I was skeptical this would really only mean "informing me" of it and not really asking me for input about whether the dates at issue worked or not but he swore that was not the case.  Often he wouldn't even tell me actual dates but only speak vaguely about upcoming travel.  I started pushing last month for his upcoming travel for the next few months since he'd mentioned in passing one trip that was scheduled a long time ago and also one for professional training.  He finally sent it and it shows 6 weeks out of the next 12 scheduled for travel (2 of them back to back). None of these were "discussed" with me at all...nor was I even informed of them until just recently after having to ask multiple times.  Our son is struggling a lot now and is being sent home from his preschool early a lot of days for out of control behavior.  That means I have to leave work (I'm an attorney) and go pick him up and try to work remotely all day with him at home.  This happened twice last week (husband out of town).  We finally decided to get a nanny for him but she doesn't start until end of the month.  Knowing all this was going on my husband was supposed to travel this week.  BUT it got cancelled!  Since the customer cancelled so close my husband gets credit for the time anyway towards his utilization numbers! What a windfall! He still decided this week on Tuesday to tell me he wanted to schedule a mid-week trip for a new customer that was begging him to come because they "really needed him because he really sounds like he knows what he's doing" (ego stroking).  He said this time he was trying to "talk to me about it" And "compromise".  But he wanted to go and wasn't really asking me if that was OK.  He was simply asking what he could do to make it easier on me.  Things like doing laundry and dishes before he left etc. My son has been sent home from school twice since my husband left (Wed and today Friday).  I am beyond upset.  I feel so betrayed.  Does he not see how hard this is on me (not to mention my kids!!)?  Am I off base for being so upset about this?  This was not part of the agreement when he took this job.  He loves it but at what cost?  He's missed birthdays.  The back to back travel coming up in May will mean he leaves town the morning of Mother's Day.  He has missed special presentations of my daughters' at school.  Am I crazy for being upset about this?  He seems to think I'm being unreasonable.  Am I?

Hi. Unfortunately this isn't the best sub to offer you support. You might want to try /r/relationship_advice which is a more appropriate place to discuss these issues.
