Hi everyone!..Long time lurker/poster under numerous usernames. Last month after a scare that left me hospitalized I finally took the biggest step of my life by admitting to my drinking problem and getting help. I've been sober for a little over a month the longest period of sobriety ive had since I began drinking. The biggest help thus far has been learning from people like you.  Your tips your successes and your struggles have helped me get here and will push me further into recovery. Thank you for your posts for being in the rooms and sharing your stories. Knowing that I'm not suffering alone is keeping me going. I raise a glass of cucumber seltzer to you all and I will not drink with you today!
