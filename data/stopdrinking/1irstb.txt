I recently made the decision to stop drinking.  My first day sober is today.  I have been cutting back lately and decided to take the plunge.  I have been drinking since I was 14 and cannot remember life without booze.  I know I am going to lose friends experience mind numbing boredom and question my decision 100 times a week.  I also know that I will explore myself improve my relationships and improve my general quality of life.  I am going to need a lot of help and suggestions on things to do.  Almost all of my social circle are heavy drinkers.  I am going to be filming the whole process too.  So I can look back on it when I am struggling and look at the progress I have been making.  I just want to thank you guys (and gals) on here for sharing your stories and providing a bit of needed inspiration.  Thanks.

Welcome to the wagon-train!
Wow sounds like you're off to a solid start! You won't regret your decision. Hang in there it's not all sunshine and roses but it's worth it. 
It's not complicated. If you want to refrain from drinking then do so. If you want to keep on drinking then do that. Maybe test out the sober life and see if you enjoy it. If you don't go back to drinking. I ran this test numerous times and eventually I decided that I liked sober life better. 
Keeping busy seems to help me.  I played hockey this morning then cooked a meal when I got home.  Then worked on the car for a bit followed by friends at the beach to play voleyball and swim.  Hardest part was resisting ice-cream after voleyball...Exercise has got to be a much better addiction.  Exhausted now about to crash but congrats on making the decision!
Welcome and congratulations on your decision. Deciding is a pretty big step.
I suggest you call your local AA and make some meetings.  They have a book called Living Sober that might help you.
