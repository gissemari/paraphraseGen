The top layer is the one that makes me relapse. It's the day to day stress. Being mistreated at work? Go home and drink. Relationship troubles? Go out with friends and drink. Lonely because none of your friends are available? Stay home and drink. Don't have money to pay the bills? Fuck it still have enough to get something to drink.  ..The layers underneath are where the problem started. Its where all the demons are waiting for me. Those terrible thoughts and memories I can't let myself feel. Peel back the top layer and I start to understand why I self destruct. The reason I'm trying to run away and hide under a mountain of beer cans and liquor bottles. The longer I've waited to confront the demons the stronger they've become. I've made their job easier by running away and made the slow climb out of hell that much harder for myself...You know what else I've found in the layers below? Determination. Strength. Love. Creativity. Alcohol doesn't just hide the demons. It hides all the wonderful things you forgot were there. This fight isn't easy but when did we start expecting good things to come easily? ..I will not drink with you today.
