**Freshman year of college**: I drank heavily without fail 3-4 times a week. Like all my floor mates and friends we never gave any thought to it because it was the traditional college experience right? We drank beer while studying we iced off with a few beers at the local water hole after evening classes consistently went out three times a week and had our fair share of blackouts drunken fights between ourselves in the dorms and the like. It was unhealthy but somehow didn't impede my progress in school. In fact insulated with the approval and similar behaviors of friends it never even occurred to me that it was a problem. I figured it was an integral part of university life. I maintained this habit for a year with a high GPA in a difficult major at a reasonably competitive school...&amp;#x200B;..**Sophomore year**: After transferring to a university closer to home I began having symptoms of hypomania and eventually experienced full blown manic episodes with all its component energy optimism fleeting happiness delusion paranoia and machinations of grandeur and self-importance. After I ecstatically told my mom I was convinced I could cure any disease and extend human life indefinitely my manic delusions became apparent to her. I was promptly hospitalized. My world came crashing down and I in the somber words of a favorite author of mine "\[wasn't\] as I once was." Physically mentally and emotionally I wasn't myself. Depression and anxiety riddled my mind and body. Naturally I turned to drinking to numb the pain of transitioning into a new frightening identity. This time my body and mind couldn't operate with heavy drinking. The medication severely reduced my tolerance and gave way to crippling hangovers and paranoid mornings wondering what I done the night previous who I had pissed off and to whom I had to apologize. Suicide was always at the back of my mind. I'd ruminate about the ways in which I'd do it and what I'd write in the letter bidding farewell to my friends and family. I never felt as if there was a way out. Drinking was my temporary escape that as you all know reinvigorated the feelings of anxiety and panic that led to the drinking in the first place. I was convinced my existence my frustration with mental illness and struggle with drinking was a burden on all those around me. Fortunately those suicidal fantasies never came to fruition and luckily to this day remain at bay. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..**Junior - Senior Year**: I continued to wrestle with severe bipolar depression panic attacks and alcoholic drinking to numb the suffering. I missed classes hid from the outside world and drank myself into emotional purgatory. My performance slipped so much one semester that I failed several classes and was placed on academic suspension and was forced the next year to spend two semesters at the community college to prove I was fit to return to school. In short I wasted away two years of my education to drinking self-loathing because of drinking and hibernation because of post-drinking anxiety. I did well at the community college but continued to drink reassured that it was no longer a problem just because I was doing well in laid-back courses that granted lots of flexibility to students who needed it...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..**Fall 2018**: It's my first semester back at university and I'm mid-way through the first term. Partly because of anxiety/depression and mostly because of alcohol feeding those ailments it seems as if the cycle of academic social and emotional failure is beginning to repeat itself: I've had to drop an important class for graduation and had to leave my job of one year one which I loved and through which I found purpose. I realized once I had lost my job and dropped classes again that something had to change. After so many years of family members being worried about my alcohol consumption and how it affects my school performance it finally got through my thick skull that they were right. When I drink "I'm not as I once was." It skyrockets anxiety disrupts mood stability and derails all academic social and personal progress. The funny thing is it's not the act of being drunk that destroys me it's the post-drinking depression panic and paranoia that cripples me obliterates my stability and discipline. I know this and own it now. I am an alcoholic. I own that and I own my own shortcomings without self-pity. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..Anxiety is not going anywhere nor is depression. They can be managed but they cannot be excised from my life with a surgical procedure nor indefinitely cured with pills. What I can control and fight against however is my addiction/self-medication with drinking. In hindsight had I never relied on drinking to numb the pains of mental illness I'd be in a much better place. I would have maintained grades and graduated two years ago with all my friends. I might even now have the career I dreamed of and be enjoying a life of meaning direction and purpose. These choices I made are my own not situations that were out of my control or wholly scapegoated on the backs of mental illness. For that I am beginning to take ownership and slowly moving forward. To use mental illness as a cause for my problems is a red herring for my personal failure in habitually succumbing to the poison chalice of drink for complete numbness from all that was falling apart around me. I do have agency to take control to take ownership of my mistakes. This begins with addressing my alcoholism. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..Anyway it's been several weeks or so since the important class and job were axed from my life. I had a mental breakdown and hid in my room for several days. This is my long-winded way of saying I realized alcohol has disrupted and dissolved what was supposed to be the most intellectually inspiring and socially enriching four years of my life. It's easy to dwell on how things could have been: graduation with friends exciting new careers an idyllic life unadulterated by the demons of my own creation. ..Now that I've accepted my personal failures to realize my alcoholism and the long list of academic and personal failures it has caused it's time to take extreme and honest ownership over both my problematic history with alcohol and the behaviors I can control moving forward. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..So today after spending five-six years failing to attain a degree stability and inner-peace I'm modestly celebrating a week of sobriety. In the last seven days I've found an incredible drop in anxiety and found a clear head space to evaluate where I am in life. That isn't much but it's more than I've had going for me in a while. I'm optimistic about the rest of the semester and my path to freedom from addiction. This community has given me hope that there's light at the end of this dark tunnel and I can't thank you all enough for that. ..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT. Here's to cases of La Croix! hahaha ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..**TLDR:** I'm an alcoholic and I have taken ownership of that instead of blaming my failures on other factors. I'm one week sober. ..&amp;#x200B;
