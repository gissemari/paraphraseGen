[Wall of Text ahead]..Hey guys!..I don't really know how to start so I'm gonna geht straight to the point: I'm worrying about the role alcohol is playing/could be playing in my life.  ..To the situation: I'm your typical 18 years old high-school guy. I usually drink 2-3 times a month and then typically around 3-6 drinks strictly on weekends. I've never ever lost control while drinking nor have I ever blacked out while drinking.I've been drinking in this pattern for about 1 year now with linke 2 months where I didn't drink at all. ..But since like 5 months I've become increasingly worried that I might be addicted to alcohol. It all began with my father telling me that my grandfather was an alcoholic. .I'd have rare occasions where I'd worry about becoming an alcoholic I had short feelings oft actually craving alcohol but those went away as quickly as they came and I never had long "cravings". ..(At this point I should probably say that I've been struggling with anxiety for the last 2 1/2 years. I mainly struggled with intense fear of having a deadly desease to  the point of almost being absolutely sure I had them. These fears have almost vanished over the years.)..But since last week my fear of being an alcoholic has intensified dramatically. But the worst thing is: I'm unsure if I have an alcohol problem or not. And if it is just fear that I'm feeling or that I actually crave alcohol. ..I've never ever felt an urge to  drink alcohol and I never used alcohol as a Problem solver. And I've never had a problem turning down a beer or stopping after drinking one beer. Also I haven't had a single drop of alcohola since these fears began to  be so intense.  .But right now I'm so unsure about everything and I'm really scared I might end up being an alcoholic/already being one...What is your opinion on this guys? .Is this worrying just exagerrated by my mind or do I really have an alcohol problem?..Thanks for your time to read this and for some helpful responses!..P.S.: Sorry about the not so well structured text and grammar errors I'm quite stressed right now. :(..~Brickon

Nobody here can tell you if you have an alcohol problem or not that is for you to decide personally. However if I were you I might take a break (I promise not to drink for 30 days/60 days you decide) just to prove to myself that I didn't NEED to drink. Just an idea! :)
I just suggested in a comment to another post that the 90 day no drink challenge might be a way to gain some clarity on the issue you're grappling with.  The way I stopped drinking was via [the things I discuss at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why not see if you can arrive at your own answers by simple sober actions for some sustained time without alcohol?
So don't drink.  I don't know if you have a problem or not but alcohol will send anxiety into overdrive.  If in the future you go for therapy being able to rule out alcohol as a possible culprit will help you get proper treatment...Drinking at your young age does raise your odds of developing a problem.  Many people your age don't usually drink anyway so you won't be any different than your peers...http://www.camy.org/factsheets/sheets/Prevalence_of_Underage_Drinking.html
