I mean there are a lot of alcohol or substance related forums out there and I'm not saying they're bad. Hell this is the first one (in English) that I've used. I've seen some via google but they seemed quite cluttered and not so easy to navigate...However in my native language I've pretty much looked up every last online resource there is. They all suck. What's worse is that there exists no moderation. This means that instead of focusing on solutions tips guides or just help for recovery 90% of the messages involve bickering trolling a holier-than-thou -mentality and generally they create a really negative atmosphere. None o that shit is here. Or at least it gets swept away so fast that I haven't seen it...Also the speaking from the I perspective; since I joined here and have followed discussions made the daily pledges wrote about my issues and struggles I've not only received massive amounts of support from total strangers around the world but I've found that my general way of describing my opinions has also shifted towards that "I"-mentality in real life. I did have that perspective before but many times I didn't really remember or use it especially if debating something...The reason I'm writing this is that I stumbled upon one of those aforementioned sites and was just shocked - all those egos fighting and fighting. I am really grateful for this place. I wouldn't be at 114 days without SD.
