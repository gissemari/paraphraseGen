I've been thinking of some friends that I drank with or were jealous of for whatever reason. Looks success drinking  abilities  whatever. But it's amazing the way this illness tricks your brain. I was just thinking of this one friend I really adored and was kinda spiting her all night and day. And then it dawned on me - remember that time she came to you basically in tears because she ditched her car while drunk? The time she passed out in front of your house and you almost ran her over? She had problems too you are not alone in this fight and the way your mind convinced you someone is  better  at drinking than you... remember those times where their struggle matched yours. You are not a freak. ..Was so so so close to convincing myself my sobriety was temporary. It's not. ..Iwndwyt
