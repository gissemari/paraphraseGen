Another week down and feeling better everyday. Just got my badge and seeing it gives me hope and strength to keep going seeing the progress made. it is a daily fight but its nice to see the time stacking up. I have tried before but always stumbled. I had never reached out or had exposure to people trying to stop too. Thank you to all you strangers that post and comment and share your life and struggle. Have a great sober day

Congratulations on your month. I'm just behind you. Do you feel any different as far as cravings go? Maybe a mental hump?
Congrats!!! I'll be joining you this weekend!
Nice going!! .
