On day two after an approximately two year relapse (had about 6 months sober before that). So much has changed in my life since the last time I was dedicated to being sober - that was honestly the last time I remember being happy. I just quit my job because I hated it and it was making me miserable furthering my depression and I finally realized no career was worth that (after 11 years chasing it). I'm trying hard to make good changes in my life and I started back on antidepressant medication the day I decided to quit alcohol again. ..I feel foggy out of it lost and sad. I don't know where I'm going with my life since it was all geared toward getting the job I just quit. But you know what? I'm not drinking today. Instead I cleaned the holy hell out of my house. I'm going to the gym in a bit. Things will come together and it will be better sober. I just have to keep telling myself that...Keep up the good fight SD. Thanks for listening. <3..PS - If anyone has any experience quitting alcohol and starting an SSRI at the same time I'd love to hear about it.

&gt; Things will come together and it will be better sober. I just have to keep telling myself that...It's true! Congrats!
I am on day 3 after going on a 5 day bender but before that I had roughly 70 days..I was happy and getting so much done! I LOVED being sober and I was looking forward to more of the energy and time to do stuff and like you I cleaned the crap outta the house! It felt so good!.I am now back on board and you have just inspired me to go clean something! Maybe brush the dog as he is shedding everywhere!.Whatever I find to do I will not be drinking with you today!.We got this!.
