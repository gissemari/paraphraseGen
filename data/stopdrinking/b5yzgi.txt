I was once. (age 17-20) addicted to meth.  I haven't touched drugs except alcohol since then (I'm 33 now).  I came to r/stopdrinking for a reason. I've drank for 4 years now but I struggle to control it. The signs are in front of me to quit. What do you all do instead of drink? How can I be sober AND somewhat happy?

Exercise is a pretty awesome alternative. I really like riding my bike!
I view addiction as a part of my being that my brain is permanently designed to become addicted to repetition and satisfaction ..I can easily become addicted to booze or coke but the problem is I lose all control over myself my decisions and actions and my life ..so I let myself get wrapped up in projects and little obsessions ..for the last few weeks I was obsessed with my new camera ..and now I'm obsessed with fixing up my camper..in a few weeks I will be obsessed with hiking ..keeps me occupied and my brain satisfied 
Drinking was not worth it to me.  For the sake of some romanticized notions for the sake of chasing a few good memories I endured unbelievable pain for years.  I tried to shut out my emotional pain with alcohol and it brought so much more pain...Sobriety is worth it to me.  I had no vision for a sober life at first.  I joined this group.  That was the key for me joining a support group.  AA or SMART help many.  Learning for sober people and knowing that I am not alone made the difference...Then I took it one day at a time.  It was tough at first then it got easier. Then one day I felt free. ..Best wishes to you! You can do this and I'm rooting for you. IWNDWYT
