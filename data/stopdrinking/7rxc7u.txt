I had about a week sober then about a week bender where I drank every night. I really fucking hate waking up and feeling like garbage every single day. ..Couldn't sleep more than an hour or two tonight and have been nauseous all day but the shakes have mostly subsided and I know from experience that it only gets better from here. If I can do it once I can do it again. Looking forward to feeling like a real functional human again in the next few days. Keep your heads up guys IWNDWYT.

Great work! Be careful. Do you know about kindling?
