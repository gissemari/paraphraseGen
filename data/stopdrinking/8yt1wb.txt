I just relapsed and am back to day 1 (for those who don't know yet). I have that tiredness again that I also had in the first 2 months of my initial try. Well I took a nap getting some coffee now and I am ready to continue my day and be productive. I am going to clean the house do some grocery shopping catch up with my work prepare a bit for my holiday (next week I am going to France yay!) and do some gaming/relaxing with a book in the sun. ..Enjoy your day folks!

Big fan of daytime naps! Well done for getting back on the horse. IWNDWYT 
Me too.. a big fan of naps and going to bed early. 
Love the nap.I love working 12 + hour days still and I can still do it at 60 because of the much under rated nap.
