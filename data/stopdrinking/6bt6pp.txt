It's been building up again the last month (or spiraling downward.) Depression and anxiety full blown despite meds bulemic episodes shame neglecting basic hygiene staying inside struggling to eat healthy and a normal amount..... Tonight I told SO I am a full blown alcoholic and it's all or nothing to me and that's it. When I came back from putting our toddler back to bed the bottle was gone. Seems like such a small thing but for him to hear me and acknowledge my struggle I was so HAPPY to see he hid it away. I feel loved and cared for. I feel a bit guilty that I couldn't do this on my own and handle this myself. He is trying to get healthy and lose weight and I am probably just distracting him from his own goals. I am praying I won't throw this opportunity away and I can be a rock for him for once!! I'm tired of feeling guilty unworthy unstable suicidal depressed anxious fat drunk stupid disappointing ...a waste...... I'm getting too old to keep living this way. Sorry for the rant. Hitting a bottom tonight and I'm really needing some help to pick myself back up guys.....

I'm glad you're getting support from your SO.  There's a lot to unpack in your post--I read it all carefully--but maybe it would be best to keep it simple right now and just address the drinking.  I'm only 8-9 days in from my last drinking episode but I already am feeling much better about a lot of things.  I think you'll probably feel at least a little better in a week or so.  Give it a whirl.  I will stay sober tonight with you!
