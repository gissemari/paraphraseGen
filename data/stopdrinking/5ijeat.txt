I relapsed last night...in my dreams. I even imagined the subsequent hangover and the shame that comes with it. It was frighteningly vivid but that only makes sense; my mind and body have both been there countless times.

After 16 days I actually had my first drinking dream last night. I was so relieved to wake up and realize I was in fact sober.
Occasionally.  It is nice to wake up and realize I don't have to reset my badge after all.  :)
I haven't had one yet while sober but I had them a lot while drinking if I went a few days without. I'm sure it'll happen but I can't say I'm looking forward to it. Did it freak you out?
All. The. Time...Two nights in a row now I've had such vivid dreams that I had to really think about it to realize I didn't actually have to re-set my badge. In last night's dream I remember thinking "Shit this is real this time not a dream. I really relapsed."..I'm still processing how I feel about the dreams. Mostly annoyed. I'm hoping they'll pass over time.
Had one on night #9. I was like what the hell am I doing? Was so glad to wake up and realize it was only a dream. No reset needed. FTZ!
