Ignore the badge: I stopped for 3 months 4 years ago before relapsing. Will reset now...So I have made it 3 weeks. I don't have too much anxiety and my sleep is pretty normal...However I get these weird prickly tingling sensations in my legs and other parts of my body that seems to be periodic throughout the day. Coupled with that I get these feelings of brain fog and head pressure that come and go. Eating seems to flair all the symptoms significantly...I haven't been to a doctor in some time. I'm a 26 year old male that has drank pretty heavily over the last 8 years. I didn't experience any sort of w/d really when I stopped. Maybe some slight anxiety. Im beginning to wonder if maybe I have a deficiency of some kind with vitamins as I haven't eaten healthy the last few years and my alcohol intake has been moderate to high depending on the day...Anyone else have experience with this? Should I just write it off as my body recovering from alcohol? ..Also over the past year I have abused opiates periodicially and used xanax/valium for a couple months to help with sleep at night. I have also stopped all the use of that as well...Overall my quality of life is kind of shitty because these physical symptoms that haven't seem to have abated. However I am still functional for the most part and am still sexually active...I don't know it's got me feeling down...Any advice or experiences? ..Thanks alot. I will not drink today.
