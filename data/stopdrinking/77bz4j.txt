I checked out of a 5-day detox program yesterday for alcohol abuse. My nightly routine was about 20 shots of vodka then 1 mg of Ativan and 10 mg of melatonin to knock myself out. ..I was terrified of the detox process but I think I might have been even more terrified at the prospect of giving up a familiar routine with consistent results. If I hadn't reached out for help I'd be on a pretty good buzz. I'd also be one step closer to early grave as the primary doctor at the detox/rehab center confirmed with my lab results...It's nice being able to eat full meals again. I used to eat just enough to make sure I didn't throw up while I was drinking heavily. Now I'm actually enjoying meals socializing with others and waking up every day getting to claim another victory. Still the urges are there. Simply writing this post is one of many ways that I'm trying to fight the urge...So to those of you struggling tonight I'm right there with you. The one day at a time part is much easier than one night at a time.

Awesome :) keep at it one day at a time and before you know it the months will start flying by my friend. I am happy to hear how positive you already feel. 
yaaay you'd see me there if we were in the same city! :D
Good luck to you!  I remember being so awkward and standoffish at my first meeting but everyone was super friendly.  Keep fighting the good fight.
Looking forward to hearing more about your journey!
The other day I read This Naked Mind cover to cover. I would highly suggest reading that book as tons of others in this sub always do. Never in my many times trying to quit have I had the mindset that I absolutely don't want to drink. ..Best of luck to you. I will not drink with you today.
