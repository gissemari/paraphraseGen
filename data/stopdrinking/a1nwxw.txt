So I've been drinking quite heavily since the age of 18. Started off as just getting shitfaced on weekends for social events then progressively turned into drinking 6-12 beers daily as well as going out and getting shit faced at least once every 1-3 weeks. The reason I started drinking so heavily aside from enjoying it so much (see username) was to ease the comedown I experience from the stimulant medication I am prescribed to treat ADHD. So why don't I get off the meds? Because I am a useless lazy shit without them and it makes day-to-day life a struggle. Shit attitude and excuse I know... that's why I'm here posting this because I feel like I need help but I have no one to talk to. ..I became really concerned recently as I have developed tremors in my left and right hand and slightly in my head. When I'm relaxed my hands don't really shake at all but if I move them in certain positions they can begin to shake pretty violently. The tremors with my head are rare but every now and again my head will shake slightly. I also feel pain in my stomach and sides (kidneys?) at times at the end of the day after drinking but like the idiot I am I choose to ignore it and continue with my bad habits. I don't feel invincible anymore and I know i'll end up dead at a young age if I keep this up. ..Does anyone have advice for me to get this under control without seeking help from others just yet? I want that to be last resort because I am ashamed.

You will want to talk to a doctor about the tremors. We cannot give medical advice on this subreddit. ..Are you sober now? That's how we all had to start.
Being ashamed sucks but you need help from others. You already took a step by posting here. ..Realize that you probably need to not just drink less at this point but stop completely. I don't know how far you are as far as your body depending on alcohol but I would go to a doctor and tell them what is up. At least get a physical and have them make sure you won't go into withdrawals...When I needed to be helped I had to go to a rehab facility and receive medical help for getting through the withdrawals. If I would have tried to "do it by myself" again I wouldn't have a year and a half of sobriety under my belt today. ..Good luck.

I've got many many many years on you and my best advice is get serious about getting control of this sooner rather than later. Happy for you that your being strong and brave at a young age and tackling this much earlier in your life than I did in mine. You can do it. Good luck.
All I can tell you is that it will only get worse and harder to quit. Not easier. Ask anyone that has been sober 2 or more years if we quit too soon. You will get the same answer.  Hell no . ..I would not stop taking your medication without talking to a doctor. ..AA saved my life. The people in the meetings are just like you and .me. ..The sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit has links to two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. ..Quitting drinking isn't easy but it isn't hard either. It takes effort. I encourage you to at least give it a try. Good luck. IWNDWYT 
\*\*..I quit drinking 2 years ago (and some change) I too was also prescribed an ADHD medication that resulted in an addiction/ various health problems this may be something the people in [/r/StopSpeeding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StopSpeeding/) can help with. I remember Adderall withdrawals and I owe a huge part of my recovery to my decision to ditch them. ..\*\*Mods feel free to delete this if you want I don't know the rules for cross-referencing this sort of stuff\*\*..&amp;#x200B;..I decided to quit drinking at 25. I had similar tremor-like symptoms crippling anxiety and I felt hopeless. The day I quit drinking (for the first go) I felt like I was going to die. Those initial withdrawals I remember like a vivid nightmare I may or may not have had DTs the first two days were hell third day something came over me like a sun rising on the horizon. Then 2 weeks later I relapsed at a friends wedding had a week of reacquainting myself with the inner hell that I am capable of got back on the sober train and haven't looked back since. ..&amp;#x200B;..I started running when I quit drinking. Not directly after but maybe 2 to 3 weeks in I started going out once or twice a week. It started as quick 3 mile runs around the neighborhood to combat the  developing anxiety attacks I used to get pretty frequently. I figure when you have a panic attack that your heart starts beating your chest tightens you start to sweat...I basically take the energy that I would've invested into a full-blown spiraling anxiety attack into a workout. Then as I started getting healthier and avoided the booze the panic attacks just all about stopped. I still have them maybe once every other month or so but I have more control over them without a doubt...&amp;#x200B;..Sobriety taught me how to cope with my existence without numbing myself or escaping.  r/stopdrinking has been  with me the entire time. ..&amp;#x200B;..* find a good book to read or audiobook / podcast to listen to.* buy a 12 pack of sparkling water ..you got this IWNDWYT
