This is my second time trying to get sober and given that my last stint (which was my first attempt) lasted just over a year followed by two and a half years of relapse I've been really trying to actively get help for some of the underlying issues that lead to my drinking. I met with an addiction specific counselor who recommended I start seeing a therapist weekly and prescribed me anti-depressants. I know the act of finally speaking out about unresolved issues is healthy and will be good in the long run but at the same time delving into those emotional topics (that I spent so much cash to drink away to normalize the situations) is creating a level of friction relating to my sobriety that I haven't felt previously. Its like I know I'm not going to go out and get a drink but I'm just feeling a lot less settled. Any one have experiences like this and have advice?

I just wrote a post about this unsettled feeling.  What helped me tonight was to come on to SD and comment words of either congrats or encouragement to a bunch of people who posted here.  I think it helped me get my mind off myself and reach out to others. ..Watch out with the anti depressants.  I was on Effexor or whatever it's called  totally addictive completely KILLS your libido and was for me anyway just horrible. ..Funny story the shit is super addictive so much so that if I ran out and couldn't get a refill from my doc because it was the weekend or whatever the pharmacist would give me a few tabs to get me through the weekend because missing a day was ROUGH.    My doc told me I might have to be on it forever and that getting off it is really difficult.  I decided that I'd had many worse hangovers and I could tough it out.  I did and it sucked big time. ..If I had to do it again the anti depressants I'd probably just hire a trainer to kick my ass in the gym a few times a week instead. ..Good luck
