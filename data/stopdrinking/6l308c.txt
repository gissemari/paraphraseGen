I was 7 months in and going strong. I was really pleased with myself after going for my first long bike ride in a long time after being injured. There was a fancy beer in my fridge and I decided to make a ceremony of drinking it. I rationalized it with "I'm making all sorts of great changes in my life and change is the only constant. No sense being so dogmatic about this no drinking thing". I sent my badge reset request. Soon I was having a drink here and there and a couple of times bought a 6 pack on the way home with the plan of having one which never worked. ..It took me a month and a half to finally realize what was happening. I blacked out the other night. My depression is sky high...I was so confident that I had defeated this thing and flew too close to the sun. Today is a new day and one day at a time I will get back to where I was this time armed with the experience of a relapse after thinking I was over it. Badge reset request sent. I'll not drink with you today.
