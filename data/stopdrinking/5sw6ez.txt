Disclaimer: The purpose of this post is NOT to cause any offence. This is an honest and genuine post whereby I desire the opinions of fellow SD'ers; in order to better understand others (and perhaps myself too). ..I have watched countless documentaries about younger people drinking. I have also read lots of posts here on SD from people struggling and experiencing health problems at an early age. ..When watching and reading I realise that I had been drinking very heavily on a daily basis for far longer than some younger folks are in age...Why is it that it appears that us older folks (me F51) somehow have endured the alcohol self-abuse longer in time? Is it that our ever-increasing tolerance over many decades somehow has led to a slower more lengthier decline? ..What I do know is that these young fine SD'ers are the 'smartie pants' as they are addressing the issue at an earlier age. ..My data:..Total length of shenanigans: circa 30 years..Commencement of problem: bottle(s) red wine daily..Finale of problem: between 50cl to 1 litre vodka daily..Length of finale: circa 15 years

Freaking vodka man. It's *always* vodka! 
I don't think the stats have changed too much I just think we're finally getting a bit more awareness. Everyone's decline into alcoholism is slightly different I guess. .My data:.Length of shenanigans: 29 years.Commencement of problem: 3-4 beers or glasses of wine per night.Finale: All day drinker 3 bottles of wine roughly per 24 hour period.Length of finale: 4 years (with sober stretches probably kept me from more serious health issues)
Your results may vary...Some are "bingers" and some are "maintenance drinkers"...Your description sounds like the latter...There's a great post by u/gelastic_farceur on "A little love for maintenance drinkers."   I'll look for the post.  One thing jumps out at me when he shares "It's not that I lack an 'off' switch; I lack a 'don't' switch"...That described me to a T !
I wonder if more young people getting involved has something to do with raised awareness re: mental illness and less stigma (although there's certainly still stigma) around reaching out for help. Recognizing that anxiety/mental unwellness is a Real Thing and connecting feeling terrible with alcohol (regardless of whether or not mental illness is comorbid with being a problem drinker) and having an overall sense of "yeah I should probably figure out what is going on here and change something."
