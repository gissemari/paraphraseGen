[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------.**Triumph:** The drain in my bathtub was clogged and wouldn't drain and instead of calling a plumber I went down to the hardware store asked them to explain how to unclog it then bought an auger and snaked out the drain myself! I love learning to do new things...**Struggle:** I had a drinking dream that was so specific that I not only chose the cocktail I wanted in the dream I picked the particular brand of vodka. I know we all have drinking dreams but the intensity of this one left me feeling off-kilter the whole next day...**Sobriety: It ain't for sissies!**..**General:** I don't know if [ What I'd Say ] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAjeSS3kktA) by Ray Charles is the best song ever written but it has to be up there among the finalists...What would *you* nominate for best song ever?.
----------immediate responses--------

Here's something interesting. It's 10pm and I just realized that aside from making my daily post this morning I haven't thought of alcohol. Not at all. Not a craving to ignore not a desire to go to a pub to squash. Nothing. ..3 weeks in and I finally had a day where I really didn't have to actively think about NOT thinking about booze. ..That excites me :) 
**Triumph:** I handled a scary financial situation without using alcohol to wash away all the panicked feelings!..**Struggle:** I had an out-of-proportion miniature breakdown before handling said financial situation...**General:** tough question it's so subjective! For me it might be [California Dreamin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wabc6ojuw-s) by Bobby Womack

Triumph: I was thinking about getting a new daily driver and I like fast cars so I test drove a Tesla P100D in ludicrous mode and they not only let me goose it they actively encouraged it. Whoo-hoo what a blast! I am time poor so my rationalization for maybe getting one is that you get a lot of bang for the buck virtually no maintenance no gas station stops (the way I would use it anyway) you can drive in the carpool lane by yourself and it will park itself! Plus it's not such a ticket magnet. That's in stark contrast to the times before I got sober when I was so short on money (from spending it all on drugs/alcohol and the wife smartly turning off all the spigots) that I would run out of gas and have to push the car a half mile then panhandle money for gas...Struggle: We're having trouble finding good people for a position or two we're trying to fill at work. It's a preoccupation and it's making my already long work days longer than usual. I'm also doing this hardcore hour-long work out in the mornings and it's kicking my ass...General: Best song? Oh man that's so tough because I have favorites in each category but if I go with mellow rock then it would have to be *Here Comes My Girl* by Tom Petty..
Triumph: I got new customers for my business I am starting. I saved money this paycheck and bought some tools to invest. I mowed 4 lawns today. Sobriety is awesome!..Struggle: I need to go to a meeting but find it hard to make time. I struggle trying to keep balance with family sobriety and work. I have managed to keep it afloat with a clear head and no hangovers! Awesome
Day two. I will not drink today. Just not having hangover is best part. One foot in front of the other...pretty sure that phrase is from a childhood Christmas cartoon ;).one day at a time. 
Triumph : Dealing with a recurring situation that normally depresses me by positive-thinking my way out of it throughout the day...Struggle : I have absolutely no energy I'm so flat. ..
Hey not drinking with you all today thankyou for all your posts. 
**Triumph:** Things are going well. I'm feeling pretty balanced between work and home personal and relationships...**Struggle:** It's barely Wednesday for me. My sleep is not balanced and I'm waking up in the middle of the night and the mental gerbils *run*. I've got to find some way of settling them down...Best song **ever**? Can't do it. I just spent some time trying to choose one of [Charlie Patton's songs](https://youtu.be/1BrmnnCpQoo) because they distill so much history to that point and influenced so much of the music I listen to.
Triumph: had some great feedback from senior peeps on a marketing project I've been running this week. Nice to be recognised as I pulled a lot of 12-hour days in the run-up to launch...Struggle: my tendency to brush off compliments like the one above and focus on negative or absent feedback. I really struggle to absorb the positive constantly honing in on the one negative point or thinking they're not being sincere.
Triumph - no arguing with my pregnant wife...Struggle - feel like my life has less structure and is boring sober
Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday and I cleaned half my room. I'm still on small accomplishments lol
Triumph: I cleaned most of my room which I never did when I drank daily. ..Struggle: Being sober for these days has snapped me back to reality and made me realize all the life I wasted. ..I don't think a best song exists...but one I love.....Wild is the Wind - Nina Simone 
**Triumph:** I had small argument with my boyfriend and I didn't let it ruin my day and give me an excuse to drink.     .    **Struggle:** Money has been an more of a stress lately. Some big bills are coming up and it's tough. Trying not to let that drag me down. 
This is my first time commenting here! Hi!..Triumph: I feel so good. I'm down 6 lbs in two weeks I'm jogging with my dog almost every day I'm usually in bed having the best night sleep ever by 10pm and I am definitely more present/clear-headed already. ..Struggle: I've really had to start facing the problems I created for myself while drinking and fix them. Namely for my business as I'm working through taxes. I've been really careless and I'm not proud of myself. Trying to not beat myself up too much but it's hard. 
Triumph: my friends don't even ask me if I want a beer when they head to the bar for another round. They just bring back a water for me because they all know that I don't drink. It's awesome and I love them. ..Struggle: living three hours away from my son really really really sucks. I need to get on the job search grind ASAP (already sad about having to write cover letters haha)...General: "As" by Stevie Wonder is the best song of all time. It'll instantly put a smile on anyone's face. 
Triumph:  100 days!!  Feels great to be sober happy about it how much my life is changing with this new perspective...Failure: Still not exercising.  Stress over money related to job change...Song:  "Us and Them" - Pink Floyd has always been a favorite during tough times.
Triumph; that little 100 sitting beside my name right now and the fact it's been hard earned the last two weeks when facing some health concerns. The high stress was making me want to throw in the towel so many times but now everything's come back ok I'm so relieved I didn't...Struggle; stopping drinking did not wave a magic wand and get rid of my anxiety as it has done in the past. I'm battling the 'sure you weren't that bad' thoughts...I'll have to comtemplate the song as my taste in music is variable according to my mood.
Thanks for posting /u/sfgirlmary...Triumph: I mopped the floor for the first time since I moved into my apartment- 7 months ago! (I posted about this earlier this week). I also washed the windows for the first time since I moved in and started cooking my meals in a REAL PAN as opposed to a disposable one- and actually cleaning it!..Struggle: I'm probably gonna have to move for work which frustrates me because I hate change (especially when I'm having it forced on me) I really like where I live and I feel like I'm too young in sobriety for a big move like this. Work isn't willing to push it out until I'm a year sober unfortunately. :)..General: My favorite song of the moment (not all time) is Don't You Worry About A Thing by Tori Kelly. Very upbeat and uplifting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzPQ61oYMtQ
Triumph:  4 match (tennis) win streak!  it's amazing how much easier 3rd sets are when you aren't hungover.....Struggle:  It's hard to articulate accurately/precisely but I'm having to relearn &amp; recalibrate what I do/don't like.  Drinking let me ignore the fact that for years (decades really) I was ignoring/suppressing what _I_ wanted/needed to avoid confrontation.  It also took away my ability to handle that confrontation when it was brought to me even though I wasn't seeking it.  Now that it's gone I'm able to deal w/it better but am having to face some uncomfortable truths about the sources/causes of it.....General:  I love spring (aka "pollen season" here in Atlanta)!  Some people are summer people some winter &amp; some even fall but I've always loved spring!  Winter's over weather's nice &amp; we still have summer &amp; fall ahead of us!  Winter is never further away than when pollen season starts!
**Triumph** I did my taxes! And it wasn't even that hard...**Struggle** My tween/teen kids seems to be annoyed at everyone in the family. Trying to be patient and loving when a I want to roll my eyes and tell the kid they're being an asshole...**General** So many great songs! I've always been fascinated with Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. How did such a young guy write that much sadness? But generally I like happy songs.
Triumph:  just passed the 9 months mark! ..Struggle: vacation planned for next month this will be my first sober vacay and we're going to a concert one of the nights.  It's going to be a challenge but one that I'm ready to step up to the plate for. ..General:  The best song ever written is Goodbye Horses by Q. Lazarus and everyone knows it. 
**Triumph:** We've decided to put in built in shelving and dressers in the bedroom closet which meant cleaning out the closet and going through things. No arguments erupted in stage 1 of project closet which was nice! And my SO and I spent some time together looking through the mementos I had saved from back in our dating days which was also nice :)..**Struggle:** I miss my beautiful uninterrupted sleep. For some reason I've either been waking up way too early and not being able to go back to sleep or my alarm goes off in the middle of a sleep cycle and I wake up groggy and out of it. I think I got spoiled by the past months of sleep perfection...**General:** Oh wow best song ever for me is a hard call and so subjective to what mood I happen to be in. I'm going to say David Bowie's entire Black Star album is a masterpiece. 
**Triumph:** I've been getting out more trying to do more. I did a new yoga class on Sunday and went all by myself went out with coworkers last night. Will probably play the new Pandemic with some friends tonight. The more I do these things the easier it gets to do them...**Struggle:** Gotta stop eating and barfing. It's putting a huge strain on my body and energy levels. I'm not sure how I managed to do this so casually and so often when I was younger without the issues I'm having now -- I was even 15-20 lbs lighter...**General:** Idk. I love Bob Dylan's lyrics as a rule. And a lot of Pink Floyd's lyrics appeal directly to me. I'm really loving Lennon's Imagine these days although it's a pretty straight forward song.
T: It's been a hard month but I'm still standing and still have plenty to be thankful for. ..S: There's a lot of uncertainties in my life right know and change can be scary...G: I'm going to jump on the Pink Floyd wagon and say "Time" is one of the best songs ever. The lyrics resonate with me now more than ever.
Triumph: I had an emotional meltdown yesterday. I cried and cried. I felt all alone and I felt really sorry for myself. But I did not drink...Struggle: I have to go to court today which is stressful. I'm praying for serenity amidst the chaos. ..General: I'm beginning my 4th step with my sponser. It is really tough and it is dragging up a bunch of bad memories for me. But I'm eager to do whatever it takes to stay in recovery. .
Triumph: I am on day three of not drinking. I will not drink today...Struggle: I am on day three of not drinking. Ha ha. I still have the shakes and am nauseated. Every time I think about drinking I look on this subreddit and read everyone's amazing stories. It's helping. ..I will not drink today.
Struggle: it's only been four days and I already bitterly regret the past several years of my life..Triumph: didn't drink and didn't want to
**Triumph** I went to trivia last night for the 1st time since I stopped drinking and I only had seltzer...**Struggle** I'm really isolating myself lately and I kind of like it but I know it's probably not good for me. ..**Sobriety** It's actually been going really well. It's kicked me in the ass to start yoga which is kind of amazing since I'm not bendy at all. ..**General** [Get Better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB4Avdlz3lk) by Frank Turner. Currently one of my favorite songs. I can never pick just one favorite song though. 
Um /u/sfgirlmary you are a bad ass. I have the handy skills of a slug so I admire your go-getter attitude in learning how to handle something like that (and doing so successfully)!..**Triumph:** A few weeks ago I reached out to someone I had harmed in the past and apologized. We mutually harmed each other really. He hurt me and then I hit back hard. ..I sent him an email apologizing and owning my part of it without any qualification (none of this "well you hurt me FIRST so somehow my behavior was justified!!" bullshit) and told him that I knew the apology may not be accepted and that I didn't know if this was the right action but it seemed like a basic but important human thing to do. I didn't expect a response but one showed up in my inbox a few days ago. The letter was so kind. I cried when I read it. He said *exactly* what I needed to hear. I didn't even know it was what I needed until I read it. ..**Struggle:** I've been struggling to keep up with everything I need to be keeping up with and feeling really bad about myself. I've been in work situations where I was doing so much and juggling a million things. It felt like the first month of sobriety was supercharged and now it has slowed down--I'm feeling a lot of fatigue and like I've slowed down a lot and I'm trying not to beat myself up about it...**General:** Started Grimm on a whim now can't stop watching. Totally obsessed. ..As for best song ever I couldn't nominate just one but lately I've been listening to a lot of [Electric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a4gyJsY0mc) [Six](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Htu2ku4Oo) since THEY ARE COMING TO MY TOWN IN THE SUMMER AND I HAVE TICKETS AND I AM SOOOOOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!! .
*Sobriety: It ain't for sissies!* love it...**Triumph:** I have another round of interviews on Friday for a position I really really reaallayllallyllylyyyy want. the first ones went well. everyone cross your fingers. :D..**Struggle:** interviews make me nervous and my stomach has been upset all week. I've already been having digestion/appetite issues lately this is not helping. :(..**General:** ok this probably isn't the best song ever written but it's my favorite: [Lateralus by Tool.](https://youtu.be/epkG-xSYaHA) it has everything! hidden Fibonacci sequences! sweeping melodies! beautiful lyrics about consciousness and the human experience! Danny Carey's GLORIOUS DRUMS AAAHHHHH............... *brb having a spiritual experience*
Hey u/sfgirlmary! So I may be asking you for some advice on how to unclog the drain by myself! :) Great job!..Triumph:      Dealt with the whole flat tire in the pouring rain storm at 4:30AM yesterday. I still can't get over the overwhelming support and all of the messages of encouragement I got from SD yesterday!!..Struggle:      Dealing with some business/financial issues and finding myself even more impatient than usual. Note to self: Calm the F* down Lee. Deal with it...Sobriety:      415 days ago I would have got drunk on wine over the car issue. Not anymore ;)...General:      Spring. I'm thanking my lucky stars that it's here!
T:  I didn't drink...S:  Oh boy...  everything.   Daughter stayed with Mom over spring break.  Supposed to meet up half way and she was a day late brought daughter back with abscessed tooth and without jacket i sent her down with...  I'm just getting started!   Struggle = real...Sobriety  if it were easy everyone would do it...G:  I don't know if u all missed this but it's an objective fact that the best song ever is Stairway to heaven by led zepplin.  I thought this was common knowledge! 
**Triumph:** I am finally not vacillating about my relationship.  I have decided to put on my big girl pants and really be present in this relationship and commit to it.  At the very least I will get much-needed practice on being a good partner and thinking of others and I think my full involvement will truly help me arrive at a definitive answer about whether this is the right relationship for me.  In hindsight seems like a "duh!" moment.  But lord it took me like 6 months to arrive at this little jewel of insight...**Struggle:** I *really* want to get to the place of keeping up my home space on a regular basis.  Not just keeping it neat but keeping it clean.  I hate how petulant I get around this type of chore.  Grow up self FFS!..**General:**  Man I love just about all music genres so hard to pick a best song.  But lately I've gotten pretty revved up by revisiting some old workout music like Rage Against the Machine &amp; Tool.  Been cooking and dancing in the kitchen to country music 'tho!
Triumph: I woke up at 6:25 this morning and took my girlfriend to work because she doesn't have a car at the moment and we had time to stop and get biscuits and coffee before. We also talked and laughed the entire car ride without any grumbles. This is something that doesn't seem like much but to me it is because if I'd been drinking like I used to on Tuesday nights I would have been in a bad mood waking up got ready in 5 minutes and wouldn't have had time to stop and get us breakfast before dropping her off. ..Struggle: I have been having anxiety about an upcoming wedding that I am in or more so the bachelorette party and bridal shower I'm attending in the coming months. The people in the wedding party and the bride and groom are heavy drinkers and I'm worrying about telling them I no longer drink. ..General: I couldn't say what the best song ever written is but damn I love Dreams by Fleetwood Mac
Triumph: I keep feeling more like myself!..Struggle: I have two sometimes I still get really bad nausea I had to take gravol again last night. The other is that I thought I saw a beer in a cupboard that didn't get drunk. It wasn't one but I realized that I don't think I have the strength yet to not drink what is in my house...General: the best song ever written for me is let it be by the Beatles just because of the peace it has always brought me.
Triumph: got my tax paperwork to the account. First time in a decade that I haven't had to file an extension..Struggle: 40 days cigarette free not nicotine free once I'm on the patch and sometimes I really miss smoking..Sobriety: it's all good. .General: Mr Rogers was a Navy Seal? Really? 
Triumph. I deep cleaned my apartment for the first time in god knows how long. Also I visited my old place of work to ask if I could come observe as research for a project I'm doing and they said sure. They also asked if I'd like to be an on call sub for them saying they had some days coming up where they'd need the extra hands. I need the money so that's nice. ..Struggle. I've been feeling really lonely lately. I don't really have anyone. It's really making the whole staying on track thing difficult. ..General. I don't think there's one best song. I nominate all those songs that someone somewhere is immediately  thinking about when asked about their favourite songs. My favourite is probably In Loving Memory by Alter Bridge but it has to be the live version from Amsterdam. 
Triumph: I am 95% moved into my new home! The house is so lovely and is much more spacious than my old apartment. I'm looking forward to picking out some new furniture and settling in. ..Struggle: After a few hours of lifting furniture and sweating in the sun my first thought was "After all this hard work I can have a cold craft beer..." It's so eye-opening to realize the niche that alcohol occupies in my head and habits and the influence it has on me! I instead had a large glass of cold bubbly water with coconut milk :) 
Made it (non europe time at least which while I'm still in London hoping it counts - long day)! I will not drink with you today :)
**Triumph**  I got a raise at work.  My boss asked to speak me alone as I was leaving and I had that inner panic "uh oh what did I screw up?"  He said I'm doing a great job and is giving a dollar an hour more.  I am stoked that I'm appreciated the $ will help...**Struggle** I smoked several cigarettes this week.  And I've been eating more chocolate than I feel is good for me.  I think it's addict brain lashing out.  I need to kick its ass.  I was doing pretty great with that stuff.  Time to get back on track...**General** best song ever...hmmm.  That's tough.  I'll say Desolation Row by Dylan
