Hi All. I'm on day two after one of several relapses. I've been trying to stay sober for years without success. I'm curious to know what has helped everyone here stay sober. Are you seeing a counselor using medication (if that's not too invasive of a question) has anyone here tried vivitrol? AA journaling meditation? I'm open and willing to try anything to stay sober. Thank you all for your continued support. I will not drink with you today.

What helped me the most in the first 6-7 months was [The Daily Check-In](https://redd.it/7nk4pb) and AA for the social benefits. Something very powerful happened in my brain Each and Every Morning when I typed those five little words "I will not drink TODAY." If I felt the lizard speaking to me later in the day I remembered the commitment I made to myself and kept EXTRA Busy and/or went to a meeting. ..Also if you want some motivation here is [MY TWO-YEAR POST](https://redd.it/6wincn) which also explains how I stopped...Happy New Year and Good Luck!!..
I like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7nfvrz/just_starting_out_me_too_here_is_a_list_of_the/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link).  ..For me:  La Croix.  Stopped with my significant other.  Talked to him about it a lot.  Walking and hiking.  This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. This sub above everything else!
The daily check-in and posting daily here was very helpful to me. I feel like that should be in all caps it was so helpful...I took up going to the gym and meditation. I couldn't stick with going to the gym but I did stick with meditating. It took a while for that to feel helpful though. It does now...I tried Refuge Recovery but I felt very awkward about it. I read a lot of books on recovery and addiction and listened to podcasts on my commute most of which were recommended here at SD...I spoke to my doctor but did not go on medication. I'm on vitamin supplements under doctor's orders as he ordered blood work and found that I was severely deficient. He also checked out my liver and that is surprisingly in good shape...I don't live alone. I have a husband and 2 teenage kids so I was open with them and they have been mostly supportive. My kids have been a huge motivation for me especially as they are now being invited to keg parties and such...Looking back I think I probably should have tried counseling. But I had many doctors' appointments with the vitamin deficiencies and low energy from anemia and working full time and I just couldn't figure out how to pull it off. Now that I am physically better I will keep that option open for my future if I start to flag...So I needed a few strategies and something to do regarding sobriety every day. We are all rooting for you here and I hope you'll keep coming around SD. There are so many great resources here.
I don't know if I believe"rock bottom" is really a thing or if it's actually necessary I know people who have just decided to quit and quit. ..For me though it took a trip to the ER and believing I was about to die and then to my great surprise finding out I actually didn't want to die. I had pretty much given up on life after my wife left and I lost my job and felt like even though I couldn't quit drinking I had it under control to the point that I could make it til my kid was grown and still be a good dad to him before it got me. ..Now it's like stepping through the looking glass seeing how wrong and delusional I was. I wasn't a bad father but I wasn't as engaged and close to my son as I thought I was. I can see just from his reactions to me in the last few days from his perspective I must have just been kinda "there" fixing his lunches washing his clothes. Now we play all the time we talk he's after me non-stop for attention and I love it. ..Life has meaning again I'm starting to enjoy things again I *want* things. That's where it all really went wrong for me I gave up on most things I cared about and burrowed into an alcoholic cocoon...I know it's not practical advice but all I can say is look for meaning joy goals and try to see how booze is robbing you of those things if it is. ..But it's hard. Yesterday was an awful day and I just had to kind of breathe and keep remembering all things pass in time.
