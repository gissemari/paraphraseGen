January 2nd will be a full 365 days sober. My life has changed in so many positive ways. I want to thank folks here that I got great advice from when I started my journey and also provide anyone struggling with reassurance. You are stronger than you know don't give in to the temptation. Remember why you stopped to begin with every time you are tempted.

I needed to read that today thanks for posting and congratulations.
Lately everyone around me has been shitting on New Years resolutions. Saying  nobody ever keeps them  it's dumb just another day etc. When I respond that I quit drinking last January 1 people are always very stunned. I never really intended to quit drinking for this long or to time it on New Years but it just worked out that way and I am so proud of the New Years crew that I got sober with this year! ..It is inspiring me to make big goals and resolutions for this next year because I've proven to myself that I can set an intention and stick with it!..Congrats to you and i hope you stick with it throughout 2019!!
Yay well done! I am right here with ya!
