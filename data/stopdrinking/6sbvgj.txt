Just ended my holiday. I have been able to spend it 95% without alcohol I relapsed 2 times but feel that I'm on the right track Feel better lost a bit of weight and I want to continue to feel even better ..Now the real challenge starts I do export sales meaning out in the world constantly. Next week Russia   then 2 weeks in Denmark and a jump to Poland a small break and then a long trip to Africa....After this Asia it will continue like this until the end of the year..I love and hate the traveling part of my work. The issue is that Alcohol is a part of my association to the traveling. And I start to be afraid that it's not the traveling I love it's the constant opportunities to drink.....Anyone who is a traveler who have any tip on how to sober up while outside?..Or do I have to consider a career change only problem  this is what I know and do best done it for 20 years and nothing else..Not drinking with you tonight .

I travel a lot i used to travel as much as you.  I find a sober contact in the cities I am visiting and plan a meet up.
I've traveled a good bit.  Something I learned and take advantage of is there are meetings everywhere in the world!..I can go to a new city town or country Google a meeting and in short order I am connected with local sober support people.  I've made friends all over and get local tips and advice!..Tried that?
Maybe i should thanks for the ideas
