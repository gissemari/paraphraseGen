Previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/73b9qn/almost_at_day_60_and_i_really_want_to_drink/ I remember the morning of that relapse. I woke up from a fantastic sober sleep I even had butterflies in my stomach that persisted throughout the day. When 8pm rolled around I still felt fantastic and then I had a random thought: "Im in such a great mood alcohol would be so fun right now." I dont know how I managed to rationalize that thought in my mind. Anyways I started putting on my "going out" attire while the whole time I was thinking "I shouldnt be doing this" but I kept doing it anyways. I got to the bar around 9pm. Before I ordered a beer I was socializing like Ive never done before. When I took that first sip of beer I thought "this fucking sucks." Before I knew it I was shitfaced and not sociable. The next morning I was so sad. Still am I have been avoiding everyone in my life because I am so ashamed of myself. I didnt have fun at all that night and I am still kicking myself over that decision to drink.

I've found for me that it is best to forgive myself and focus on what I have accomplished in the past and what I can accomplish now.  It can be very hard to change oneself.  There are hiccups along the way but you are back and working on it again which is wonderful. .
