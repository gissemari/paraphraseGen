I know we aren't supposed to beat ourselves up but man I can't help but do so right now.  Drank so much earlier today.  I am no longer drunk and am writing this fully aware of what I am saying. Anyway I pretty much decided that I wanted a drink. For no other reason than I wanted to alter my state of mind. Does that make sense?  Keep having these 3-5 day streaks and then decide I want to feel messed up so end up going to the store and well than the rest is history.  ..I feel like I always want to be high or drunk or something.  I don't know I'm rambling. I am just so annoyed with myself.   ..Any suggestions or tips for those of you who have also struggled like this would be greatly appreciated.

Coming here every day made the difference for me.  And taking it one day at time. I never thought I could do this but one day at a time took me to a place where I don't have to struggle most days.  It's freedom. ..Wishing you the best ! IWNDWYT
