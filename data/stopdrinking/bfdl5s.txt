Hi all..I am on day 20 today and about to go see family for Easter. I anticipate the typical stressors but I think it'll be okay. My family doesn't keep alcohol in the house and we actually don't drink together for any holiday (never have) so no worries there...I am just kind of in a weird place. I'm tired of drinking the AA Koolaid in a way -- my sponsor got on me last night for not raising my hand for having less than 30 days. The way she was looking at me too...like looking into my soul to see what was the matter. Nothing's the matter I just wanted to sit and listen and not talk. She was saying that letting up on any little thing can make me slip and relapse. She has a point but I got frustrated. ..After I went home and was enjoying quality time with my partner she sent me a Big Book quote about resting on your laurels. That made me feel even worse because I've been devoting a lot of time to the program at the expense of other things I need to do (pack for my move exercise clean or grocery shop). All I do is work go to AA go to sleep. Give me a break!!!! ..I understand she's concerned and coming from a good place. I know I need to do things I don't necessarily feel like doing to build the discipline. I just get frustrated. I do a lot over at my home group... and I'm there for hours after work every evening. I'm doing the work on my own time too...Bleh. Just had to get that out. Thanks! Happy Saturday. IWNDWYT

WTG on 20 days!!  When I got sober I thought about going to AA but the whole concept of a sponser was never going to be my cup.  I knew myself enough to know that it would just piss me off.  My personal belief is there is many paths to recovery now so more than ever.  AA use to be thought of as the "only" way but it's 2019 and the options for support are massive.  I use this reddit along with recovery podcasts FB sobriety groups to get my support.
Glad you could get that out!..20 days is Big!..If I can make 20 days then I know I just need practice discipline and willingness!..Looking forward to hearing more about your journey!
