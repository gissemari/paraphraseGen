Anyone else here who have been through a lot of huge stressors in quick succession (for example going through divorce death of a parent job loss/employment and an international move all within the course of a year) and after all that and being sober for a bit have all of the emotions and heartache slam you all at once?..I thankfully didn't use alcohol or anything else like psych meds or drugs during this time to cope (a miracle tbh I managed to stay totally sober for half of the past year during the most stressful parts and was able to stick to moderation the calmer second half until it slowly crept back up on me) and I thought I had a good handle on the emotional footwork and processing all of what happened but since everything calmed down enough for me not to be in a constant state of vigilance and the new life I worked my ass off to establish on my own is now relaxed but uneventful with some positive things lined up in the near future. But because I've been feeling intermittently frustrated and bored and was doing awesome with moderation for several months I stupidly let my guard down about how easily alcohol can overwhelm me and got cocky with my drinking until I found myself downing 3-5 glasses of wine a night habitually and even puked my guts out from downing almost a whole liter recently which lead me to the conclusion that I have to stay dry for at least a month before I can even think about drinking again if *ever* again...I've been sober for 4 days now and although haven't really had any physical symptoms cravings or withdrawals (again wasn't drinking super heavily at all except the one night) it feels like all of the emotions and negative thoughts that were sorta "paused" during the past half year all caught up with me at once like a tidal wave instead of the manageable stream they were when I was totally sober. It's shitty I don't even crave alcohol I just miss the distraction and the numbness it provided briefly but I know that if I keep doing that my mind won't be able to process any more backed up emotions and whenever I stop again I'd have an exponential amount of unchecked emotional baggage to deal with than I do now and I'm having a hard enough time handling what I have now. Great motivator to stay dry........but yeah today I scheduled my first appointment tomorrow at the psych doc to begin untangling this gigantic stinking shit ball of emotions so I know I'm heading in the right direction with handling this and what lead me to this point I'm just trying to see if anyone else here can relate to this at all so I don't feel like I'm an emotionally fragile worthless unemployed asshole...IWNDWYT and thanks for letting me vent and get that off my chest

I actually felt like I heard a lot of emotional intelligence and clarity in what you said. Dealing with the emotions is very tough. I haven't had to manage a lot of crap at once thankfully but I have still felt very fragile at times. Honestly my self esteem has vastly improved by not drinking. I hope you have a similar experience.
