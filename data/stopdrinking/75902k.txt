Hey..I haven't been active on this sub for awhile and to be fair its because I relapsed (which sucks). ..Anyways the past few weeks have been rough. I mean I am constantly exhausted and stressed from work. I just moved into a new flat (which is a good thing) and I have been slightly more anxious and depressed as of late. In addition Its been really difficult for me to work and I have been slowing down considerably...Anyways I drank a bit last night and today - I am literally shell shocked by anxiety. To the point where it feels like a constant (and underlying) physical panic attack. I tried to get some writing done but I failed. Hell I don't even think I can go outside today (I might order takeaway which is something I avoid).  My anxiety always gets worse after drinking but this is the worst its been. ..Despite this I know that I will work tomorrow and that will be ok. ..I am sorry for this rant. thank you for reading

Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. I'm feeling the same way with anxiety right now; I feel paralyzed. At least we can NOT drink! Stay strong!
my mental health is one of the main reasons i stopped drinking. the anxiety for days was never worth the hours of black out...understand that this will pass but try to be nicer to yourself today. you are human.
Same. Really bad anxiety. It's honestly the driving force for me to stop drinking... drinking just makes it 10x worse.
I would self medicate for my anxiety with alcohol until my doctor prescribed some anti-anxiety medications. I'm not saying it's good to swap one drug (alcohol) for another drug but I'm much better off at least temporarily by taking something for my anxiety instead of relying on booze.
