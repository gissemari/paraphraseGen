 Long time and no post. Just wanted to check in with some gratitude and reflections on 5 years (it's kind of a long one so thanks in advance to anyone who reads it all). ..It blows my mind because it feels like yesterday and a life time all at once. If you had told me 5 years ago where I would be now it would be unimaginable. Quitting drinking was the best decision I ever made it jump started this journey of self love care discovery and healing that I'm ever immensely grateful for. I wouldn't have been able or present for all of my accomplishments throughout the years (not to mention struggles and lows). ..This past year in particular has been the hardest of my life but throughout it all I have been grateful for my sobriety and the tools I've picked up along the way to cope healthily and presently that I wouldn't have if it wasn't for my sobriety. ..For all my progress there is of course still struggle. I'm battling depression quitting smoking and a career and life shift..But like every thing else I know I will be able to grow through these feelings and challenges with the help of my support system tools and most importantly sobriety. That's I think my biggest take away from 5 years; there will always be challenges and struggle in life I'll never get to a magical place where everything is perfect and without my sobriety I wouldn't have the slightest chance of moving through them. And for that I immensely grateful proud and humble to sit where I am today. ..Thanks for being there SD. To those of you just starting out or those who's time even baffles my own here is to not drinking today. ....
