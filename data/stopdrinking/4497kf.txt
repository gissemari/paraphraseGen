Funnily enough I met this friend on my first day of sobriety last year. She's been going through some serious crap in her life over the past six months and it really erupted a couple months ago. ..She relapsed after 9 years of sobriety. Her relapse experience is my worst nightmare and I don't know if I would survive a relapse. I should have died three years ago. ..It really drives home how important my sobriety is to me that I need to remember the importance of having a strong support network and that I need to keep doing the things that are working. ..I'm going to visit my friend in detox on Saturday. She plans on going to treatment. I'm going to bring her some treats and a calling card. I think she could use a good friend right now. ..Have a good night everyone.

The detox I interned at didn't allow treats. They did have crappy shampoo though. A couple ladies brought nice shampoo and conditioner for their friends and the girls always appreciated it...You're a good friend.
The longer you're in recovery the more you will see people go back out there. Some will come back. While I hate to see it happen to anyone each person that I know that relapses gives me more resolve.
