This is so those in shorter time sobriety can see some light at the end of the tunnel if they are struggling. How was your first few months or even your first year? What were your symptoms how did you over come them? How much better are you doing now?

For the first 45 days of my sobriety I had not accepted that I was different from non-alcoholics.  I wouldn't refer to myself as one.  I was generally unhappy and felt like I had quit drinking for my marriage and not for myself...After NYE '12 I had a rough time feeling left out and had a talk with my wife that really helped me put things in perspective.  I started to see how differently I saw alcohol vs. non-alcoholics do.  Shortly after that we went out to dinner and she had a glass of wine.  When we left the restaurant it was still half full.  I would never have done that...That time led to acceptance.  I accepted that I saw alcohol in a completely different way than she did and that in order to be happy and not fall victim to my alcoholism I had to remain sober.  That acceptance seemed to immediately lift all of the frustration and feelings of being left out of the fun...At that time I was able to start focusing on the bigger picture: I was fat and had no life outside of drinking.  So very slowly I started making changes.  I started riding my exercise bike for 15-30 minutes at a time 3 days a week.  I started watching what I ate.  I started focusing on getting better sleep.  I started working on dealing with problems and frustrations in a better way with my wife and in life in general...The next 9 months or so had ups and downs.  In general sobriety was great.  I was playing tennis going to Krav Maga classes and riding my bicycle.  I went on a cruise and literally had alcohol shoved in my face.  That was difficult but it wasn't the worst thing.  I was able to recognize the problem and discuss it with my wife and friends.  That made me feel better and the rest of the cruise was much better...At around 8 or 9 months I noticed that I could meet friends out at a bar and not be constantly aware that I wasn't drinking.  It really started to set in that it didn't matter at all what I was drinking and more importantly what everyone else was.  I mean I didn't care if the guy across from me at the bar put salt on his fries.  Why would I care if he had a lemonade or a beer?..Since then I've become much more comfortable in my sobriety.  In fact I'm fucking proud of it.  I have no problems talking about it with people and am willing to say that "I used to drink way to much and had to stop."  I'm able to go hang out with new people even at places where people drink and not feel strange...I don't have any urges.  I hardly ever think about drinking anymore.  I can have conversations with people like "Oh yeah back when I drank I loved that beer" and not feel any desire or regret...I went from being a very unhappy (borderline depressed) person without a life to someone that is happy just about all the time.  I get good sleep every night.  I eat well.  I am VERY active.  I have friends: both keeping old friends and making totally new friends.  In Krav Maga I've made many friends and have started interacting with them socially too (outside of KM classes)...**tl;dr: Life is fantastic.  It is better in every single way.  I wouldn't give up any part of my new life for all the alcohol in the world.**
Honestly?  Not too much has changed (except the kid and the new job field and living in a different part of the country but those aren't related to either drinking or quitting) in my day to day...For the first two or three months there was just a faint compulsion to go buy a six pack of cider or mix up some vodka but once I replaced that with other habits it went away...What has improved is pretty subtle - I'm better at gauging and proactively addressing my issues with depression.  My time management is better - I have more free time during which I can be productive.  I don't have to deal with hangovers (had a nasty virus last week that reminded me what those were like).  ..I'm really happy that I never had to try and juggle being a parent and a drinker - that's probably my biggest motivator right now to simply not drink in the future.  Ever.
The first 6-7 weeKs were a pretty rough ride for me (and those around me).  I was consumed with the thought of 'not drinKing' from waKing to when my head hit the pillow again.  Yeah that shit would maKe even Mr. Rogers be a miserable bitch to be around.   By the end of the second month that mantra of misery started it's pretty quicK fade to silence.  It was then that I finally had some breathing room.  I finally had the space to looK around and notice things other than my struggle with booze...I remember smiling to myself around that time and taKing stocK of the warmth in my chest from being able to feel pleasure at the sight of a sunrise.  From then on I made sure to be aware of when I was experiencing pleasure and happiness during the day.  Those feelings were my early guides out of my identification with a life of drinKing...My life has radically changed.  Not so much in my existential circumstances per se but in my attitude and view.  I am excited by the possibilities that my days hold (no I'm not James Bond I've come to develop a deep sense of pleasure at taKing notice and having the clarity to do so  of the details of living).  I'm finally getting shit done.  I'm becoming an actualized person that not only dreams of doing stuff (mostly what I did while drinKing) but of taKing action to see those dreams become reality.  I find that shit totally exciting!..My life has been revolutionized for the better.  Most of that life is my internal life.  I'll never forget the day I logged onto /r/stopdrinKing and I experienced a new emotion that left me filled with warm fuzzies.  I had never experienced it before.  I thought to myself "wow that's gratefulness."  I am so grateful for all the help and guidance I have found here.  It has helped me to be happy and excited about being alive.  That is a gift I can never fully repay.  ThanK you all...My life now is a wonderful revelation that Keeps on giving insight and opening doors.  Getting sober isn't easy.  It's tough shit to do but the benefits have made life worth living for me.  I don't ever want to go bacK to the place I was when I was drinKing where the possibilities in life narrowed to just ONE drinKing myself to death and inflicting a world of pain on those around me.
The feeling of guilt went away.
Great posts for me my ability to handle stress when I first quit was gone. I had no idea how to handle things I constantly felt disorganized over worked while having to raise a baby I would flip out at my GF even in public. Alcohol cravings anxiety and occasional panic attacks. I was stressed beyoned belief. I realized if Im not happy I need to make changes and I ended the relationship. Much better now to have my own time and not being poked constantly about something...Another thing too is I constantly felt some what on edge I would twitch or duck at loud unepecting sounds even if someone just called my name sometimes. I was worried it was permanent nerve damage or something as it was still happening 8 months later but it went away as well as most of my other forms of anxiety. As far as im concerned the brain can take up to two years to rewire it self
The first 30 days were crazy. I didn't really expect to stay sober (as it was not my 1st go-around) and my life was such a mess. Every dive bar I saw beckoned. Then I left my addict boyfriend moved in to my dad's basement got a job delivering pizzas and got a sponsor. I got an AA home group &amp; started working the steps. I felt like drinking at least once a day for a year but I did what sober people were doing &amp; I stayed sober. I felt stupid a lot &amp; I couldn't understand my emotions. I was lonely. So so uncomfortable . . . &amp; sweaty. ..I couldn't have even imagined what my life would be like today. Pretty comfortable in so many ways. I'm a happily married professional. I'm capable of handling situations which would have baffled me. I like myself I spend time being useful to the world around me. I do stuff like traveling &amp; outdoor activities. The best part I think is that I rarely think about the past--not my screwed up family not the terrible things I did. I live in the present and I am moving into a positive future. It isn't perfect but it is so much more than I ever could have wished for. ..I worked the 12 steps &amp; did what sober healthy people were doing. It took some time &amp; often I just had to hold on until it got different.
Every single thing about my life has changed. Location profession living situation weight habits hobbies mental state friends....I quit drinking/weed/drugs/cigarettes on the same day cold turkey. ...**Days 1-15**: Psychotic break with reality. Hallucinations and worse. Left (good) writing and drug dealing careers in NYC. Moved to DC....**Days 10-90**: Intensive outpatient rehab counseling. ...**Month 2:** Started taking yoga teacher training. Was so happy. But still having a tough time. ...**Month 3:** Family encouraged me to start blog. I start blog and am honest. thought I was suicidal. (I was not.) Spent month in mental hospital. Was put on a medication that almost killed me. Gained 50 lbs. in 3 weeks. Almost died.....Was also accused by family of relapse due to taking doctor prescribed benzo (before I knew it was a benzo). Was miserable and almost dead. ...**Month 4:** Get job as innercity preschool teacher. Not paid a living wage. Save aggressively to get away from family. (who I dearly love and like but I just can't even with these people...) I notice at this time my teeth are basically permaclenched....**Month 6:** Get 2nd full time job at a cheese shop. Am able to move into a sober group home in a low income neighborhood at end of month. ...**Month 7:** Can't do two full time jobs and rehab and therapy. Quit teaching. Thanksgiving is OK. ...**Month 8:** Cheese shop unexpectedly closes. We all get laid off on Christmas. It's hard. A housemate relapses. She gets 15 minutes to leave. ...**Month 9:** I already live cheaply but don't qualify for unemployment. I start freelancing and taking odd jobs. I get involved in the sober living organization and this subreddit. Have sex for first time sober (started drinking at 9 pot at 13). I lose 10 lbs. Recovery is great!!!!...**Month 10:** Being sober is shitty. Freelancing dries up. I turn 30 am lonely am unemployed and too broke to do anything at all and my anxiety shoots further through the roof. I'm sad angry agoraphobic wishing I was suicidal gaining weight missing weed etc. I apply to over 200 jobs. Gain weight back. ..I am the most miserable I've ever been in recent memory. Life is torturous. ...**Month 11 (March):** I'm working my ass off. Therapy rehab psychoanalysis service work. I'm so broke I have to borrow (read: he gave it to me but I'll pay him back somehow) money from a friend which is devastating. A friend brutally commits suicide. Another friend was in the crowd at SXSW. 4/9 people from my rehab small group relapse. I am glad to be sober but it's all I have. ..I have a great college degree and I get rejected from places like Starbucks and the grocery store. I have a panic attack during my one interview I scored at a temp agency. I have no freelance work. I've been interviewed for Forbes and been granted professional awards. Starbucks won't hire me. I'm embarrassed and devastated. ..I'm afraid I won't get any better. ..Then Monday night I have a PTSD attack. Very vivid. And I'm able to identify it write through it etc. I've never survived without weed/alcohol/drugs to cope. It was terrifying. ...I start to process it and it's like a light switch went off. I am validating myself as a trauma survivor (childhood and adult) and understanding the psychological impact it's had throughout my life. And I'm getting some better. I still miss my career though. ..**TL;DR: Strikes and gutters. Sobriety is so much more raw and real.**
im no longer crippled with paranoia and anxiety
