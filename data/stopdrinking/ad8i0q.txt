It happened so frequently. Around noon or 1:00 PM the day after as lunch time approached I'd really crave peanut butter and jelly. And when I make PB&amp;J's sandwiches I put a LOT of peanut butter on them. Love them. And polish two of them down with cold milk. ..Then 20 or 30 minutes later I'd feel like crap because my blood sugar was bouncing around like Michael J Fox's yoyo. ..But since I quite (106 days now) I don't think I've eaten one PB&amp;J. Weird the way alcohol's tentacles reach into other areas of our lives and the unexpected benefits of stopping.

Maybe your body was trying to get vitamin B. Alcohol is so depleting--remember being so thirsty that it felt like you didn't have room in your stomach for the amount of water you needed to drink to feel hydrated? I hated that.
Meanwhile I've rediscovered the joy of peanut butter sandwiches since stopping! Love those things...
