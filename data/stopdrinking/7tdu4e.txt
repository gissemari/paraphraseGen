Hey friends..I'm going through PAWS. I just learned that if you ever relapse you lose everything and even might hurt yourself worse. ..During my sobriety I've used kratom some times. 2 to 3 times a week sort of at first and since November maybe 5 times. The most recent being 3 or 4 weeks ago. ..I really didn't even like the shit and i have no intention of doing it again. ..Now i feel gross and guilty and regretful because i feel like using kratom has reset my paws clock to 0 or even worse further damaged me by physiologically acting like a string of relapses. ..Idk I'm just super bummed out about it and afraid i ruined my brain =[ paws is really tough..What do you guys think?

I think PAWS can be something that occurs regardless of any substance use or abuse.  There's no point in beating yourself up over your past choices.  Nothing can be changed.  I will say that I know a person that became addicted to kratom and experienced extreme depression coming off of it.  I'm going to avoid the stuff at all costs.
I have no idea.  There seems to be a new drug that I've never heard of every day.  Are we that miserable as a culture?
I don't know what paws is but kratom definitely helps me avoid drinking. I don't find it at all addictive

My brain chemistry was never *mint* to begin with (seemingly born with severe depression and anxiety that I lived with over a decade before booze etc.) so I personally don't have an issue with using certain substances to self-medicate when things are really really bad. I use kava about once a week for severe anxiety attacks. I've tried kratom in the past but it has been years now. ..I doubt you've done any serious *additional* harm to yourself. Where are you reading this stuff about relapsing once hurting your brain worse than years of abuse just curious. ..
