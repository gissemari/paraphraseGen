With people...General chat: Not squatting for a while then squatting a lot hurts...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: got a full-time waitressing job and things are going well. Also deadlifted 235 lbs...Struggle: I had three bad nightmares last night and this morning and I am all out of sorts. The really gory nasty nightmares. ..General chat: I miss in-season blueberries.
Triumph:  Nothing major really.  Managed over 6 months of sobriety which felt very daunting over 6 months ago when I first started. Got a new job a little over a month ago which was a huge promotion.  Marriage has been kicking ass...Struggle:  Went to my family's lakehouse with my family last week.  Lake house trips are all about sitting around and drinking beer all day and wine at night with burgers and steaks.  I've been out there several times since I stopped drinking but it's always a struggle not to fall into the trap of "One drink won't hurt you while you're here..."  Just gotta play that tape forward..
Triumph: Someone complemented my weight loss that I've worked so hard on...Struggle: I don't seem to know how to handle stress without alcohol.  I've been completely avoiding stressful things and procrastinating which tends to make things worse...General chat: the spooky movie marathon sure was fun.  Thanks to JBH for coming up with the idea.
&gt; Struggle: Relationships. With people...My motto: "People suck."  Persons are great.  But people suck...**Triumph**: Life is great.  My wife is out of town for the next week and a half.  I've settled into a good routine.  While I miss her it really is nice to be able to turn on lights and make noise as I'm getting ready in the morning. :)  Even with her gone I feel very confident and secure in my sobriety.  I'm aware that since my routine is different that I should reach out for help (therapist friends in-laws) if I have any issues but it's been smooth sailing...**Struggle**: I got nothin'...**General chat**: I went for a run on Sunday night.  Just 1.8 miles.  But my legs are still sore.  I don't think it helps that I've been to two Krav Maga classes and have played over 3 hours of tennis since.  I'm taking another KM class at lunch today and have 2-3 hours of tennis this evening.

Good morning everyone!!!..Triumph: I finished week 1 of C25K and I'm loving hating it :) I'm pushing through during the workout but at the end I feel happy and accomplished. Exercise is really helping me here :)..Struggle: I'm snacking constantly to undo the progress made by working out but I haven't really been having cravings for booze so I'm still eating away. I'm also having crazy vivid dreams that I used to be able to get rid of by passing out. Some are good most are not. ..General chat: I got a filling replaced today. My face is numb and this is fairly annoying. ..Have a good rest of the week guys!!
Triumph: this is my longest stint of sobriety. Feeling really strong and positive...Struggle: Sleeping. My body's used to "the pass out at 11/ sleep terribly until 3 am/ be up from 3-5/ have decent REM sleep from 5-8 and wake up feeling shitty" routine. I struggle to fall asleep without the alcohol still have the restless sleep til 3 or so still wake up at 3 (but fall right back to sleep) and still only seem to have the decent sleep from 3-8. Ah well...all in time I guess. ..General chat: I vowed to quit going onto the IRC chat at work. Now I just hang out on this sub. FAIL. 
Triumph: I was on the receiving end of compliments on various things and I'm succeeding at not putting them down immediately. Not drinking is no effort at all (were it not for this subreddit I think I could go for days without even thinking about it). Had a pretty large number of chats with new people without needing alcohol to get over the hump...Struggle: I'm not having much luck finding a place to stay in Buenos Aires using AirBnB this is beginning to stress me out a bit...General: In *exactly* a month I will be in Buenos Aires :-)

Triumph: About 3 days in.  I'm starting to sleep better and spent the last two nights watching movies with family and generally goofing around.  Relationships to family and pets are definitely better.  Love my job and am in the Manhattan office today...Struggle: No cravings but a nice dose of health anxiety going on.  Now that I'm not drinking I can feel every ache and pain have felt a bit short of breath when walking the dog and still having some heart palpitations probably from withdrawal.  From much I read here these are common complaints but I freak myself out worrying what damage I've done to my body and how long it will take to recover...General Chat: New Call of Duty game is out and I was sober enough to try it out last night.
Triumph: walked 5km this week and played Ingress while I did it!  Made exercise in the fresh air fun and satisfying!..Struggle: insomnia.  Hour of sleep then wake up.  Hour of sleep then wake up.  Repeat ALL NIGHT EVERY NIGHT.  Doctor and I are going to seriously discuss this tomorrow...General chat: Almost off the Ativan and feel well enough to ride my motorcycle again.  The weather's perfect and the fall colors are peaking!  Gorgeous!.

Wednesday took me forever to learn how to spell.....Triumph: I have a really good new sponsor he catches me in my "indifferent thinking" towards spirituality that would send me back out. It's where I resist that is exactly where I need to go. I started my day with a meditation on the 24 hours ahead of me and I'm pretty sure it's going to be a great day. Living on less but living the dream on my own out of the parents house more of a grown up than i've ever been. It's one of those things you don't notice the greatness of until you spend 2-3 hours back with your mother and her old ways of thinking negatively slef-pity and gossip. That was a very toxic situation that i've become free of because I live on less I don't drink and hold my life together in sobriety...Struggle: I don't want to complain about my life anymore. It's pretty good. The only things that haven't happened for me are things I have resisted working for...general Chat: Lady GaGa is going to perform in space. Where did this chick ever get so connected? I sometimes wonder about if some celebrities have had spiritual experiences and what kind of wacky experience hers might be but then I remember that my spirituality is about me my heart my day my path. It's intimate and it's all right I should feel satisfied enough with my life and spirituality not to question the nature of others...The world is a wacky place especially on wednesday!
Triumph: I had a very unpleasant encounter with a parent at an after school activity.  She very aggressively accused me of having an "attitude" and scolded me in front of the kids and other parents.  I'm calling this a triumph because I used my non-violent communication skills and although the conversation didn't go well I didn't say anything I regret and I was able to be firm but respectful...Struggle: the confrontation with the other parent was very uncomfortable and I was upset about it for a couple of days.  I was embarrased to have my son and daughter see me get yelled at by this person.  ..General chat:  Not loving the shorter days or the allergies.  But grateful for my health my family and this beautiful planet.
Triumph: well I ended my however many day long drinking session and am back to taking sobriety seriously.- I also signed up for the LA marathon and my 18 week training program coincidentally starts this week..Struggles: it's my first 24 hours back- all I can think about is the fear of failing again and how much change not drinking brings (even tho it's always been positive change).General: I found a new flavor of Gatorade I love: lime - cucumber 
Triumph: Making strides in accepting myself for who I am. Developing confidence...Struggles: Acting out on Pride listening to myself...General Chat: Boopy Doopy. Woopy Snoopy. Loopy McFoopy.
Triumph: Today is day 30 sober! I made it a whole month you guys!! :D I really struggled the other day. Just wanted to buy one beer and sit down with some food. But I didn't. And that's fucking awesome...Struggle: snowwwwwwwwwwwww ugh. Also made me want to spike my hot chocolate. I'm getting these sorts of ideas popping in my brain now a lot I can't help it but I am working through it. ..General Chat: I bought myself a fat case of red bull as a "reward" for my sober month. I do love me some red bull! ..Hope everyone has a lovely week! :)
Triumph: Somebody observed that pretty much everything is fucked up for me except for **running** and **sobriety**. ..Struggle: That person is correct...Chat: Not really. A lot of stuff is challenging but I am healthy. My kids are healthy. I eat sleep have friends. For these and other gifts I am grateful. 
Triumph: A big work project of mine got skewered in front of an audience today but the triumph is I mostly kept my cool worked late to make changes and went for a run after to feel better. As long as I don't drink tonight I can show up to work tomorrow all strong and ready for whatever...Struggle: Seasonal depression is creeping up. Yesterday I had a pained thought of "oh poor me how will I ever get through winter without mah whiskey??" One cold dark day at a time I guess. I may need to develop some new coping tools........
Triumph: knee deep in some awesome nextgen technology that will revolutionize security on the internet...Struggle: stuck in a strange cold city till friday and boredom is driving me nuts when im not working...General chat: cant wait to bet back to my new hobby of stone carving.  Got a new 51 pound alabaster rock at home!
Did my third 12 hour day in a row at work. I've never worked so hard in my life. Glad I'm holding on to my remaining brain cells. 
Triumph: took less librium and made it thru work without getting upset...Struggle: money. Money money money...General chat: I've lost 40 pounds on my journey of sobriety and I can see my regular customers notice but don't say anything. Today 3 of them did. Felt great. I see ny foot doctor tomorrow and I'm excited to hopefully add walking/cardio. Only 30 lbs to my goal. My husband seemed like he really wanted to talk to me about his group therapy tonight (his sharing and progress) but when I got home he didn't want to talk. Very odd.
