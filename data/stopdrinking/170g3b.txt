I have a hard time with the "preachy" hardcore meeting goers. It's a positive thing but then people unintentionally make it negative with their "Holier-than-thou" attitude. One that I went to had two guys ready to fist fight over the fact that NA beer has alcohol in it and you aren't really sober if you drink it. Every meeting is different of course but there's always that/those guy(s). They seem so sad at times also. I wish I could find an successful crowd that is positive and upbeat. Any techniques for finding such a thing?

Ask someone!  Chances are they can suggest meetings to try and ones to avoid.
I must be extremely lucky. I've never encountered a preachy or holier than thou attitude at any AA I attended.  .I only remember the "sad" people. Life longers whose entire lives were AA. And I mean in the sense that they had absolutely nothing else. Appearing like they had no family or things to do outside of the meetings.  .To me it was just as sad to see them replace addiction with AA without any other things to give them "life".  .Edit: what I guess I'm trying to say caligronk is choose life; oh and there are AA's where you won't be preached at.
pull up all the meetings in your area and do 90 meetings in 90 days hitting as many different meetings as you can.  Don't dismiss bad ones too quickly as often times others are just as annoyed as you and the meeting might actually be okay.  I must admit though it took a lot of meetings for me to find ones that I can tolerate.  I would have never accomplished that if I hadn't committed to the 90 in 90.
