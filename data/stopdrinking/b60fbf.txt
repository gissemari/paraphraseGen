I've struggled with alcohol addiction for the last decade since college (2010). I love reading stories about folks who have been sober for years. How did you do it? I'm not religious and AA is not for me.

Two things helped me most:..1.  Getting help.  I couldn't do it alone.  When I found success is when I started coming to Stop Drinking each day.  Face to face groups like AA or SMART help many.  A support group offered me a vision of a sober life...2. Taking it one day at a time.  Especially in the beginning it was hard to imagine life without alcohol.  But I focused on one day.  It was tough at first then it got easier.  Then one day I felt free.    Most days are easy now.  But on a tough day I just don't drink today...Best wishes to you! Life got better for me sober.

Rehab helped me realise my problem and how dangerous and serious it was. It also helped me to talk to other alcoholics so I could realise my own problem. And this made me feel that Im not alone in this alcoholism for me isolates me and drives me further down the dark road. ..Once Ive realised my problem and the depths of it and where it most likely will lead I made the choice of trying to go sober for a year. Do the 12 steps (are good to do even if not religious) and go to AA. If Im not feeling better after a year alcohol will still be there. But so far I prefer being sober. I feel way better than being drunk and seeing my alcoholisms bullshit lies with sober eyes is amazing still learning new things daily. ..If youre a rebellous person it might help to try to use this against the alcohol - which was one way for me to get motivated. ..I will not drink with you today.
