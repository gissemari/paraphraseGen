It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**How Mary Got Her Groove Back**..Alcohol has been bad news in my life since day one. When I was just a child my father got drunk got behind the wheel crashed his car and died. (Luckily he didn't hit anyone else and he didn't have me or my brother in the car with him.) When I was 28 I was hit and badly injured by a drunk driver. (I was on my motorcycle. He was in a large Cadillac convertible and in the middle of an alcoholic blackout.) A few months later my boyfriend a Marine Corps gunnery sergeant whom I adored died of alcohol poisoning. (After this completely devastated I went to a doctor for help. He listened to my tale of tragedy and then told me sarcastically  You should be a poster child for drinking. )..You would think that all this heartbreak would have made me too afraid of the dangers of alcohol to drink it myself but it didn't. Booze became my primary  coping  mechanism and my drinking got progressively worse. They say that rock bottom is when you choose to put down the shovel and stop digging but I refused to put down the shovel. Apparently I was trying to dig my way to the Earth's inner core...When I was in my late thirties after I discovered that my then-husband was cheating on me with other men my already heavy drinking shifted into high gear and became an all-day everyday affair. I lost a high-paying corporate job for drinking at work and I lost my GBFF (gay best friend forever) for bad behavior while drunk. (He himself was a heavy drinker who had been my primary drinking buddy so the fact that he of all people thought my drinking was excessive finally made me realize that I had a serious problem on my hands but by that point I simply could not stop.) Going out in public was a crapshoot (so to speak) because by that time I was so physically sick from all the alcohol that I no longer had complete control of my stomach or bowels. ..Did recognizing that my life had become a complete dumpster fire make me quit drinking? [Spoiler alert: No it did not.] It took having the whole flaming disaster collapse onto a stinking pile of dog shit to finally make me stop. This happened on May 14 2015 when a doctor who did a sonogram of my swollen abdomen told me that because of my lifetime of heavy drinking my liver was now filled with so many holes that it looked like Swiss cheese and that I would probably die within the next few months. I have not had a sip of alcohol since that day...About a year after my terrifying  Swiss cheese moment  genuinely surprised to still be alive I decided to take a class in collage in the city where I live during the winter. I had always wanted to try doing art but I'd been afraid that I'd be no good. However there is something about being forced to kiss Death on the mouth that makes social fears like the shame of making bad art seem not so scary after all. I took the class loved it and decided to keep doing painted paper collage on my own. I had no delusions of artistic brilliance or success but I had a new motto: What the Hell I Might as Well...I started doing landscape collages of the Adirondack Mountains where I live during the summer. It turned out that making painted paper collages dovetailed perfectly with my new sober life it kept me busy so that I never got bored in sobriety it gave me a new identity so that I was no longer just the Girl with the Drinking Problem and after so many humiliating failures it gave me something that I could actually be proud of. After mustering up the courage to show my work to others I was astonished to learn that people wanted to buy my collages attend my exhibitions and even commission me to make more art...In addition not only did I now have my collage-making to keep me going but I also had r/stopdrinking. A zero-to-the-bone fear of death **got** me sober but this sub has **kept** me sober. I didn't discover r/stopdrinking until a few months after I quit but I have been on the sub every day since. ..When I was lying in that hospital bed having been told that I was about to die and feeling utterly alone I had no idea that a friendly group of more than one hundred and fifty thousand people was waiting for me just around the corner people who would understand me and be willing to share their own stories. I deeply appreciate the wonderful friends I have made here as well as my fellow mods who have become like brothers and sisters to me and everyone else including newbies and lurkers who make up this sub. ..Being a part of this community has given me a sense of belonging that I have never had before in my life and now when I go out into the big bad booze-soaked world I carry r/stopdrinking with me as a secret talisman that no one can see but that gives me the courage and strength to keep walking down this path that we are all on together. Thank you for being my companions on this sober journey. I feel extremely lucky to have been given a second chance at life.

What an encouraging story. Your posts have helped me personally since I joined this sub as have the countless tales of others who continue to fight the good fight.  Congratulations on your four years! IWNDWYT!

Wow what an incredible story. You're awesome. Congrats! IWNDWYT
Nice post.    IWNDWYT
I still consider myself a newbie here so I hadn't ever heard your story yet. I'm glad I got to hear it now. You have been so helpful to me and so many others here. So grateful you made it through. Much love! &lt;3
Mary thank you for sharing your story. I too am considering picking up a creative pursuit but resistant because a) I may be too old and b) I may suck at it. I'm really inspired to see how a  what the hell  pursuit became something bigger for you. Sober life is so full of possibilities.
Congratulations Mary! What a great story - you are such an asset to this community!
Aaaw Mary thanks for sharing that! Your name is one of the ones I consistently recognize on this sub for your continuing awesome posts love compassion and goodness you put out into the world...Struggle - I am trying to date a new person and realize I am really bad at asking people out sober. Also eating well something I used to have on lock is looking nearly as bad as my drinking did. My social life has become larger than my time which is a great thing to be struggling with but I want to learn some new time management strategies...Triumph - I have exercise on lock in my life and have 4 days of planned exercise every week plus addl days at the gym or going outside. This is without question the most active I have been in my entire life and I am so grateful to have opportunities to exercise so much. I have not felt lonely or shameful once the past.... 4 months? 6 months? Sometimes I forget how often I used to feel that.
Hi! Thank you for sharing. Like you I should have been a poster child for not drinking but I've turned to alcohol too. I get that. I am so glad you are still here with us sharing your story being here. You have overcome a lot. Sharing stories is so important! I am also so grateful to have a new change in life. And SD is my talisman to haha. Always in reach and giving me courage. Thank you again for your story! What up Wednesday? I'm still at the coast. Enjoying the ocean. Life could be worse :) IWNDWYT
Your writing and your story are inspirational. ..You say you're studying art? I reckon there's a book in you. ..IWNDWYT
Congratulations on 4 years Mary!      What a change you've made from the poster child of drinking and on death's doorstep to being a mod here and giving hope and inspiration to others every day. Thank you for sharing your story and thank you for being here!
So much love to you /u/sfgirlmary for the inspiration and example and support that you give all of us here every single day and especially on the tough-nut Hump Day when the week can feel especially long and challenging. You are always a reminder to celebrate and affirm what's going *right* as well as acknowledging honestly what's still a struggle. It aint all sunshine and rainbows and farting unicorns... but there ARE some sunshine and rainbows to be found even when there's also big steaming piles of metaphorical poop to navigate. Bless you for always reminding me of that :)

Congratulations on 4 years Mary! That is an encouraging and inspiring story. ..**Struggle** Water heater overflow tank blew a gasket yesterday and leaked. BF tried to fix and couldn't and got very very mad about it but at least didn't direct any of it at me (his meds are working well these days). Plumber will come today. Had to go without water since last night. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but certainly irritating. ..**Triumph** Getting through another really difficult week at work. I am drinking way too much caffeine which I'm supposed to limit because of blood pressure issues but at least I'm not turning to booze to unwind. Also relationship with BF has never been better. That's a great triumph. We've both really worked on our BS this past year. ..**General** Less than a month until my vacation.
Checking in from the mountains of western North Carolina. Looking forward to tending the garden a little once it warms up this morning looking even more forward to not drinking with you today...If one were to piece it together there's a recovery metaphor about picking up the pieces in there with your journey with collages from first steps in a class to exhibitions OP.
Congrats u/sfgirlmary you are a lovely light here at SD.  We are lucky to have you here:) Thank you for sharing.  Your kind words have helped so many.  Hugs
I've been feeling a little stagnant lately thinking about doing things I need to do but not doing them. This morning however I am feeling motivated to get started on at least one thing for my business so I'm going to run with it and hopefully I find the energy to keep at it. Most of my struggles lately are with my thoughts and feelings and how I let them effect my actions. Practicing kindness and patience and not being so easily offended takes work and time and I've got to be ok with progress and some small failures...Overall though life is good! My dog is doing way better lately she loves sober Charles and physically I am feeling hundreds of times better than I did 5 months ago. Happy Wednesday!..Also what a story Mary thank you for being part of the miracle of r/stopdrinking and recovery in general!
Congratulations on 4 years! The world is a better place with you in it. I remember your early days on SD. You are awesome. Thanks for your service to the SD family.
Thank you u/sfgirlmary for sharing your story and congratulations on the milestone! It's inspiring to read about how others find untapped creativity in art and other kinds of endeavors. Drinking dampened my creative spirit for so long and just this spring I feel it resurfacing in the absence of alcohol. I'd love to see some of your work if you have pictures posted online anywhere!..Struggle for this week: work is still a major source of struggle and stress. Big changes and an unhealthy organizational power structure from the top down are triggering bad flashbacks and memories from family struggles when I was a kid/teenager. I'm trying to process everything with my therapist but it's a slow go. I'm so emotionally wiped out at the end of the day that it's hard to muster up the energy needed to apply to other jobs...Triumph: I'm so so happy alcohol isn't a factor right now. It's absence is making all my other struggles easier to tackle. No hangovers less worries about money more time just being present and engage with emotions instead of stuffing them down with beer...General: I'm taking the week off after Memorial Day and am SO STOKED to have literally nothing planned on those days! I'm just going to hang out in the garden cook some good meals take walks around my part of the city and read. Just thinking about it makes me happy!
Congratulations u/sfgirlmary!  You are one of the familiar "faces" to me here that gives me great comfort.  I am so incredibly happy for you.
What an amazing post  Mary. Thank you so very much.  
Well what do I say after reading a story like that...Thank you. Thank you. Thank you...I sometimes read of ones like this who went near if not to the end of the line. I think I was not that bad fortunately. ..But then I stop and think yes I wad that bad. I was in constant blackouts intox/ hungover or planing that next drink for 17 years. I am sure doctors would have held fears for my life had they known how much I drank. ..I lost my job and my drivers licence. I had a criminal record and a ton of debt from a huge gambling addiction. One may think I would stop...No I had 8 solid years of drinking left. I could not hold down jobs as I needed to stay topped up almost around the clock. I had long ago started comming to on the streets. I had lost control of all bodily functions...A very nice lady decided to marry me after I was sober a few months. At a work Christmas party I was to have my last drink 3 months into the marriage.  I missed 2 days work. I stumbled in home the next day feeling very sorry for myself. My dear wife's only words " What a lovely Christmas pressant. " ..I was cut to the core. I returned to AA and made up my mind I could take no more. I had a sudden spiritual awakening and was shown if I did not take the first drink I could not get drunk.  ..I have not needed a drink from that day foward. I have recently returned to AA more determined than ever after a low point in life 1 day at a time to remain sober.  ..I am just over 29 years sober and can honestly say I have no regrets. I have found in sobriety all I sought in the bottle and more  far more. Today I look for what I can give not what I can get. I am happy and contented. I know an inner peace that is amazing. I accept life and my situation. ..I hold out this same hope to all. No life is not all roses and sunshine. But I know no matter how bad it all may seem a drink sure won't help. ..Your Friend John      
Wow. /r/sfgirlmary I have known you for years but I never knew your story. You are so inspiring and I'm thrilled to hear about your success. Thank you for inspiring us. We are so glad you are here with us encouraging us and being a vital part of this community. ..Happy 4 year soberversary. I will not drink with you today. &lt;3
"Kiss Death on the Mouth" I'm going to use that one. My wife and I were just talking about how the scars from the ice storm (10?) years ago in the Adirondacks are still sort of visible. The Mts. healed but they are different.  Something to consider. Congrats on the time The park is a beautiful place to spend the summer. I love that we call them "Camps"
Thank you so so much for sharing this story Mary. I needed to hear this today. Congratulations on four years. &lt;3 &lt;3 ..**Struggle:** I've been dodging/bunking social obligations therapy and AA. That's five things this week. I at least have realized where it's coming from this need to feel "safe and free" that I used to find in alcohol. Also someone called me in/criticized my behaviour/let me know I had hurt them yesterday...Watching *Easy* is making me uncomfortable especially the brewery brothers storyline. The excitement and glamorising and appreciation of alcohol and all the glasses of beer is triggering me and making me feel closer to alcohol. I'm not going to put myself in danger like that again and I'm getting out of that sea...**Triumph**: I was a little panicky at having to face consequences for my bad behaviour but I didn't spiral or make the fight worse. I apologized as generously as I could while not bending over backwards/being a doormat. I did have a moment of wanting to be mean as I've been "dropped" by so many friends over the last year but I didn't. I kept it specific didn't make any excuses and they said they had closure now and thanked me. ..Also I'm slowly beginning to understand that my inability to be honest *about* myself (what I can/can't do what my energies allow etc) has harmed people. A related insight I had that I want to practice is that I want to hold myself to a higher standard of behaviour work etc. not because I'm being forced to but because I *want* to because I respect myself. I'd seen other people do that and it was always a mystery to me but now I'm feeling the grasping towards it. Again possible only due to sobriety...**General**: Thunderstorms and rain here.
Congratulations! Thank you for sharing your amazing story. For me you are always an inspiration and an example to follow.
Wow what a story. Thanks for sharing! Congrats on 4 years and thanks for brings such an important part of this community. I just have one question:    .    .**Where are some pics of your collages?!**    .    .iwndwyt
Congrats on an amazing **4** years Mary!..You certainly DID get your groove back and then some!..You're an amazing bff role model Mod artist daughter sister etc.. ..From what you've been through - growing up around alcoholism and developing such heartbreaking health issues due to the poison - you're such a beautiful inspiration to me and to everyone here :). ..I admire your strength conviction kindness and dedication. You make this sub a safe healthy place for all of us to enjoy and share in...I love ya! &lt;3 xoxoxo
Wow. What an amazing story. Thank you so much for sharing with us. I'm so glad to hear that you're doing so well now!..Struggle: It was brought to my attention on Monday that my father is still in very frequent contact with my abusive ex boyfriend. Meanwhile he hasn't initiated contact with me since August. Not even on my birthday.  My dad and I were never close and I've always suspected that didn't believe me when I told him my ex and I had split because he was abusive but finding out it was true seeing post after post on Facebook of them joking around seeing my dad commenting on pictures of my ex and his new girlfriend talking about how happy they look...it still knocked all the breath out of me.  The old me would have gotten very drunk and buried all the hurt. The current me is just trying to stay busy practicing self-love and trying to figure out exactly how to handle this situation. .Triumph: I had a dinner meeting to attend last night. Everyone there had a drink or two but I'm very pleased to report that I wasn't even tempted!  The old me would have had three or four glasses of wine gotten too intoxicated to actually pay attention to the meeting spent the entire time staring at the power point hoping I didn't look as drunk as I felt and woke up the next day feeling like a failure unclear on what was discussed/decided. The new me sipped on water took notes and even made a few suggestions which were very well received!  Instead of waking up feeling like a loser I woke up feeling proud accomplished and super motivated!
That is an incredible story.  Glad the swiss cheese liver didn't getcha.  IWNDWYT
**S:**  My child is being difficult this morning.  She is refusing to go to school.  I'm not willing to fight with her on this.  She doesn't want to go fine.  She's not watching TV she's not playing with her friends when they get out of school she's also going to be picking up after her dog.  Including her shit and stolen items that she's brought out into the yard and destroyed...**T:**  I'm trying not to let this impact my internal condition.  Not how I'd like to start my day but I'm going to try and not let it ruin the rest of it...**G:**  Thank you Mary.  You were if not the first one of the first to reply to my first post and directing me towards getting a badge.  If not for that who knows maybe not even being here today.
Thanks for sharing your story. Congratulations on 4 years!
Thank you so much for sharing your story as it gives me inspiration and motivation to continue down this path and make changes every day.  You've helped me multiple times in this community (even with the badge resets which mean a lot) and congrats on 4 years!
**Triumph:** I've been working on my stress resilience for several months. I think I'm making progress and seeing the practice pay off. "Think" because several sources of work stress have decreased so my baseline stress has changes even as I'm learning to handle it better. ..**Struggle:** Stigma and labels. I've been bumping into issues around labels like "gifted" "troubled" "mental health"... You tell someone you're exercising to get healthier and they applaud you.  You tell someone you're seeing a therapist and taking meds to get healthier and they look at you sideways. At least *that's what my brain tells me*. I've got some deeply rooted core beliefs that have surfaced recently...**Mary:** Congratulations on FOUR YEARS! I've valued your contributions and friendship and know I know for how long :)
Struggle: Dealing with laziness and using marijuana..Triumph: Got rid of all of my marijuana related items yesterday. Going to quit that also. And found out that I am a finalist for the position I interviewed for last week. I think I have a good shot at actually landing this position. Fingers crossed.
Your story is so inspiring and was a pleasure to read. Thank you so much for sharing!    .  .S - Work but in such a good way its almost a triumph? I'm struggling with some bureaucratic nonsense which has been ongoing since last fall and I was sincerely hoping to have resolved by now. But the fact that I'm even filling out these forms and coordinating communications is a victory. Still...it takes serious efforts on my part to see it that way and has been increasing my stress lately.  .  .T - I'm taking more time to address my own well being emotionally and relationally. I'm feeling so much more secure and confident than I did 1.5 years ago...not having alcohol/resulting anxiety in the mix really speeds up the process. Who knew?    .  .GM - I legit thought I was developing IBS and was so upset. Literally in the last week and a half my symptoms are already subsiding with no other changes than being sober. TMI but I'm amazed that moderate yet regular drinking made such an impact. I am coming to realize that I am truly a sensitive person even physically...and that is okay.
Woman I just love you!  Thank you for sharing your story and your success in such an engaging way.  We are blessed to get to know you and receive your support as a mod and as a friendly companion on this road.  Not to mention your way with words and sense of humor!  ..**Struggle:** Realizing I have to delve back into my childhood wounds if I want to stop my current self-protection patterns that are now holding me back.  I thought I had worked it all out but I just used my brain and not my feelings to handle the trauma.  Turns out I still need to address the issues by grieving and allowing myself to own being a victim as a child so I can process through things and move on.  Blergh.  I keep telling my therapist "so what do I need to *do*??" to which she patiently answers "we're doing it".  ..**Triumph:** I'm taking the time to address these deeply rooted issues instead of paving over them and reading yet another self-help book...**General:**  GF's brother sister and sister's 2 kids are descending on our place in a week.  Yikes.  And then I leave the day that they do for a trip to visit a friend and my mom.  It's gonna be a full couple of weeks but I'm rather glad of the change in pace.
Thanks for sharing and for the one thousand times you have reset my day count!..I will not drink with you today.
I had a triumph last night that would have been a huge struggle last year but was definitely  do-able  this year...I went to a private party last night at a restaurant. Our party was seated in the WINE CELLAR (not really a cellar more of a room). The lady next to me was drinking my old favorite Chardonnay. I didn't struggle at all thinking about wanting a drink. It was easy for me to stick to water and other non-alcoholic choices. A year ago at this time I would have felt overwhelmed. This time I could laugh at the irony of an alcoholic being seated in  the wine room ...It does get easier my friends!
I get what you are saying. Now that I have a year in I feel like I can start peeking around the curtain of the production of "Girl who tried to drink herself to death" which has been my life.   I now have to figure out who I am.
Thank you. This was very timely. I'm about to finish my shift (in a pub) and was tempted but I really don't want to. One week sober. I've got my phone on me and thought I'll check this sub for some inspiration. It worked.

Struggle: I wish sobriety was a magical cure for dysfunctional relationships. Unfortunately it isn't. I'm currently struggling to save the relationship with my mom but instead of making things better I seem to be actively damaging it further. At this point in time I don't have the willingness to approach the situation like an adult. I'm trying - I really am - but it's difficult. I haven't heard from her since Sunday and it's crushing me. I know I could call or text her but I don't even know what to say right now. I don't want to screw it up even more. ..Triumph: I have been sober for 9 months today! In the past 9 months I have seen my life change drastically. When I first went to AA my life was starting to crumble. I was experiencing crazy shakes and was probably never fully sober even at work then I started working the program and getting connected with new (real!) friends and my life just turned around. I got a sponsor who is now an honorary member of my family because she continues to teach me so much and is one of my biggest supporters. Today I have a professional degree and my license will not be at risk because I am sober. That's pretty dang triumphant if you ask me. ..General: I was invited to a friend's house today to hang out and paint. We watched a YouTube video and had our own little wine and palette (minus the wine - she's in recovery too!). It was a blast and we got to know each other more deeply. I love nurturing these new friendships that I've found in sobriety. Sometimes being able to talk to someone who understands me and where I'm coming from is all that keeps me from picking up a drink. ..I will not drink with you today!
Congratulations! Your story gives hope to the rest of us!
Counting to the 2 year mark..in the meantime. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind.
Struggle- I've been working with a therapist for a year and we finally figured out why I'm having such a hard time leaving an unhappy relationship. I relate to him in the same way I relate to alcohol. Like when I was drinking and using I was 100% aware that it was a problem and it was hurting me but I kept on drinking anyway. It was my masochistic tendencies. Similarly I am in a relationship with someone who hurts me I know he hurts me I know he'll keep hurting me and I stay with him. It sucks but at least knowing that might help me down the line make better decisions...Truimph: along with alcoholism and addiction Ive struggled with eating disorders and body dysmorphia for years and yesterday for the first time ever I saw my body the way other people see it. I was partially disgusted. I'm soooo skinny. Like smegal skinny. Nothing but bones but I consider it a truimph because I didn't see the little fat kid I was growing up. I saw my body for what it actually is and that was absolutely amazing.
Wonderful to hear your story Mary. I'm a bit of a lurker a lot of the time but I do try to post as well. Definitely recognise your name thank you for all the work you do here. It would be great to see your art do you ever share links to view it?..Struggles - because life has got so much better I think 'maybe I wasn't that bad' the riskiest thought of them all. I know to talk to people get on here look at my journal from the first few days weeks and months of sobriety and just to play it out in my mind. ..Triumph - a couple of months back I realised I needed to pivot my professional life to something in the world of mental health. The last few weeks I've been involved in some initiatives at work including telling my own mental health story to the whole company as part of mental health awareness month and I've started an online course in mental health care...General - sometime it feels like there's not enough hours in the day. This is a good thing. When did I have time to drink or how much bloody time did I waste drinking? Ah well got here in the end. ..IWNDWYT!!
CONGRATS ON 4 YEARS MARY!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy to see how you've grown in sobriety and have shown so many others that it's possible. You're an amazing and talented artist and I cherish the painting you made for me :) ..I consider myself lucky to be able to call you my friend and co-mod in this amazing journey we're all on. Thank you for being such a positive light for so many of us.  Wishing you all the best!!!!!
HERE!
Congratulations on 4 years Mary!
What!? I missed your 4 year soberversary! Darn it...I'm so eternally grateful to have you as part of SD. You've been a rock in this stormy sea. A diamond.
