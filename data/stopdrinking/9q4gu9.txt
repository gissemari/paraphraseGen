I have tried for years to "moderate" my drinking and have failed every time. This time around I have quit alcohol altogether and find it far easier as I don't have to constantly wrestle with the issues of when to start drinking and how much--I am so grateful for that freedom. ..But I am eating a lot more especially sugar and I don't like it (and not just because I have put on a couple pounds in a month). Before I became a daily drinker in my early 30s I struggled with bulimia and anorexia. I certainly don't feel at risk of either of those disorders at this stage in my life (I am 54) but I am concerned about my eating and feel like I'm turning to food to tamp down my anxiety. ..Has anyone else gone through this and found a healthier way to cope?

I'm staying tuned here - totally overdid the carbs yesterday and I know food is what I turn to when I don't have booze but I don't want to do that.
I was the same for a while and it has def evened out after 8 weeks. Any initial gains I saw on the scale I ended up losing inches from belly bloat alone. Prob 3-4 just from not drinking. I also have struggled with eds but allowing myself the safety to just eat what I need to and keep from picking up the bottle. Cheers friend 
Eat the sugar for now. It helps. It will calm down. I am a Haribo whore when I stop drinking.
