And have thrown it away down the bottle. I have a good job a bright future a supportive family great friends and boyfriend and I have my HEALTH. Mental health issues and self contempt have clouded this. I will never take this granted again. I may have relapsed but will NOT let this stop me. The amount of times I have gotten myself into dangerous situations by being blacked out.. ..I have been down this road before. By picking up the bottle again I knew how it was gonna end. Relapse has only shown me my strength and my determination to beat this for good. I feel like part of it may be accepting you may slip up. It doesn't make me weaker. ..Keep strong guys I am so grateful for you all. ..IWNDWYT!!!!!!!!

I am grateful for you as well!.IWNDWYT!!
That is a fine list of positives in your life.  Not everyone has it that good.  If drinking and reading about others' drinking on this sub has taught me anything its that continuing to drink more will take each of those things away until alcohol is the only one left in life.  Learn from the slip-up and become stronger!  I will not drink with you today.
