If you would have told me 3 years ago i could do any of these things without alcohol and drugs.. I would have called you insane. Can't say how nice it felt at the first picnic ( did not know of our sobriety) and was repeatedly offered to have a beer.. To easily explain I don't drink ( anymore) then I had a good laugh at the offer of moving the beer away from me ( like that would make a difference if i wanted to drink). There's been great challenges in my sobriety.. But nothing would have gotten better by picking up. Love this sub. Love my new sober life. To all those struggling... Don't leave before the miracle happens!! IWNDWYT
