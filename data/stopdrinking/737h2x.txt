Four nights in a row of decent sleep!!! I'm talking falling asleep between 10 and 11 and waking up between 4 and 5 with no more than 1 wakeup in the middle. I'LL TAKE IT ..Before this about every other night I was waking up every 1-2 hours with a very active brain. I have tried a number of things including listening to boring audiobooks podcasts ("Sleep With Me") relaxing music etc. ..What finally seemed to help: white noise. Found a youtube video that's just a sound. It seems to give my brain just enough to focus on to stop the thoughts without stimulating additional thoughts about the content (since there is no content). ..Just wanted to share this as a possible thing to try for others struggling with sleep. Rock on sobernauts and happy weekend

How wonderful! Thanks for this ray of hope. Looking forward to peaceful sleep someday and I will not drink with you today! 
Can you share the YouTube channel please? I can't stay asleep to save my life. 
An uninterrupted sleep has been such a benefit for me! I was also waking up every hour. The anxiety was unbearable as was my racing brain (I referred to it as the 'thinks'.)..I've found that a fan has been very helpful (my white noise). It's not blowing on me just in the corner providing just enough steady noise to help me fall and stay  asleep.
