Been a lurker here for a long time and found inspiration along the way - time to put it to good use. Thanks everyone!..After a horrendous relapse post ~30 days sober I've finally surrendered to fully committing myself to my sobriety. Didn't work the steps read the book or go full on at all with my recovery then nor the 1.5 years I had long ago but it's become a "now or never" situation. Now I say Never Again! IWNDWYT!.

Woot congratulations on 5 days! I've also relapsed after not fully committing to doing the work necessary to really get and stay sober. It's such a different experience this time around. It's uncomfortable at times but I'm really appreciating being sober and what this change offers me. I look forward to hearing about your progress! IWNDWYT
