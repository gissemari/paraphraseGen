Today is my half year mark! It's had it's ups and downs. I feel a lot better mentally physically and financially. I do still struggle with anxiety but it's completely managable. Cravings are minimal. I do occasionally have to tell my brain to knock it off. The good definitely outweighs any bad. This time 6 months ago I was laid up all night/morning thinking I was going to die...I didn't...If you're wondering if it gets easier it does. If you're wondering if you'll feel better you will. If you're scared about either just keep swimming. Tommorrow is a new day! Only dead fish   go with the flow
