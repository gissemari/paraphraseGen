So I've been an serious alcoholic for 7 years now but shit really went off the rails in September when my girlfriend and I split up after 7 years. Ended up spending 15 days in the ward before completing a 60 day IP program. Currently I'm in IOP 4 days a week. Absolutely loving sobriety no struggles with cravings whatsoever. My life has improved folds beyond what I've felt emotionally and physically for years. I'm a real success...So this is just a general question I'm not seeking medical advice from anyone. Has anyone dealt with persistent nausea and vomiting this far into sobriety (5+ months)?..More specifically having the obvious withdrawal nausea/vomiting and it lasting for a good month going away for a month or two and then coming back? My situation after being in IOP for a while was my nausea went away until the last few weeks of my program and came back. Once I got home I began to get seriously nauseous everytime I woke up for the day and bouts throughout the day where I'll need to sit or lie down for several minutes. I rarely vomited though. Now over 2 months of being home I still have nausea every day when I wake up and generally when I eat though the severity has subsided tremendously. The problem is that now I've thrown up 3 times in 4 days - twice after eating the other after waking up with a migraine. I'm just curious if anyone was still suffering from nausea or vomiting this far into sobriety (ulcers and other health problems aside)...When I was in the ward I had tests run on my liver stomach heart etc. Haven't consumed a drop since having those tests were done. Everything came out with results typical for a healthy person my age though I was definitely right on the fringe of the threshold for those tests. I'm scheduling an appointment tomorrow to see a doctor to do another check on my stomach and get a reup  on my meds. I am NOT seeking medical advice I'm just curious if anyone has an experience similar to mine that might be able to shed some light on this. I understand a million different things could definitely exacerbate the nausea i.e. stress meds etc.. But I just really want to look at this with all other variables removed and to just take a look at the cutting alcohol out and having been sober for over 5 months.

Are you experiencing any anxiety or depression? I know for me personally that's often a cause of nausea and digestive issues. Hope you feel better soon! 
Please see a doctor.
