Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Support..**"Life is not a solo act. It's a huge collaboration and we all need to assemble around us the people who care about us and support us in times of strife." - [Tim Gunn](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/t/timgunn493188.html?src=t_support)**..*What I get from it:* For a very long time I thought that my struggles and my problems were mine and mine alone.  During my drinking I tried very hard through isolation and stubbornness to take on the world and all of my challenges all by myself.  Not surprisingly trying to do everything on my own [didn't work out too well](http://ericafinds.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/smile-because-I-am-overwhelmed.jpg).  These days I have accepted that I need and want the support of others at home and in my community [and I am asking for help from my team when I need it](http://www.motifake.com/image/demotivational-poster/0809/teamwork-demotivational-poster-1221418354.jpg).  This community at /r/stopdrinking has given me so much support love and wisdom and I feel very lucky to have you all here whenever I need you.  [For all of the help you have given me and continue to give me I hope I have the opportunity to do the same for each and every one of you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkyqRP8S93Y)...Have an awesome day all!

You are doing such a great job at this service work KJ!
I really enjoy the quotes. I read the daily reflections and look for these every morning. This one hits home for me as I have spent the last 15 years in isolation and going it alone with every thought. Asking for help here on SD was the best thing I have ever done in those years. I have also started to talk to others in the real world and having the courage to ask others for help has meant a great deal to my sobriety. Thanks KetoJam! Needed this!
