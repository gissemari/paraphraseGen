I'm heading on my first sober trip on Sunday to Miami! I'm so excited and just hopeful the weather doesn't interfere with the trip... and of course that if it does hit everyone is okay!..I'm going with my friend who knows I'm sober and who's sister is sober so not worried about relapsing. I found SOBE a sober AA home thing where they have meetings so I'm going to check that out. But I'd love recommendations on what places have good NA options places to go out dancing and all that!..Thanks!

If you don't know the history of the  Coral Castle  and you are into weird you should check it out. I think it is close enough to Miami.
