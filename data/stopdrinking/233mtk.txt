I've lurked on this sub for quite a long time...long before I ever made any serious efforts to quit. Two years ago I posted using a throwaway account and reading this post today my heart breaks for the scared and guilt-ridden young woman that I was: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/rkv2f/i_never_imagined_that_i_could_end_up_in_this_place/..Sadly even though I knew damn well that I needed to quit drinking two years ago it took another 30+ pounds of weight gain an extra year of graduate school (beyond what it should have taken me to graduate) months of suicidal ideation an ER visit and multiple blackouts before I finally managed to make any serious effort toward changing my life. ..Today I am 50 days sober but every day is still a struggle. I can't thank the /r/stopdrinking community enough for getting me this far. I have learned so much from reading all of your posts and I've made connections with people that have helped me more than they know (I'm talking to you /u/scrotoe ). I have also gotten involved in AA chose a home group and a sponsor and started working the steps. I've seen phenomenal improvements in my life but I still think about drinking multiple times every single day. I've had a few "pink cloud" moments but overall getting sober is probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I keep wondering when it will get easier heh. But then again ["Nothing in this world that's worth having comes easy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVTYtsfg-tc). ..If I can make it this far anybody can. It won't be easy but it will be worth it.

Cool post on your half-century /u/psycook --many happy returns.  
Wow wow wow has it been 50 already?! Congrats!
Way to go getting 50 days! ..I did the same thing - lurked for a long time off &amp; on before ever getting serious about stopping. I'm not out of the woods but doing so much better than before. Let's keep at it!
I kept doing this:.."I have also gotten involved in AA chose a home group and a sponsor and started working the steps. I've seen phenomenal improvements in my life"..And now I don't do this:.."I still think about drinking multiple times every single day."..They said: .."You don't have to struggle. If you're drinking or even thinking about drinking there's work to do." ..They were right.
