Who here has tried aa for an extended period of time but later faded away from the program (and still continued to stay sober AND happy) without the program. What did you not like about AA? Do you find they can sometimes lack empathy and force their steps timeline onto you? (Or force you to pray daily if you "want what they have") ..Anyone here follow more of a co-creating relationship with the universe - rather than handing over all your power to the care of God?..I'm more of a law of attraction + positive mindset and action taking person - rather than praying for things kind of person. Praying gives me anxiety...working to create my life (mixed with gratitude) works much better for me. Gives me peace of mind. I'd love to know if anyone else has experienced releif and positive results without AA.  I've been in the program 2 + years....relapse is part of my story but now I 100% know I'm alcoholic and am 7 months clean. I love sobriety. Just trying to find a more positive softer approach rather than being drilled into adapting to prayer.  I have my own methods of getting in touch with divine inspiration or a divine energy/universe. I find it when I'm clearing my head walking along a beach or watching a sunset. Let me know your experience

Here's a softer version of the steps. Using these made it possible for me to work the program. Meetings are not enough. Getting a sponsor and working the steps led to personal growth...________________________________________ ..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given...Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others...Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal...Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm...Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors...Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people...Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me...
25 months happily and gratefully sober and been to 1 AA meeting. And after that meeting I found myself fantasizing about drinking more than I have any other night since my last drink. I find something about sitting around and identifying as alcoholics to be damaging for ***me.*** Being alcoholics isn't what defines us; but how we react to our situations does. I won't sit here and bash AA as it is some people's only lifeline but it is/was not the answer for me. The 12 steps are nice but if you truly look at our psyche the 12 steps are something a heart and mind that are truly desiring change will go through naturally over time. 
I found doing the steps to be the most effective thing in my recovery. I was sober but miserable and I did find a new freedom after completing the steps especially the "action" steps (4-9). ..In my experience the AA program has been ALL about action. Showing up helping people getting outside of myself by doing things for other people etc. - in the Big Book it is described as a program of action. ..I know people who have sat in AA for 20+ years and have not done the steps - their sobriety is not something that I want. I know people who have been in the program for a year and have done the steps - they have something I want. For me AA has been a program of gratitude and action and I firmly believe without it I'd be MISERABLE...I hope this is helpful :)
Someone in AA told me prayer is asking and meditation is listening.  The hoop you have to jump through is wider than you think.  Nothing you described is incompatible with AA. I'm sorry you bumped up against some personalities. I was welcomed and really appreciated the support in my early sobriety. I continue to be active because provides me an opportunity to be available to pay it forward to others who are still suffering.
I faded away from the program around my third year sober. It was too contradictory to my trauma therapy and I don't think the mindset of always practicing a tenth step was very healthy for me. I just do my own thing now.  It was fine for needing a sober fellowship for that I am very grateful it was there for a youngin getting sober but it was not a long term solution for me. It kept me caught up in a lot of negative behaviors that reflected my dysfunctional upbringing.
