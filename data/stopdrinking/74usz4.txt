First of all I'm 21 so alcohol is almost always around me however lately not even by a direct choice but just naturally I've been weening off alcohol. ..I spent the last couple weeks not drinking and in the time I've started running again I'm barely smoking cigarettes anymore the color has come back in my face and I feel(felt*) great! Waking up early and feeling well rested it far better than the feeling of up staying up late drinking. ..But the temptation was there very strongly last night so I drank. Ended up waking up at 3am since alcohol prevents you from entering REM sleep and cant fall back asleep. I'm dizzy I'm nauseous my face is pale and I look aged. I can feel the poison in my veins. ..This was so not worth feeling this way guys! Stay strong don't give in to the temptation! Time to detox. . .

Hold on to and remember that feeling. When I am feeling tempted I ask myself why I want to drink and what do I expect it will achieve. For me I am usually hoping it will recreate something that no longer exists or never existed in my life and there is 0% chance alcohol will bring it back. Staying sober might help me create something else good though.
Glad you came right back. I will not drink with you today.
