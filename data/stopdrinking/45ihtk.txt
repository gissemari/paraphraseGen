Once upon a time there was a hopeless hateful joyless selfish drunk...Me. ..Here is some info by the dates:..On Jan 11 2013 I had to quit drinking alcohol for stomach surgery on Jan 18 2013.  I was not allowed to drink for "90 days" post surgery and then it was to be "occasional".  I remember saying ahead of time privately that "I don't know if I can avoid alcohol that long"...because I was already an alcoholic and had been for YEARS...I just hadn't accepted it.  But I had the surgery and made it 106 days total without alcohol.....There is a picture of me in that 100+ day window (March 13 2013) of booze free time post surgery where I had lost a lot of weight...I look great...I'm holding a bow and arrow impersonating Katniss from the Hunger games.  Man...I look good.  It rips my heart out to look at that body now.....I made it until April 24 2013 (by abusing all kinds of prescription meds in lieu of booze) before I had beaten that 90 day mark and decided it would be OK for me to have "A drink".  Jamesons whiskey and vodka.  I mean HEY MAN!  They said 90 days...I did 106!  I've GOT THIS right?  (Nevermind that recreational abuse of Percocet Vicoden Ambien etc...those are prescriptions from real doctors! They don't count.)..I wrote in my fitness group that day April 24 2013...I was already relapsing before picking up that drink and inside I knew it......*"I have some major personal challenges at home right now and I've been back to eating my feelings. There is not much I'm feeling positive about right now but for today I'm trying to do things the right way eat right and not drink with my food. I feel like I'm on the edge of the start of snowballing down to ruining everything. This is a pretty low point for me."*..That night I picked up the whiskey and vodka...Fast forward...from "a whiskey and a vodka" on **April 24 2013**....to **April 20 2014**..There is no more sexy Katniss on April 20 2014. This is the day of  a picture of me target shooting with my husband's gun in my hands.  I'm 52 lbs heavier.  It is only one year later......and it isn't a bow and arrow shooting archery for fun anymore.  I'm having my stepdad and hubby teach me how hubby's gun works "so I'm safe having it in the house" by target shooting...but they didn't know.  The target I wanted to shoot...was me.  ..I wanted to know how the gun worked so maybe during one of the moments before I hit my nightly blackout I would be able to use that gun and end the cycle I had gotten into.  ..I went from that much slimmer chick teetering on the edge of a dangerous spiral...already out of control with pills but when I went back to my best friend Alcohol it only took one year for things to escalate to the point of needing to learn how to use a gun and searching for enough liquid courage to use it.  ..30 days later...I hit my breaking point and knew it was "get help or die."..May 20 2014 was the first day in 392 days that I had been without alcohol...and the gods only know how many days since I had been without the use of a prescription sleep medicine/pain medicine outside of how it was prescribed.  ..May 20 2014 I felt truly hopeless.  Just one month earlier I held a gun learned how to use it because I was teetering at the edge of suicide...but that day in May I was given the gift of desperation and I saw a therapist who specialized in addiction treatment and poured out my heart and finally told someone the truth the whole truth including the dirty corners.  I was up to drinking a handle (1.75 litres) of vodka every 2 or 3 days at this point...He told me after that session "Well I know I can't ask you to go one day without booze but come back next week try to cut back and let's start trying to help you.  ..I went to my car and was pissed.  "This guy thinks I can't go one day!?!?" my ego screamed.  (Despite spending an hour telling him I was a nightly blackout drinker with the mixing of sleeping pills etc.)..So I quit.  I quit the alcohol that night. I didn't touch the sleeping pills.  I stopped the pain meds (I didn't need them anyway)...I quit because "I will show that Doctor!"..And it was hard.  I had the mood swings the temptation was STRONG...I already had shakes aches eye twitches lank falling out hair strange bruises...alcohol had trashed my body and surviving without alcohol was tough.  ..Within that first week I went to my first AA meeting..a women's meeting.  And they welcomed me with open arms.  I had NO love for myself...but they showed me in just that first meeting that there was life outside of the hateful downward spiral I had been in.  ..On Day 5 of sobriety I found /r/stopdrinking and [I posted this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26ey9d/today_is_day_5_of_sobriety_this_time_around_tried/)..And people responded.  Perfect strangers told me "Welcome" and that I wasn't alone.  And...I saw just a tiny spark...like flint and steel make...just a tiny spark of light in the darkness I was in...that MAYBE I could find my way out...so I kept coming back.......To be continued.  ..***********************.Stay sober my friends...Mouse

Wow. This is a great post. I am inspired. Thank you!
&lt;3 you Mouse. Thanks for sharing! That must feel good to get that out and your story is inspiring. (&amp; I think my doctor did the same tactic on me lol.)
Mouse you got strong and stayed gentle at the same time. Sharing this kind of stuff takes such gumption and I know you do it because there's a chance that the one person who really needs to read this tonight is gonna see it. You are such a gorgeous human being thank you for making it through those hard times and being here with us. 
When you boil it all down it really is that direct and blunt of a choice to be made. Stop now or continue drinking? *Live* or *die*? I know I was poisoning myself daily falling (or digging?) ever deeper into depression. ..I'm glad I chose life and I'm glad you did too Mouse. Your inspirational story can change lives I'm sure it already has.. Best wishes :)
wow. thank you for this inspirational post..
Hope. It gives me goosebumps thinking about what a powerful thing it is. That spark that brought you back from the edge of oblivion.  I'm glad you found us Mouse. I'm glad you found that hope because I know that you have given many many more that hope in return. And it just multiplies from there. What a beautiful thing to close your eyes and envision right?.. Love you. :-*
You have been on quite a journey. Thank you mouse.

My SIS (sister in sobriety) so awesome to meet you back in November! Glad I didn't see these pics till now fierce! Us hippie yogi pacifist tree huggerrs are skurd of weapons! What's funny about IRL with you Crosby and big tuna separately we all knew each other a little or a lot but for me there was nothing about any of you that surprised me at all. We really do let it all hang here! What makes it great!!
thanks for the story best wishes
Mouse I'm glad to see you have grown into such a strong person. The struggle is real but you're making it! You're fucking making it and it gives me the courage to think one day I will be there. Thank you for the work you have done for others your husband and very importantly yourself. Congrats on another day sober!

Thanks again for sharing your life with us Mouse. You kick ass at life!
Thank you for this post - you are truly inspirational!
My father wanted to give me a rifle I used to shoot as a child. My state makes it pretty difficult to get a firearms ID card. You need references and have to consent to a search of your mental health records. I wasn't sure that I would pass as I've been treated for depression and anxiety...I stalled on it and gave him excuses but I knew a part of the reason was that I knew I shouldn't have a gun. In this case the regulations made sense. I was at the point where I was constantly thinking about dying. I couldn't continue to live the way I had been...I guess I wanted to live enough that I protected myself in that tiny way by making an easy option unavailable. I could just picture myself sitting and crying holding a gun and contemplating shooting myself and I didn't want to be able to have that debate. It was probably one of the few wise decisions I made back then...Thank you for your honesty and for being such a great example of overcoming adversity. Your story is inspiring.
Thank you so much for posting and for your honesty. Congrats on your 633 days! That's amazing! Your s&gt;tory is truly inspiring to me!.. &gt;Fast forward...from "a whiskey and a vodka" on April 24 2013....to April 20 2014..I feel that exact way looking back at the last 4 years. Don't remember anything. Glad to be sober!
Amazing stuff Nonny. Brought me to tears. Strength and peace to you friend. Be well.

Wow I am SO FUCKING PROUD OF YOU!..Alcohol definitely makes me gain weight too. Which makes you more depressed and then you drink MORE. It's so messed up...What gives you the courage to keep going? Do you have a big support system? I think I finally reached the end of my denial today. I just can't continue to ruin my body life or sanity. ..But man really I am so proud of you and I don't even know you. Keep going.
Mouse.Thank you for posting this story its what i needed at the point I'm at right now. KEEP strong and Sober on
