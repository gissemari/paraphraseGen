Hey you can do this..Just reset your badge and welcome back..What do you think tripped you up?.Any thoughts on how you could avoid that in future?
Don't hate yourself bud. Everyone here has relapsed anywhere from hours to years. It's normal. It's easy to feel like such shit about it that you stop trying. Don't stop trying. You quit for a reason and that reason is still valid. You've got a boatload of people here supporting you and understanding where you are. You *can* do this. ..Can you look back to the point you relapsed and pinpoint the why?  No reason is stupid. Once you know why this happened this time you can work on being prepared the next time. You just gotta be honest with yourself and you have to forgive yourself. Will you jump back in the journey?  I promise there are great things along the way. 
Hey been there done that far too many times to count. The main thing is not to stay lying down and turn it into a months long binge but to keep trying to climb back up onto that wagon. I've said this before elsewhere - but think of it as a process - fail fail again fail better and then hopefully don't fail at all. You got this. Good luck to you and congrats on the first day again - I sometimes think starting over is the hardest thing - so kudos..EDIT - and I forgot to mention there is a blog called Tired of thinking about drinking and she does this thing called the 100 day challenge where if you subscribe you get allocated a sober pen pal who can help hold you up when you feel crappy/just need to vent. It really is helping me to stay on the straight and narrow.
