----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** Didn't do much but I am staying sober fast approaching 6 Mo.    .    .**Struggles:** I still waiting for my legal issues to be finished.    .    .**General Chat:** I just started watching Game of Thrones and I am hooked I bought and watched season 1 and loved it so much I bought and watched season 2. I couldn't wait until 2014 to watch season 3 so I found a website that plays full episodes (instant gratification old habits die hard)...So not I am all caught up and I may get HBO just to watch season 4 when it airs. 
**Triumph**: Joined a tennis league that starts next week. Trying to focus more at work so will be less active here and in the chat. Went to my first Level 2 Krav Maga class on Monday and will be going to another one today. Life is good. ..**Struggle**: Trying to focus more at work so will be less active here and in the chat. But life is good. ..**General Chat**: Life is good. 
**Triumph:** My whole family is coming down to Ottawa the day I write my LSAT's to celebrate that bitch being over and to dress shop with me! ..**Struggle:** Sick as a dog today. In bed. Also studying has dropped to a new low. I'm having a hard time even looking at an LSAT right now...**General chat:** Peanut butter is so good. 
Triumph: Longest I've been sober in 2 years and I'm making some headway with my job search...Struggles: Ex-gf/ex-friend are fucking cunts (please excuse my language) and that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth...General Chat:  Holy balls are drunk people annoying.  I was on the train last night and apparently a Yankees game had just let out because there were some incredibly obnoxious/mildly belligerent passengers on the train beers in hand.  Ugh.  Talk about ugly Americans.
**Triumph**: My wife told me some news that I'm technically not supposed to tell anyone about for another 5 weeks and I'm super excited..**Struggles**: My wife told me some news that I'm technically not supposed to tell anyone about for another 5 weeks and I'm super terrified..**General Chat**: I haven't been very active around here lately because work has taken over my life. I've been ok but I'm nervous about slipping. So far so good though. I do feel bad not helping others however when this sub has helped me so much. I'll try to make more time.
**Triumph:** Now that I'm single (and mostly happy about it) I have time to get back to the hobbies I enjoyed as a child. I have been playing the flute and teaching myself the piano and it's been very rewarding...**Struggle:** My birthday is next week and I'm not sure how to celebrate. Part of me is just completely fine with a very low key evening and the other part of me is disappointed in the complacency. My drinking birthdays were planned weeks in advance and strived to be the most epic ever. This year will be a bit of a contrast. On another note I don't deprive myself of much lately so how exactly do I treat myself? I've been treating myself to something nice for each month that I'm sober...**General Chat:** Life is good. I've been going to AA but not really bonding with many people so I introduced myself to someone at the last meeting. I know that I need to embrace the community aspect of AA but its hard for me to come out of my shell......Love this fall weather. So happy to be here.
**Triumph:** I know it has only been 5 days since my relapse but I haven't even thought about a drink since which even in the last almost 6 months before my relapse never happened not for more then a single night anyway. Also my ex-wife and I are getting back to being really good friends and finally talking a lot more which is great for our 3 little girls. Also taking things one day at a time with a girl I met in the program she has become my best friend and one of the greatest supporters of me in my sobriety...**Struggle:** Been trying to focus more at work and even got on meds for my ADHD but they still haven't kicked in as it takes time for the med to build up. So been struggling with the staying on task...**General Chat:** Life is going pretty good overall and really liking the weather here in ND this past week.
Triumph: work is going well. relationship is possibly the best it's ever been. Family is doing good. Strained friendships are being rekindled...Struggle: insecurities. Trying to be perfect. Feeling bad when I'm not...General chat: I want a dog.
Triumph: 2 meetings in 48 hours after big bender on Sunday being honest with my caring coworkers and boss about how much I'm struggling and needing to take a break...Struggle: Still an emotional roller coaster terrible nightmares all last night and no sleep so much depression over last few days...General chat: Got some work tasks I was avoiding done.
**Triumphs**: I had a very nice weekend meeting up with a friend and going out dancing on Friday night making an ultra-delicious tortilla for a birthday party on Saturday night going to yoga for the first time on Sunday and later meeting with my ex on Sunday (and leaving less stressed for the first time). At the party on Saturday I spoke to a guy from Uruguay (my Spanish classes are already paying off!) and I'm considering going to South America for a holiday in December. ..I also went to yoga the second time today straight from work and the difference in how my body feels is noticeable: after work I was much more hunched over etcetera. So apparently me going to yoga twice a week is a thing now much to my own (and my ex's) disbelief...**Struggles**: It's hard to see my ex having a much harder time getting her social life back together - so it wasn't just me who was the problem there - and I still am thinking of ways to get back together but in a different less co-dependent way... ..Also even though I'm doing a relaxed form of yoga my body is still kind of stressed...**General**: A bit of an Indian Summer here in the Netherlands (no rain 18 degrees C) but man are the days getting shortening quickly! Not looking forward to winter...
