Good morning/afternoon.   .Theme: Renew your motivation.   .**"People often say motivation doesn't last well neither does bathing that's why we renew it daily."- Zig Zigler**    .What I get from it: I have a selective short memory and I can't forget why I made the voice to stop drinking.I renew my motivation in the rooms. Observing the new comer or here reading the struggles of the beginning of recovery. I need people with far less clean time as well as people that have been where I am trying to go. Thank you all.

Very true this is why I just make the decision to avoid drinking TODAY. It makes things a bit more manageable and I can muster up the willpower everyday if I know I just have to make it to bed sober for another day no matter what is going on. I remember reading a quote that alcoholics "are quick to forget and slow to learn" or something along those lines which is why we have to stay vigilant daily. I renew my vigilance every morning with a shower a cup of coffee and coming here to join in the community.
