59th reset. I had really wanted to stay sober on good Friday but the person who started my relapse popped in to the AA meeting I went to and I chose to drink over him again. But now I'm back at to try again. I'm en route to a good meeting (one I know he never goes to) and have left my small amount of remaining money at home. I just want to be sober again. Hopefully this is my last reset. IWNDWYT.  Thanks for reading
