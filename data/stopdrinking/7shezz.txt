This addiction just came into our lives this past year or so. My dad isnt the type to drink a fifth a day but even just the half pint or shots he does a day is enough to get him drunk since he's on a bunch of pills too...He keeps going thru a cycle of relapse. He'll be clean for a couple weeks then cave in and be angry a few days then it'll all repeat... Today I was getting ready for work about to leave and I saw some meat in the fridge defrosting. I took it out to him to ask him when he's making it and he shot at me calling me a loser for still living at home (I'm 22 finishing school). I don't know if he was drunk or recently relapsed again. I then called him a loser since he had lost his great job and wrecked his car just a couple weeks ago both due to drinking. Then I went back to the kitchen to finish making my lunch...He them ran at me saying I have 5 seconds to apologize or he will beat my ass. He's never been violent before but he had crazy eyes. My mother was there and i was running late so for her sake and mine i said sorry rather than confront him. He then started ranting about how I need to show him respect or get kicked out and to never disrespect him again or else. ..I'm still stewing about this. I wanted to call him out and confront him so bad

You might try /r/AlAnon as well for this post.
I think the people at AlAnon (r/alanon) might be better able to help you in this situation.
