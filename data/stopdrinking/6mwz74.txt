So I posted a day ago about my basic story which is that I was sober for 14 months and then relapsed in an 8-day binge. Now things are getting back to normal and it's surreal because my life has nothing to do with alcohol. So much of the work I had to do when I quit quit I don't find myself needing to do now. But I don't want to let that give me a false sense of security. Does anyone share this experience and how did you make sure you got back to your life and stayed there?
