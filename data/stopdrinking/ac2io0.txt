It happened the day before NYE. I had nine months. I ended up with my pants around my ankles on my friends' floor screaming about conspiracies and making schizophrenic word salads (drinking exacerbates my schizophrenia like nothing you've ever ever seen) and told the love of my life he wasn't my "one" when he is and wound up in the hospital. Then the mental hospital two days later to up my meds. ..And that's just a concise telling of only some of the horrors that unfolded. So this is just your friendly reminder that alcohol is the literal devil and ruins lives. No matter how tempting it may be think about me with my pants around my ankles yelling word salads at innocent nice people. It's just not worth it. Ever.
