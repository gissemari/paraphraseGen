I had what I believe is my first dream that I was drinking in.    I remember ordering the drink and not even thinking about being sober.  After I had a few drinks something click and I said oh. Why did I just do that but then I finished the drink.   I remember struggling in my dream if I should hit reset button or not as I only had one drink.    ..The dream bothers me as it reminds me deep down that I still wouldn't mind  to drink!  I always play it forward and know it's the right decision but I'm laying in bed confused about how nonchalant I was about it and don't like that my mind was ok with it.

You have to put a barrier of forgetfulness between dreams and real life.  I've dreamed some of the most fucked up shit imaginable probably.  I don't really know because I've forgotten whatever I dreamed because it's irrelevant to my real life...
Remember dreams are a very advanced version of "play the tape forward".   Nobody knows exactly how they work.    This one challenged you to be more vigilant and it's got you thinking about that right now.   I would say "mission accomplished" take the lesson and have a great sober day.
I'm not responsible for my subconscious...However I've noticed the more I don't have that first drink the more my subconscious starts to resonate with being unimpaired!
