I'll try to keep it short. Those who have seen my posts over the last week have heard me complaining about my boss and my job. But I pulled it together grew a thicker skin and had a big day today...I was called into an emergency meeting unexpectedly and had to present on an problem I'm considered knowledgeable on. I took a deep breath went for it and knocked it out of the park. One of the top-20ish people in my company had called the meeting and thanked me after calling me by my name (woah) and saying he was impressed with how I handled it all...I felt so great. I can't even explain. Every long night every time I doubted myself every relapse every hopeless day and all the loneliness - they are worth it. Every second of struggle was worth it. Waking up at 3AM in a cold sweat and wanting to give up but gritting it out - worth it...My sobriety makes these good days possible and the bad days much more bearable. And it only keeps getting better. SD has been my only friend at times and I'm grateful for everyone here. My demons keep popping up and I keep winning the battles. You know what I might just be stronger than them
