I was on vacation recently and stayed with a friend who is a big drinker. I noticed he wasn't drinking which was odd.  I also noticed that there was very little alcohol in the house.  (That's what an alcoholic looks for in a house!) anyways we were supposed to meet for dinner but was ditched as he was going out with friends for drinks after work and his wife was out of town.  This was strange but. The only explanation that I could come up with was that he chose a drinking spree instead of me.  I was right he came home extremely drunk. My husband had already told him that I had a drink problem.  He was drunk and told me that he knew I was an alcoholic and that he was too.  It was interesting and I could identify with him on every level. I was right about he reason for standing me up. Strangely it was a positive experience to meet somebody with the same struggles. We never mentioned it the next day.  Should I bring it up with him? We could help each other out. Or should I ignore it and say nothing?

i've had a situation where things were said while drunk and then never brought up again.  i have mostly regret for that.  if you think you will want to talk about this in the future i would suggest to seize the opportunity before the window closes.
Thanks
I would just ask him. I don't have anyone around me who understand my situation and every time I drink or think of drinking I miss that like crazy (so thank you SD). I know if I made a confession like that it would either be to make that connection or just because I needed to vent. If he doesn't want to talk about it you'll notice and probably no harm done!
