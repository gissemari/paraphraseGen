never giving up 
I learned my triggers and how to avoid them. Sounds easy took time; whenever I fell I looked at what led up to it surroundings how I felt what could I have done different etc...And I needed to *really* want it...Hang in there the only thing the heroes have in common is they didn't quit. I will not drink with you today! 
Serial relapser here.  Was sober for a almost a year once a few months here and there over the last 5 years.  This time  I am on day 17.  The difference this time is that I really really want it and I know that I have no choice in the matter.  It is a matter of life or death.  Every other time I had a voice in part of my brain that told me that I would at some point have a drink or two when I had this beat.  I could never think that I could last forever without ever touching booze again.  I felt like I would be missing out on something.  This time I have been attending AA meetings reading and posting on here more open with my friends and family.  I have made sobriety my #1 priority.  Through alot of reflection I realize that the only thing I am missing out on is misery that I caused by drinking.  Drinking is what caused me to miss out of so many good things in the past and I am tired of being sick and dependent on alcohol.  I am powerless over alcohol after I take that first sip.  I am tired of being it's slave from the moment I wake up until the time I go to bed.  I am tired of worrying about when the store opens and closes and which store I last visited because I wouldn't want them to think I am a drunk after all.  I feel more positive and happy this time than any other attempt beating this beast and can't wait for more of my future.
