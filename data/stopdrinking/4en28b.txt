I don't understand but I feel like if I stay sober for a week or more my entire thinking changes. I get manic depressive things irritate the shit out of me the world is boring as hell. I have these problems inherently but why am I having such a severe case of this when I'm actually NOT drinking? It makes me want to drink and me being sober is a trigger!..I am so confused I chronically relapse for the past 8 years. All my friends are having kids and I'm just stuck. I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. ..Basically me being sober makes me want to drink because the after effects of alcohol keep me calm. So damn weird I dont know what's going on.

I am not surprised you chronically relapse if after a week you feel irritable and manic depressive! That sounds really hard! Drinking is an easy cure for those feelings... but it's temporary...Nothing changes if nothing changes. I needed an overhaul of my life. It doesn't happen overnight but small changes here and there can help immensely...I remember that vicious cycle. Feel bad drink feel better. Time passes feel worse drink drink feel better. Do something reprehensible guilt shame feel bad drink feel better. Over and over and over...I broke the cycle by going to rehab. It was 35 days of my life. A small price to pay for the life that sobriety has given me.
This was common for me.  If I had not consumed any alcohol for 24 or 36 hours I would get "restless irritable and discontent" (RID).  I learned the feelings emotions and upsets I had repressed by numbing with alcohol did not go away they were repressed.  Similar to garbage in a trash can sitting in a summer sun they festered and grew more rank just waiting to leak out...When I take the alcohol away I'm still left with me.  There are tools to address.  There's a saying "if a drunken horse thief stops drinking you're left with a sober horse thief."  (I'm NOT comparing you to a horse thief).
