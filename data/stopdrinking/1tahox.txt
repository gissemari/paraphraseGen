As we can all relate when I sobered up I realized how  much time I had on my hands when I wasn't getting drunk/planning to get drunk/recovering from being drunk.  ..Especially as the holidays are  here.  It seems every weekend there's some event going on that drunk me would have *loved* but sober me has to stay away from.  I feel absolutely no danger from going to the bottle because of the feeling I get when I think about it.  I can still feel the nasty hangover nausea and dizziness even after a week so it's a huge disincentive for me.  ..Tonight we're going to watch Christmas Vacation at a friend's house.  They will be drinking all sorts of things and I will have some simple clean cider.  Again the thought of those drinks makes me feel instantly hungover even as I type this so I'm not worried about a relapse.  ..Just wanted to tell someone I guess that's all.  They're going to rip me a new asshole because they don't really understand how I felt before and how much better I feel now.  They'll just have to [deal with it](http://imgur.com/yr226.gif).

You owe no one an explanation. Hang tough hombre
Have fun! My first outing where others were drinking wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Just keeping a nice cold fizzy water in my hand was enough to ignore the desire to drink; hopefully that cider helps for you too. Enjoy!.."Yeah it is a bit nipply out. I mean nippy. What am I saying nipple? Hahahaha" :)
How did last night go?
