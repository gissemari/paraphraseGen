Last year I belatedly learned that August 16th is National Rum Day. Upset at missing an opportunity to celebrate my favorite drink I added a reminder to my phone calendar so I wouldn't forget in 2016. I planned a grand time in my head drinking Captain and Coke all day lounging by the pool and taking the next day off work to recover from the inevitable hangover...But guess what? I completely forgot about it until my phone so kindly reminded me. (Insert sarcasm here.) I've been struggling with increased moodiness and cravings since Sunday and I didn't need the extra fuel for my lizard brain thoughts. The fuck its are on attack and they aren't messing around. I'm trying to fortify my defenses using my tools built over the past two months to not take that first drink. I'm winning so far but damn it's been a tough fight for me...Instead of giving in and making that trip to the store I'm actively choosing a better life for myself. No matter how sad pissed or frustrated I feel at never celebrating this holiday I once looked forward to so much I know it's a lie that happiness I think will come from giving in. I know that one drink will lead to many more that will never be enough. It's not worth ruining all the progress I've made just to celebrate a fabricated holiday...Today I won. FTZ and here's to one more day not drinking with all you fine folks.
