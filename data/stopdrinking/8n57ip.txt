It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I have been struggling with some emotional damage done by a therapist some years back who deliberately tried to make me feel bad about myself. (This is not something I imagined when I confronted her she admitted that something about me irritated her and said that she had even asked **her** therapist why she often felt the need to be mean to me.) Soon after she told me this I stopped seeing her but what she did wounded me and has made me scared to turn to other professionals for help. ..**Triumph:** Despite having unresolved psychological issues I am a much happier person than I was just a few years ago. Bad things still happen to me and I still have some serious medical issues to deal with but on the whole I really love my life. ..Someone else on this site said  An alcoholic is happiest when he or she is sober  and that is certainly true of me...**General:** Recently I saw [this cartoon](https://i.imgur.com/BajZVAJ.jpg) which pretty much sums up the difference between my life when I was drinking and my life now that I'm sober...

My dad was a pretty bad alcoholic when I was growing up and at almost 30 I still struggle with automatic defense mechanisms from my childhood. I used to just automatically lie about things knowing he would never check up on them so he would leave me alone when he was drunk. It always starts with a mean name and a accustaory tone...My wife sets this response off because she does the same thing and I revert to that same behavior. The difference is she checks first so I got caught before the words even left my mouth and I realized what I said. Something I'm better at but still fuck up. Sucks just the same every time. 
Struggle: I have pneumonia. Went to the ER for an antibiotic. They gave me a shot there of the antibiotic and script to fill the next day. Wake up the next day a crazy rash everywhere. Had to go back to the ER and was admitted for most of the day. Little sleep and I'm tired out but not ready for bed sleepy. ..Triumph: I DID IT ALL SOBER!! Instead of grabbing a drink to "help" my symptoms I listened to my telling me that I was ill. I did it all on my own too! My husband has helped me so much these first few weeks. I did this all by myself. I TOOK CARE OF MYSELF!! I haven't done that in any significant way for a long long time. It felt good. =)
/u/sfgirlmary that's quite the number ya got. 1111!..**Struggle** A friend committed suicide a few weeks ago and I've been having a hard time processing it.  ..**Triumph** Getting stuff done at work! And despite the time crunch doing everything well!..**General** I'm hanging out with the world's chillest but also funniest dog for a couple of weeks. This dog has no shortage of hilarious antics stopping in the middle of the road to chew a stick or deciding to give up on walking across grass in favour of doing some kooky dog version of 'the worm' or spinning around and around when excited or trying to lick strangers feet...He's also super chill.
**S:** My daughter is going to her Mom's on Friday.  I'm a little worried about that because they are going to be 400 miles away and her Mom is in my opinion crazy...**T:**  I GRADUATED NURSING SCHOOL!!!  Holy crap.  It still hasn't sank in yet....**G:**  Being sober is hard work.  After being a heavy drinker for many years it's deeply ingrained in me.  I've come to just realize that it's something that I have to live with and I'm just going to take it day by day because that's what's worked for me so that's what I'm going to keep doing.
**Struggle**: My fucking pain! UGH. Some weeks it feels like I've got a handle on it and others I am just surviving life. I also got super depressed out of nowhere and just feel very empty. Maybe I will finally get to the bottom of these feelings now that I can't run...**Triumph**: I feel like I have developed a closer bond with my cat who I am obsessed with lol. For a long time my boyfriend was the clear favorite but something changed and she has been super affectionate and playful with me lately. ..**General**: I am so glad I got this stupid expensive cat. When I used to feel suicidal it felt like a real option to me but now I'm like 'I CAN'T LEAVE HER BEHIND'. It sounds dumb but I don't care!
**Struggle:** Boring money worries.  Trying to juggle thousands in medical bills.  I'm freaked out but I'll make it work.  Instead of hiding from it like I would have in the past I'll just pay a little of each bill and talk to them about payment plans...**Triumph:** I'm applying for a new job.  I actually really like my job and might not want to change.  The new one would be harder and less laid back and very different but I would learn **so much** that would be very valuable to my career in the long run.  Plus more money and *benefits* (what are those!?)..I don't know if this is a triumph but I guess I'll count it.  Chance of getting the job is like 0.075% I think so I guess it's a triumph just to take a risk and try for it.  Confidence or something.....**General:**  I love that.  Attitude is Everything!
Struggle.Feeling overwhelmed with work and hectic home stuff. Knowing meditation will help. Not making time for meditation. ..Triumph.Recognising this overwhelm as subtle self-sabotage and quite possibly a yearning for the comfort of "old drinking ways"...General.Mood swings seem to be calming. In particular the high highs - which have been very disorienting.  Spilt a cup of tea on the carpet last night and thought "at least it is not red wine"!
Struggle: Insomnia has been giving me a lot of grief this week despite things like routine shower before bed spending a few hours not using tv/phones etc before bed reading not working.  .Triumph: I've made it to day 10 of not drinking and I'm feeling pretty happy with that. I know things are getting better mentally as well as physically.  .General: I started reading American God's and I'm really enjoying it picking up reading again has been a nice byproduct of sobriety and I've been enjoying going to the library and saving a few bucks on books too.
Struggle: where is my weight loss?..Triumph: 3 months!..General: Training for a race and its nice to use my sports watch for its intended purpose. .There were times before when i used to use the data from the activity tracker to retrace my steps from the night before. oh you did walk to the shop... yes you did get up in the night to puke you guts out...
Congrats again Mary! That was a fun virtual party yesterday! :)..**Struggle:**     The job I contracted for is nowhere near where it should be. If you're familiar with New York health care regulations then you know about all the damn red tape here. Sucks...**Triumph:**     Finally spent some "Lisa-Time" out in the sun yesterday; just me and music. And the blazing sun which I didn't realize was so strong - even with lotion on! Anyway it was *so nice* to not have to take care of anyone for a couple of hours :)...**General:**     I have an old business colleague / personal friend that I haven't spoken to in years. He recently reached out to me and we spoke for an hour yesterday. I decided to come clean and tell him I'm sober. I was shocked when he said "an alcoholic? YOU Lee?! No way". It's funny how some people "knew" and others didn't. We're meeting for a Cajun lunch in a few weeks - he's lining up another job for me :)...See there's always a silver lining...wait for it... ;)
*struggle* I am completely overwhelmed with how much I wanted to get done before our mini-break how much I HAVE to get done and how much I'll come back to waiting to be done - on both the work and home front. Even pulling 1am workday finishes hasn't cut the list enough. Have another unavoidable one in front of my tonight. sigh. and my kitchen will NOT be as clean and sorted as I wanted by the time we leave to catch our plane in the morning. ..*triumph* I am sticking to my plan for our break no matter what. For me that's a biggie not to decide it simply can't be done the time simply can't be found yadda yadda. There's something to be said for booking non-refundable plane tickets and hotel rooms :)..*general* Maybe I need to stop caring so much if my house isn't "perfect". Maybe given a choice between a great and thriving career OR a perfect house and a half-assed career I am making the right choice for me to put career first ahead of housework. Parenting of course is not-negotiable and she'd get the same amount of my time and energy no matter which of those choices I made - though perhaps more of it would be hassling her about her feral mess all over the house if I chose the perfect home!.
Sup
**Struggle:** I started a new job 2 months ago and yesterday my boss said she had concerns that I'm still making errors in one area of the reports we produce. It sucked to hear but she is right that I'm still struggling with this one report. I'm doing well in other aspects but now my anxiety is through the roof about this. I'm worried about how long it will take me to catch on and hoping I don't get let go. I don't think that's going to happen but I can't stop obsessing about it now...**Triumph:** This is my 6th morning of sobriety so there's that. It has almost been 2 weeks since my boyfriend and I moved into our new apartment which I am loving...**General:** I think we're going to make tacos for dinner
**Struggle:** The realisation that I need to re-invent myself professionally is currently causing a combination of paralysis procrastination lack of motivation general avoidance of anything connected to the work I should be doing...**Triumph:** Remaining sober through it. It's taken a while but I now realise that in order to live soberly I have no hiding places. The temptation to pick up is weak because I focus on playing the tape forward...**General:** I can hold a baby deer in each hand. It means I'm Bambidextrous...
Struggle: my grandfather just past away yesterday so I'm pretty bummed out about that. He was a great man and made it to 99 so he lived a long and great life but still pretty upset about it..Triumph: I guess just being able to stay sober for 50 days now I feel like I've accomplished more in these past 50days than in the past 2years or so..General:been listening to a lot of music from when I was younger. Smashing pumpkins old snapcase one king down to name a few really good nostalgia trip..Anyway have a great day everyone and IWNDWYT 
Struggle:  Sticking to my decision to quit alcohol completely.  I know from previous experience that moderation doesn't work for me.  The thoughts of just one glass of wine or a cocktail maybe with vodka and not whiskey pop into my head.  When I start justifying drinks or making rules around drinking it isn't a good sign and it's exhausting.  I have to remember that it escalates quickly and I actually hate how I feel even after one drink...Triumph: I am actually posting here after lurking forever!  I don't know why I have been so nervous to post but the support has been great.  Maybe this was what was missing in my previous attempts...General: I'm really happy the weather is warming up here.  We got to spend some time at our cabin this past weekend which is one of my favorites places.  It was nice to relax before my summer Accounting course started this week.
**Triumph:** I've felt really confident in my sobriety lately \- between weight loss exercise and therapy I've felt good about what I'm doing lately...**Struggle:** In therapy I'm confronting the fact that I was bullied in high school. It's starting to get tough. I know it's necessary but hearing from a 3rd party that I was bullied as a kid and that it affected me is hard...**General:** Working on my bike learning climbing skills \(anchor building researching gear and climbing locations etc\) keeps me busy and challenged which is so so important for sobriety. It helps that they're both healthy hobbies!
**Triumph:** Four. [Four years](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8n3cc3/episode_iv_a_new_hope/). Four fucking years!..**Struggle:** Today nothing. Disbelief that I made it this long. All the normal things. But today I'm just going to let it go and concentrate on what I've done.
**Struggle:** I am struggling with catching up on all my doctor's appointments I avoided over the last couple years.  Also struggling with pain from an autoimmune disease...**Triumph:**  One of my puppies (four weeks old now) became gravely ill last week.  I rushed her to the vet and was able to somehow save this puppy. (I have found over the years that saving a sick puppy is very difficult.) She is on medicine for four weeks and not growing all that well and definitely looks a bit off and unfortunately I have fallen in love with her as I have watched her go from death's door to just making it and now really doing well.  It will be hard to let her go but she will likely make someone an excellent dog with years of joy all informed by her early struggle...**General:**  My youngest made the all-star baseball team.  He fills my heart up.  My oldest finishes up one baseball season today and then will start his all-star season.  My heart overflows.  My life as baseball mom is unceasing but hey they are all happy.  Today I'm tired but I'm good.
u/sfgirlmary I cannot believe that therapist.  I do at least give her credit for owning up to it.  There are lots of therapists who would not do that and it give you a basis to work it through.  Still tho jeez.  Congrats on loving your life.  That's so much in a nutshell.
Haha that cartoon pretty much sums it up. And it's great!
**Struggle:** Tomorrow marks four years since we lost my step daughter to an opioid overdose. Sometimes it doesn't even seem real and other times the reality crashes down and I'm barely able to hold it together. It's hard. I want to shut myself off from the feelings. I know that doesn't work and I'm not sure that anything does...**Triumph:** My work friend opened up to me about some personal issues she has. We've eaten lunch together almost every day for 15 years and while I've always had the impression she had something going on I never pushed the subject or tried to coerce it out of her. I'm glad she felt comfortable enough to confide in me and I hope I can give her some support by just being there to listen when she wants to talk more about it. ..**General:** Last week I had quite a bit of anxiety over the fact that my not drinking had been exposed at work. Turns out nobody cares at all like it's a complete non issue. I feel like the second person in Mary's cartoon for sure Nobody gives a shit! Yeah!!
**Struggle**: I'm having a hard time getting motivated at work this week. I work from home full time so I'm ultra paranoid when I'm not as productive. I need to get my sh!t together and focus...**Triumph**: I think the weight is finally starting to come off. I feel a couple of pounds lighter. I might try on some pants today :-)..**General**: Some friends and I rented a Karaoke room (Japanese style) this weekend and we had an absolute blast. They aren't really drinkers and they don't allow alcohol in the rooms so that helped curb temptation. I learned that you don't need booze to sing like a superstar my friends!
Struggle \- Having added many responsibilities and activities since I stopped drinking I have been feeling stressed / anxious again and sleep has suffered. Also for really the first time in over 300 days I've been fantasizing about drinking wine. I didn't realize the warming weather would be such a trigger. Or maybe it's the fact that I am approaching a year? Anyway. Reading SD like a fiend and I feel safe for now. ..Triumph \- I am addressing the stress / sleep issues without alcohol and seeing some early success. Being alcohol\-free is a chance to learn how to manage things naturally. ..General \- I love that cartoon Mary. I will join you in not drinking today. 
**Struggle** Uncertainty about the future. Not knowing where I'll be in 6 months and having it not fully in control because it depends on SO's job is driving me kind of crazy and I think is at the bottom of all my nerves about my job and whatnot yesterday and today...**Triumph** According to my app I haven't had a drink in over 3000 hours now. That's a triumph in my world. And I'm doing pretty well with exercise too. :)..**General** Stormy weather here in central Minnesota. 
Struggle: Am I an alcoholic? Well I'm here aren't I? I've been lurking this sub for over a year now. I have trouble with moderation. It doesn't exist in my mind. Who drinks one glass of wine? Impossible! Always filled with regret shame and embarrassment the following morning. Always saying I'll never drink again but then I do anyways and the cycle repeats once again. I'm a binge drinker. That'll never change. So alcohol needs to vacate my life. But forever? Never drink again? ..Triumph: I'm on day two today. I've finally posted in this sub. I'm making healthy decisions for today and for my future...General: IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT! 
Struggle : I've been feeling extremely anxious about having many things on my plate. I've been seeing a counselor who has suggested I try daily meditation to deal with it. I tried it once but haven't since. Now that I'm typing this out the answer seems pretty simple: I'll be meditating later today...Triumph : I am taking the written citizenship test for the country that I reside in tomorrow. I'm both nervous but extremely proud that I've tackled my anxiety enough to get this far. ..Happy Wednesday!
IWNDWYT 
Going to see GI for chronic low belly pain whic started over a year ago after 2nd bout pancreatitis.  Using Nortryptilene for pain.  Side effects mild from med.  Going to drive2 hrs to see doc.  Doubt if anything will change..TRIUMPH - no alcohol for 2 full days!
Tomorrow I have a job interview. For the first time I am not just winging it. I've been working on responses to the 10 most common questions since Monday. I'm a little nervous about remembering the answers but I know if I read them over a few times I'll remember generally and can expand from there. I'm not sure if my winging it was related to drinking but I'm sure it played a part. I'm glad now to be clear headed enough to recognize my nervousness and try to combat it. The job does require a DL and I don't drive but I've decided to be honest with them play up my superior education \(I have a BA and its minimum is a diploma/GED\) and hope for the best. I'm so happy I have my shit together enough now to prep for this. Whatever happens I badly need the interview practice. 
Struggle: I've been thinking a lot about suicide and death recently and I don't know why. On paper my life is a pretty good one but its like there is this giant gaping whole inside me that can't be filled. It's like there is this huge part of me that just doesn't give a fuck anymore and just wants to lay day in a hole somewhere and die. The weird part is i don't even want to drink over this i just want to give up...Triumph: I ate ice cream and three full meals yesterday! Thats huge for me the last few weeks I haven't been eating much at all and ive been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia again so I'm super stoked...General: Time Out of Joint is better than Ubik. There i said it. Time Out of Joint is way more compelling in 25 pages than Ubic was at 230.
struggle: i am doing fairly well. i need to weed some toxic people out of my garden but it is truthfully less of an issue...triumph: killing it in the gym...general: i made it through memorial day only to have my birthday come up this weekend. i know i can do this i am just a little exhausted of all these celebrations that were usually soaked in alcohol. 
So yesterday was my first meeting. I wasn't sure what to expect going in but I met some wonderful people they were all so welcoming and I can't wait to go back again...Here's to day 5! IWNDWYT 
Stuggle: I'm not happy at my job at all. Been looking for a new one but so stressed out I can barely think sometimes. It got better for a couple weeks but now it's bad again. ..Triumph: made it through a long weekend without alcohol. Some cravings but not too bad. And my weight is coming down. ..General: I need to spend less money. Impulse bought a couple things and should be saving given my job situation.  
Had a great day then boom. My landlord called to arrange a survey on the house I rent. I bet he wants to sell. He said its just out of curiosity but he would say that. I've been fighting the whole month against illness my dog was ran over and my relationship is falling apart and I just want to give up and cry under the duvet with a bottle of wine. I won't know his intentions til next week. I have no idea what I'll do if he sells. It took me years to find a pet friendly rental. I'd be homeless before I lost my dog. Things were just starting to turn round too
Day 3 of sobriety for me. ..Struggle: Withdrawal has my stomach in a lurch today. ..Triumph: Threw away my corkscrew and wine stopper today. Gathered up my wine glasses to give away to a friend. Neither action has given me any pause. ..General: My friends have been really supportive. 
Life is shit. But I'm alive I'm sober therefore I can change that. And good  news is that I still need to pickup new AA chips bad news is that I dont go to the meeting anymore that gives them out and im in such a routine of my meetings that I like lol
Struggle: I'm 34 days sober &amp; on the cusp of major life changes. I am moving back home to another country tomorrow morning &amp; my husband of 10 years has separated from me. He said he will keep trying &amp; is in contact but he needs me to learn to be good to myself before we can attempt living together again. I understand as I can see I was unbearable but it's still hard what I've done &amp; missing him. So part of the struggle is to resume the work I've been doing here (AA therapy being physically active being social) &amp; try to add to it bit by bit at home. &amp; hope that in addition to me actually feeling better &amp; doing better he will be see &amp; believe in my new found self-acceptance...Triumph: I am proud that I am moving alone &amp; getting over my panic about everything making sound decisions &amp; problem solving. I used to get so overwhelmed organizing movers packing what step to do next the terror of the change &amp; uncertainty etc....&amp; in the past I'd pity myself &amp; drink &amp; make him come to my aid etc. I'm surprised how much more manageable my emotions are becoming without drinking since for the longest time I felt drinking was managing them. It's a triumph to see that was dead wrong...
**S:** It makes me nuts how easily distracted I am.  I'm fairly certain I have ADD but I *really* don't want to take meds for it.  But forgetting things seems to be getting worse I am reacting instead of planning and I have a million unfinished projects.  Luckily I have a focused GF who is kicking my ass into shape bit by bit in this area...**T:**  Had a fantastic Memorial Day race and spent the rest of the day meandering through a bookstore and eating a delicious meal with said GF.  A fantastic very sober and uplifting day!  And I forgot how yummy virgin margaritas are!..**G:** I'm really looking forward to finishing projects and having more time for relaxing weekends and fun trips.  Adulting is a skill I am learning late in life (thanks booze!) but I shall persevere!
Struggle : worked in a new area today and we had some really poorly patients in theatre was hard work but I coped and helped the team  ..Triumph : drove straight past my usual liquor stores on the way home and iwndwyt!! ..General : I've not stopped eating all day and am now cooking again but who cares   none of those calories will be wasted on alcohol!!
I'm about to commit to my first family vacation since quitting wine.  I'm totally terrified but I feel like I have to do it to move forward.  Thank you to everyone for helping me get to this point \- even just a few months ago I would have sworn it could never happen.  I am so happy to have been proven wrong!
I'd like to do this...I am an expat much of the get together revolve around drinking. Also work can be stressful and without too many other avenues of relaxation drinking it's often involved...These seem like excuses and they probably are but I've tried. So I'd really like your support.
Struggle: I blacked out for 4 days. I bought 3 beers. Then suddenly it was 4 days later and I had 3 empty 1.5Ls of vodka instead. I dunno. Also I deleted all of my text and call history on several different apps (drunk me learns to hide from sober me) so I can't even imagine what I did during those days. ..Triumph: I made it 42 days last time so I don't have to think of a new goal until day 43. Gives me time to build up that steel resolve. ..General: Day 2.5 and I'm still having the visual withdrawal symptoms (things moving things not actually being there... Like specks of lint or whatever that move around in a totally unnatural way) so if I can sleep tonight some point tomorrow afternoon my eyes will straighten out. My stomach is okay I can eat. ..I don't know what happened. I think I might have tried to change too many things too quickly? Maybe stress because fam is visiting soon. ..Note: I have a therapist (no meds) and she's very nice. I like her. But she moved buildings so I haven't been in 3 weeks. I'm scared to drive to new places. ..Also I've never posted here. Sorry about the username haha. Before the 42 days I think the longest I was sober was like 10 days. Just long enough to withdraw feel human clean the whole house and then go again. I've been like this for like 3 years? ..Started with a terrible job I actually still have nightmares about 
I will not drink today. 
2018 days!!
I was so busy being super pregnant I missed my own soberversary! Happy 6 years to me!
S: I'm afraid that I won't be able to reach out to my family when I'm struggling because I don't want to burden them even though it isn't true. ..T: I survived physical withdrawal for the first time. I took initiative opened up to my family and told them a lot of horrible things I've done while under the influence. I know that I have a great support system and I don't have to do this alone. And I'm 15 hours sober! It isn't a lot but it's more than I had yesterday. 
Struggle: I relapsed again on another addiction :(..Triumph: I made a connection to play paintball with turned a double play in a softball game and had a lot of nice conversations throughout the week...General: I'm feeling a bit unstable at the moment. A lot of good things are happening and I'm having a lot of positive life revelations which are great but also overwhelming.
I wish I had had time to check out your post this morning u/sfgirlmary. It would have saved me a lot of trouble if I had remembered today was Wednesday not Tuesday.  
Struggle: I have no desire to drink but I'm trying to get involved in AA. The amount of people pushing 90 in 90 is insane and honestly I think trying to go to a meeting every day while maintaining other relationships work and exercise is unrealistic and setting yourself up for failure. I think going 3x a week is still a lot and will be more effective since I won't be throwing the good things away in my life. Yet the people I'm getting phone numbers from are constantly texting me and guilt tripping me and I'm setting boundaries but I'm not sure what to tell them. I'm not doing myself any favors by running myself ragged.  I'm not depending on the program to keep sober since I still have a lot of healthy things in my life and I don't want to give up things like going for a long bike ride and doing chores to sit in a room every single fucking day. ..Triumph: I'm feeling like being sober is giving me the ability to tackle my problems day by day with a clear mind and sound body. I make a plan for the day and follow it.  My weekly plan has everything laid out that I need to do which means I may not make it to a meeting everyday (see above) but it means things aren't hopeless and every day that passes get me in the right direction. ..General: Dogs are awesome. Birds are awesome. Pets are amazing if you choose to have one in your life. I'm grateful I live in a really positive supportive household.
