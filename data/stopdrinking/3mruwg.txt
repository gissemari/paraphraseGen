I've patched together a little over 2 weeks after a year-long relapse. It's been hard but this sub Reddit is helping me remember the terrible cost of my drinking.  I still can't bring myself to go to meetings (I had 18 years sober in the program before) but I think I'm getting closer to it...Thank you.

Nice job on two weeks.  Wanting to get a couple weeks myself.
Congratulations on your 2 weeks!
You will know when the time is right to go to a meeting. It took me 6 years to attend my second one but that night I just knew I had to. You shouldn't pressure yourself if you aren't ready. Good luck friend keep fighting the good fight...Edit: a word

Was your life better in the program than during the relapse?  I could assume that's the case since you're going back to sobriety but I thought I'd ask.
