At a meeting last thursday I went up to one of the guys who I got along with and asked if he'd be willing to be my sponsor. Surprise surprise he said yes and we had our first meeting today I got a big book and a twelve by twelve and some homework on step one. Still feeling a little tentative about the AA thing and it's still a struggle but I'm so happy to be on this road and every step feels like an actual accomplishment. I just wanted to share with you guys how helpful everyone has been and how much I'm actually digging this recovery thing...Here's to today!
