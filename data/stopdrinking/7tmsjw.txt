My brother-in-law is bipolar.  He "self-medicates" with alcohol he also does coke and other harder drugs somewhat regularly.  He has refused to take his medication or seek any kind of therapy or treatment for over a year and it has been a nightmare.  He has been getting blackout drunk regularly and he has been burning bridges with everyone who's ever cared about him or tried to help him.  ..A close friend of mine also has a bipolar relative and said that in a support class he took for family members the counselor mentioned that people seem to stay the same age they were when they START abusing substances.  So in my brother-in-law's case he was in high school so according to this theory he has been hovering around 14-15 years-old emotionally.  It seems accurate - he is emotional moody highly insecure struggles with his identity and almost always ends up prioritizes partying and getting laid over healthy mutually respectful relationships...I started drinking heavily in my mid-twenties and continued for about five years.  I wonder if during that time I had the same maturity as a kid just out of college?..I'm wondering if other people have thoughts on this or their experiences match it.  To any of you out there coping with mental illness or a mentally ill relative I feel your pain it such an awful battle to have to fight.

My brother is schizo affective and has been self medicating for decades with booze and drugs. He also refuses to take his meds even after being put on psych holds. .I realized part of my disease was drinking over anxiety I have and had to get help as part of my recovery. .I definitely think the two are connected and it's a harder road for those of us who also have separate mental illnesses.
