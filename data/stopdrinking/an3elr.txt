Hi all! Sorry for the throwaway several people know my other username and I'm not comfortable sharing this with them. I have been lurking for about a year and have had several (very short) failed sobriety attempts in the past. I've not come close to rock bottom yet but I've realized for a while now that alcohol is quickly becoming an issue for me and I need to nip this addiction ASAP before I reach that point and do something I regret. My brother dad and grandpa are alcoholics so I know it runs in my family. I've slowly been increasing the amount I drink for the past 8 years since I turned 21 to a point that I'm uncomfortable with. Going to work hungover has begun to impact my job and my life and that is not okay with me!..On top of all of the negative effects alcohol has on life I have several autoimmune issues and I know that the alcohol exaggerates those immensely. I've decided to take the leap and stop drinking to improve my life and my health. Today is my 4th day sober and I had to share! This sober weekend was my first in probably 6+ years. I'm already feeling a bit more clear headed and focused. Last night was one of the best nights of sleep in a while. I really struggled on Saturday night but was SO proud of myself when I woke up Sunday morning feeling great!..IWNDWYT :)
