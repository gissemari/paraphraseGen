Getting sober solo hasn't worked. And every relapse is getting worse. So i decided to go to a doctor about it today. Apparently I've been having borderline severe withdrawals. Also have a thiamine and folic acid deficiancy from the booze that is causing vertigo and balance problems. So the doctor signed me up for an outpaitent detox so they can keep and eye on my vitals. Got prescribed gabapentin and some heavy duty barbituate to get me through the wothdrawals. So i won't even be able to drive for the next 4 days apparently...Its crazy. I knew my health wasn't good but i didn't relaize i was that bad off. But heres to hoping getting medical help will give me more sucessful results. ..Back on day 1. IWNDWYT

Glad you're getting help. I hope everything works out for you!
That's exactly what I did and I was prescribed the same medications. It made a huge difference. Good luck!
