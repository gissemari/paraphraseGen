Last night after 5 months of sobriety I made the rookie mistake of believing I could have one or two casual drinks with a friend over dinner. Of course that "one or two" turned into an entire cask of wine before passing out at 5am. .I woke up this morning with a pounding headache and a lot of anxiety but also the realisation of how much I have not missed feeling like this. Honestly hard to believe how I could do this to myself every weekend and still be counting down the days until I could do it all over again. .Although I am feeling disappointed in myself spending my only day off this week bedridden and sick has helped me to see how much happier and productive I have been since I stopped drinking and really cemented that I made the right choice 5 months ago when I decided that alcohol was no longer for me.

Just take this as a reminder of how HORRIBLE drinking is and go on to the next day. Isn't it crazy what we put our bodies through every day?!
I really admire how quickly you have realised this and jumped back on the wagon! I always seemed to use it as an excuse "ah I have to reset my badge anyway might as well go out for a cure". Fair play to you! 
Look at it not as a failure but a reminder of how great sobriety is...IWNDWYT 
It takes what it takes. Thanks for coming back and helping me stay sober today. 
I did this too. A high ABV drink left in my garage fridge led to a casual drink while mowing. It was so refreshing I started drinking up all the old leftovers we haven't finished in the past year. Once I ran out of that I went inside and hit the booze. Next morning I woke up with shorts on smelling of booze and yard work and forgetting how I got there. ..Overwhelming depression has hit me like a freight train. I knew I should have just stayed away.
