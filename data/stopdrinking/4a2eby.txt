Hi everyone..First timer here. I'm a 25 year old guy and have had problems with alcohol since my first breakdown with friends when I was 17. I'm living with my parents and manage to work a full time job but I spend money too freely especially going out for drinks and weekending at bars and the like. I've been out of the house a few times bounced around some schools without any real direction and I feel as though I'm stuck in an eternal rut that to escape requires major changes in my lifestyle yet I have been unable to make those changes. I last lived on the beach in california and my habitual drinking sent me spiraling into a depression that ended with me waving the white flag and coming home. I struggle with depression as it is and my emotional sensitivity is something I've never been able to get a handle on and allow myself to grow and become the person I want to be. Alcohol is stealing my attention. It's peppered itself so seamlessly over my life that I've never really had a clear understanding of how much it is affecting me on every level. I've been through 7 weeks of a rehab program that worked for about a week. I cant seem to replace my old habits well enough or fast enough to stay clean. no matter how frustrated I get beer has always won...I feel weak. I feel secondary and I feel hated. The person who hates me the most though is me. Today I'm hoping I found my final source of inspiration and motivation to really rid myself of the vice grip that is alcohol addiction. One of my closest friends someone I consider a brother told me that he can no longer be apart of my self-destructive life. He said he can't be my friend and not be an enabler at the same time. He said that when we came back from California he thought I was going to make changes but instead I continued to drink and let the alcohol determine my decisions. I said I wasn't happy to hear that but it wasn't my decision to make and that I'd let him know when I'm on a better and clearer path. He said he hoped I would. I'm still struggling to process this situation and to understand how I feel about it. I can honestly say though that I've never been more desperate to rid this from my life and I've never truly had a clearer perspective of the external strife my problem has created...I want to do good things. I want to be stable. I want to love everyone. I want to be able to support myself and support others. I want I want to be satisfied with my time spent here on earth when I'm lying in my deathbed. I'm thinking the drink might be a good place to start. I have so much to vent but I don't want to leave a giant wall of text so I thought I'd say hello. Thanks for reading I'm going to bed in hopes that today will be my day #1 and that I'll never have to say that again.

Change can be difficult but you sound ready. I think focusing on what you want- to do good things be stable to love. Are you ready to be loved? It's easy to beat ourselves up over the past. ..You say you are in hope that today will be day #1 - it's my day 1. ..Recognizing the need for change is a good first step. I wish I could wave a magic wand over us both but I guess that it be too easy. Go for it! Reach out for the life that you want for yourself. You deserve it- a life full of good things.
