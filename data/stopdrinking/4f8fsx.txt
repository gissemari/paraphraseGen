Hey guys. Last time I quit I didn't do AA or any other IRL support groups. I just wasn't ready yet. I am feeling more open to it this go around and am making an effort at finding meetings but I'm struggling. I live in one of the biggest cities in the US and am completely overwhelmed by all the different meetings available. They all have different names and I have no clue what they mean. I got the Addicaid app which has meeting maps but it is kind of glitchy and doesn't give enough filter criteria to be helpful for me (I'd like to be able to find women's-only meetings for example). I am also open to non-12-step meetings (e.g. Women for Sobriety) and have no idea where to even start looking for those. Help?

For WFS I think you email them asking about meeting locations. They didn't have any in my area but if you're in a large US City you've got decent odds of finding a meeting: http://womenforsobriety.org/beta2/contact/..For AA my experience was to just start going to meetings that were at a convenient location for me and asking the other attendees for recommendations. Be prepared to try a range of meetings to find a good fit. In my area the meeting list is online and indicates which meetings are women only...
Smart recovery probably has a meeting where you are.  
Lucky you! I'm not kidding. I probably would have found a much better fit with AA if I had a ton of different meetings to choose from. Seems lots of folks on here are agnostic/atheist don't know if you are but big cities often have special AA groups for them which might help narrow it down. Best wishes!
I recently downloaded the Addicaid app too. I'm actually finding it to be really quite enjoyable(the community) and I have been able to find a couple stellar meetings in my area.  .I hope you find what you need and good luck in recovery!
