I got home from the wedding and submitted a topic here because i was happy that i managed everything sober and needed a little encouragement from you guys...Thanks for your words and for this wonderful community. One day at a time....I'm bummed a little that since our last conversation (after i relapsed and we got both really drunk) my girlfriend said she would stop drinking too. She felt horrible the day after said it was not good for her because she was still recovering from surgery and she learned that moderation is something that doesn't work...A little background: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2vv3rr/another_relapse_i_think_i_need_to_stay_sober_or/...Well she drank at the wedding (one week after my relapse and our conversation). It was like 7 glasses of beer but i could see if i wasn't around she would've drank more. I didn't say anything not a single a word because i knew she said she was going to stop because of me. She didn't want to lose me so she will do anything she doesn't want to do to keep me around but less than one month later she is doing again...**I knew this was coming**. At the wedding she kept staring at the beer said she was craving one and some minutes after she already found us some place to crash (another bridesmaid that we didn't ever know the wedding was at another city) *JUST IN CASE* we decided to drink...You guys know how tempting this is? You are at your early days sober "suffering" through a wedding at ANOTHER CITY and your girlfriend who said she would stop with you says she found some place to crash JUST IN CASE we got drunk? At this point i was absolutely certain that i would drink one guy at our table asked with i wanted **i said yes** and he poured me a glass. I stared at it... stared... but i kept the glass full. It was like having Scarlett Johanson dancing naked in front of you wearing a chastity belt. **Takes A LOT of willpower.**..Anyway... i noticed my girlfriend was starting to pick up the pace and filling her glass fast. I didn't say a word i kept to myself. This is my sobriety i will take care of myself and my problem...**She said that before.** She can drink casually and stop and it's ok for her. (Less than one week later she was getting really drunk with me when i relapsed and got a lot of stomach pain because she got a liposuction one month ago and is recovering).So i kept to myself and focused on my sobriety...She was already rationalizing drinking when she found us a place to crash for the night...Anyway here i am safe and sober...I feel sad to be the boring guy holding her back and saying she needs to stop so i didn't say anything and won't say anything. ..**She said after we got home: You're a little boring but that's ok because i'm little annoying too.** (Her words)..Coming from my girlfriend this really hits me...I know i'm not the most extroverted guy when sober and it's my early days. I don't have the social maturity to handle things sober yet so i just keep quiet and talk to people when they talk to me...In my work i talk to everyone sober all the time but i have a hard time knowing new people specially at a wedding when everyone is drunk and the music is loud...But you know what guys? In the past i would get hurt (i was) and start an argument. I don't know if i was just tired of explaining the problems that drinking was causing me the things that i'll have to endure now that i'm trying to be sober and that this is really new to me. I need to rebuild my life my mind everything now that i'm handling life without binge drinking in every social gathering. But i am just tired of explaining and i didn't say anything...At this point i was thinking about coming back to drink again to be the drama-filled drunk boyfriend that she found fun. I stopped my thoughts there and went to sleep..I don't want to talk to her about everything again i'm tired...At least i'm sober today and will keep that way.

Wow. I'm really impressed by your fortitude. Well done on staying sober at what seems like an incredibly tempting event...You showed a lot of strength by not getting into it with your girlfriend.  Keep that up too. ..Thanks for sharing this really is awesome.
Hey I'm glad you stayed sober. I've seen your posts before about the upcoming wedding...As far as your girlfriend - she isn't going to stop drinking for you. So you just have to do what's best for you and let things happen in time. I think most people would say when they stop drinking "for" someone or to hold on to someone it didn't work. You've decided to stop drinking for yourself and for all of the reasons that you've articulated through your posts over the months...until she has that same awakening for herself this will likely be a constant battle...Good job again on staying sober at that wedding!..Edit: To add that the more time I get sober the more I realize around people who are getting drunk how boring *they* are. I've been making a lot more sober friends or hanging out with people I see drink *maybe* two drinks once a week or so and I am having SO much fun. I'm an introvert and I feel uncomfortable now around drunk people NOT because I'm not being as extroverted as they are or because it looks like they're having "fun" but because I find them to be obnoxious and I'd just rather find other ways to spend my time.
You are doing great. ..&gt;I need to rebuild my life my mind everything now that i'm handling life ..Great insight. Hang in there. 
I have been to many parties sober and people are much more interesting to me at the beginning than they are towards the end. I don't need alcohol to be sincere. I'm very comfortable having quiet conversations and connecting with people as deeply as they need...If I feel that any person is a threat to my sobriety I avoid them as much as possible. For me this is about staying alive and if someone cannot accept that then they obviously don't care about my well being.
Keep the focus on yourself.  She can not make you quit you can not make her quit.  Ideally you could help each other but they requires synchronization similar to putting that lander on the comet.  And to a certain extent the universe has to help a little...../r/alanon might help but at 7 days you are likely still dealing with pitch yaw and roll of your own vessel.  ..Consider a peer program such as Smart or AA to help with all of it including the people stuff... oh and good job staying sober.....
Three things:..1. Holy crap nice job on not drinking at that wedding!  That's really impressive.  ..2. You'll never have any success tying your sobriety to someone else's.  It dilutes responsibility and makes it way too easy to relapse.  Quit for you and stay quit for you.  Don't worry about your girlfriend's habits.  ..3. Drunk people are boring.  If you need alcohol to have a good time you're probably not doing anything fun.  Spending your weekend nights sitting in bars or in somebody's living room having circular nonsense conversations and your weekend days nursing hangovers is just about the least interesting thing I can imagine.  When a drunk person calls you boring for not drinking it's code for "you're making me feel bad about my drinking."
Good job! I would just like to give you a little reassurance. I am pretty introverted and stick to myself as well. I think part of my drinking was to be a little more outgoing when I went out (I would get sloshed at weddings in the past). I am still struggling with the "being boring" phase of sobriety but when I see my friends talking about coming home to visit and meeting up with each other it is actually pretty pathetic how that goes and I am not judging because I was the same way only 6 months ago. Watching it from a sober perspective is shocking all it is about is getting hammered not about catching up and enjoying each other's company. .."At this point i was thinking about coming back to drink again to be the drama-filled drunk boyfriend that she found fun. I stopped my thoughts there and went to sleep. I don't want to talk to her about everything again i'm tired."..I will be the one to come in here and say it if this keeps up long term and is endangering your sobriety you know that you will have to start thinking about distancing yourself. I am proud that you weren't hurt but I was put out just reading about the lack of support and I wouldn't want to be dealing with that kind of pressure long term. 
First off great job. .I have some good friends' weddings coming up in the summer and don't know what I am going to do. A wedding was the cause of my last relapse. ..Being boring is something I struggle with. For the past few months friends have told me I am boring stone cold sober but they would take that over my asshole self when totally loaded. HOWEVER I think you will turn a corner. Had a big night out with friends this weekend and they said to me towards the end of the night "wow you being sober are super engaging in the conversation and it's awesome." It gets better!.
Between you and the post about the guy's wife who's worried his sober life is too good I'm just thinking wtf is up with people? Kudos to you for sticking to your plan and not being derailed or triggered by this behaviour. You're right. It's YOUR recovery! (and you're right to feel pissed as well)
Hey there /u/h0ttentot. I really feel for you. Things are particularly difficult for you right now. Trying to negotiate your way through your sobriety with so many hurdles to jump over. Just keep doing what you are doing. Focus on your own sobriety that is all you can do right now. After that wedding you have shown so much strength of character. Day by day you will be clearer in your mind. Take care be kind to yourself you got this.
Well done!
