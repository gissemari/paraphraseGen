I'd say no.
No. You didn't know but obviously don't drink or eat another one. Keep going. 
No way you didn't know and I'm sure you didn't get buzzed off of it. If I had eaten half a delicious cupcake it would be hard for me to stop too lol. 
Of course not.  lol
I did this too. It's about intentions and you had no intention of drinking or useing alcohol. All clear.
No. I don't think so. Chalk it up and move on.
For myself I define relapse by what I did after the slip up. You didn't know regardless and you didn't use it as an excuse to accept failure and drink more. So you're doing great!
I no from my perspective. 
Did you get drunk off of a cupcake? I'm guessing not. No relapse.
Unless the taste set you off into drinking then no. No question. 
No
