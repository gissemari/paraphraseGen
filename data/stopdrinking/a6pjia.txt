Good morning SD friends..Sundays are my only completely free days and when I find alot of time to reflect on my new beloved lifestyle. I was a hard core drunk from  the age of 17 till just this past October I'm almost 30. After some terrible choices I made and some severe consequences that came along with those choices I made a change. It's been the best decision I've made in my lifetime. I have very very minimal cravings these days and that's been an incredible feeling for me. ..I am so happy to have found such an awesome support system here and I respect every one of you. For those still struggling my only words of wisdom are to stay strong and seek help. You have the power to make your life worth living and I am rooting for you! ..Have a great day all! IWNDWYT
