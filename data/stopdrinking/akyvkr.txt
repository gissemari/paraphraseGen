Today I am 689 days sober now ...English is not my first language so please forgive me for mistakes in advance...[I was recently featured in leading men's health magazine in India](https://www.mensxp.com/health/motivation/49778-31-days-of-fitness-from-being-a-chronic-alcoholic-to-reclaiming-his-life-back-gulit-rsquo-s-story-is-inspiring.html) ...&amp;#x200B;..My before after..1. [https://imgur.com/CfbXQrO](https://imgur.com/CfbXQrO).2. [https://imgur.com/a/kF3Mlq6](https://imgur.com/a/kF3Mlq6)..Had all the health problems under the sun from diabetes to thyroid to high blood pressure to low testosterone. There were frequent blackouts...The doctor told me if I don't change my lifestyle I will never be able to have a family of mine..... One of the main reasons of being alcoholic was I believe my insecurities and introvert behavior. I have been fat guy from as long as I remember. Been made fun of many times which increased my insecurities I was never comfortable being with people as I felt I am less of person then them. Food has temptations but alcohol is the mother of all temptations if you are an introvert fat guy with no social skills...Alcohol drinking got to a level that I had no friends. my family was exhausted by my drinking habits almost gave up on me.  Almost died few times  became voilent too got beat up many times. there were many times police came to my house. Got kicked out of the house.Having nowhere to go I decided to check myself in rehab...&amp;#x200B;..I always thought that I could control my alcohol drinking the **ILLUSION OF CONTROL** almost all of us addicts have we think we can control it anytime. With this illusion we keep going and we lie to ourselves that we can control it anytime we like...When I went to rehab I saw people of different age group as young as 17 to as old as 60 all suffering from one or other addiction...Some of them were really smart as in amazingly smart I wondered How some of them could have been something really big if it was not for alcohol also there were some people who were really big deal in past ruined their whole life without realizing it...&amp;#x200B;..Sadly Most of them believed they do not have a problem...The biggest step towards quitting for an addict is to understand they have THE PROBLEM. since you are already **Here** which means you are already towards your progress..Out of 100 people who came out of rehab I think only 10 might have been able to actually stay sober besides them 90% of them relapsed. Many of guys who came out of rehab I saw them using substance again not believing they had the problem and some started using it by getting carried away in the moment. I saw deaths of few. only if somehow I could have helped them realize that it indeed is problem and we are helpless against it they were amazingly one of the smartest people I ever met...When I got out I decided I wouldn't be ending up as same again. I understood that I had this problem it was part of me I did not have control over it for that purpose I will follow few rules...As I see it I think the 3 top causes for it for me were..1. Loneliness - I was alone. No one to care for love for i wanted to fill that emptiness and alcohol completed me without needing anything else...2.Boredom - Loneliness also leads to boredom and believe it or not boredom is one of biggest reasons alcohol consumption in us addicts...3. Depression - everything sucks and everything hurts alcohol made me feel good ...&amp;#x200B;..What I realized that my loneliness Depression and Boredom all 3 were connected with my insecurities..and One of my biggest insecurities I had was I believed I was fat and ugly. So i decided instead of taking help of alcohol lets try the less traveled path. So I decided to do something that could help me grow improve make me feel good. I realized fitness was best solution because it also could help me fight my insecurities and beat my loneliness and depression. Might meet someone which would help with loneliness more...In the beginning my main goal was to be healthy tho with all the health problems from diabetes to high blood pressure to thyroid I wanted to beat them all...Once I decided working out I realized every time I worked it really helped me with depression too helped me feel better about myself. I decided to take it up a notch and work on what I ate so I could get most effect of what I was eating...The diet part is same as universal the calorie counting . I followed the same route calories in and calories out What I mostly did is kept high protein (150 -250 grams) low fat (50 Grams) and least carbs diet... But refeed carbs in every weekend just made sure that go big surplus...Also keeping diet on made me realize I was more addicted to food then alcohol...I created a value system. If you don't eat good food for 6 months in diet trust me the cake becomes yummiest thing on planet and you don't even remember alcohol because all you think about is pizza . And your relapse is ice cream cake...What I realized are the rules that apply to staying sober and quitting alcoholism also fit perfectly with weight loss and clean diet. Though cutting diet way easier if you have had alcohol problem..SO WHAT DID I LEARN? (Below Part I have already [shared](https://np.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/9662zz/from_alcoholic_obese_to_fit_lifestyle_sharing/) in r/Loseit)..***ONE DAY AT TIME***..First Apply this motto - When you wake up in morning say this to yourself I WONT DRINK TODAY NO MATTER WHAT. Don't think about tomorrow or day after tomorrow just today no matter whatever temptation comes! you will not give in to it. (do this daily every morning) After few months in gets in your habit so don't worry it gets easier...Later when you are comfortable with one day at time Alcohol problem start with one day at time diet process and after that add TODAY I WILL GO TO GYM DAILY NO MATTER WHAT. but keep it slow and steady don't want to mess it all up in hurry the process took me months...There are few factors which could help you with one day at a time program and help you avoid getting carried way...***1. Serneity -*** Either you are quitting alcohol or trying to have disciplined proper diet in your life. The serenity of mind is most important. If your mind is not at peace then you can not concentrate on anything which includes having right meals..so if you want to lose weight or improve your health most important is the serenity of your mind...Most of people can't keep up with diet or stay sober not because they do not want to but because they get carried away in life. Which can only be avoided by discipline and to have spline you certainly need peace of mind or its all chaos...The cycle goes something like this..Some incident happens (Fight with a friend Boss yells at youBreak UpPromotionETC ...) ==&gt; We start thinking about it ==&gt; We overthink it ==&gt; Converts it into feeling (Upset or Sad or too excited or too angry) ==&gt; That Feeling converts in action DRINK Alcohol/EAT Unhealthy stuff to feel better..**How not to lose your serenity** \- As the prayer says it is very simple and very difficult at the same time..At the time when any incident happens ask yourself if you can do anything about it to change it if Yes! then change it and if no then let it go show acceptance and move on. Don't hold it and carry it's burden on your mind because it will eat up your serenity and which will lead you to eating cake in the fridge. Got fired? See if you can get the job back if not let it go and you will find new one don't keep holding onto and letting it bother you...***2.HARDCORE HONESTY*** \- First Step is understanding your problem either it is alcohol or eating junk unless you agree that you have a problem you will not be able to fix it.but if you are here already that means you already know you have this weight problem...When we were children we were told to stay honest with yourself and others. But as we grew up we learned the methods of the world and started with small dishonesty like taking someone's pen and saying we have not taken it (Just an example not saying yall are thieves). Then that dishonesty grew slow n steady and it got to a level that **we started becoming dishonest to ourselves**...My alcoholism was killing me but I would tell myself that I will quit it soon it is not that bad yet. Knowing full well I was not being honest to myself. I would say one drink won't hurt my body and then I will drink the whole bottle and think I won't do it from tomorrow knowing it very well that i will be doing it again tomorrow...One day I realized that It doesn't matter whatever I say I will be doing it tomorrow and then I went to rehab. Started avoiding pubs and clubs or people who could get me carried away and relapse. Once you know that this is your problem figure out who are the main culprits that get you carried away.Try staying away from those things slow and steady...Be honest you are hurting your body and you know it. But More then that You are hurting your self-confidence You are losing the battle against it **YOU ARE WEAK** accept it! and be honest about it...Once you have accepted the truth you know you are weak against it and you will give it a real fight. you will really work on improving yourself making yourself stronger then IT...***3.Become Selfish -*** If you are not selfish then you stop caring about what is best for you. If you are selfish you consider your health your life and your progress before any other thing. If you are selfish about your body then you do what is best for it...Most importantly be selfish about your serenity. No matter who or what no one is worth your serenity your friend or family or colleague no one. If you have your serenity with you will be better person to them. If they really love you they will understand it too...***4.Be shallow -*** People pretend and say looks don't matter much but it does! everyone judges you on your appearance until they get to know you. Be shallow about how you look rate your appearance out of 10...Say you have dark circles and since you are one shallow person who judges themselves by their look you will try get rid of it..and to do that you will try get 8 hours sleep and all minerals vitamins which actually leads to healthy lifestyle...***5.Be Vain -*** You should be your favorite. You should love yourself most. Love your body try make it best looking and healthiest in the room. Obsesses about yourself. If you don't love yourself that means you don't respect yourself and which means no one will respect you. If you love yourself most and if you are doing best for your body then your body will make you feel good about yourself and help you boost your confidence...After all this transformation I saw people looked at me differently they loved my positive attitude and they wanted to know my story that also helped me with my introvert part. Since I felt like i look good I was more open I could talk freely be out there be less afraid of rejections. I met an amazing girl she liked my lifestyle story and **I AM NO MORE SINGLE** which helped a lot more to fight the loneliness and depression part too having someone caring for you  The depression still comes time to time very difficult to handle but the trick is not give in...&amp;#x200B;..TL:DR - Life is way better without alcohol.

This is one of the best things I have ever read thank you 
That's awesome. Good for you. I hope to follow your lead. I'm currently trying to get my diet going and trying to eat less and better. It's tough but not drinking alcohol definitely helps since it adds so many calories!
&gt; If you don't eat good food for 6 months in diet trust me the cake  becomes yummiest thing on planet and you don't even remember alcohol  because all you think about is pizza . And your relapse is ice cream  cake. ..&amp;#x200B;..Haha!  Love this!  I relapsed on my diet on Thursday night by eating 2 chocolate bars... but it was either that or go grab beer downstairs at the hotel.  I'm happy with my decision.  :)..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks for sharing your story.  ..&amp;#x200B;
Very inspirational keep it up man
"Be Vain" I love this.  Obviously there is a point where this is not beneficial BUT (!!!) I think it is hugely beneficial to be vain when we lose weight and begin seeing results because it is hugely motivating!  I am on my own weight loss journey and I frequently look at my body's changes because it encourages and motivates me :)  Congratulations on your journey you look great!  IWNDWYT
