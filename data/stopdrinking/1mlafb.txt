I really felt like I was going to drink this weekend. My bf moved away and broke up with me because he didn't want a long distance relationship. I'm pretty broken-hearted...I was invited to a surprise birthday party on Saturday night and would know only the birthday girl. My meditation group was having a get together the same night. I chose the meditation group thing and I'm glad I made that decision because it was around this time 3 years ago that I relapsed after having almost 3 years of sobriety...I was disconnected and isolated and drinking was the only thing I felt like I could look forward to...I'm glad I've set up supports in my life that I can count on today...I wish you all well in your journeys and if you ever want to talk PM me!..edit: changed LDR to long distance relationship.

Woo!  Congrats on 1002 days!!!
I had to look up "LDR".  Sorry about your relationship...Good call on skipping the party.  If the birthday girl knows you well I'm sure she understands...Keep up the good work and hopefully the best will come out of the change in your relationship...Congrats on 1000+ days!
Doing this alone and isolated makes us especially vulnerable.  Have you been going to meetings a - smart AA whatever?
Fair play to you.  Sorry to hear about the boyfriend but thankfully you didn't need to drink.  It takes time to be able to deal with stuff like that.  Hopefully I'll make it to where you are one day at a time.
Congrats--it's like a thousand+ giant steps! 
I'm inspired by you. Thanks.
