I've tried to stop drinking in the past. I've had some success (3 and 6 months of sobriety respectively) but have continuously fallen into the "I can handle this" trap. I can't handle this. About 8 years ago I had a gastric bypass before which I never had problems with alcohol. A friend tried to warn me about the rates of alcoholism post op but I was too absorbed in the stomach staple mill. I recovered well but the side effects (quicker absorption getting wasted on one drink) have kept up. I admit I have a problem with drinking. I know I didn't used to I know I do now and I'm so angry with myself for not having the foresight to avoid it. Even through all the rage and self hatred I know I can't drink. So today my struggle continues but I'm struggling to better myself and my life. I'm glad there is support out there.

Hey I'm only a few days ahead of you and this is actually my first go at it! Let's do it together!..No matter what we're not drinking! :)
Some of us road that roller coaster a lot longer before we decided to get off. Last time doesn't matter. All that matters is not drinking today.
