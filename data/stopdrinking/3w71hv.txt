Happy Thursday sobernauts!..Thankful Thursdays is a weekly thread here where we can focus and reflect on what we are grateful for. I'll include something on thankfulness and invite y'all to take a moment to reflect on what you are grateful for **today**.....---..**Thankful quotes:**..>*Stress is caused by being 'here' but wanting to be 'there'*..and..>*The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but thought about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Separate them from the situation which is always neutral. It is as it is.*..~ *Eckhart Tolle*..What I get from this: yesterday was a tough day for me I was in a car crach in the morning and struggled through anxiety for much of the day. "*This too will pass*" got me through the day. By the evening I recognised and saw the anxiety for what it was and how I was beating myself up for the past and worrying about the future. Instead it is important that I see that "here" is ok. The past can't be changed only learnt from; the present is where I am; the future I will tackle when it presents itself. I..I have so much to be grateful for in the present today. I'm thankful that noone was hurt I am thanful for insurance I am thankful for the kindness of strangers I am thankful for routine I am thankful for the trust I have in myself for getting through adversity....---..**So r/stopdrinking**..**What are you grateful for today?**

Hope you are ok from the car crash! Glad that you got through. ..Today I am thankful that I am starting to get comfortable in my own skin and that I'm getting kind of ok with boredom. I've been hanging out at home by myself quite a bit lately and I've really enjoyed it. I'm not obsessing about what I'm missing or spending money. You will be seeing a bit more of me in the IRC because I'm happily sitting at home and watching TV! 
Gosh I hope you are OK /u/finally_woken.  When I was injured over the summer I was so grateful that alcohol played no role.  
Thank you for this post! I'm sorry to hear about your car accident...I am grateful for my fiance who has always seen the best me even though she's been hiding behind lazy self-centered me for a long time. I am grateful for my family who support me when I need help and keep guilt-trips about length of time between phone calls to a minimum. I am grateful for my job which though stressful allows a great deal of creativity and self-direction in my chosen field. And I am grateful to have found this online community ten days ago! This community has given me a lot to think about regarding the value of sobriety and the way I have been using alcohol to cope with emotional stressors rather than finding healthy ways to deal with life. I may have been able to stop drinking for these past ten days without this community but it would not have meant anywhere near as much...So THANK YOU! :)
I am thankful that my NOW is pretty good and that I am learning tools to improve my THERE...I'm glad your crash want more serious. Nice job handling g the emotions. Anxiety fear worry are all normal after something like that. Magnifying dwelling or getting stuck in those feels seems to be where we get into trouble. Letting them pass watching them pass coming back to Now... Nicely done.
I am grateful for my struggles as well as my blessings 
I am grateful for a kind partner I am grateful for my job I am grateful for my friend family. 
I am grateful for you being okay. ..I am thankful for only a few more days of working 0400 until 2100. I am thankful for my sister and LaCroix and the dopest Christmas celebration we will be having on Sunday. I am thankful for my goofiness and hectic lifestyle. 
Whew glad to hear you're OK grateful even!..Today besides my sobriety which I am of course most grateful for I'm actually grateful for the great deal of suffering I experienced over 21 years ago because it lead to a huge change in the way I live my life that has so far given me my best years. Suffering was unfortunately what it took to get my attention to wear down my old ideas and cause a transformation in me that's as stark as a caterpillar becoming a butterfly (except the caterpillar had it better than me and I still can't fly yet!). It's neat to see things that I could only dream of while sitting on a barstool become real. I'm grateful that sobriety has given me the ability to take something that starts out as a thought and turns it into something useful positive and productive.
oh how scary I'm glad you are ok! thank you for the quotes and your perspective on anxiety...right now I'm grateful for my body. it is not perfect right down to my genetic code and causes me much anger and frustration. I'll write about it someday. but you know what? my lungs breathe involuntarily. my stomach digests delicious food. my small intestine turns that into energy. my arm and leg muscles move around to pick things up and walk great places. right now my heart is pumping 4.7 liters of blood through my veins. the human body is a marvel and even when part of it is broken it still deserves respect and gratitude. 
Glad you weren't seriously hurt...I am grateful for the patience of my partner for my A+ cuddling kitten for the snotty kitten for my jobs even when I don't enjoy them but mostly I'm grateful that it's my day off today.
