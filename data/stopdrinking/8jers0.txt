My close friend from college got married on Saturday and my best friend was invited as well. We see each other a few times a year always get obliterated together...Best friend and I had previously talked a bit about my struggle to moderate and my extremely poor health but I barely remember those conversations as they were over the phone between binge-drinking sessions...So the whole drive over I was anxious on  missing out  with the guys. I wanted to be included dammit!..My best friend was so understanding. We always rib each other hard but we talked seriously about it all. And that was that! The rest of the night and next day were some of the best moments I've shared with him...Sorry if it's incoherent but it's difficult to put it all into a cohesive story without getting into unnecessary detail...If anybody is out there worried about a special event the take-away is that I was worried about having fun without drinking but I had MORE fun because I WASN'T drinking!..Thanks for reading!

I love the theme that I keep reading here and have now experienced for myself... not drinking does NOT mean "missing out" on anything (except regrets and hangovers!)  It seems sobriety enhances life rather than harms it.  Thanking the universe and this place that it didn't take me any longer than it did to learn this.  Way to go on not drinking finding honest support in a friend and staying STRONG!  IWNDWYT
I am starting to feel anxious about traveling and going to a wedding next week and seeing this was such a great boost! I love seeing folks not just "getting through" typical drinking events sober but actually enjoying them more because they are sober. Way to go and thank you for sharing! ..IWNDWYT
