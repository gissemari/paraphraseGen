I relapsed last night. I don't understand completely why. I have been having a very hard time at work (completely overloaded and often up until 11 1 am 2 am working) at home but yesterday was a good day. I made it through so many bad days just to relapse and ruin a good one. It was uncomfortable and awful and my anxiety is through the roof now. When will I stop learning this lesson?..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT.

It's ok nobody is perfect.  It's great that you're immediately jumping back on the wagon.  Try not to let those hangover fueled feelings of guilt and anxiety get to you.  I'm sure you'll be feeling better in the next day or two.  You didn't ruin anything...the road to sobriety can have a speed bump every once in a while...it's staying on that road that matters.  Be proud of yourself for going so long without a drink and be happy you're starting a new streak today.  IWNDWYT!
Thank you very much for sharing. We are all here for you and have had plenty of day 1's. Yesterday is over and today is a new day!..IWNDWYT
Wow that's a long time sober you can do another day. Just for today I will not drink with you.
I wish you the best on this journey.
