After 4 years of floating around and trying to make things work on my own and drinking myself to near oblivion every day this year I decided I had enough of it and to give a shot at applying to grad school. I could only manage to apply to two as I struggled with taking care of myself but I got accepted to my top choice! UW Seattle for Library Science. Funny I had a dream about getting accepted last night and not having to pay a dime for it... we'll see how financial aid comes through soon though...In the meantime I will not drink to celebrate!

Many congratulations :)
congratulations!  that's great news....
Woot! That's great!
I'm in my last semester for Library science! Congrats!!!!!!
Congratulations! UW is a great school....My drinking got a lot worse when I was in grad school. I wish grad programs were better at educating incoming students about managing stress and depression. I hope you can make some plans for taking care of yourself while you're a student.  Congratulations again!
