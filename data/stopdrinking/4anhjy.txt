Goooood Wednesday Morning Folks! It is hump day! How has your week been? Post your triumphs struggles and complete nonsense...---..**Triumph:** I am alive and sober. Last night I waited on my sponsee's porch for two hours in the rain to make sure he was still alive (he was). Yesterday morning I passed my forklift training with 100%. ..**Struggle:** I have had insurance for ~month and I have yet to  set up appointments for doctors / new therapists / other health professionals. ..**Complete Nonsense:** How is your recovery going? 
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:**  I have abstained from drinking even when I've been really struggling with some troubling issues.  I'm also thinking about drinking A LOT less than I used to. ..**Struggle** I'm having a hard time getting my butt in gear. I've been falling down the internet wormhole far too often and need to stop being on the computer so much...**Complete Nonsense:** It's been tough to feel things as they really are and not masked or numbed by alcohol but I'm doing it and I think it's bringing out the better parts of me. Life isn't necessarily easier now that I'm sober but it is less complicated. My reactions to things are more straight-forward and there are certainly more hours to my day.
Triumph: I got back on my bike Sunday and loved it...Struggle:  I'm still substituting food especially ice cream for alcohol...Complete Nonsense:  I don't feel like I'm making progress as a person I'm just focused on not drinking still.  Trying not to cry over everything.
**Triumph:** By a series of events I am able to cut my hours down at the end of the month. ..**Struggle:** I am so very tired. But I suppose switching shifts twice each week and working 58 to 70 hours each week at my age is reason enough! ..**Complete Nonsense:** Very well! I am very comfortable in these new sober duds. How is yours?.
**T**: My life is full and interesting and alcohol plays no part in it...**S**: My job is stressful and over-full and between that and how full my days are I feel very ungrounded and unfocused. Need to make time for the basics...**N**: Recovery needs to be a bigger focus in my life but I do have tools that keep me on track. 
**Triumph:** I'm doing well on my first sober business trip. no closing down the hotel bar no 3 hrs of horrible sleep no panic over red eyes and cotton mouth and uncontrollable pooping this morning (sorry). I feel fresh alert and ready for the day ahead. ..**Struggle:** the *habitual thinking* still surprises me. I walked past an airport bar yesterday and thought "do I have time for a glass of wine" totally out of the blue. WTF?..**General Chat:** sober life just keeps getting better. I have my rough moments but they're getting fewer and farther between. thank you SD!
T: joined a home group last night. ..S: sleep sucks these days. i'm either asleep by 9 pm or up til 1 am. ..C: honestly i think i needed to experience the relapse i had to get my ass in gear. i'm not happy about it but i've learned a lot from it. 
**Triumph:** I finally finally found a reasonable place to live at the end of the month. I was falling apart over this..**Struggle:** Work is so busy that I can't seem to get a minute to myself. Nothing ever seems to get done..**Complete Nonsense:** I'm having a hard time dealing with such extreme emotions that are let loose now that I'm not dulling them with booze.
**Triumph:**: I have almost finished 2 books since the start of my sober journey. I don't think I've read 2 books in the last couple years. Reading is a great passion of mine so it has been amazing getting back into it. ..**Struggle:** Dealing with some guilt right now. I know I need to focus/take care of myself right now but my mom is in the hospital with a terminal illness and my dad decided it was the best time to divorce her so she is constantly wanting me to be there before/after work and it's starting to wear on me. I have to mention that she's a 40-45 minute drive from where I am. I didn't go yesterday and she was blowing up my phone making me feel guilty about it. ..**Complete Nonsense:** As you guys always say each day does get better. Still feel anxiety around a bunch of people but I'm hoping that goes away with more sober time. 
Triumph: I'm two weeks sober. This is the longest stretch I've been sober for years...Struggle: I feel like I'm about to crack. My cravings feel relentless at night. I'm restless and have had anxiety attacks. I'm going to my psychiatrist tomorrow to talk about all of this...Complete Nonsense: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
Triumph: I realized recently that I don't think about drinking as much as I used to. It continues to dwindle in my mind until I see a reminder (advertisement/someone talking about it etc). ..Struggle: Really tired this week. Partly due to the time change but also long hours and odd stuff at work...Nonsense: Fallout 4 continues to take up a lot of my down time. I love that game. 
**Triumph:** I've gotten a lot better about cranking out applications for full-time jobs. I found out yesterday that I might get a full-time (if temporary) job with the nonprofit that I do part-time contract work for; the director wants to hire me because I am "honest and reliable and don't have to be babysat." I always think I am terrible as an employee so that was really good to hear...**Struggle:** I have gotten out of the habit of exercising and am having a hard time getting back into it because of shame and frustration with myself. I'm eating way too much sugar and not enough green vegetables. Not-drinking is still taking up most of my energy and decision-making power and I am overindulging in other areas of my life to make up for it...**Complete Nonsense:** My sobriety's going really well. It was a great decision for me to stop drinking. I chaired my first AA meeting this week and it was a good feeling. I even stopped smoking weed about 35 days ago and have stuck to that with only one relapse; I'm hoping I don't have to quit weed forever like I'm quitting alcohol but I wanted to see what it was like to be really-truly sober (and to be able to pass a drug test if I need to in order to get a job). And it's not so bad. I'm sleeping just fine and getting a hell of a lot more reading done. I could get used to this whole sobriety thing.
**Triumph:** It's becoming easier to socialize meet new people and try new things. In fact I had somewhat of a breakthrough experience yesterday in which I navigated a difficult social setting with humor and charisma despite not having a 'buzz'.  .**Struggle:** Thoughts of trying moderate drinking keep popping up.  .**Complete Nonsense:** If Donald Trump becomes president I'll certainly get rich.
**Triumph:** I am sober this morning for the first time in a while and I am feeling motivated and excited to see the kids after school now so I can spend some time with them. Also my boys have therapists for developmental/emotional support and the one therapist and I had talked last Wednesday about how I have been getting drunk every single day sleeping it off being hungover by the time we have to get the kids from school going into my room and doing nothing productive for the rest of the day. Well I had promised her that I wouldn't drink (in pubic) on my walk home because of the legal ramifications of doing so however unlikely they are to actually happen. Today I did NOT drink on my way home or even when I got home! I kept my promise even though that wasn't really why I had kept it. I didn't even think about that til I got home and realized that she will be coming over later on (she comes on Wed) and I can tell her that I did keep my promise to her! I feel like it is not worth the hassle with the po-po and I could get into some trouble with the authorities if I am caught drinking in public. It would affect my children as those authorities could also be called as a welfare check. I would be forced into treatment which means I would be taken away from my kids and home and the consequences of that on my marriage would be catastrophic. So...I didn't do it. Not worth it anymore. ..**Struggle:** I am taking it one hour at a time but thinking back about that day I picked up again fills me with sadness and makes me really angry at myself almost to the point of (internal) rage. I messed up royally and I can't promise yet that I will stay on this path indefinitely but at least for now I can...**Complete Nonsense:** Um...the cheese curls I just ate were really good but now my fingers are all orange. Hey it is fun licking the cheese off of them though! :D Planning supper for later...still no clue what we want to make though. Humph.
Triumph:  Haven't had a drink since Saturday afternoon.  Had a really rough day yesterday feeling like I was going crazy.  Today however I feel much more normal.  I feel like my old good self and my new good self combined but not my old drunk self.  Anxiety is still there but not as intense.  I'm loving these flavored Sanpellegrino drinks.  ..Struggle: Still just going home and doing nothing at night.  Just sitting around.  I have a gym membership and I will use it just a little intimidated because I literally have no idea how to work out.  ..Complete Nonsense:  I feel like nothing will be fun again but I have a dirtbike in the garage just waiting to get tuned up.  I had to put it away because I would always have 4-5 beers when I was out on a ride.  Could be a good distraction.  
Triumph: Feeling fucking great on naltrexone cravings and anxiety curbed. ..Struggle: Nervous about how long this will last. Scared. Want to succeed...Complete nonsense: Feeling aimless. Like what am I supposed to be doing right now?
t-woke up without a hangover..s-day 2 here so it's gonna be tough..cn-gonna chip away at some work and chores try to hit a meeting later and try not to be an asshole.  Today is gonna be about learning techniques to be less selfish.  any tips?
**Triumph** I'm still not drinking even with some tempting situations and usual hardships that would normally drive me to cope with booze...**Struggle** Craving the flavor taste and "ritual" of drinking especially my old stand by of Canadian Club. Just been trying to think about something else and remind myself why I stopped drinking in the first place...**Complete Nonsense** This pop is so cold I'm shivering which is an easy way to make myself crave hot black tea haha.
Triumph: I started filling out the spreadsheet from yesterday's Tuesday Tools. I plan to give the completed version to family and friends so they know the extent of my problem and will quit offering me "just one" and/or coach me when I'm feeling weak. ..Struggle: none today! Feeling pretty good!..Complete nonsense: I'm finding my way back to spirituality and look forward to redeveloping that aspect of myself.
**Triumph** : I met with friends in a restaurant instead of a bar. I talked to more friends about stopping drinking...**Struggle** : I still have problems to concentrate...**How is it going?** : I began working on my health. It's time to get it back. I want to lose about 30 lbs in the next two years.
Triumph: I'm on my 4th day sober. This is the longest run I've had in a few months. Anxiety has gone down significantly :) I love being totally clear-headed and focused at work...Struggle: Like many others I'm having trouble with substituting food for alcohol. I'm going to focus on mindfulness when eating/ preparing meals :)..Nonsense: drank way to much coffee this morning and now I'm dizzy D: looking forward to a Cesar Salad and fruit for lunch to hopefully balance this coffee-buzz out
**Triumph:** Went out for my first bike ride on Saturday. Did 75km with a friend that was training hard over the winter and I didn't get killed *too* badly...**Struggle:** Work has been stressing me out and I've been struggling with the whole work/life balance thing...**Complete Nonsense:** It's going well I feel great and life is pretty good right now. 
Triumph: 2 days sober ..Struggle: It's hard to fall asleep without a few beers..Nonsense: I'm curious on how much my blood work will reflect the complete lack of alcohol in my diet.
Triumph: Defended my dissertation and became Dr. Ybahent. ~450 days ago I realized it was either quit drinking or drop out of academics. Glad I made the right choice. ..Struggle: Will be unemployed soon worried about that (sort of?) and also about getting overconfident with sobriety in the wake of an achievement. I will struggle to adapt to new circumstances but that's a good problem to have. ..Complete nonsense: Spring! Flowers. Bees. Yay!
Triumph: I didn't drink today..Struggle: I can't bring myself to go to AA..Complete Nonsense: I saw the sun today :-)
Triumph: Went to an AA meeting for the second consecutive day.Struggle: Didn't make it to the gym or do my grocery shopping.Complete Nonsense: Anyone else excited for March Madness getting crazy starting tomorrow?
