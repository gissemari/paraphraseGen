I'm so happy to live a sober life.  It's been a real challenge but I feel good.  My depression has been acting up again and I don't feel like my medication is working properly.  My head is all tangled and knotted up but I am sober!  If I was drinking these problems would be much much worse.  Happy Tuesday Y'all!

Nothing to balk at it's hard as fuck..Good on you bro 
Aw wonderful! Stay strong my friend :)
Tangled and knotted up... I remember experiencing a lot of fuzziness. The simplest of ideas seemed to take an exorbitant amount of thought. My brain took some time to find an equilibrium but don't be afraid to have that chat with your prescriber.
right on not drinking with you today
Hey me too! And I posted this morning I felt off. Saying things I just needed to not say. Today went better. Thankfully!
Congrats! It is worth it and so are you! Remember you a person worthy of love and respect! 
Thanks everyone!  This community is so incredible.  I'm off to an AA meeting!
We've all seen people who needed to relapse before making a real commitment to sobriety. I was one of those people. You sound like you are doing great. Get that medication figured out. It can be trial and error for a while. See your doctor. Happy Wednesday.
