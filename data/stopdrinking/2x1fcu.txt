I don't even know where to begin. ..This is not my first post. I've been dealing with this and much more for the past year and a half. Been to detox twice and... i was going to write relapsed but i don't think I've ever really *honestly* tried. ..I've pushed so many people away. I've been waiting for my SO to leave me. For my family to get angry and disown me. But they've only ever been supportive and loving. ..I'm starting to realize that the only thing I'm doing to avoiding the real problem. And by doing this I'm hurting so many people most of all me. It's a strange feeling knowing people truly care about you. ..I don't really know what I'm doing with this post. Rambling right now i guess. ..I guess I've just been thinking about this maybe slightly obsessively.... And I'm just trying to deal with them. Hopefully i can get some sleep tonight...Thanks for listening.
