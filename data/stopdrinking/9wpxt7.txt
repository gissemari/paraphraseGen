Hello all I wanted to share my experience with the medication Antabuse and how it helped me. I saw some mixed results on this sub when I did my initial round of research before beginning the medication and thought I would toss my opinion in to anyone else considering trying it(or any other medication)...Quick background: I was a heavy drinker for years before attempting to stop. At least 6 high volume % IPAs a day and up to 12 to 15 if I was off work the next day. I tried cold turkey cutting down and read all the helpful literature and posts on this subreddit to try and stop. Absolutely nothing worked. 5 days sober was my maximum achievement once before that addict whisper in my head brought me back drinking. ..I was finally honest with my doctor who offered several medication options. The first Naltrexone is designed to allow you to drink but blocks the positive brain response to booze. This did not work for me. I tried it for a few weeks but the desire to drink was so ingrained I continued to get drunk daily despite it not feeling as great as it did before. After a few weeks I went back to my doctor and I decided to try her second option Antabuse. ..For those who might not know Antabuse's sole purpose is to make the user violently ill if they drink while the drug is in their system. My doctor explained that a hospital visit was most likely necessary at even lower ends of mixture with possible fatal reactions at higher levels. ..This absolutely terrified me to the point I almost declined. But I realized my body felt like constant shit from drinking anyway and I was headed towards an early grave if I continued so I figured why not go for it. The drug is known to be rough on the liver but after a blood test to determine I was in the clear I began to take the medicine...I am very happy to report that it has absolutely worked for me. Antabuse took the option of drinking completely off the table and I now had a solid concrete argument against that voice in my head that was begging for a beer. I hated not drinking those first few weeks. I felt terrible and depressed and would come home from work and just lay in bed until I fell into a miserable sleep. But after the first month drinking ceased to become part of my routine and I began to live again all from just taking the risk and trying medication...I want to be clear this medicine is probably not for everyone. It worked for me because I could not trust myself to stop on my own. That was tough to admit because so many other people could and I felt I should too. But I see now stopping drinking with help or without was the ultimate goal and I'm on my way to living without booze hopefully the rest of my life. ..With the clear from my doctor I no longer take the pill daily. I now take it only on my harsher days of longing and they are getting fewer and far between. I'm no idiot plenty of stronger men and women than myself have relapsed back into drinking. This pill isn't magic and I need to stay vigilant on myself but it's nice to know I have some help sitting on my kitchen counter while I continue the path forward.

I know my doctor is a Naltrexone prescriber but not sure if I'm going to go that route as I already take several medications. I'm super glad the Antabuse worked for you! That is worth a big fist bump cos I know it's very harsh. Well done you!
