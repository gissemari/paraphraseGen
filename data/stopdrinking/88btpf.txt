And that kind of makes me nervous.  Fortunately I am not entertaining thoughts of "I can MODERATE!!!".  I the past 163! days I have experienced many occasions where I normally would have drank.  Being home alone was the biggest because I was an at home daily drinker. Several times I have had the house to myself (for days!) and while the thought did occur to me that I could have a bottle of wine and no one would know I did not do it.  And I never regretted that decision.  I credit Alan Carr's book and This Naked Mind.  And SD.  Especially SD.  Hearing other's stories of successes and failures and struggles really does help.    So thanks all of you out there!  Keep on keeping on never stop trying.

In a way you are right.  Odds are you don't have a bottle or six in the fridge your car no longer goes on auto pilot to the liquor store you don't hoard your money so that Friday can be all you want to drink it to be...I suspect you will find some next steps that need taking - the "reasons" we drank the way we did need be addressed one way or another - be it therapy the steps one of the books you mentioned or whatever...  This will happen as needed - but in my experience it is important to keep in touch with where we once were if only to keep complacency at bay.
