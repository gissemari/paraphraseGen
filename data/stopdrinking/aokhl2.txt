Terrible week at work may need to work over the weekend as well. In the past I would have "treated myself" into a stupor after a Friday as a way to turn my brain off . I have every ability to leave work early and sit at my favorite posh cocktail spot for a few gin and tonics before heading home to a husband and 2 rambunctious kids. Why does this abstinence feel so spartan and cruel on some days? Today I begrudgingly WNDWYT...even angrily. So as an alternative what do you recommend for mentally shutting down?

Meditation/breathing exercises reading stretching/yoga.....&amp;#x200B;..You can do this!!  IWNDWYT
I allowed myself to eat what ever the hell I wanted for the first month. Now been eating healthier for 2 weeks and am pleased to find the major alcohol cravings have gone. You could try treating yourself to decadent deserts for a month (or crisps and other snacks if you're more of a savory person)  
Self care is so important. And I mean beyond the eating drinking sleeping exercise routine. Could you treat yourself to a massage or a pedicure or do an at home pedicure with a friend if $$ is an issue?..I also have a secret game I play when I need some chill time and the kiddos are crazy rambunctious. I play a game called  what's on my butt?  And it goes like this- I lie facedown on the couch. Kiddos go find some random household project and then place it on top of me. I have to guess what it is which usually isn't hard. Once I've guessed correctly they go race off to find the new thing that mom won't ever guess!!
