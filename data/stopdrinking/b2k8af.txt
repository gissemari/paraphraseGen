I'm doing okay...- I got out and spent a full day with my brother in the bush. We had a great day. I met someone with 15 years sober didn't chat about it much but it was comforting to see someone in sobriety so happy. ..- Went out with my SO and a couple friends yesterday to bar hop a bit. My friend confided in me that he's super fucking proud that I quit drinking. He said he's got a bad problem and he has been to a few meetings. I hope that I can be a bit of an example for other people in my life that life goes on after quitting. ..- Lastly I have a family member who might have hit rock bottom a few days ago. Treatment is now inevitable. I hope it sticks. Another reminder...I'm still struggling a bit. I've got a big decision hanging over my head (whether or not to quit my "good" job to go to college for a bachelors degree in a different field) so I'm stressing about that if anyone has any advice or stories about career changes I'd love to hear it...Thank you so much for this community in general and especially to the people who replied to my post the other day. It meant so much to me. I will not drink with you today.

If you have a career already (I don't know what your definition of "good job" is) can you get a degree that complements the experience that you have?
Good job on making plans that avoid the relapse!..I will not drink with you today.
