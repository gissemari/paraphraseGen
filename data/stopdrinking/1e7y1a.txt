Changing habits is so fucking hard. People that say their rock bottom is all it took doesn't jive with my experience. Maybe that makes me the biggest fuck up of all. Self medicating takes on exponential proportions when trying to deal with the outfall of your rock bottoms...s intentional.

Hating yourself doesn't accomplish anything. It just keeps you in the spin cycle of addiction. What helped me the most with depression shame and regret was AA. I learned sober coping skills and found support guidance role models friends fun and hope in those rooms. Go to a meeting. Sit. Listen. Go again. Sit. Listen. There's hope if you stop digging. 
Hitting the bottom is not and never is all there is to it. When I got to my bottom I had to decide to drag myself out of the pit of self-loathing pity hatred and fear. ..From my experience there are two options (three if you count keep digging (drinking) for a deeper bottom)...1. Hang out in that pit you've dug. This is very simple and it is a familiar place so it is tempting to do that. And hey if things get bad I can just pick up the shovel (bottle) and start going deeper...2. Look around your pit. Decide that you want out of it. Do whatever it takes to start climbing out. Get some help. Do things that you have not done in the past. ..For 964 days I've been filling in my pit of despair addiction and isolation.
