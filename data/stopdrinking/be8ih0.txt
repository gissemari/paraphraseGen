I'm starting to think that I have a drinking problem. My partner was in the military (so yes he drinks for any and all occasions) and I come from a family history of drinkers (we are Thai... We love to drink.)  My grandpa drank heavily when he was depressed after my grandma passed. My mom still drinks heavily even after a car accident which caused her car to go up in flames about 10+ years ago. My brother constantly relapses when he goes out for drinks with friends and ends up making poor choices (car accidents.) So I'm starting to think I need to better my life by cutting out alcohol. Day one for me. I may start a journal to help me. Just wanted to see if you guys have any input.

Recommend doing some reading while you're in this initial sober stretch :) I really enjoyed the book Alcohol Explained by William Porter &amp; the book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. Learning more about alcohol &amp; addiction helped me a lot
Congrats on day one!..Perhaps you'll try a 30 day challenge and see how you feel?..I think you'll enjoy [this information about the beginning of sobriety](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_it.27s_my_first_day.__what_do_i_need_to_know.3F)...Looking forward to hearing more from you :).
You will either find that you can do it or you can't do  it.  Both bits of knowledge will be very useful.
