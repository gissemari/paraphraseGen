For a chronic relapse artist like me the biggest and best thing I can do today is go to bed sober. I'll take it...No crazy stories or philosophies. No more lies to myself and you. No more empty promises. No more big dreams about a rich and sober future. But no nasty and unbearable hangover tomorrow either. ..Good night SD. I love you.

Goddamn best thing my sponsor ever said to me early in sobriety: No matter what happens in your day or how bad you mess things up if your head hits the pillow sober tonight then you've won. And tomorrow you get another crack at it. That's why it's good to be an alcoholic. It really is that simple for us...Man thanks for reminding me of this. 
Sweet dreams /u/chickenhips!
I always had fun drinking all afternoon but when it was time to sleep I always wished I could just sober up and get some real rest. Waking up clear headed is a huge motivator for me. .Keep it up!
see you in the morning chickenhips. ..:) 
Love this! Not only is going to bed sober great but waking up sober and not hungover is becoming a big motivator for me. Since usually my hangovers are so bad they are like I am still drunk in the morning or would just feel like death. I have so much more energy in the morning and am in a good mood. I could get used to this.
Going to bed sober is the best I'm doing it tonight as well.
Hope you have a beautiful clear-headed morning!
