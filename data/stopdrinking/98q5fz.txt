I need courage and have no support. I want to go to a meeting tomorrow but I'm overwhelmed with shame. Shame to admit to my husband I've relapsed to my family and friends - who almost exclusively socialize around booze - and scared to run into someone I know at a meeting... Or find someone predatory around the meeting. I was raped and scared but need help.

I hope you go - you right that you need support and if you reach out there you'll get some. Also hope you're talking to someone about the rape. Sounds like you have a lot on your plate - helps me to just do one minute at a time so I don't get overwhelmed. Remember to breathe to look at the horizon (literally) to take a few deep breaths to wiggle your fingers to stay in the moment. You can do this inch by inch.
You can do it. I was scared to go to my first one too but I'm so glad I did! In my experience AA is a pretty awesome place with people there to support you rather than judge. Best of luck!
Don't be ashamed. None of us goes to our first meeting brimming with confidence. This is hard. But you will be welcomed and cared for. If you see anyone you know there remember they're there for the exact same reason as you. 
Today was my 10th meeting in 10 days. .Do not feel ashamed. You're in perfect company and they are there to help you succeed in your sobriety. .It's extremely refreshing to know they are there for you and only want the best for you. .You don't have to speak or share right away. .The meeting really put things into perspective and helped me really realign my thoughts.
