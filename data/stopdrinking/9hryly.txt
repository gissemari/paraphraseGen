Hi everyone! Just doing my daily check in. Not much to report. I've slept poorly the last couple of days and I've been craving cigarettes. They're both probably related to general life stress. I haven't been getting much exercise lately so I'm gonna go to the gym later which'll hopefully help with both. ..I've been smoking off and on for the last couple of years but I quit for about a decade before that so I know that I can quit. I also know that if I start smoking again it'll just prolong the pain of quitting. So I might as well stick it out &amp; get it over with. And as someone on here pointed out recently it's a dumb addiction. The only thing that smoking does is get rid of nicotine withdrawals. ..It's just the bitch of addiction though - falling off the wagon can lead to relapse after relapse because it reawakens my system to the idea that smoking is a solution of some sort to feeling bad. So the key is to never pick up not even once. I knew that I could get through yesterday without smoking and I know that I can get through today without smoking. And I know that I can live without it beyond that but today I'm just worrying about today. ..Obviously this also applies to quitting drinking although I have found that I need more support around quitting drinking. I can't just wait it out I need to get support and actively work on it...And that is where I'm at. Hope you all are well! ..Ginger_Sprout Out

Try getting addicted to going to the gym. Get them gains. Try yoga. It helped me quit smoking. I dunno how but hell it helped.
Hello! Keep hanging in there. Lack of sleep can make all filters low. And then lessen the space between  I have the urge to do this thing  and  I am deciding to act on this urge . Rest helps so much. IWNDWYT
