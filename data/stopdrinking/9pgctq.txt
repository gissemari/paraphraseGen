I'm about to be 25 in a few weeks. I'm been a full time student and work 30+ hours a week which has been insanely stressful. The past 3 years since I've moved away from my home my problems have become intensified. When i first left home I had a drinking problem but I hadn't realized how bad it was at the time. I was working at a bar when I was 21 and I got drunk with my coworkers probably 5 nights a week. Anyway I decided I needed change so I re-enrolled in college where I am today. I thought this would be a healthy change so I registered for classes and moved 5 hours away from home. These past 3 years have been misery. Not only is my drinking problem out of hand but I also have struggled with a drug problem and smoke nearly a pack of cigarettes a day. I've ruined a lot of good things in my life and I'm depressed miss my family and constantly think of all of my regrets that I will live with for the rest of my life. I graduate college in December and I've been thinking about what I want to do when I graduate. I talked to my mom and she has agreed to let me move in with her provided I pay a small portion of the rent. I'm really hoping this will kickstart me back into getting closer to my family and myself and reflecting on where I need to go in life to be successful. A lot of my old drinking buddies from back home have moved away which I see as a positive. I've become so detached from my family the past 3 years and I hate myself for it. It makes me sick. Anyway I'm hoping that if I put my family first and focus on work (hopefully I can get a job in my field) it will help a lot in beating my addictions. I've missed out on so much of my family's life. Missed by brothers basketball games missed my sister when she was going through the worst period of her life this year missed being there for my mom when I should have been. Have little relationship with my father. I believe my alcohol &amp; drug problems have been a huge reason for these things. The next day guilt after drinking makes me so depressed and withdrawn. ..&amp;#x200B;..Long story short I've had a bad drinking problem for probably 5 years destroyed relationships with friends &amp; family and am moving back home looking for a fresh start after I graduate college in December.

I wish I had this foresight when I was 25. It's never too late to do something else.
Sounds like shame and guilt have you in a chokehold!  I know that I feel guilty and ashamed about a lot of things I missed and ignored while I was drinking.  Succumbing to those feelings and acting out of the fear and anger they inspired me led me to drink for far longer than I would have liked.  It's a hard cycle to break.  .I was finally able to break the cycle by lurking here on /r/stopdrinking for a while and practicing on myself the forgiveness and compassion I saw the Sobernauts extend to each other...I don't know what your family situation is like but it's clear to me from what you wrote that you love and care for them dearly.  I can only imagine they feel the same.  And I hope you're able to share your feelings with them and tell them about your regrets.  I know I'm a sucker for receiving a sincere apology and I generally feel better when I deliver one myself.  I don't imagine apologies completely wipe the slate clean but for me the mend some of what's broken and get the ball rolling on starting to heal relationships...I see from your previous posts this isn't your first attempt at sobriety.  Hopefully you're learning from relapse and not beating yourself up about your mistakes of the past.  I did my best to learn what I could from my past and try to remember that I can change will change and if I stay sober I'm _far less_ likely to repeat those mistakes again.  I try to allow _just enough_ guilt and shame to lick at my heels so I keep moving forward but not so much that I feel overwhelmed and return to the bottle...I know feel I'm rambling.  I hope your return home is a good one.  Being in a healthy supportive place is so important to recovery.  You're a young man and have so many years ahead of you.  You're getting a jump on sobriety far earlier than I did and I'm proud of you for that.  I'll be looking for you around here and at the check-in.  Reach out whenever you need!..IWNDWYT
