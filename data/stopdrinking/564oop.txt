Well hello there...It is 150 today...50 days ago I was kinda worried that I was losing interest for certain things..Well I am happy to say that it got better:..* I am enjoying all my hobbies with renewed interests - some of them slightly different then before...* Also got new ones...* My energy levels are skyrocketing. I get great praises at work...* I changed the circle of people who I am communicating with - I don't worry that "old friends" are not around anymore. I accepted that I am a different person now and moved on...So to anyone who struggles with "100-day crisis" know this - it will get amazing soon :)..P.S. Cravings sometimes come and go but mostly in a "what-if" version and fortunately I am not dumb enough to entertain these thoughts...P.S.S. Also yoghurt ice-cream rocks...P.S.S.S. Firewatch video game is really cool try it out...Cheers friends thank you for your posts your support and for everything this community is doing for itself and have a good day!

This is exactly what I need right now thanks.
Right now I'm on a "100-day high" but I know things can turn unexpectedly at any moment. Thanks for posting and congrats on 150!
Awesome :) Take care! ..How did you meet new people?
Video Games I was losing a lot of great games while drunk. All the playstation 123 and xbox generation I never got to play cause of this addiction...Now I am playing all..  so much waste in drinks bars.. not only money.. but time too...Cheers...Ps.: Gonna check it out Firewatch!
I felt pretty shit until five months. Must be the turning point for some of us.
