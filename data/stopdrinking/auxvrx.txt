I relapsed. I thought to myself while shopping ahh it obviously doesn't control me! I can have some drinks tonight and relax! Now I've woken up after those few drinks and immediately want more. I'm sorry... I'm trying to resist it but I need help.

Just think about how anxious that craving makes you feel. The hangover will invariably be worse. Get a little sugar in you and go for a walk! You can do it!
