I've been following this sub for some time but this is my first time posting.  What I've discovered as I read through the posts is simply how much alike we all are.. struggling with alcohol addiction and trying to be healthier both for ourselves and our families. What also amazes me is how many of us there are struggling with this. Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone with this struggle and everyone else is just doing wonderfully at this thing called life but clearly this is not the case. I find this sub extremely inspiring.  Thank you all for sharing your stories and best of luck to you in this fight!

Yep...  I often wonder if some of the people I interact with in real life are suffering or going through this. I keep my recovery to myself in my job etc. 
It helps me know I'm not overreacting or being too hard on myself. It gives me confidence that staying away from the stuff is the right move. There isn't some other solution for me because my story isn't original. 
I think it's so important to be honest if we feel able to otherwise it's all too easy to look around and think everyone has the perfect life when in reality they are probably just good at hiding things! You're definitely not alone and I too find it shocking yet reassuring that others are feeling and experiencing such similar things to me 
Damn right. We are family! Love all y'all!
