Don't get me wrong I want to do it but these feelings of zero self confidence no motivation I'm just down I don't want to give up but if I relapse I feel like I have nothing left to lose.I'm just depressed I'm still going through this break up and I'm hurting.My family is having a very hard time with my uncle's death 2 weeks ago the 3rd consecutive death in 3 years in my family.Everything happens at once but I do know drinking will always make it worse so I'm going for another 24 hours a month scared me.Sorry had to vent

Anything longer than 24 hours scared the hell out of me. I couldn't think about tomorrow next week next month next year. It's *all about TODAY*...I'm sorry for your family's loss. Have you thought about counseling or meetings?.
Congratulations on 98 days! That's a huge accomplishment. I hope you're proud of it. You deserve to be. .It sounds like you're dealing with a lot while also getting sober. AA meetings helped me collect my thoughts prioritize things and get some coping skills outside of reaching for the bottle. There are other meetings like smart recovery too. I know counseling has also done a lot for my sober friends who have had a really hard time navigating through tough real life stuff that gets thrown at us. 
I have to stay in the here &amp; now personally or I tend to panic &amp; break. ..Congrats on the 98 &amp; I am sorry for you &amp; your family's loss.
I saw good advice once:..Run don't walk to a meeting!!!.        .I will live fully today .Today I will not drink with you
