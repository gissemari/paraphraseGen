63 huh.. nice.  im already starting to lose track i didnt even notice my 2 month come and go.  i have heard a lot of people saying they still get cravings and strong urges months and even years later.. seems very common.  i think the fact that i got diagnosed with liver disease probably makes quitting a lot easier mentally for me though.. i know that i cant drink any more or i'll probably die.  so i really dont even have a choice.  i just cant so i dont.  i imagine the mental game of getting cravings and strong urges to drink relapsing etc is probably much harder when you actually do have a choice.  .  .dont get me wrong i'd trade my liver disease for that extra mental struggle in a heartbeat.  i am where i am though so i'll try to see the bright side as much as i can.  .  .hope everyone is having a good day!  happy friday.
