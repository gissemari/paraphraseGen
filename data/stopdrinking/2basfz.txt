Guess my relapse tilted my brain chemicals in the wrong way. Had trouble sleeping last night. Terrible anxiety and depression like this sinking feeling of doom in my chest. Woke up this morning and it hasn't gone away...I hadn't been feeling this way. Still taking my meds. Not drinking today. Wish this feeling would go away.

Hopefully it will given time.  A relapse is depressing in itself. Goodluck.
I know this feeling all to well. Try to just stay the course drinking won't make it better. Good luck /u/sober_girl you can do this. 
I hope you're treating yourself kindly today.  Mint tea chocolate sitcoms whatever calms you down and takes your mind off the feeling of doom.  Because it is temporary.  Real and sucky but most assuredly temporary.
It took a couple weeks for my depression and anxiety to calm down after I quit.  Now my anxiety is almost gone and depression is better.  If anything will keep me from drinking it's those two things.  Yours should calm down too as your nervous system evens out.
&gt; Wish this feeling would go away...It will but you know you have to tough out these early days. 
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (most modern anti-depressants) are inactivated by the presence of alcohol.  In other words it's like you're not even taking them if you're still drinking.  Source:  Me... I'm a nurse who's studied this stuff for a while.
