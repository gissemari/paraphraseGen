Good morning all and happy hump day!..Today in honor of hump day (and some events I had to navigate Tuesday evening) I wanted to talk about the challenges we face and how we respond to them aka getting over the hump. ..Everyone experiences different challenges whether they be from inside or outside forces and usually we're experiencing a whole host of both at any given time. I tend to be the type of person that has a hard time forgiving mistakes most especially my own. I like to think I got an extra spoonful of "fuck that" in my cookie batter when they cooked me up. :) With that being said I can find it hard to empathize when people make completely preventable mistakes that directly affect me and I am also extremely harsh on myself about mistakes I make both past and present. ..Today I am trying to think about empathy and forgiveness instead. I came across this quote and I think it perfectly encapsulates what I'm trying to express:..&gt;When someone is working hard to change the worst thing you can do is hold them to their past. Forgive them and help them transform...The mistakes of our past do not define us and while I am struggling with working through that with another person I am also trying to keep that in mind for myself. Remember the Golden rule? Treat others as you wish to be treated? I realized that for every bit as much as I am trying to handle this with grace and not be angry I am thankful for the people who were kind to me in this way. And I realized that I needed to be kind to myself in this way too. ..I often talk to my daughter about how we choose to talk to ourselves. That if we would not speak to another person that way we shouldn't speak to ourselves that way. And I just wanted to share these thoughts for anyone who might be struggling today. Be kind to yourself too. We have all worked hard to change and get where we are. ..I hope you all have fabulous days!...*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---.

Good morning good afternoon and good evening SD.  Just getting into bed after working this evening. Hope your day is peaceful. IWNDWYT 
Planning on going for a nice walk through downtown this morning. I remember how good I felt when I did my runs every morning in highschool and how healthy/in-shape I was. I want to feel that way again. ..I'm also seeing my counselor today I'm sure she will be thrilled that I have maintained sobriety.  I will be joining you all in not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today  
I will not drink with you today!
Not drinking today!
I'm exhausted. Been struggling with whiplash for almost 4 months now.  I refuse to take pain pills or muscle relaxers because I know me. I haven't slept 8 hours straight this year. Finally drifted off to sleep. Now a rather violent storm is moving through.  Just needed to vent.  ..IWNDWYT ..
I will not drink with you today
happy hump day   IWNDWYT!
My fourth day! It's a little tougher today. But IWNDWYT!
I won't drink today.
Good day I made a new account as I feel that it will help me forget the old me. Had a short binge and its 24 hours since I had one. ..I probably won't be able to sleep tonight but i'll just walk it off.
IWNDWYT
Good morning. Feeling rather tired today but still won't be drinking.

I will not drink with you fine fellow wanderers todays.
Miserable day here but it's always sunny when you're sober so I don't mind :).Going for a walk with the pup and the kids in the rain..I absolutely will not be drinking with you today SD !!!
Hey all went to a morning meeting today. It was very quiet but nice. I still don't feel very comfortable sharing my thoughts aren't coherent and well .. I don't know. I just feel kind of silly like my problems aren't that bad compared to other people's...Anyway IWNDWYT.
Checking in. 
I will not drink with you today!!
I will not drink today. Thank you /u/RiskyBlossom for hosting this week and for reminding us about forgiveness a great message. :) 
Well it's been 80 days...I don't feel like i've had the adventures of Phileas Fogg or Passepartout and I certainly don't want to visit the Reform Club but it's been an adventure none the less...Despite my limitations ( a post for another time ) i've exercised more than I have for a long time eaten a ridiculously healthy diet slept well and have seen a noticable change in my mental health. The weight change is the key though over 20lb down in 11 weeks is what sees me sticking with this now with arthritis making life a challenge the less weight I have to carry the better...Be good everyone let's not drink to our success !
No drinking for me today...... have a great day..... 
Happy Wednesday All I am up and ready to tackle another day Sober and Strong. No drinking with you all today.. Peace
Morning from French Alps! Yesterday I went into the dining room for dinner and noticed a water dispenser where people were filling up their carafes for their table. I went to investigate - it wasn't water - it was wine   Free. Gratis. ..I shot back to our table like I'd been stung! You wouldn't get that in England. Maybe the French are generally sensible enough about alcohol to fill up a carafe put it on their table share it around the table with their food then - Well - go and do something else?   I couldn't help thinking if they did that in any English hotel when I was drinking (8 weeks ago today dammit!) the hotel would be in flames by 1am...  ..Yesterday morning I broke up ski bootcamp and made us go tobogganing. It was great! We were racing each other down a luge run. I nearly died laughing when Son1 came off lost his toboggan and it shot off over the edge onto the piste whilst he scrambled after it swearing madly! I came round the corner nearly mowed him down and laughed so hard I couldn't steer!    ..When I had my shower that evening I noticed that I am covered in bruises from the luge - but what a change to know exactly where the bruises came from. When I was drinking I often woke up with bruises and I hadn't a clue where they came from! 8 weeks today - still sober - Thanks SD!! - IWNDWYT   
I'm not drinking today no matter what!
Not drinking today  
IWNDWYT

I have a nasty cold. In the past I would still drink a bottle of wine or more and then be useless tomorrow. It's so nice to be tucked up in bed with some orange juice instead. IWNDWYT. Goodnight all.
Good morning - I will not drink with you all today or tonight   
not today!
Good morning from Mississippi! Great commentary this morning RiskyBlossom. This statement speaks directly to me:. ."With that being said I can find it hard to empathize when people make completely preventable mistakes that directly affect me and I am also extremely harsh on myself about mistakes I make both past and present."..It is something I am working on to try and improve as a human being. Forgiveness has never been something easy for me to offer to anyone including myself. ..I will not drink with any of you fine folks today!.
Good morning everyone! We almost have this week behind us! IWNDWYT

Happy Hump Day. I will not drink with you today.

Good morning. I will not drink with you today! Day 3
All too busy kinda week - like shoving my size nine feet into size three winkle-pickers it just aint comfortable. On the upside have been mixing up my weekly routine in terms of the 100 mile round trip of a Wednesday evening to the nearest city for Kiddo's Cub Scouts - leaving a little earlier and getting a pesky city shopping thing ticked off and then buying takeout dinner instead of squeezing a kid feeding of some kind into the pre-trip prep. Tonight was Thai from a place we hadn't tried before. It was gooooood :) And no booze today/tonight! I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow either. Have a hip-hooray Hump Day everyone :).
I will not drink today.
Good morning everyone. Feels great to start the day calm focused and content! I will not drink with you today.

Checking in. Today feels like a BIG struggle but I can only affect the things I can truly control. And for that reason I will not drink with you guys today!
**IWNDWYT!!!**
Good morning /sd! I will not drink with you today!
I had strange and vivid dreams last night. I was drinking in one of those dreams and I was certainly drunk. Like a bad session on beer I don't remember the context. I woke up sober though so it could have been worse!.I think the dream was down to the fact that going off alcohol forever was in my thoughts for most of yesterday. I'd never dream of alcohol otherwise. .I think it needs to be in my thoughts however because I will heal up and complacency will rear its ugly head. My thinking needs to be on point when that happens. So the eyes are on the prize I'm very hopeful for the future right now...I will not drink with you today.
Will I stay alcohol free today?..Yes I will not drink with you all today
Wednesdays are the worst.  I will get through it. I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you all today. :)

Today will be day two with completely no alcohol. Yesterday I got a sponsor quit my job as a bartender and readmitted myself into the sobriety home that I once managed. It feels good to be sober this morning still not at 100% but I'm here. And I will not drink with you today. 
Good Morning! Iwndwyt!.
Just requested a badge reset but waited til I made it past day two just to be sure. Bring on day 3 -- I will not drink with any of you today.
Checking in from NYC. 94 Days. IWNDWYT.
3 weeks! Not doing to drink today. Do not miss it right now. Proud of that 3 week mark and feeling even better than I did the last time I hit this point. 
I will not drink with you today!
won't drink today
Only thing stronger than my alcoholism is my workaholism. So I'm taking my first few days off in years to plant my mutha fucking garden and I will not drink with you (awesome and inspiring people) today.
Not giving up and still trying...messed up Saturday and Monday but not tonight! The every other day cycle has got me wrapped....so I'm going to get to day three if I don't drink today or tonight. Hopefully I'll get too tired from the yard work that I'll just go to bed!IWNDWYT
60 days for me today.  I CANNOT believe I've gone this long.  Longest I've ever gone since I started regularly drinking and I am over 40.  So that's a lot of booze . . . ..IWNDWYT!
Happy hump day everyone!  I will not drink with you today!

Checking in to say I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink with you today 
I'm 4 days in to challenging myself to practice yoga every day. I've replaced alcohol with pursuing passion. ..Sometimes it sucks. Sometimes I sink and feel sad. Usually that's when the alcohol would come in. Now instead I sit with it. I let it enter. Inevitably it passes and peace returns. Everything in life is impermanent. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today! Unless you've got a pack of La Croix you'd be willing to share.  
Not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today! 
Not drinking with you all today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with y'all today! 
GOOD MORNING AND HAPPY HUMP DAY!! I will not drink with you today :)
Getting easier...I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
 
I've been tracking getting to day 10 with my wife.  It was a mark on the wall to get through the phase where there may still be alcohol in my body.  Today is day 10.  I've had a couple scares over the weekend but my mind is definitely right this time.  Listening to this naked mind for the second time in 2 weeks.  Gotta undo the conditioning.  I will not drink with you all today.
Forgiving myself is/was one of my toughest challenges. I say is/was because I have addressed and forgiven many past mistakes but regret all of those lost years I try not to think about this .  It's much easier to forgive now because I'm sober and I've jumped back into the I'm happy to be alive bandwagon. I've had a solid 6 years of sobriety until 2011 and am grateful for those lessons that have helped me so much in the present rather than being pissed at myself for falling off the boat. Have a great day SDers! You can do this and it's so worth it. I will not drink with though today! 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today! Day 9 and fighting the urge with some good ole fashion running and ice cream! Booyah!
IWNDWYT  
Not drinking today!
Got up extra early just to enjoy my morning cup of coffee and relax a little bit longer before starting my day. Planning on picking up a book I have on hold at the library after work today so my evening is booked solid! (Yeah terrible pun and I'm not apologizing). ..I will not drink with you today! 
Love the message about forgiveness and being kind to ourselves..I won't be drinking today.
I will not drink with you today...I've got the new "Beauty and the Beast" movie to finish I've got a fancy dinner to make I've got a lot to do and alcohol would only get in my way. I got too much life to live to drink with you or anyone today.
Good morning.  Not drinking today 
I will not drink today. I'm losing my fucking mind though. 
I will not drink with you today
I won't drink today
Iwndwyt

Officially day 3 for me and I feel great!  ..The puffiness around my eyes is subsiding already and I slept like a baby last night....easily. (Except when my dogs got me up but even that didn't bother me like it used to)..Why didn't I do this YEARS ago??  I will not drink with you today!!
Checking in as I make my way through Day 4. Going to keep things simple. I just want to be around people making a daily effort to stay sober. This community has been a huge part of that thank you all!..IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today. But COME ON LIVERPOOL FC!!!! The semi final awaits if we can conquer Man City. YNWA!!!!

I will not drink today!
I will not drink today. 
What can I say.  ..1st Week was full of cravings for crap food probably the trade off for calories. ..2nd Week now every morning starts off ok and energetic and by lunch time I feel irritated and bored.  ..Oh well keep on?
Happy hump day. I'm making my way down my to do list. I did something today that took a lot of courage. I found a mental healthcare professional to get some help. I felt like my sobriety was in danger I was tempted to self medicate but instead I called the doc. :).It was uncomfortable to do but I'm proud that I did. Here's to being proactive in our sobriety! I will not drink with you today. Happy Wednesday.
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT

I'm having an awful day at work and while I'd normally already be planning on picking up wine on my way home tonight I will not drink with you today. This is my longest stretch of sobriety since November and I'm not losing it.
Thanks for sharing that powerful quote of compassion. IWNDWYT!.

IWNDWYT 
Hey SD. Last night I told my parents I quit drinking!..I know this isn't a big deal to some people but I was dreading the conversation for no good reasons...As I should have expected they were very supportive and understanding. . .Afterwards I was talking with my brother and he was also very receptive that I quit. I was waiting to tell him because I'm going to visit him tomorrow but he asked if I still drank Tito's and so I figured it was the perfect opening to tell him...All in all I'm glad it is out there in the open now. I have an amazing family who has always been there for me so I couldn't be happier. ..Thanks for listening...IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today.
Happy hump day! I will not drink today!

Checking in having my morning coffee at 2pm baby girl decided to be a total night owl so we we're up until 3am singing songs and dancing.  Anyone remember Raffi? My Google home played it randomly and I was all OMG! Blast from my past. Lol. I won't drink with you fine folks today! ..I digress- a challenge I am currently working on is silencing my inner monologue that literally never stops. Trying meditation today after yoga. Gotta start somewhere! 
Very tired. Gonna have a nice bubble bath and an early night. I will not drink with you today.

Checking in! Hope everyone has a good day! 
Not drinking with you today  
Here again! 
Had a drinking and using dream last night. I got drunk and did drugs in the dream and thought "damn I have to reset and start over. I have to call my sponsor." I'm grateful it was only a dream but it's left me worried about my sobriety. I haven't been to many meetings lately. Haven't been focusing explicitly on my recovery. I think I am blindly heading into a danger zone. I think I need to go to a meeting tonight...Anyway I'm not expecting anyone to read this. Just feels good to express what's going on in writing. I will not drink y'all today.
It's been 5 days and I gotta say I'm hardly thinking about alcohol. It's nice! Seems like all my trying has resulted in my coping skills getting stronger...How are you guys doing?..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today
checking in feeling good today. Positive thoughts to everyone.
Checking in late but IWNDWYT!  Had a box of wine left in my fridge that I kept saying "Oh I'll throw it out with the next trash trip". HA.  I made a special trip this afternoon to get that out of my apartment.  I know what part of my brain was trying to keep that inside my home.
Late for me but I will not drink with you today!
Checking in. I will not drink with you today.

Another great day of not drinking in the bag
Hello sobernauts .It's been 106 days for me now. I'm happy to report that I am going strong. One day at a time. I don't know what else to say other than life feels good. Thank you all for posting. Keep it up. IWNDWYT!!!
