I hadn't weighed myself since I stopped drinking because i was convinced I'd gained weight. I was a hard liquor drinker and only mixed with club soda and I've been eating garbage since getting sober.  I've struggled with my weight my whole life but I'd lost about 40 lbs and was dreading seeing my weight increase. ..So today I bit the bullet and stepped on the scale and I've still managed to lose five pounds!  Not sure how but I'll take it!  Still another 25 to go but my body is obviously loving not being damaged on a daily basis!  Anyway still time to start eating better and exercising more but it was a nice surprise! IWNDWYT

Awesome!  It's nice to know that when splurging on calories at least it's not on top of wasted alcohol calories.  
Hurray ! IWNDWYT 
Wow that's amazing! My weight has stayed the same but I'm way less bloated and puffy. Hopefully I can lose some weight soon.
