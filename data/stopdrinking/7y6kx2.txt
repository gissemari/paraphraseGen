good morning beautiful tribe. i tend to look for silver linings in all things. looking for the one wrapping around 20+ years of alcohol abuse. ..i feel like i have been really slaying at work and so much more patient with colleagues and others around me. ( except for some notable temper tantrums that were really aimed at myself.)..i am used to pushing through my fog confusion sickness and irritability to hold on to my livelihood. so i am used to being really effortful to rise above my sickness to survive for a few hours every day to make sure i deserve the paycheck. ..i am thinking that struggling with the sickness for so long might have given me some different kinds of muscles that combined with sobriety have brought me to  really good place... like in a strange way i have some strengths now that i would not have had if i never suffered from the sickness...just a thought. ..have a great day. stay strong. be in the moment. surf those urges until you land on the beach again. ..i w n d w y t. ..

Thank you for the post this is a great perspective. My partner is always telling me how strong I must have been and am now to fight this battle (we didn't meet until I was already close to a year sober) and I have never been able to see that strength especially any strength that came from before my sobriety. I really appreciate your perspective here it's helping me to understand :) iwndwyt
I've seen others post on here that they now feel like they're playing in easy mode when they were doing it in hard mode for so long.  Seems like a similar sentiment and I totally agree with both ways of thinking about it!
