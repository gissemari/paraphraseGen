Out celebrating with my classmates for finishing with our final test that gets us out of here and really struggling not drinking. I keep trying to convince myself I can.

Be the good guy and offer to dd? I would try to thin about what hell I've caused dining and how horrible week one was &amp; always is for me. ..-putting flammable substances in my body will cause fire-
You can do this. Every time I say no thanks and go home tired and sober I feel amazing!!! It's like a super power. 
You can do this.  Congrats on finishing your last test.  Time flies.  The odds are you won't even see these people anymore as everyone goes there own way.  Congrats on going the sober way.  I won't drink with you today.
