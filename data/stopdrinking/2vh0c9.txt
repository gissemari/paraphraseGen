check yourself son..oh this silence hurts deep..cant eat cant talk or sleep..sobriety dont make it alright..dont stop worrying at night..but i tell myself thats alright..cause each morning brings new light..though she said see ya later..for this is russan roulette and i aint a player..she said check yourself son..you aint you not the same one! ..youve kicked the whiskey but your still a drunk..if life were about skimming it youve got a slam dunk!..so i back away and remember what its all about..though i dont lie i dont scream or shout..i still oozes the drunkness of this unfairness..i try to carry the world and i cant bare this!..so i let go be silent but still...be at peace again refill my jar of will..for fear of taking the old path once again..though your silence beer never was my friend!..so each day check i incase i end up running..for there aint no life in a bottle in bumming!

It seems that poetry is a good outlet for your feelings.  Some people find journaling helps too.  Whatever works for you. Keep fighting the good fight.
