I have been lurking in this subreddit for a few weeks envious of all you quitters wondering if I had what it takes to stopdrinking after more than a decade of it with alcohol such an integral part of my life and my friends' and family's lives.  Finally after a particularly horrible week of drinking and hangovers I stopped drinking for the first time in my life.  I was sober yesterday and I plan to be sober today.  ..I want to remember my evenings not struggle to piece together snippets of shitty memory.  I want to be fully present and content during my workday instead of irritated scowling hurting chugging water and wishing I were in bed.  I want to feel connected and helpful to my friends and family not numb to them.  I want to remember their words and our shared experiences.  I want to read more learn everything create stuff cook lovely meals take beautiful pictures.  I want to be my best self for my husband.  I *need* to stop wasting every moment in a fog wasted or hungover so that I can begin to experience what very short life I still have ahead of me.  ..**Thank you all for inspiring me!  I really appreciate this community.  <3**
