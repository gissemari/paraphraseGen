Hello Reddit /r/SD!..I'm currently polishing off the last of what I hope is my last drink -- but I've said that before. I just... I just hope I don't say it again...I've been drinking too much for 2 years now and I need to stop before I have to deal with health implications. I've had a week here or a week there in the interim but I always relapse and it leads to a binge...What are your tips for getting through the first week? I hope to be active here from now on because I'm ready to admit that I have a problem with drinking.

First off...Pour out every bit of booze in house...
Welcome back!..I had help from my doctor to detox safely and that helped me get through the difficult first week or two.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....I spent a lot of time reading/watching/listening to everything I could find about addiction and recovery in order to fully understand what I was dealing with and get some inspiration for what to do about it.....There's tons of stuff on YouTube about the neuroscience of addiction which is really fascinating.....Apart from that healthy eating exercise keeping busy and finding rewarding meaningful activities to fill up all the free time you'd otherwise be mindlessly boozing are all good ideas!..It often takes a few goes for sobriety to stick so if at first you don't succeed keep trying......Keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Ok so my first week was no booze in the house and I also stayed home to avoid temptation. I stocked up on sugary snacks and soda for cravings. Read alcohol explained all the time. Haunted this sub lurking to keep myself honest. You got this. After the first week it gets easier.
