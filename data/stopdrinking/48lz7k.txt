----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  Started a new job in my field and i loved my first day.  Im going to get 32 hours a week that works exactly with my school schedule and as long as I do well I never have to work at fucking dominos again.  Plus 3 weeks sobriety is pretty tight..Struggle:  Court and school are both boning me with fines and community service.  I understand I did the wrong thing and Im happy to repay my debt to society but that doesnt mean it isnt an incredible financial burden.  ..General:  Favorite color is purple by far.  Blue a close second most of my clothes are blue.  Just reread that "by far" "close second"  Im so prone to exaggeration lol...Also I cant stop listening to The Life of Pablo.  Really like this album dont get at me Kanye haters this aint the sub fa dat..Edit:  ALso made friends with a stray cat near my new job gave him a bite of my tuna sandwich.  He wont let me pet him....yet.  But ima cuddle that bitch one of these days god willing
Triumph: Been working out this week! Proud of myself because I am NOT strong at all and was super intimidated. ..Struggle: College midterms looming and I desperately need to find a job for graduation :/..General Chat: Not caucusing since I'm foreign and my favorite colour is Army Green.
Triumph: ..I made it to 60 days! Hurrah. I really wavered over the last week but dealt with the extremely insidious thought patterns that were cropping up. Hopefully I'll be more decisive with them when they return...I also remembered to get a card for Mothering Sunday which is one step closer to arranging a present. Going to be an organised daughter this year who doesn't do things last minute. These were the things I always used to forget and/or resent having to do (got in the way of what *I* wanted to do like drink more!)...Struggle:..I'm so tired. I have some sort of virus thingy that's playing havoc with my nose and throat and in turn my sleep. The last few nights have been full of chaotic dreams and nightmares and I'm exhausted. I usually don't deal well with anything when tired but I'm surviving this one better than usual. ..I'm not American so no caucusing for me. It sounds like an intriguing and odd way of doing things. Election time is so stressful so I feel for all of you living it at the moment.   
I'm not drinking today.
Good morning! On day 4. I'm female. Morning and work are going good because I'm not hungover or anxious. I struggle afterwork though. I would open a beer before I even took my shoes off so I have to find other ways to unwind between 5 and 8. Im not going to drink today. Hope everyone has a wonderful wednesday! 
Triumph: made it two consecutive weekends without drinking (shockingly avoiding the bar helps me not drink!) girlfriend is on board with my effort to not drink one day at a time getting better quality sleep (which is also due to working out more another sober benefit)...Struggles: the clarity has led to more instrospection which while needed is... rough. Doing a mental tabulation of the money and opportunities I have squandered over the past 17 years is tough. Even writing out 17 years right now sucked since I'm only 33. Eff it what's done is done. Just have to be thankful that I have my health a job (that might not be a career but that provides a roof over my head and food) and the love and support of my family and friends.
Starting day one again with the my first badge. Day is just getting along but I have expectations work will be manageable. ..Scared honestly but I have more hope trying to quit than I do just giving in. With that little said LET'S DO THIS!
Triumph: Running almost 6kms straight.Struggle: Passive-aggression co-workers.Caucusing: No cause I am Australian also what the hell is going on over there?.Colour: Blackyes I know it is a shade. .
**Triumph** Continuing to make small financial goals. Work is great love the new facility!..**Struggle** Still working many hours 58 to 70 this week *yikes*. Battling a temp I believe it is a cold but will do a UA tonight. So needless to say I am a grumpy little squirrel. ..**General Chat** I am and I am very passionate about my politics. ..It depends my favorite color for decorating is earth tones and blues Clothing is dependent on my mood. I love looking at bright and reds. I really don't dislike any color they all are beautiful in the right place. . 
Your struggle? Josephine is a girl squirrel.... 
Triumph:.-I'm in a very good mood today.-I read for over an hour last night.-I made a delicious cake last night also..Struggle:.-I gained back 10 lbs of the 25 lbs I lost.-I think I'm coming down with something..General Chat:.-My favorite color is green. A quiet forest green. It gives me an instant mood boost.
What is your favorite color /u/dancing-lobsters?
Triumph: I'm feeling a lot better and more hopeful about my life. I'm actually making plans...Struggle: Monstrously sick with a cold still. I just want to be in bed but have a ton of work to do...General chat: Finding a new apartment suuuuucks.
**Triumph:** Still sober past a month... Yay!.**Struggle:** Winter doldrums - trying to keep it from becoming full-on depression but it's truly a struggle. Also complacency. My mental state is urging me to chill-out with a glass....**General:** Green. I like most shades of green but my favorite is the deep healthy green of a mature fern or ivy found in the woods.
Triumph:  Proud of hitting 90 days sober yesterday and that I have lost 30 lbs since I stopped drinking...Struggle:  Work has been ok but unfulfilling... working on that...General:  Will be in Atlanta with my wife at a conference until Monday.  Looking forward to a few days away and seeing some new things...My favorite color is dark orange like burnt orange...
Triumph: still no alcohol in my apartment. I'm 3 days in! My face feels less poofy which is weird it's just been 3 days. And work is going good..Struggle: people are talking about St Patrick's day and drinking at work and I really am craving because of it right now. This is hard..Favorite color: does Navy blue count? I like wearing that color.
I choose not to drink today!.
Triumph: things continue to be awesome. I've been going to boxing classes again and am already starting to look better. Getting some much wanted muscle definition and now that I'm sober I have better form and throw better punches than a few years ago when I was actually training for a match. Everything I do is just easier now mostly because I don't over think every little thing I do. I've learned that my body knows more about some things than I do and I've handed over the reigns. The new job is great now that I've gotten past all the negativity at work. I just go in there and remain positive and hope the other people I'm with that day can follow my lead most days they do. ..Struggles: N/A..General Chat: with spring around the corner it's time to get my bike to the shop. I've been riding it all winter and my drive train is looking a little rusty probably time for at least a new chain. I really hope I can get some quality time on the bike paths this summer. 
**Triumph:** Depression hit me hard and fast last week. I coped deployed my tools and actually dealt with it better than I ever had before. Progress!..It was a week of break-throughs. Got to see (and help) friends make breakthroughs in their personal lives. Got my turn on a run and in yoga class. I've been floating on those feelings for a couple days...**~~Struggle:~~** Nope I'm just gonna float..**Chat:** Blues. Oh and reds. And greens and yellows and creams browns oranges...
**Triumph:** I told about not drinking to someone not close to me (though I could have done it in a better way)..**Struggle:** I have more moments of "fuck I'm supposed to be sober until I die"...**Chat**: Yellow. It has always been an unpopular color and people don't often wear it. I used to have a yellow tshirt collection. I guess I like yellow just to piss off people.
Just checking in. I'm fully committed to not drink today. Plus I made a doctor's appointment to go over my blood and urine test that I did few months ago but never made a follow up appointment. I need a new doctor. I'm always in a struggle with my current one. 
Triumph: My liver and stomach pains are finally gone. I'm starting to write and play music again. Also recently started helping my friend by drawing cartoons for his zine...Struggle: I'm still too afraid to go to a doctor to find out what was/is going on with my liver. I need to start looking for a second job or go back to school for the summer mostly to fill time. Need to get my school transfer stuff done too but I haven't been to school in two years so I'm afraid I won't be able to transfer anywhere....
Triumph: Made it to class last night...Struggle: Trying to distance myself from parents. Car has oil leak from an unknown source and apartment complex says i cant have it parked there until fixed. Could take several days. Only means of transportation...I like earthtones. They are the easiest to match.
**Triumph:** I'm learning about more and more of my old friends who have chosen sobriety including people I used to party hard with. I'm becoming more comfortable reaching out to them. they've been incredibly supportive and happy to hear from me. I realized I can't sit around and wait for people I need to actively reach out when I need help or conversation...**Struggle:** FUCK YOU ALLERGIES..**General Chat:** my favorite color is a bold cheerful orange as evidenced by my [wedding bouquet and shoes](http://i.imgur.com/d630mFu.jpg) :) I was definitely the orangest person at City Hall. 
Weather is getting nicer!  
Day 2 done and dusted ..Triumph - Feeling well rested more cheerful and more positive than I have in a while..Struggle - also feeling like a fat sack of shit who'll relapse soon. Just not tomorrow 
Triumph:I'm feeling good for not having drunk any alcohol for 16 days. I'm preparing for a graduate recital and simply don't have time to waste on drinking. I have also gotten lots of compliments on my attitude and general appearance. Turns out not being uncomfortable grumpy and puffy changes how you act and how you are perceived...Struggle: My struggle is also the afore-mentioned recital. I'm way behind on memorization. I have 18 days to get it memorized polished and performable. Also I am currently on my way back home from a funeral week for my grandma. ..General: There is a handsome boy who wants to see me when I get back home and I'm excited for a first kiss and time spent together. I've also had lots of time to read on this trip and it's made me happy to jump back into something I have always loved.
Triumph: today is going to be one week once it's over. I feel like an emotional wreck half the time but that's ok :) I'm thrilled to have made it this far..-both of the doctors I work for (as a vet tech) took me aside separately today to tell me they appreciate me and how great of a tech I am and how much they appreciate working with me. Felt awesome..Struggle: turns out being sober doesn't fix the depression and whatnot that led to alcoholism in the first place so...that's in the back of my mind constantly and I'm making a game plan to get that handled..Happy healthy can't complain about a thing!!..Favorite color is pink because I'm a cliche girl ;)
Triumph:..60 consecutive days without alcohol. I haven't done that since I was 16 (now 44)..Finding it easier to stay focused with work...Struggle:..My business website isn't anywhere near as effective as I thought it would be. Almost back to the drawing board I think....Not getting out on my bike as much as I would like. Fitness stalling as a result...General Chat:..I don't have a favourite colour!
Triumph: I actually made it to work on time today even though the last thing I wanted to do this morning was get out of bed. ..Struggle: Worried about a good friend of mine. There's definitely something going on with them that they're not being honest about and it's incredibly frustrating. ..General chat: I always wear black/charcoal grey/red but my favorite colors are actually really bright and obnoxious. Like weird puke green and hot pink together. 
Triumph: was off of work today so I ended up cleaning the whole house and filled out an application for a new job...Struggle: the last four months have been rough. I moved in with my parents a couple of years ago because I was killing myself with drinking. I've been up and down the last couple years. Four months ago my step dad died. I've been an absolute mess. Which has been hurting my mom who's already hurting. Anyways....General: favorite color depends on my mood. I've stopped playing video games for awhile now because of depression. Maybe I'll pop in fallout 4. I'm a huge rooster teeth fan. I work as a volunteer at their convention every year in Austin. 
Yay hump day!..Triumphs: doing well at work. I've been in a much better mood since getting sober. Overcame a really big alcohol craving today. I've been going to the gym and walking more! My puppy is starting to learn commands like sit no etc. I spent a lot of time last weekend training him - instead of drinking :) ..Struggle: insomnia. Soooo bad. I never realized how much alcohol helped me sleep. Been drinking chamomile tea at night but it's not strong enough. ..Chat: Favorite color? They're all pretty. But I like green.
