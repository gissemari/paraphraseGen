Hey there..I've been lurking in this sub for too long without actually doing anything about my drinking habit..There was always an excuse to delay the only thing I was supposed to do...I came across a post that really hit me hard and it finally clicked with me...It is day one for me..It's almost 10PM here and I'm trying not to do anything stupid..I really want to though...I'm still struggling.

What helped me through the first nights and days: milk chocolate cookies and tv shows.
The beginning is hard at moments but worth it.  The mind divided is a battleground. Focusing on my commitment to be free of its shackles today makes it easier at least that's how it works for me...IWNDWYT 
Keeping busy is key. Take one day at a time and pop in here for support and inspiration. ..Je ne boirai pas avec toi aujourd'hui!
Glad you're here!  Welcome!
Congratulations! I too am on day one. I only found this site today and already feel massively supported. Will read for a while and hopefully sleep. You can do this.
