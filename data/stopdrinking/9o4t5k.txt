My cousin who i grew up with since we was young is suffering from alcoholism real bad this past 3 years. That's why i want to quit drinking because i see the harm it has caused him going through withdrawls and relapsing again hearing voices tellimg him to drink. I can tell you guys that alcohol is the devil in luquid form i don't wish this on nobody not even my worst enemy. You are stronger than this you can win this battle believe in yourself and you will overcome this that's what i'm tellimg him all the time do whatever it takes to get this bad habbit out of your guys and girls i wish you all strenght and the willpower this win this journey. Sorry for my bad english. Be safe and may god be with you all the time!
