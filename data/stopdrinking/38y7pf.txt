I've been seeing a therapist lately and he mentioned something in passing that was very telling. I was telling him about my latest relapse and he seemed very concerned. I told him I utilized SD for a virtual support which he said was great BUT if I don't get into a face to face group my chances of relapsing again are a lot higher. ..At the end of the session he said "you can't afford to be lazy". This was very telling to me. Going to group support meetings seems like work to me and thus I end up being lazy and not wanting to go. But if I continue to be lazy the consequences are limitless...Don't be lazy and join me today in working towards a lifetime of sobriety!

&gt; I told him I utilized SD for a virtual support which he said was great BUT if I don't get into a face to face group my chances of relapsing again are a lot higher. ..I don't think that's true.  Invite him to read through the results of our 300+ question survey.  I'm not able to explain  the numbers right now but there is very little to no difference between the groups once you account for the fact that SD was only two years old at the time.  ..The common thread is participation.  People who get active in their recovery have a better shot. It does not seem to matter whether the participation is online or face to face...All of that said some people need face to face contact.  If you're one of those people the stats say nothing about YOU and your recovery. Do whatever it is you need to do.   
I do both - this sub and face to face. Each one has its own special set of gifts to me so I won't try to compare or dissect what exactly it is that I get from each of these methods of support to determine which one is best. All I know is that "it doesn't hurt to have both" is an understatement for me. I'm someone who wants to take all the help she can get.
