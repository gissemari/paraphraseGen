Hi all I'm new here and have been reading your posts.  I had six years of sobriety and relapsed last fall.  I let my emotions and stress control my actions and I feel really bad like I gave up my sober time that I was proud of.  I've been to rehab I've done outpatient and therapists along my journey in sobriety.  IF you think it has been long enough and you surely are not an alcoholic anymore you are so very wrong.  Don't do it please.  I'm happy to not drink with you all today!  Blessings to you all.
