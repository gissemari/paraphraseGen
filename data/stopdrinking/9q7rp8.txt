Yesterday i made an ass out of myself again. For years I've been saying to myself that i don't have a problem and everyone goes overboard on alcohol in their college years. I'm a binge drinker I basically have no desire to drink alcohol if I'm not in a social setting. The problem is that when i drink i almost always get plastered have blackouts and do crazy shit that make my sober self miserable. I'm pretty sure that there are underlying issues that make me use alcohol as a crutch but I'm not ready to open that Pandora's box yet..  To be completely honest I have visited this subreddit couple of times before when I was crippled by anxiety the next day after a big binging night.  The whole "one day at a time" thing doesn't really apply to me since as I said I can go as much as i want without alcohol if I don't go for a night out but I think that even if I had such a problem that mindset would ruin me it's a constant reminder of how much of a daily struggle it is to help yourself..  I know that the only solution is to "just stop drinking" I don't even know why I'm writing this I guess i just wanted to get this off my chest...P.S. English is not my mother tongue so excuse my awkward phrasing at some points.

I wrote a post just like yours.  I really felt bad about making an ass out of myself in public.  It is so embarrassing and humiliating and I just hate myself for looking like such a pathetic loser and my wife was there.  It's just awful to do that.  Reading this sub helps me a lot.  I am not the only one who has done such things and I am not alone.  I'm just gonna focus on not drinking today.  I hope something gels for you my friend.  I'm getting old and want to hold on to a little dignity.
