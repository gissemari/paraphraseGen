For many nights in the past few weeks I've had dreams where alcohol has been involved; usually there's a gathering an event of sorts a sense of adventure maybe too - and someone offering me a drink or having one themself. I don't recall ever having drank in these dreams but last night I think I accepted the drink but didn't drink it. ..The reason I am posting this is that consciously I have zero desire to drink. I don't want to go there any more. But subconsciously I seem to be yearning for the adventurous nights I used to have (like maybe +10 years ago) as I haven't really found social circles without alcohol during weekend nights. Also around 4 to 5 months is where I've usually relapsed and iirc I've had these dreams before. ..Anyone with similar neutral(ish) dream experiences?
