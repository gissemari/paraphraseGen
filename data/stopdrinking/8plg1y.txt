I posted a couple days ago about how I've been thinking a lot about "trying again" i.e. relapsing. Several people responded and were very helpful. Thank you! The thoughts kept coming though. I just got off the phone with a very good friend who no longer lives near me but who has also quit drinking. We just chatted for a bit about how it's hard how our brains deceive us etc. It was so helpful! I might need to try AA again...

AA saved my life. It's definitely better than slowly killing ourselves by getting drunk with this poison they call alcohol. 
AA has been the saving grace of my recovery! It might be worth a shot &lt;3
