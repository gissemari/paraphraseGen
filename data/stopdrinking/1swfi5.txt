got a DUI. that prompted me to quit cold turkey. it was difficult as you probably know...I was able to keep my job thankfully. Because the monetary penalties are not small...I originally got sober at 21. I stayed sober for 12 years. ..I lost a great job in 2009. Then I relapsed. ..I had been trying to work as a programmer for small funds and financial firms but my drinking interfered with success there. Then I'd drink more causing more problems.  It was a circular process or downward spiral. ..I plan now to go back to graduate school while working part time. It's difficult to keep positive when I shafted myself and made an unfortunate situation significantly worse. ..Even though I consider my life at the moment far from where I'd like it to be it's far better than it could be as a result from my drinking. I need to remain grateful. It's said grateful people are happy people. ..Thanks for reading and good luck with your program!
