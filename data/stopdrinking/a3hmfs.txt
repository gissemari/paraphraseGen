Hello..I went out to throw the trash and ended up going for a walk. I felt nervous and sad so I decided to get on a bus and went to a nearby city where no one knows me. I have to stay here 7 hours more until the next bus arrives. I know or at least hope I won't relapse because I have a Naltrexone pill with me...It's not the first time I do something like this. I'm bored waiting for the venue to open.. A simple walk sends me a city away for a most probably boring night alone.. I hate how little control I have. Wish I could go back in time.. But now I can only try to have fun or stay on the streets until the next bus comes in 7 hours..

Interesting idea best of luck. Be careful with naltrexone and IWNDWYT 
Yep i hear you. I got dance lessons for this. I drive dance alone do not want to talk to anyone just shake out that feeling. I am blessed in that i don't want to drink. But i still check in with someone so i have a commitment in real life to be sober (and enjoy myself without guilt) ..But i understand that restless feeling and hope you can find safe ways to express it. If you don't feel safe i hope you can find the strength to go for a run or a movie or anything but drink. 
I'm already home. Got some guys to give me a ride.. Another sober day and I'm grateful for that.
