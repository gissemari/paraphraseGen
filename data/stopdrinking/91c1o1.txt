Being in my 30s and having moved an hour away I'm fortunate enough to say that I still have a few hometown friends that I've known for decades at this point.  I've blown off planning things with them so many times because I'd rather be with my bar friends (who turned out to be losers for the most part) or didn't have money (was spending it all at the bar).  ..Today I got hit up asking if I'd want to go to a show next month. Old me would have been filled with dread and anxiety like how am I going to say no this time??  But today I said yes for what feels like the first time in forever  and  I'm buying my friend's ticket to the show for her birthday present.  ..I used to be so much more social and have great memories of shows and trips from before the bar and poor spending habits made me live paycheck to 5 days before payday.  I didn't even realize until now how much anxiety I had in my day to day life.  It really makes you become a prisoner to yourself.  It's a freeing feeling to actually think you know what I think I will go to that show.  That actually sounds like a good time.  ..If you are struggling today ask yourself when the last time you said yes to something just for the hell of it was.  I can't even remember for myself but I promise being chained financially and physically to alcohol does not help.  I will not drink with you today.
