After my last relapse I blew up my businessprobably my marriage and ended up in rehab. I finally am getting back financially have a good job and felt down all day. Like if this is it why not check out I listened to dear mr.fantasy which made me cry because all I want to do is drink bourbon with a bunch of benzos. I didn't and will go to a meeting tomorrow but damn feelings like that are what make it  so hard for me.

I can totally relate to wanting to get totally wasted when I feel depressed and hopeless. I never drank when I was happy. I drank when I was lonely or angry or depressed. I drank to stop feeling. It's hard to sit through those emotions and feel them instead of numbing it with liquor. But we're better off for it. Congrats on not drinking tonight! I'm joining you even though it's hard. Have you tried journaling?
Congratulations!  Great milestone!...Also: haven't thought about "Low Spark" in many years!  Just revisited because of your Nom de guerre.  Thanks!
