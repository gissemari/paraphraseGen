I was wondering if and when this would happen. Almost two weeks in and this is beginning to feel normal. I know the struggle isn't over and I'm not close to having this beat but I have confidence and lack of fear I didn't have before. I'm not dreading tonight knowing I won't drink (a new ps4 in my freshly cleaned office helps). My wife got teary eyed at dinner last night talking about my progress. We have another date tonight at a nice place with mocktails. Giddy up!
