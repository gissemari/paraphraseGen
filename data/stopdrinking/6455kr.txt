My neighbours have asked us over for a drink. I miss that warm relaxed feeling. I feel annoyed and jealous.

I'm glad you posted because I've been wondering how you were doing. It sucks to feel jealous and annoyed - like everyone else on the planet can enjoy something and you can't. Makes me want to activate Toddler Mode. :)..That said the reality of that situation for *me* is this: I would go over and have 1-2 drinks. I would feel relaxed after the first sip or two because of Science. I know the way that alcohol affects the brain. That is beyond my control. But I would probably accept a second drink. At that point I would feel fuzzy. Buzzed. Start saying things I normally wouldn't because my ability to filter would be impaired. Okay. Go home &amp; chug water and eat a healthy dinner right? ..The worst part is I would go home feeling slightly high and I would have another 2-4 drinks. Those social drinks would just prime me for a night of drinking. I would be "too tired" to cook so I'd eat crackers or something else quick &amp; unhealthy. I'd snack and drink until I would pass out on the couch neglecting all of my responsibilities to my family. I would probably be angry at whoever woke me to transfer my body from the couch to my bed later that night. ..And if I were **lucky** I would JUST wake up feeling shameful and sad. I might also wake up with a pounding headache. At the end I was getting the ones that make you want to die. Nauseated completely. My insides sore and painful. On and on and on. And then I'd probably have another drink around 3-4 p.m. to feel "better." ..When I think it through I am not annoyed that I have to give that up. I am thankful. And I am not jealous or envious of that person. That person is very misguided and so I give her help. ..I hope you feel better today.
