Not sure if this allowed but here is the post. This guy sounds like he is hurting bad...http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23awzm/probably_going_to_jail_for_a_few_years_to_anyone/..I'm also struggling with lost relationships addiction depression and suicidal thoughts. I can only imagine how this guy is feeling with a history of violence and prospects of jail. I don't want to see /r/stopdrinking lose anyone.
