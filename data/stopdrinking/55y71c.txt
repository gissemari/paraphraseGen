I have been struggling with alcoholism for the past 2 years.  Since then I have decided that I would like to join the military (in hopes of getting my shit together).  I spoke with a recruiter today.  Everything checked out except that I have celiac disease.  Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which anything that I ingest with wheat rye or barley is poison to my intestines.  I have to be gluten free and this is a red flag to the military.  Just as I thought I was making progress it turns out I cannot do what I want to do.  Just when I thought I could get clean I was turned away.  I do not know where else to turn.

Bummer. So how do they diagnose Celiac's disease out of curiosity? Reason for asking is if consuming gluten causes the numbers to show in a blood test I guess you could just go gluten free for a while and then the numbers might look good?
I'm sorry joining the military didn't happen. ..I've been working my way towards a sober life with the help of this sub. Others have benefited from AA/SMART meetings seeing a therapist/counselor and/or rehab. 
I understand your disappointment...All is not lost!..I'm a veteran.  I would make a list of all the "things" I thought the military was going to be the answer to or source of...Want to share that here?..There are many other places where those attributes are available...I'd be willing to bet that 'whatever you're looking' for people here could recommend where that may be found outside the military...There are lot's of way to serve...Whadda ya think?
