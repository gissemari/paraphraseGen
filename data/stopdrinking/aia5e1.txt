Ive been sober since januari 1st a lot of my friends do dry januari and I dont think they are fully aware off my forever-dry decision. Its hard and I struggle some days. And when they ask me to plan social events where there will be alcohol and people drinking I stress about it.. .

Way to go on 21! Keep going! The good I found in sobriety...I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's worth it! IWNDWYT 
Congrats!  It's all about you!  In the early days a lot of people follow dry people and dry things.  Let's not worry about tomorrow until we get there.  IWNDWYT
Why would they ask you to plan things where there will be alcohol. Can't they plan things themselves? Lol
Kudos on 21 That's tough as Hell.  You've got to put your recovery first before work before friends Hell even before family.  This shit is literally life or death and I know you don't know me but what I do know is you ARE worth it.  The real ones will understand some may not but just think of this as a great opportunity to figure out who's really down for the cause down for you even if it doesn't benefit them.  I'm proud of you for venting here is a great habit vs bottling that shit up.  Recovery is this amazing beautiful thing that literally will give you life but is also halting frustrating messy and maddening thing at times too.  Get through today and check back in you got this shit IWNDWYT!
