Several weeks ago I relapsed - it was  okay  at first I.e. I wasn't getting too drunk etc. but once again I have found myself in the same mess as before. Anxiety and paranoia are way up blackouts and unacceptable behaviour towards strangers etc (the guilt is killing me and I am in fear of being reported or losing my job). I knew picking up the bottle again was a bad idea and knew how it would end. ..So here I am - back to Day One. ..Does anyone have any advice on how to forgive yourself and picking up the pieces after relapse?

I have told myself  So I already know how this would turn out eventually- let's not go there again.   Moving forward from down low is hard because it's just hard.. but it's worth it and it doesn't seem so hard anymore at one point.  At one point we begin to see that momentum.  Let's push ahead for that momentum we know is so good.  IWNDWYT
