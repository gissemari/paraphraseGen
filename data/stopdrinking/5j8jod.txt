I'm sorry about your friend.  I've learned not to hate myself just because I did something i regret.  Sorry that you feel so low but you should be commended for coming back so quickly.
Thank you....was just thinking I was doing ok...well two days only...but all it took was a funeral....
I'm sorry for your loss. ..It's commendable that you are back so quickly. When I find myself in tough situations I find coming here and reading about the triumphs and trials of fellow sobernauts to be really helpful. By the time I've run out of things to read or posts I can comment on the desire to drunk is usually gone. Well doing that *and* having a plan. 
Thank you all for your kind comments! Gonna start again tomorrow! .I did like how I felt sober..I mean the MORNINGS!.I love reading stories about how everyone feels in the mornings! Refreshed and all!.I love those stories!
No hating required.  You got knocked down and now you're ready to get back up - and that my friend is what life is all about.
Sorry for your loss. Its great that you stopped at one and got back on track. I'm here not drinking with you today
