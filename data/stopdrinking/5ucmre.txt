I have been pretty much coasting along for a while now. I was fine on New Year's Eve I enjoyed the second trip to Edinburgh and no longer felt sad about pubs. I've been getting through boring and stressful afternoons on business trips without wanting to get a drink. But I have taken my youngest to Rome for two nights and I really struggled to think of a good reason to not drink other than "because then I wouldn't have over 100 days sober." ..My son is 7 and has limited interest in the things that I enjoy doing most and the trip is all about him. He tires easily and I could have passed a lot of time in cafes feeding him ice cream while he played mine craft on his tablet and I could have drank. ..It's my 4th visit to Rome. Even before I was a problem drinker I associated Rome with sitting in cafes drinking wine or beer. I think if I were here on my own I could have found ways to keep myself busy. But I was thrown off my usual routine of going to the gym every day and sticking to a strict diet.  There's only so much coffee I can drink. ..I am looking forward to going home today and retreating into my routine.

I think any reason to stay sober is a good enough one :)
My first real test of my early sobriety was going to my best drinking buddy's wedding with a full open bar. I was so close to 30 days --something I'd never done since I was 13 or 14 maybe? -- and that was all the reason I needed to not drink. I really like to "win". :D
