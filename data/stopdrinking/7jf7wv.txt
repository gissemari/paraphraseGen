Hello all..I'm new here. My last drink was on sunday the 3rd of december. After yet another wild night where I ended driving 100 km drunk as hell and somehow miraculously waking home alive with aparently no signs of damage to my car I decided to take a break from the booze...First 4-5 days were hell on earth anxiety wise. (I also stopped Xanax altogether at the same time.) Then after feeling like I'm loosing my mind I decided to take magnesium B-vitamins and omega 3 to ease the debilitating feelings. I also started going back to the gym after a 6-year hiatus. My days are still roller-coasters emotionaly and mentally but seeing this crippling anxiety slowly fading away is such a soothing feeling !..Also I was really scared that I got some sort of wet brain. I got to a point where I couldn't make any decision or think even the basic stuff. I couldn't take care of basic hygiene or shop groceries or decide which clothes to put on. ..Now slowly I feel like my brain is somehow recovering. I don't know how to explain but it's like I went from a sharp mind to fully retarded during these last years (especially the last few months) and now gradually back to somehow a "decent" but not 100% functional brain yet...The only draw-back is that I feel like I'm replacing my drinking behaviour with binge eating and it starts to show already. But hitting the gym is hopefully going to help me manage the weight gain....The cravings are still pretty much here everyday several times a day (triggers everywhere when you used to drink/be drunk during your day to day life... You know what I'm talking about). They come and go. My anxiety is replaced with restlessness and frustration and inner tension but overall I feel better since a loooong time...Also I feel like a little kid re-discovering how to deal with life. ..I don't know how long I will be able to stay sober this time but I want you to know that reading all your stories even the relapse ones helps tremendously and I thank you all for that ! It gives me something to relate to and knowing that there are so many other people going through similar events in life helps to put things into perspective...Tl;dr : sober for 9 days improving mentally and emotionaly. Struggling everyday but finding help in this community.
