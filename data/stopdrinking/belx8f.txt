Had a really great day yesterday and then attended and evening with friends. Thought I would be okay and  this time would be different  ended up staying out til 430 missed class and slept till 130. Not only did I binge drink but ended up binge eating. 3 hours after waking up I still feel a bit drunk and nauseous....waiting for the real hangover to hit which for me often includes bad depression and anxiety(thank youpgd2019!)...today is gorgeous outside and I'm going to miss it!! The worst part about it is....my hangovers(and the secondary effects) as I have gotten older can last for 2-3 days...so I am fully anticipating struggling with anxiety and depression the next two days in addition to physical symptoms ..If you're out there and you have stopped drinking and are having a great day because of it I salute you! This right here is exactly why drinking is just not worth it. ..If anyone has any advice on coping with this hangover send it my way please!

I suffered like that for 35 years the key for me to getting out of that cycle was not picking up that first drink.  Alcoholics can't drink period.
