Hello guys..I feel like I'm in the early stages of an alcohol addiction and yesterday I decided to quit...A little backstory: In late October of 2018 my girlfriend of two years broke up with me. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety issues for a really long time but during our relationship it got a lot better. ..But after the breakup everything returned and hit me at once. I could not sleep or eat for days on end so I resorted to alcohol. The first month or so was the worst - I drank from the moment I woke up right until going to bed again. Most I've had was 10 beers and a bottle of liquor in one day. ..I tried to quit several times but quickly ended up going to the store to buy more although I swore I wouldn't. I tried to impose limits on myself like only drinking one beer an evening but I could never keep them. ..After that month things got a little better - my mood went up a little and I was drinking less but still every day. Up until yesterday I was feeling quite alright but I was still drinking at least three beers an evening. But yesterday due to the snow I could not make it to the store and my stash was empty so I could only drink one shot which was left in a bottle of liquor. ..Last night was horrible. I could not sleep until the early morning hours because I was craving alcohol so hard. When I noticed how dependent I had become I decided I had to quit now before it gets worse. Today is no better. ..Yesterday I had a tiny bit of alcohol at least but today I want to drink nothing at all. Since it's only been a little over two months since I started drinking every day I feel like i should really quit now before going deeper into the rabbit hole. But  I'm literally craving a drink so badly the urge to just drive to the store and buy a crate of beer is so strong. Every thought I have only revolves about alcohol and I doubt I'll get much sleep tonight...Does anyone have some advice what to do when craving? How long does it take until these cravings stop? ..Thanks for any help in advance!

Urges can happen especially in the beginning. There are a lot of tricks you can play. It helps to remember that urges always pass. Always. They cannot last forever. And all they are is discomfort. Nothing more...DEADS is an acronym that can help you remember some tricks to kill an urge. There are others...Delay escape accept distract substitute...Delay: Tell yourself that you will think about having a drink "later." Sometimes that appeases the itch and it subsides. By the time "later" arrives you could be doing something else entirely...Escape: Escape the environment that is prompting the urge. Sitting at home and suddenly start looking around the wine cabinet? Grab your coat and bolt. Hit Starbucks take a walk etc...Accept: Remind yourself that this is an urge and it will pass. "Urge surfing" It will run out of fuel and subside eventually...Distract: Give your brain something else to do. Who is your favorite character on Game of Thrones? Why?..Substitute: Swap good thoughts for bad ones. Instead of saying things like "I am getting the itch to have a drink..." say something like "OK I can handle this and it's only going to make me stronger...."..Think of fighting urges as "reprogramming" the mind. It really is a mind game at times... ..Every time you fight off an urge subsequent ones are weaker. Maybe not in a straight line but they weaken over time for sure. Just hang in there! It defintiely gets easier.
