I'm a complete mess I'm half way through the semester and I've fallen back into drinking and smoking weed regularly.. I'm not talking about falling into the party scene either. I'm a part time student (23) at a cc and full time store manager where being in complete control of my mind is so crucial but here I am finding myself recovering and cleaning up my relapse yet again... ..I left my hometown in another state to escape the friends and life I had where all we were doing was getting drunk and high not giving a fuck about tomorrow. I moved south to stay with a grandmother and attempt college without the social pressures of substance. While I've had some successes my troubles followed and I've met dealers and drank plenty. I don't have any friends my own age I normally go to work school then finish the night with my poisons. I don't know what the deal is SD I don't want to use but my self control is weak. I can foresee myself doing great things and alcohol has pulled me back long enough I just want better. I want to finish this semester out strong learn self discipline and master time management so here I am. I'm new to SD but I'm trying to find some self acceptance with my vices guys. I'm on a lonely path but I can't let myself be the reason I don't persevere

The geographic cure is not the best way to do it...mind you it sounds like you got away from some of that external pressure which is great. However for me it's something inside me (the Beast the Alcoholic Voice whatever you want to call it) that I needed to tackle because it goes with me wherever I go. As for your self-control being weak will power alone can't kick this for most of us. Maybe try writing up your goals on paper as you have here take a really good long look at where you want to be in 1 5 or 10 years...and ask yourself can I have this AND drink? The answer for me was a resounding NO. Then maybe you can check out some therapy or meetings to get an IRL support network...and take the daily pledge here and grab a badge! Best wishes.
Hey in the same boat with you! I've been fucking up bad with my drinking interfering with school this semester but I'm ready to turn it around. We can do it. Let's not drink today.
