I dreamt I relapsed again. I met with an old friend who I used to drink with havent seen her since I got sober. Ive avoided her. Anyways in the dream it was enough to just go to her place she was drinking as always and I decided we should go out and get more beer. The hellride started. Remember bits and pieces of the evening I remember smoking from a pipe that I had no idea what it was. Eventually got back home to my parents who I was visiting again they were furious apparently I had been gone three days amd not answered the phone. I looked like shit. My sisters who were visiting were shocked "We thought you were doing well! Not drinking!". And I was like "well now I was drinking. Im an alcoholic had a relapse." ..I eventually got to my rehab who I still see every week. I felt so guilty and scared. I almost didnt have the guts to see the therapist and talk to him maybe I could hide it. Eventually I felt that I just had to. So I tell him "6 months wasted I relapsed".  He knew already. I was not thrown out from rehab. ..The hungover started. All the anxiety was back worse. The regrets? The guilt the shame the feeling ill and the ground feelsnlike mud and everything is shaking just a little. And how much I wanted to drink again I had already fucked it up whats the point. It was all back. ..And I woke up. Im so thankful. Im not hungover. And i definately absolutely will not drink right today. Thank you brain for keeping me alert or what might be. Hope this could help remind someone else too.
