Today marks my fourth year. 1460 days since the very last time I used any kind of mind altering substances...The tranquility afforded by sobriety has allowed me to continue to love and respect myself and be emotionally and physically available to others. For this I'm thankful for the continued courtesy and support I receive from my loved ones. On this humble trip around the sun I intimately came to know that soberly overcoming hardship is critical to my freedom from the terminal nature of addiction...To the alcoholic who still suffers understand there is a path out of the mire. Talk to those who are privy to your struggle and know you're not alone. A sanguine life can be realized. Notably a recovering addict should not seek to impose our opinion of your habits nor do we look on those who use with contempt. In fact... to people who are able to control the doors of perception we may simply envy your abilities. ..We addicts who convalesce are a breed too strange to live yet too rare to die. On a daily basis we quiesce our desires to alter reality yet we are no closer to recovery from the moment the last drug exits our bodies until our death. These afflictions lie dormant in us like a sleeping volcano. We remain vigilant.
