Woot Woot Wednesday! Guess what day it is? [Ermahgerd!](http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/94098-Hump-Day-Camel-Meme.png)..Let's hump it out. Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I'm becoming much more comfortable with letting people know that I'm sober (as opposed to just "not drinking.") As the months pass (9 now woot!) I'm giving less and less of a shit about what other people think about me. Part of it I think is because I'm doing so well right now and there's a part of me that wants to give sobriety a bit of credit for that. Either way I'm much more open about it than I've ever been and that feels good. ..**Struggle**: I've got some basic and not-unexpected work and life stressors coming up. I kind of feel like I'm ignoring them and not really planning for their eventual outcome. I've been isolating and withdrawing a bit which is always a bit of a warning sign for me. So I'll talk about it in therapy and with friends and I won't drink. ..**General Chat**: Anybody watching Wolf Hall? Cromwell is a fascinating character. What other good TV are you guys getting into? And you know what's awesome about sobriety? I can remember what happened on last week's episode! ..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I've had a really stressful week at work so far and the thought of drinking hasn't crossed my mind.  Great success!  Also I was able to be of service on Monday by taking someone to a meeting...**Struggle:** I've had a stressful week :(..**General Chat:**  I now have more link karma than comment karma with the posting of [this image](http://i.imgur.com/cQjm5yw.jpg)  in /r/itookapicture. 
**Triumph:** When I hear about tragedies like the earthquake in Nepal it really puts things in perspective and makes me grateful for a lot of things that I otherwise take for granted. My triumphs this week are living in a safe country having a roof over my head and .easy access to food and water...**Struggle:** Work has been stressful and a little deflating. The company is going through a lot of changes but a lot of the old behaviours are preventing us from being truly successful. I'm starting to think it might be time for a change I've been here for 12 years...**General Chat:** It's not new or anything but I just started watching The Walking Dead and really like it.
**Triumph:** I've been posting about these a bit. Told my research advisor I'm a recovering alcoholic and the world didn't end and I got a bit of time off to regroup. Becoming more generous and involved. Got my husband interested in an agnostic AA group that I'm pretty sure is showing me what the definition of "home group" is.  ..**Struggle:** My sponsor is telling me that I "have" to change my AA sobriety birthday to the day that I stopped smoking pot a couple of weeks ago rather than the day of my last drink. I'm less than convinced. Can't find anything about it in the book and I'm pretty sure I joined ALCOHOLICS anonymous with a desire to stop DRINKING. I'm pretty much ready to fire her and find a better fit but I don't want to be hasty since I've spent so much of my life looking for ways to justify my drug use. Still seeking guidance on this issue...**General Chat:** My husband spotted a flyer for me in a coffee shop so I'm going to attend something called "12 step yoga" at an art studio I've been meaning to check out anyway. We will see!
**Triumph** - I have been super busy at work this week and accidentally missed my year anniversary. ..**Struggle** - still trying to get eating under control. Addiction is addiction and I still have a good addiction. Trying to make small changes and slowly wean myself off of sugar/junk food. ..**General chat** GoT anyone??
**Triumph:**  I'm 27 days sober from my last relapse I'm 8 days clean of nicotine I've broken off and ended a toxic relationship with a woman who was no good for me and my recovery I received a job offer yesterday I'm exercising every day and eating right and I went to the doctor and I'm in great physical shape right now...**Struggle:**  Oh God I am so lonely.  Unfortunately I do not have a close friend that I can just call up and say "Hey wanna hang out?" or "Hey let's go check out a movie or go hiking." etc.  So now that the toxic relationship is over I have a huge void of human contact in my life.  I do go to AA roughly 4 times a week and also Celebrate Recovery but I still have this emptiness inside of me.  Hopefully once I get a job that will help but I really want a close friend right now that I can relate to and hang out with.  Finally I am going to start hiking again with my old Meetup group which I hope will help ease this sense of loneliness...**General Chat:**  For the most part I am doing good and I think each day is getting better and better.  One of my character defects is that I am an impatient person and in this culture of instant gratification I want my life to be fixed **now**.  But alas sobriety and learning how to cope with life on life's terms is a process and cannot be done overnight.  ..I wish the best for all of you and that we can look forward to a long healthy life!
**Triumph**: Closing in on one year of sobriety and loving every minute of it!..**Struggle**: Every now and then I get sort of melancholic for my old drinking days. Never had an impulse to drink but I do get a little sad and withdrawn at times..**General Chat**: Wednesday is golf day and it's finally nice!
**Triumph**: I'm on Day 3 of sobriety. I drank heavily nearly daily for the past 5+ years (bingeing even worse on weekends with an occasional break here and there). My husband is very supportive and insists on quitting along side me even though he is not an alcoholic and I have given him full permission to drink with his buddies if he wants to or drink at restaurants etc. I feel so determined to quit because my alcohol use was starting to worry my 8 yr old daughter I was starting to have blackout moments more and more frequently and my life just felt like a big train wreck. I have a very positive outlook about my recovery and have started going to AA. .**Struggle**: I am a musician in a rockabilly band and am fretting about my first sober gig coming up on Saturday. (In a bar as part of a burlesque show no less) Alcohol has always been my liquid courage to perform and I'm afraid of performing sober. Plus In my mind I'm having a little trouble reconciling rockabilly lifestyle (which is known for hard-drinkin' and carousin') with my newfound sobriety. .**General Chat**:  /u/uninvitedthirteenth I love GoT but I'm so far behind. I need to get caught up. Hhhmmm....I wonder what it will be like to kick back and watch my favorite shows like GoT and Madmen where there is a lot of heavy drinking going on within the show. When my husband and I were more faithful about catching episodes of Madmen we would drink Canadian Club whiskey while watching it (Don Draper's drink of choice). 
**Triumph**: I have 40 days of sobriety under my belt. I can start to see some physical changes specifically with my face. Less red. I'm also walking 5km+ per day and feeling better for it. I'm heading to one of my favourite AA meetings in a couple hours and I'm meeting a potential sponsor later this evening...**Struggle**: I had a cardiologist appointment yesterday and he says my chances of suddenly dying are low but not 0% low. Have no idea how to take that but going for a second opinion. I also miss my ex-girlfriend like hell and still feeling utterly rejected from our break up earlier this month...**General Chat**: Does anyone watch Orphan Black? It's sooo damn good! I highly recommend watching this TV show :)..Thanks for letting me check in. 
**triumph:**25 days clean (2nd time ever) working program for first time ever doing 90 in 90 have sponsor already reaping benefits of sobriety...**struggle:** a MILLION Things to do today. 1) moving out have to spend the entire day moving out of my house lots of furniture and stuff to move must be basically done by end of day. Friday's the first. Need to pack lift things etc. 2) at some point need to go to house and clean out room I'm moving into. Room is completely cluttered will be a pain in the ass. 3) at noon landlord is coming with cleaning crew to get estimate on cleaning house. 4) need to be available all day because cable company is coming to disconnect internet/ cable. Have 0 time frame as to when they are coming.5) need to go to kinkos and fill out/ print out a bunch of things for my new job (oh yeah- I got a new job. Start in June. Doubled my annual salary plus full benefits for the first time. Huge sober victory.) 6) must take urine test for new job HAS to be today (thank god I'm sober. 7) meeting tonight. 8) have to hop in shower uncle and dad will be here soon to start moving furniture...Aaaahhhhhh!!!! Pray for me damnit. All of you! If I can make it through today SOBER it will be a HUGE victory.
**Triumph:** Still on an upswing and things are going well...**Struggle:** Work is slowing down and I'm having trouble staying motivated and focused as I transition to new projects. Do I hear a tiny violin?..**Chat:** I'm finding it hard to watch a full movie or TV show. I'm occasionally watching Cowboy Bebop and the 20 minute episodes are just about all I can concentrate for.
**Triumph:** I made it through a weekend away with a wedding and a rehearsal dinner and open bars and weed all over the damn place.  I wasn't tempted I didn't have cravings and I stuck to my sobriety plan. I feel like I hulk smashed all of the alcohol and I am so frickin' proud!..**Struggle:** I don't want to work.  Like ever.  Please someone mail me a winning lottery ticket.  I will buy you pizza...**General Chat:**  I need a new mattress.  Suggestions?  Bueller?
9 months already?  Man time flies!  You're doing so well Cakes!  It's been amazing watching your progress!..**Triumph**: The month-long birthday celebration for my wife has just about drawn to a close.  It's been great.  I wanted to give her something that would make it so she'd remember the feeling she had for this milestone birthday.  I threw her a surprise party I bought her a new office chair (Herman Miller Aeron) that she really wanted and I took her on a trip to watch some Equestrian Eventing.  It's been fantastic and she's been so happy... I couldn't have asked for me...While I did nice things for her in the past I've never been this excited and this invested in just trying to make her happy.  I think in the past I would do things to score points so to speak.  This time my whole thought was: in ten years I want her to look back and remember how happy her birthday was...**Struggle**: Some of the people we went to the horse event with wanted to go on a distillery tour.  My wife offered for me to just stay at the hotel but I felt like I could handle going.  It was weird.  I didn't feel like I wanted to drink at all but I definitely didn't like being there.  We went into one room where they were bottling stuff and it reeked of bourbon.  It made me a little light-headed and I didn't like the feeling.  I guess that's good...**General Chat**: Now that "birthday month" is over I'm looking forward to having a bit of downtime.  My wife and I have really been enjoying _The Flash_ on the WB.  We watch _The Arrow_ too but I think _The Flash_ has been really excellent lately.
Triumph: went on a long walk with my pup and an old friend who also recently (within the last few months) committed herself to sobriety. We had a great chat comfortable and easy. Also progressing well in my lifting and my garden is really taking off/doing well =)..Struggle: didn't get in to grad school dad had a medical incident and is recovering my roommate is a slob.  Nothing too crazy I guess...General chat- sleep is awesome. So is mint tea. 
**Triumph:** I'm in uncharted territory. I've never voluntarily gone beyond 123 days without a drink. The only previous times were when I was younger and unable to actually obtain alcohol.  When I think of my struggle below I know and believe that alcohol will just make things worse...**Struggle:** I feel like a total dry drunk. I'm finishing up a computer science undergraduate degree (graduate in 2 weeks - I hope) I just had a baby girl and I'm hoping to buy a house within the next year. I feel like I'm going absolutely insane...I also recently looked into joining the Air National Guard but it appears they won't take me because of a DUI within the past 5 years (it was 4 years ago). Feels crappy to be denied but it is what it is and it's not something I can change.
**Triumph** I'm struggling with getting everything on my to-do list done before I go out of town which is how it usually is (and part of what I've grown to hate about travel.) But I'm feeling more ordered in my thinking about what needs to be done and I'm strangely relaxed. And I won't be doing any drunk "packing" so I should end up arriving with everything I need and a suitcase that makes sense! (Not sure if it's appropriate to post here but Comedy Central has a very funny clip of Nick Kroll talking about drunk packing.)..**Struggle** Tired. So freaking tired. And so much to do!..**General chat** I finally broke down and started reading the Outlander series. (Because how can something be good if lots of people like it amirite?) So far it's pretty entertaining. Reading again is an unexpected benefit of sobriety for me and I'm looking forward to doing lots of it on vacation!
Triumph: I got a job! It's part time and the hours fit with my outpatient and AA schedule. ....Struggle: I'm still sleeping 12-14 hours a night. I'm sure part of it had to do with escape or the fact I don't have to face my issues if I'm dead to the world.....General: Seinfeld made a deal with Hulu. While excited I'm not thrilled about watching my favorite show in a glitchy format with a slew of commercials.
Triumph: Having better boundaries about other people's bullshit. Realizing that my experiences are just as valid as anyone's. Example: I let someone make me feel 'lesser than' about something but then realized that they are not any better than me just because they are in a 'higher social class' than me. .. I struggle with that but this week it hit me that anyone can be ignorant it has very little to do with one's background or even education.  And that sometimes people who have nicer backgrounds are more ignorant because they've been sheltered from poverty addiction etc.  I work with two people who are very sheltered and sometimes it's difficult to explain to them how my life has been very different from theirs. I.e. my parents didn't pay for me to go to private school I never went to summer camp as a kid and I've always bought my own cars whereas neither of them have ever done that. They both come from very upper middle class families and sometimes I feel 'less than' I have like poor person shame or something. But then I realized that there's dignity and empowerment in doing these things for myself and that I need to respect my own experience be proud of what I've accomplished without the benefit of a functional family unit. Sorry for the rant I just needed to put this down for future reference later!  ..Struggle: What's my next career move? Finishing college and checking in with my department head to make sure I'm on right track. ..General chat: I'm really liking being sober lately and value the changes however incremental they may feel in the moment. I'm excited that the movie "A Girl Walks Alone at Night" is supposedly on Netflix I've been meaning to see it. It's an Iranian film that has gotten great reviews.  Movie night!!! 
Oh man what a week so far. Let's start with the struggle...Struggle: I got a dog. A nine month old rescue dog. A husky/boxer nine month old rescue dog. I swear this pup has the energy of the sun. Also my best guess is the original owners did not know how to train a dog she needs to learn some manners. Plus I feel like my room mate is less than enthused about the dog. He hasn't out right said it yet but he keeps complaining about the dog however he's not supposes to be living here long at least that's what he told me when he moved in 5 months ago. Now I'm getting the feeling that he's getting a little too comfortable and wants to stay here. ..Triumph: thanks to my recent sobriety I am able to tackle this dog's training head on and I am seeing incredible results. I've had her for three days and she is 100% better. Shes a pup so I know its not going to be perfect all the time but she has been an incredibly good after the initial first day. I can honestly say this is going to be an amazing dog and friend. Also on the note of the room mate I set some goals for myself. To have my own place and car in the next six months. I'm sure when I talk to him about this he will understand. I'm actually kicking myself because now that I quit drinking I realize that I can totally afford the place I'm at now by myself. Too bad he moved in 2 weeks before I went sober. So now I pretty much have to tell him that I want him to move out but I think he'll understand. ..General chat: seriously though this pup is adorable. http://m.imgur.com/H8Uf4i5xI5ZQ92dvGLGNXWGWHjsX
