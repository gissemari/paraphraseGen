I try to avoid this type of post (I've made one before) but I thought I'd share a common reoccurring dream...Sometimes I think I could make a one time exception. You know drink with a buddy I don't see often at a wedding at a bachelor party etc. In this dream I decide to take myself up on my exception. I drink with a buddy we have a decent time and I surprisingly don't do anything stupid...Then I wake up (still in my dream) hungover and am immediately filled with regret. I realize that I'm back at square one and now I need to reset my clock. All of the progress I've made is for nothing and for what?! An exception...Luckily I wake up from this reoccuring dream and get so excited when I realize I've made it another night with nothing but myself in control of my own destiny. I then re-commit myself to sobriety because I've briefly seen the regret that would occur...I'm thankful for sober life (which is significantly better for me) for friends and family and for you guys at /r/stopdrinking. Some days are more of a struggle than others and I love hearing your stories. I don't attend meetings so this is essentially my AA...Finally Merry Christmas! Enjoy the holidays sober I guarantee memories are much more enjoyable if you actually remember them.

Congrats L-smoke. I hope your holidays go well!
Congratulations /u/Lokismoke on your 4 months.  Over the long haul I found that there was no replacement in sobriety to actually taking action through counseling and recovery meetings.
