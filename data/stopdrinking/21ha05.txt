In today's IOP meeting an older guy talked about his recent relapse. He didn't think anyone gave a shit about listening to his problems and drank an entire bottle but managed to call his sponsor while he was drunk. He's back in treatment and the big thing was that he could have called that sponsor before even buying the bottle and possibly avoided the relapse...In my own situation I got in a rather intense argument when I got home that had me ready to punch a hole in the wall. I wasn't thinking about 'man i could use a drink' or anything like that but instead I was thinking that I really could have used someone to talk to with a perspective that understood where I was coming from so basically a sponsor. ..I'm likely going to my first AA meeting on Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. So I'm a bit more open minded to getting one now. Though I am apprehensive to the idea of checking in with someone every day.

Having a sponsor was huge for me especially in the beginning. I had to check in twice a day. I didn't like this because I naturally resist accountability. But my sponsor was a true pro and I started seeing him as an advocate someone who was truly on my side. ..Often times the calls were less than a minute. I came to realize that this daily check-in got me into the good habit of reaching out for help instead of a drink.
It's healthy to have a separate person to talk with about our struggle. Those interior arguments where we take both sides can get real squirrelly. Staying in the real is valuable.
Sponsorship is really at bottom what AA recovery is about.  Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith's greatest insight was that hopeless alcoholism could be addressed finally by one drunk helping another.  We have the "street cred" that well-meaning professionals lack.  That's why sponsorship works.
