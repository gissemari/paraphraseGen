Friends I haven't seen in a while made a happy hour plan for tonight. This week has been a struggle already and I'm not looking forward to the temptation. I told one of my friends last night and he replied "It will be fun to go out! Just enjoy conversation!" It's hard for others to understand the difficulty I guess. I know the "sober places sober people" rule that some follow. But it seems really impossible for my life between family and friends. One of my girlfriends is over 2 years sober; she will be a comfort. She's coming to my house prior to the outing so I will share that I'm not drinking with her. Any other advice is welcomed! Cheers to lots of appetizer plates and club soda...I will not drink today and still try to have a "happy" hour/s!!

Just my thoughts that others with vehemently disagree with: early on I came to terms with the fact that it's a drinking world and it's up to me to adapt to it. I occasionally yet happily go to bars for sibling birthdays engagement parties and gatherings. You won't find me going there on my own but I won't let MY problem keep me from enjoying the loved ones in my life. If I'm attacking it with a positive attitude and paying attention to HALT then it works out fine. You do you.
Did you go?
