I'm on day 4. Day 1-3 felt great no urges! I just stopped myself from walking in a bar and I just went home. I think I can make the rest of the day. The only bad thing is that my alcoholic wife gets home in an hour. She is also on day 4 but she don't plan on quitting like me she thinks she can just cut back. I'm so afraid she is going to come home and have a drink. I don't want to ruin this!

It's great what you are doing! Congrats man. My best advice would be to go out for a run or a long walk a couple minutes before she gets in. This way you'll have endorphins from the exercise to help fight the craving. This first couple days are the hardest but they pay the biggest rewards. Stay strong brother! IWNDWYT.
I would be prepared for your wife to do that and plan how you will handle it.  People are going to drink around you and that's tough to deal with but definitely not impossible.  My husband drinks not a lot but it really doesn't affect me because we drink different things and his drinks don't appeal to me at all.  Maybe ask her to switch to drinks you don't like?  Good luck.  It does get easier.  Day 14 feels way easier than day 4 and it will be here before you know it.  IWNDWYT
Stay strong man.  We can do this no matter what we see or hear!  I won't be drinking with you too
Keep going and stay close to this Sub !..Regardless of what your wife does... Stay Strong!..
Day 4 can be difficult. Maybe invite your wife out for dinner and fill yourself with food. Food always shuts my cravings down.
