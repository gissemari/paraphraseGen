Hi today is my weak day.....It is the end of the month and I struggle financially due to my own mistakes (which I'm trying to improve with little result). It is always getting on me all this counting "can I buy juice? can I afford juice? what if I run out of cash" etc. EH... ..Also I moved to a new flat which happens to have cockroaches... Not many but still... Few years ago I had the same problem in another flat that was the most disturbing and disgusting ten months of my life. And now it starts again...Also yesterday I was at a party and I really struggled with non drinking. I felt alien and awkward and I was very stressed. I managed to stay sober but it wasn't entirely pleasent. ..Today all I want is to numb myself. But instead I'll grab my pen write a petition to the building management and try to kick the cockroaches out. I will also hunt them in my kitchen by means of soapy water (it's super effective). Yay me...I'll only drink juice (yea I bought that juice) with you today.

Hey there! Thanks for sharing! Now you get to make non-drinking choices!..* Call your landlord about the roaches. Writing the petition is definitely a thing to do but call them now so that they can get started.* Check out /r/personalfinance for help with the financial struggle.* And know that drinking will never improve any of this..Sorry to be so declaring-of-what-you-should-do ... I just see that I was in that same spot years ago and had to deal appropriately. I got excellent financial advice from my sponsor (he helped me get on track with a well-paying career from which I was shying away). ..You can do this!! I believe in you!!
