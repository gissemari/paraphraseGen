So I'm currently halfway through my 5^th night sober and physically feeling better than I have for nearly 10 years. But over the last 5 days I've been surprised by the intensity of the feelings I was previously covering up with booze even though I expected to feel pretty raw. And it's sometimes hard to separate the yearning to drink from the strong emotions I want to avoid. But tonight it's actually *hurting* almost like heartburn or aching muscles but of the mind. ..I started thinking about the pain and how much I could stand having decided not to drink today. The part of my mind childishly squirming for an easy way out started to whisper about all the shops still open how no real harm would come of drinking 4 or 5 beers tonight. I'm acknowledging the voice for what it is and ignoring it like you would someone talking crap at work etc. So I'm not entering a discussion with that voice but in the other part of my mind where I decide what to do I've been comparing the pain of skipping the drinking with the pain of giving in. By my understanding:..**The Pain of Abstinence**..* Is temporary - I have never known a yearning to drink to last for an entire 24 hours though maybe I am lucky..* Allows you to see a deeper pain and take effective action to remedy it unlike the evasive remedy of drowning it in alcohol..* Requires you to seek out the things you *need* emotionally physically and mentally..In summary it is like the pain of growing or the burning in your muscles when working out - you *will* be stronger when it's over! And there's no way you can be weaker physically (you're sober) or mentally/emotionally (you'll have learned that you *can* live with it and ways to address it without hurting yourself which is applicable in all of life)...**The Pain of Giving In**..* Has a set time to disappear - you're more imprisoned by it than the relatively brief sting of alcohol craving because you must physically recover..* Is long-lasting and by definition stops you from sorting your problems out. It's like constantly trimming the leaves of a poisonous bush when you need to dig down and burn that f**ker's roots!.* Is self-fuelling - you hurt you drink you hurt from drinking you recover you hurt again you drink again. It's a closed system..* Comes with a real-life non-negotiable cost to your health. If you get drunk all the time you will not live as long or as well. Life and health are finite...In summary giving in and drinking is like struggling in quicksand. It's the wrong way to approach the situation and naturally you'll get buried one way or the other. ..**The Pleasure**..But why all this talk about pain? There are countless pleasures I've experienced over the last 5 days which I haven't felt for years. The moments they arrive can't be predicted but when they come they glow bright and blow away any grumpy thoughts I've had. When waking up having a conversation eating driving laughing more fully than I have for years seeing my clear eyes and improved healthy glow being articulate when communicating at last moving a healthy body around - and it always takes the form of pure enjoyment of life followed by the thought **I'm so glad I haven't been drinking**. I have *never* said the opposite....**TL;DR** I'm finding a few hours a day tough but it's nothing compared to the grinding misery of drunkenness and hangovers. Plus I have everything good I had before with loads of extras!..

Thanks for this -- it is very helpful and realistic.

I think of getting sober as climbing up a mountain ridge.   You do it because up near the top is a winding road filled with ups and downs with passing storms and some great views.   Up there is normal life where the non-drinkers are...By choosing to get hammered for ten years I have flung myself off a cliff and there's nothing down there but sharp rocks and occasionally a muddy path that just goes in circles.  ..The pain of abstinence is the understandable fatigue of climbing back up to that winding path near the top.   When I get tired and I often do I need to sit down.   And I need to ignore any voice that says "Things up there are no better than down below so why not have a fun hang-glider ride?"   ..I know that the hang-glider "fun" lasts about 8 minutes and ends with a crash-landing on sharp rocks further down than I've ever been before.   Further down than I ever thought it was possible to go.  That is the pain of drinking.
Very neat post. Thank you for this wisdom it's enlightening.

That was great to read thanks.
Maybe because Im pretty far down the path but I feel no pain of abstinence. Nothing in my life would be better with drinking.
