I was walking down the street yesterday on a nice Saturday afternoon. I was headed to the park and was excited to buy some local food and cook later. It was nice to feel the sun. Then I saw an ad for alcohol and I thought "I don't have to worry about that anymore." ..Then I started crying. For so long I had to fight to battle the urges and the intrusive thoughts. It was a challenge almost every day for a very long time..Yesterday tho for the first time it didn't feel like a battle. It was just not a part of my life anymore. It was very freeing to not have to fight and to be focused on other things..I know the battle isn't fully over yet. Their are urges to come and struggles to go thru. But for now it feels like I'm ok and it's wonderful.

Very nice ! I love your words. IWNDWYT 
Amen! Yes we can't ever become too relaxed about it but it is like a mountain's been lifted off my shoulders because alcohol isn't pinning me down anymore. It barely crosses my mind and when it does it's often in the sense of  ugh I can't think of anything worse' ..Congratulations - it won't be long till you reach 1000 days and that will be amazing!
Such a hopeful message of earned strength. Thank you IWNDWYT 
Nice! I remember how happy I was when I didn't have to fear the wine aisle at the grocery store 
I want to be there friend.  So badly
