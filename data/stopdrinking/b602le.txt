M/21 here I have been sober 56 days. Although I still think about Alchohol multiple times daily and struggle with cravings I am very happy I sook help...Although at my age its socially acceptable to get drunk frequently my binge drinking had rapintly increased heavily in the last year.I started drinking heavily in college but unlike my friends my drinking habits came with me when i graduated. That was two years ago start of last year It progressed to where id go out of my way to binge drink when I was depressed or had bad things happening in my life. Everytime id drink it was to get as drunk as i humanly could. It had almost become a competition with myself. ..Start of this year I had started drinking heavily alone for the sole purpose to deal with my depression and pesimistic outlook on life...I often thought about how i was using alchohol; and that it wasnt as innocent and playful as it once was anymore. But i just kept reassuring myself that "Ah your 21 live man give it up later"...But after laying in bed drunk one night and looking through this sub reddit and seeing people in similar situations as me. I realised i needed to stop and seek help before it really got out of hand. ..I just want to thank all of you and for anyone my age. I urge you to not pass off your drinking problems just because you think you're to young to have them..
