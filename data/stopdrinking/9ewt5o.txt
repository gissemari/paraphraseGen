So I have always been a drinker. Not really an alcoholic. A couple of drinks a couple nights a week. Until this last year and a half. Went through a nasty divorce and I found myself drinking every single night. Like a lot every night. Every morning was spent getting ride of my hangover. I was barely functioning at work. Neglecting my house chores. Skin looks like crud and I gained about 20 pounds. ..Finally decided to get back into the dating pool and needed to clean up my act. That was two-three months ago. I hadn't realized that alcohol had become part of me. It's been rough but I'm ready for the struggle. I will be 30 hours sober as of 6am. So far I can say this is not going to be a fun ride.

Good luck. Don't be afraid to seek medical advice to aid with withdrawals. ..Not everyone that drinks too much is an alcoholic and not everyone that quits drinking is an alcoholic but not drinking is always healthier than drinking. It doesn't really matter if you are an alcoholic but if your instincts are telling you that something is wrong you should go with them while you have that moment of clarity. ..IWNDWYT 
Hey Mama! Same here... 3 months ago really started to get serious about tackling my daily habit. I have gained 15 lbs in the past year or two and didn't realize the hold booze has on me until trying to quit. Many day ones this summer...seriously cut back (thanks SD) but tough stringing together more than 2 or 3 solidly sober days in a row. Just this morning I was calculating my curent sober time and its 41 hours... so I feel ya. 1 hour at a time for me for now. Going for triple digits this time. Good luck.
