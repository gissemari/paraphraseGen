Tell it! You are the wind beneath my wings and I am thrilled to be able not to drink with you today.

Way to stay strong
Yah!  Damn right!!  My ex was blowing up my phone for about 12 hours.  She called at 10PM wanting to Skype with our daughter.  She was asleep.  I didn't/still don't feel any need to respond to her.
Rock on!!!
