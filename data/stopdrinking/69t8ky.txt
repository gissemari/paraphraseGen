Hi Everyone.A week or so ago I posted here and gave a bit of my history with alcohol and asked for feedback - which I got. Thank you..So I wanted to share the simple question that clarified everything for me...It is:.Has alcohol impacted my life in negative ways?..And the answer is most definitely 'yes'. Absolutely 'yes'. .And I'm not happy with that answer...Although I don't struggle with alcohol the way many many do and I'm not cripplingly self-destructive I do struggle. I have some very bad habits. And the initial negative effects of alcohol on my life have compounded into secondary and tertiary negative effects on my life. And it's these later effects that are really hurting me now (self-esteem questionable relationships loss of time and opportunities etc.)..So for anyone else out there who's on the edge - remember - everyone's bottom is different..This is my bottom..And I won't be drinking with you all today...p.s. Loving this wonderful supportive community!

In the beginning I told myself that my alcohol intake was normal. When bad things happened as a result of my being drunk I told myself to cut back and learn how to handle alcohol. When trying to negotiate with myself failed it was time to stop playing the victim of circumstance and step away from alcohol. I've reevaluated what's important to me and both personally and professionally I am a new person. ..Im sure that sobriety fits you better than drinking did! 
thanks for the update &amp; glad you are here :)..[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
Glad you are taking steps now. Some people think they are a different kind of drinker with a different kind of problem for a long time before the really bad consequences come. Then they realize they had just been in an earlier stage of a progressive disease during the time they were thinking they were different. 
The best thing I heard at some point within the last 43 days is that alcohol abuse is like an elevator going down. It's up to you when to get off. (Apologies to the author and sincere thanks.).
