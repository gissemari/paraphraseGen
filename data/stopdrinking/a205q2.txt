The Daily Check-In for December 1st: Just for today I am NOT drinking!..*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!.______________________________________________________.**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying *not to drink* we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread..______________________________________________________.This post goes up at:..    US Night/Early Morning..    Europe Morning..    Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar..______________________________________________________..Welp it's the beginning of a new month that's going to be filled with landmines.  Ah the holidays.  Christmas shopping haven't started... I haven't gotten my tree yet.  Then New Year's Eve.  ..It's great to start off the month fresh and sober.  Then end the month and year on a positive.  We will need to be using our sobriety tools because these may be difficult and stressful times for us...I'm getting ahead of myself.  Today is the most important day.  Be it day one one week one year or ten years we are all the same distance from the ditch!  (Basically what this means I think is that we are all one drink away from a relapse.)  Today and just for today I'll not be drinking..
----------immediate responses--------

IWNDWYT         
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!..Thanks so much for hosting this week u/physis81
I will not drink today.
Yeah. Advent calendar time! .And I will not be drinking today.
I will not drink with you today!
Hey I'm still awake and never get to check in until way late...so before I drift off.....IWNDWYT (tonight or tomorrow)    
I'm not drinking either. Stay sober my friends. Iwndwyt 
I too WNDWYT or tomorrow. 
Still reeling from the news about my liver function today. Had huge plans of going out and doing something fun. I think I should not dive into anything too strenuous or new right now though as this month is littered with pitfalls and I don't want a crashing low to turn up where it's not needed nor welcome. I do feel that life in general has taken an upward turn of late and hopefully other things will start to improve also. I still have no way of knowing what might happen tomorrow next week next month so I'll just concentrate on not drinking today and enjoy the clarity for a while. Take comfort in that my actions recently have all been positive. Assign some hope for another day where happiness is waiting and not just expecting it to be right round the corner. This takes hard fucking work to get the balance just right and maintaining the balance isn't easy either. The thought of entertaining the idea of a life-draining addiction into the mix at this critical point just seems completely insane. That can go take a big giant fuck to itself.....IWNDWYT
Hey physis!  Thank you     looks like another day of Not Drinking for this Fish   
Happy sober Saturday all- I will not be drinking with you today.
IWNDWYT! I believe once today is over it'll be my 90 day mark! It's been a learning journey and I'm so thankful. Here's to 90 more and plenty after! 
Still technically  Friday night  on the east coast. Got myself to an AA meeting went out for sushi and spent the night playing video games. About to hit the hay sober and wake up not hungover. See you all in the AM! 
I will not drink with you today!
Checking in: I will not drink today. I love the holidays and I'm looking forward to spending them sober. 
Check please!
No booze today!
IWNDWYT checking in
Morning from the UK!..We can start with the advent calendars now. Even the dog and the horse have one. I didn't know that you could get advent calendars for horses but you can and he has one. ..He looked suitably unimpressed when I showed it to him- perhaps he'll perk up when he sees a treat come out of it tonight!..Hope everyone has a good sober weekend- I will not drink with you today  
Day 1 wish me luck
Day 7. Still up with insomnia. BUT IWNDWYT!!!!
1 day 1 night the future will look bright tonight will be my 2nd day/night alcohol free
I will not drink with you today. 31 days now and i got used to the new baseline so i catch myself thinking "I don't feel so different now compared to when i was drinking so i might as well drink."....No cravings just weakness....Reading here checking in and reading books about the topic helps so far. Without SD i would have started drinking again without a second thought yesterday.
No thanks not today.
I have not drank for 4 days and I will not drink with you all today :-) p.s as we used to say in England when I was growing up  pinch punch first of the month!  
IWNDWYT was supposed to go to a holiday party sitter got sick and could not find another one we were comfortable with everything happens for a reason so here's to coffee tea and fizzy water and catching up on some shows :) 
It's 7.30 am Saturday. Awake and clear. Staff Xmas party last night...I was DD and drove home happy. Going to see my brother today who is home to Ireland for weekend...he lives in Scotland. We will have family gathering... But no drinky drink for me.. IWNDWYT   
Happy Sober Saturday. I am up with insomnia in MA USA and it sucks. Hope everyone has a great first day of December. Wishing you a very happystrong and healthy month. Stay Sober!!
Happy 1st of December! I will not drink with you today. 
I think my badge is stuck I'm pretty sure I've now made the 4 month milestone! ..IWNDWYT..Have a great day!
Sober weekend underway. I'll join you and not pick up that first drink today.    
A tough month coming up for many us so wishing you all the strength to get through it. Anyway I am not worrying about tomorrow because today I will not drink. 
Today starts my third dry month in 2018! I did January and November. Now I have just this bridging month to Dry January 2019! And I'm also doing Dry February. Not sure about after that. ..What I do know is that I feel in control of this for the first time in years and I will not drink with you all today!
Day 1 agsin today for at least the 80th time. Let's try this again.
Sober Saturday let's be having you!..IWNDWYT
Okay here we go again :(  ..Not had a great week so hopefully I've learnt my lesson this time.  ..IWNDWYT
Just checking in. I wish you all a glorious day. ..IWNDWYT!!
A friend recommended this feed. Starting today iwndwyt 
 
Morning all. It was my work's party last night. I had 4 non-alcoholic drinks and left about 10.30pm just as the drunken dancing started  . I was really worried about it but feel great this morning &amp; proud of myself. Have a good day everyone. IWNDWYT 
I am not drinking today 
IWNDWYT   
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today...Wrapping presents decorating for Christmas spending a peaceful night cuddled up with SO :)...Have a great week weekend!..Thanks again for hosting u/physis81! Hope you and Princess have a great Saturday :)..
I got this.  IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYAT
Pledging today 
'Pinch punch start of the month'..Happy to be here and grateful to be sober. ..I missed my work Christmas night out last night so yet another event I have called off on this year- have actually not socialised once this year at all and its been getting me down as I don't feel like I am moving on in the way I should be- Its not even that I don't trust myself not to drink its that I still can't imagine having fun sober in that sort of situation...Cuddled up on the sofa with my 2 huskies instead though so not all bad :)..IWNDWYT...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
I will not drink today. 
IWNDWYT!!!!
Morning from London! There shall be no boozing on this side of the pond! And now for a lovely coffee!
I won't drink today!
December of sobriety starts from today!..31 is pretty big number and I plan to do it one by one..I will not drink with you today life is good...&amp;#x200B;
Good morning all :)..I've been going though a whole bunch of emotional trials and triggers of late but yesterday was a different kind of test to my sobriety - a cold pop-up bar at a Christmas market no NA beers so I had to be 'obviously' sober horribly chlostrophobic because of all the people and I was so very close to buying a beer to deal with the anxiety...But I didn't. I got a sprite endured the friendly digs from all the drinkers and fairly soon I calmed down enough to mostly enjoy my evening...I kept thinking back to my check in pledge for the morning - SD was the only thing that kept me going...Pledging again loud and clear in case temptation comes - I Will Not Drink With You Today!
Iwndwyt
My badge is stuck but I'm happy to report that today marks 6 MONTHS SOBER!  
Doing good! In the us just about to finish day one!   but I'm not feeling too bad. Just bored. Lots of free time! Keep it goin!

Good morning everyone I hope you all have a safe and sober day IWNDWYT 
I will not drink for the next 24 hours. Happy 1st December everyone!
I will not drink with you fine people today.  Night time in Japan.  I am going to send the evening listening to interviews until football starts at midnight and drink tonic water (no gin included).  Have a great weekend everyone.
Thanks for hosting /u/physis81.I will not drink today. 
IWNDWYT. (by the way -- my badge seems to be off by about 5 days. is it just me?)

Thanks for the check ins this week physis!..I'm not drinking today!
Longest streak in a while and feeling positive I have the weekend covered IWNDWYT!
Will not drink today. 
Work holiday party tonight.......yuck!..IWNDWYT
I hit my one week mark yesterday and had an emergency dental procedure- painful! Oh so badly wanted to stop for a bottle of red to wash down my prescriptions - and then I read the instructions that said no alcohol wine or beer... I took it as a sign and stuck to LaCroix. I am SO happy I didn't do it!.IWNDWYT  
Day 6. (badge stuck.) Had a great Friday night with the kids writing stories! Looking forward to a beautiful day with you all. I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT!  ..Happy December SD! ..Thanks for being here &lt;3     ..\^.\_.\^=  
7 days away from 200. I'm hanging in there. The real challenge of my first Christmas sober in over 20 years is fast approaching and I'm ready for it. I will not drink with you today.
Thanks physis...great week of check-ins. I am looking forward to my first holiday season sober in many years. I will stay on high alert for that ditch. Grateful today to know that I have choices. I alone get to choose my attitude. I alone get to choose if I have that first drink. I have the choice to say...I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
I will not drink with you all today 
Drycember 1: Just for today not drinking.
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today
I will not drink today.
The biggest hurdle for me today. Me and my friends always get together to watch UFC events and there is usually a lot of beer flowing. We had a great time everyone was drinking and I only had water. It was so hard for me to keep saying no but I did it. It is now 1am here and I am so happy I can go to sleep knowing I didn't have a drop of alcohol. ..Day Number 5 IWNDWYT
No drinking here
Ahh that's better badge all fixed!  IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT!
Iwndwyt
Last night was tricky but as of today I got one week under my belt and I ain't drinking today with y'all
IWNDWYT  
IWNDWYT  
My plan is to sit and admire my Christmas tree all day. :P IWNDWYT! Happy Saturday SD!
I will not drink today. 
Happy to not drink with you today! 
Re starting today...it's going to be a shaky sweaty few days but I have to do this. I will not drink for 24 hours....one day and one hour at a time ....
Survived my trigger meeting with old BF yesterday. But my car died completely this AM - so new stressor today  But I'm focused on the positives - it is a beautiful day here and my family is happy and healthy - so I will resist drinking just for today.  
 
Happy Saturday!  IWNDWYT
I'm on day 20. Last night I had my first major craving for alcohol. I wrote down a huge list of reasons why I shouldn't drink. The only good reason that I could come up with was that I wanted to but that was almost enough...I am a bit worried as I've been down this road before. I really thought this time was going to be different but I guess all I can do is not drink today.
I will not be drinking with you all today :) ..&amp;#x200B;
Happy December!..&amp;#x200B;..I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today
Ignore the badge fell off the wagon on like day 2. Quit for 7 months earlier this year and went back on hard. Putting on weight look awful feel awful ruining personal relationships neglecting my work and hobbies. I dont even enjoy drinking?! Our minds behave so strangely. Anyway IWNDWYT! 
4 weeks ago I checked in for the first time. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you today. Day 5!..Friday I conquered a brief craving to grab beer on the way home from work. Also last night I dreamt I had a glass of wine and explained my cravings to loved ones. It was weird.
I absolutely love the promise of a new month! ..IWNDWYT
Wow December already. I'm hoping to get some of my Christmas shopping out of the way today. But first I'm going to a meeting and then out with a few of the women. I have to start December off on the right foot! ..I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today!
December doesn't bring too many sobriety traps for me in terms of boozy events - I really don't have a social circle and I'm currently doing online classes full time so no work events - but there is still plenty of holiday stress.  Thanksgiving was a bit of a fiasco because my father in law pushed my buttons all day until I couldn't restrain my emotional response any longer...but I DIDN"T DRINK OVER IT!!!  ..I've finally reached the point where stresses like this make me more protective of my sobriety instead of making me want to just cave to alcohol.  I think to myself "OK so this really got under my skin but I'll be d\*\*\*ed if I'm going to let it threaten my sobriety!"  So my project for this month is to work on mindfulness skills so that hopefully I can handle any Christmas stress without another emotional meltdown or explosion.  First and foremost though: I will not drink with you today!  ..Let's all pool our strength and make this a successful fulfilling sober holiday season!
I will not drink today!
I need my flair reset. I failed yesterday. 
Back to day one for the 100th+ time. ..I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink with you all today
Two months! I was going to drink last night. I bought Trader Joe's seasonal beer made by unibroue that was always my favorite. I was really excited about it. I poured some into a glass tasted it and yuck. Bitter and dark. Why did I drink is stuff and think it tasted good? I know This Naked Mind talks a lot about how no one really likes the .taste of alcohol at least the first time they try it. It was gross.  Give me a San pelligrino anyday! I poured it out and am back with you today. 
IWNDWYT!
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in!
This week I've seen SO MANY people staggering down streets leaning on lamp-posts vomiting into the street getting aggressive and generally being the worst sort of drunk as we ramp up towards the festive period. Glad I'm on the outside looking in on that now...IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!   
Not today too much work to catch up on! IWNDWYT
I will not drink today.
Day 21: IWNDWYT. Alcohol makes my life worse not better. It's that simple.
I will not drink today.
December already?... Jeez. ...I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT
Day 1 done. 
9 months. I never ever ever ever ever thought I could do this. And I couldn't have without my participation here. Happy Saturday and thanks everyone. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today  
Now it is Saturday morning and I will not be drinking with you today  
We are doing a once-in-a-lifetime NYE experience. I am really really looking forward to it despite knowing all the adults in our party will be drinking probably to excess because hey it's NYE and what happens in 2018 stays in 2018!  ..But seriously I'm giddy for it and for doing it sober!..But seriously but seriously today is what matters. And so.....I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today. Have a lovely Saturday!
Everything is noticing badge resets for the days we recently lost. For some reason my badge is still off by several sober days.
Happy December! I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you on this beautiful day! 
Good afternoon friends. Once again: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone!.. 
Well...my calendar said today was November 31st so it's going to be that kind of day. I will not drink *with you* today. 
Checking in!
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  This little blue worker is getting the sober tools sharpened oiled and calibrated in anticipation of the Evil Oppressor's holiday hijinks.  IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT 
It's a rainy day here in Cincifuckingnati but it gonna be 60 degrees later! The odd things I am grateful for here! We are going to meet a dog down in KY today. A cat liking dog! She is a Beagle/Ccon Hound mix and she is a year and a half old. Then we are donating some toys down there for a local toy drive! And there will be no drinking!
Sipping coffee on a sober Saturday morning is the best. Before I would spend the entire weekend hungover as I'd drink until blacking out on Friday night and then again on Saturday night after "recovering." I'm glad to be done with that. IWNDWYT
Good morning! Yeah December is super triggering for me. I feel ready this year though. I have been sober for 7500 hours now according to my sobriety app. I have a lot of practice this time around. I will not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking today no matter what happens no matter how I feel.
Busy today and Big 12 Championship! No alcohol needed! IWNDWYT!! 
I'm off to brunch for my friend's 30th birthday. It's a boozy brunch so I'm quite nervous and about not drinking and how people will react (I haven't seen this friend in a while so she doesn't know I'm currently sober)...Hoping it goes okay. It's only two hours of my life but I'm a little anxious about it. But here's my pledge:  IWNDWYT 
It's the first of the month wake up wake up. It's the first of the month get up get up. We having a celebration love to stay sober. IWNDWYT! 17!
won't drink today
IWNDWYT
Today I will improve my life a tiny bit more by not drinking. It adds up.
Did not drink today! Five things I'm grateful for:..1. The food I ate today.2. The recent chaos in my life that has really pushed me to practice patience.3. The book I'm reading *The Trauma of Everyday Life* .4. The very clean and quiet area I'm living in.5. The warm blanket I'm sitting in right now.
Just for today ..I will not drink..I will.....- Nourish myself with reading meditation and food.- Slow down during my day and keep things simple .- Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend.
Stayed up way too late last night talking/snuggling with my wife.  I'm super grateful to have done so but this morning I'm exhausted...Kiddos and I are going to decorate the house for Christmas today and they are both so excited...That kind of imbalance between our energy levels generally leads to tough times but maybe just being aware of that will help me out today...Either way busy day and IWNDWYT 
Day three! Went to an aa meeting last night. Didn't leave as inspired and motivated as I hoped but I woke up today with no hangover and didnt drink Fri night so thats something. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!!! Almost 2 full weeks and feeling better than ever! Keeping on. 
I will not drink today.
Good Morning December! IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT!  
I will not drink today.  
I stay sober when I'm checking in every day making a commitment each morning to make it an alcohol-free day. IWNDWYT!
Day 1 lets do this.
We are looking for someone with at least 30 days of sobriety to take over the Daily Check-In next week starting tomorrow. It's easy it's really fun and it's a great way to get to know your SD family. If you are interested please let me know!..Oh -- and I won't drink with you today no matter what happens good or bad.
Nope not today!  
Thank you Physis for hosting this week I enjoyed your wisdom and insights especially to the day at a time sometimes its a minute at a time for us. Peace and Happy Sober Holidays to you. I am so not into the mindset yet for the holidays as I know they will approach at lightening speed even though I truly have a wonderful life with my wife dog work and probably to much stuff this time of year sparks a darkened and dismal light down on me as my two daughters that I love very much  and miss have been estranged for many years now. There have been many attempts to reconcile this over the years but nothing has changed and I feel powerless over it if they do not respond I feel there is nothing more I can do. I will not risk my sobriety for this but just wanted to share this for me today. Thank you all for your daily support and for just being here as we battle through a day at a time. Peace my friends.
I am not drinking today. 
Here. I will not drink with you today. 
Here's to a sober Saturday which will be good not bad!
Good morning.  No drinking today
Another day sober coming up! Now time for my morning coffee before I see what today has to offer. Hope everyone is doing well - stay strong guys we got this!!
IWNDWYT 
680'th day of not drinking and I don't intend to break the streak. IWNDWYT!!
I will not f'ing drink today no matter what.  Drinking wreaks havoc on every aspect of my life. 
I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY! Life is too good without the poison! Happy Saturday! I hope everyone does something nice for themselves today. And if nobody has told you they love you today I do. Just for being with me here on this journey of not drinking.  
I will not drink with you all today!.
Waking up early refreshed and feel great!  Still need to get my badge but I'm on mobile and too lazy.  I'll be a week tomorrow.  One thing I've noticed is.. I'm dreaming again.  I used to *never* dream because I wouldn't really fall asleep I would just pass out then  come to  the next morning.  It's kind of cool.  Time for some coffee!..I am a little nervous about tomorrow though going to go play some pond hockey will all the boys and then watch football.  They will be drinking heavily I'm sure.  But hey they're supportive and I'm sure couldn't  care less but I'll be around booze for the first time since stopping.  Wish me luck! 
Hey everybody happy December 1. I will not drink with you today.
No drinking today or the next 24 hours.
Hello Saturday morning from California USA. IWNDWYT.  I have a big holiday party tonight. I will go sip my soda &amp; lime and be grateful for my sobriety. Thanks for being here. 
I'm not going to drink today.
Thanks everyone for checking in- I will not drink with you today! 
**WOO-HOO and thank you** and a heartfelt *Namaste!* to whomever debugged my badge count...Running unusually late with my DCI this first day December as I had "important" chauffeur duty to do for my dear Knitwit. You'll never guess so I'll just tell you: Joann's Fabrics &amp; Crafts. *Jeeze* the store clerks and I are now on a first name basis...Well anyway better late than not sober right?..IWNDAT/B.
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! 
Good morning. Sitting in the early morning light coffee and embroidery project within arms reach. Listening to music and feeling so much! Good bad overwhelming at times...So far I'm really enjoying SMART. It's giving me a lot to think about and is giving me tools to help manage my emotions and moods in a healthier way. A major motivator in my sober journey is to finally address and heal from all the abuse something I simply cannot do when I'm blacked out most of the weekend...Practice makes progress. IWNDWYT
Checking in.
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today!
Had a shitty day yesterday but didn't drink! Came home and played Fortnite with my brother and his kids online instead. Before I knew it it was time for dinner then bed. I'm on day 10 IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today
My goal is to make it to New Year's and go fron there. IWNDWYT!
I remember after a night of drinking I would wake up in the wee hours with my heart pounding excessive thirst and tremendous anxiety. Last night it was more like ok now what do I do with so many options in life now that alcohol is removed from the equation? My badge says 40 days and I really have 43 days. Maybe it will catch up? I don't post daily but I do read the posts every day. Happy Saturday and IWNDWYT! 
Oh it just reset! I'm obviously not good at math! Last drink was Oct17th
I will not drink with you today 
Day 62 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
Happy Saturday! IWNDWYT
No drinking today except for coffee tea and sparkly water. Happy sober Saturday.
Day 2. I am going to a gym for people in recovery and hoping to meet some people and hit the weights. I'll run some errands and buy groceries. My appetite is finally back thank god. IWNDWYT.
Fell off once again but today is a new day and I will not drink even if I have to sit here reading this sub all day to make it. Thanks for being here guys.  IWNDWYT
Thank you! I will not drink with you today!
Iwndwyt 
Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit.  I'm not drinking today.  
IWNBDWYT!
I won't drink today. 
So glad to be on the cusp on 100 days sober. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!  
I'm in just for today. I'll worry about tomorrow when it shows up.
I will not drink with you today 
Good morning all. Thanks for a great week Physis. I enjoyed your thoughtful comments each morning. I will not drink with you all today. 
Made it through No Booze November and sailing right into Dry December!..This morning I got up and hit the early morning spinning class then stayed afterward for Pound Fit; kicked my butt in a great way and now I'm looking forward to a nice relaxing Saturday. Happy to be here and IWNDWYT!
I'm in. A friend asked me to hang out at his place tonight which always means beer but no. Something about it being the first of a new month feels like a fresh start for self care which includes not drinking. I'm not sure how far I want to take it and maybe I'll find the answer with some time away from drinking we'll see but for today...just no.
Staring down the holidays is rather daunting.  I'll stick to focusing on today.   IWNDWYT.
Drinking will bring me no pleasure - even if I had one (and somehow managed to keep it at just one) I would not enjoy it and feel quite guilty as a result. So IWNDWYT
Happy Saturday and first day of December! IWNDWYT
Checking in on this nice Saturday.  I will not drink with you today.
Happy December! IWNDWYT!
Went to see my sisters kids play a basketball-match. Something Ild probably never have done when I was drinking especially on a saturday. For that I am grateful. I am not drinking today. 
Day 4 and already trying to find excuses to drink. I'm not going to make a decision to go to the store today. I don't need to. I'm just going with the plan of the day that's already made. IWNDWYT
I got drunk last night at my Christmas party. I'm thankful that 1 nothing truly awful happened (as has happened in the past) but also 2 at least that is done now and I can get on with enjoying the festive period without drinking. I am determined at the very least to be sober for Christmas Eve and NYE for the first time maybe ever. IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
I won't be drinking today regardless of mood an alien attack or hearing shitty christmas music and I will not be drinking tonight either. Almost 60 days. 
My grandson's birthday party. .sober. gotta love it. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
Not drinking today!
Started yesterday my  Dry December  journey. So today is day #2. The hangover I had on Friday made me cancel a workout class and I'm not about to give up on one of the things I love- fitness! I was open and honest with my husband that I need to take a break from wine for this month because I'm having horrible rosacea recently and feel more anxious. The inflammation in my body needs to come back down!! I told him to hold me to it and to be my rock when I'm feeling weak. He's very supportive and I'm looking forward to not drinking with you today! Stay strong everyone! 
No drink December! Let's do this!  .Side note Naltrexone and a good therapist make this whole journey so much easier. 
IWNDWYT.

IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
Checking in. Day 8! They're starting to pile up and I feel great.

My dog passed away last night. I am heartbroken. I could have picked up a big bottle of rum to drown these horrible feelings but I will not drink with you today. ..I love you Digger you were truly the best friend I could have asked for. 
Thanks for the support!! Day one on the 1st feel lucky.

Day 6!..Today I shall not drink with you. At home and sober on a Saturday!
No drinks. 
I'm meeting up with a friend who I normally get drinks with. Ive been dreading it because I always end up getting a drink or two even if I say I won't. I asked about going somewhere else instead and she was cool with it (she doesn't know it's a problem for me). I don't think I've got the will power to say no at a bar but i can at least try to remove the option. ..IWNDWYT
Happy Saturday everyone. Not drinking with you all!
