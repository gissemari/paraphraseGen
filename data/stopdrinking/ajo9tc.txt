My dad is sick. I love him more than life itself and if let loose he would do more good in this world than all of us combined. I can't keep pretending I have a code or ethics while I let him kill himself...As of Monday I will force him to play Kerbal space program with me and i hope we find a path for him away from this poison...I can't imagine how hard life was for him when I was struggling so I won't judge him

That sounds tough. I just wanted to drop in and wish you luck and strength.  
I will not drink with you today and send you leace and strength  
I was scrolling down the posts and reading when I came across a fellow kerballer ... :) You're right not to judge your father but for different reasons. When we were judged it didn't make an ounce of difference. Often it only made it worse! And of course it screws up the relation you have with your old man. I hope you can help him to stop this RUD.
