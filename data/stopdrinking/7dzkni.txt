I think I had made it to almost one month sober and then I went on holiday and the stress over how not drinking would affect my holiday and in particular what my friend who was with me would think made me relapse hard obviously. Now I'm sitting in a cafe waiting for the phone shop to open because I drunkenly left my bag unattended on the beach. Various other things happened that I am ashamed of. Coming home from the holiday has hit me hard and I don't even know what the next week is going to bring. I really don't want this anymore.

Welcome!..I will not drink with you today.
Reading your post this is what struck me:..&gt; what my friend who was with me would think made me relapse hard..Fear that a friend would not approve of me or my behavior is a very real thing in my world and I know I can't take it lightly. There are may ways of coping with that fear and some will help to keep me sober and some will not...I have slowly and painfully learned that my fears about what people think of me are usually nonsense even though they can be a huge influence when I let them. The next time that fear voice in my head tries to steer me wrong I may just tell it "thank you for sharing" and then go about my business without giving it the power that it craves over my life. A few deep breaths a time-out minute to relax and remind myself of how grateful I am for a life without being drunk...thats my fear's biggest fear and it seems to work well for me so far...
Pick yourself up and start again friend. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Be aware of how fragile you are and learned coping mechanisms. It takes practice but you can win. I relapsed many times before it finally sank in. Read "This Naked Mind" go to aa meetings and see a therapist. It's your life we're talking about.
