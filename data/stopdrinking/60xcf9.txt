I always figured I'd be able to quit on my own. what a struggle that's been. I've just gotten back from the doctors where they've told me from binge drinking my heart is now weak and I have to take heart pills that somehow restructure the heart. essentially if I keep going this way I won't make it to old age. as a 25 year old that struck close to home.  time to throw in the sobriety into the ring and call it quits. (hopefully)  can't let the liquor get the best of me.

Sounds like it's definitely time. Are you working out a plan? The "Sunday Solutions" link on the right side might help you with some ideas.
27 and just found out my liver is not doing well been two days of sobriety and it's really difficult. Don't have any advice yet but I'm here in solidarity with you. If you need to vent/complain/talk about anything  you can message me no judgement. The good news is that bodies are resilient and you're taking steps in the right direction. So far the only thing that's made me feel stronger is to envision taking it one day at a time. 
My tip is check in on here and read it daily. Read the Naked mind its free in the side bar to the right. It's been helping me as this is the longest I have gone without drinking in my life and I was a die hard binge drinker! .... wishing you all the best.
