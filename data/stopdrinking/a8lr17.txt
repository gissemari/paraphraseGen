I struggled so hard for so long and I was unemployed for so long and single and living alone and every day seemed harder than my last.  I finally started to get a foothold on sobriety thanks in large part to this sub...And then I was offered a high-stress job that is perfectly suited to my personality and has an 8am start time and I realized I had a real choice to make.  I could keep drinking every night and hate myself every morning do the job at half-capacity with a blinding headache and count the minutes until I was free to return to the bottle.  Or I could take advantage of the opportunity to exercise my sobriety muscles...I'm so happy I decided on the latter.  I go in every morning with a clear head and a clear conscience and I enjoy being there every day good and bad because I'm truly showing up for the first time in a long time.  I've been going to the gym after work and keep getting compliments on my appearance- so in addition to feeling good I know I look good too...I felt lost for a long time and kind of left behind by life and I am realizing now that it was the booze holding me back.  I just picked a shitty destructive coping mechanism...I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to leave it behind for good.  I will not drink with you today.
