Hi just came across this sub. ..I haven't touched any alcohol for 3 years now. Back story:.Been casual drinker since 18 just going out at the weekends etc. When I first turned legal age of drinking didnt matter how much I drank would always be sick. As I entered my 20s if I went out drinking while having hangover from he'll I also started passing out. Happened a few times where I was on way to the toilet to be sick and would wake up at the bottom of the stairs after coming around. Scared my mum a few times (especially since her dad was an alcoholic and he died choking on his sick) at 22 I became a dad and my night outs became very few and far between. Even on some night outs I chose to take the car and not drink. As I turned 30 night outs basically became only for special occasions like friends birthdays etc. Went to a friend's 30th and my partner left early in the nighr due to a migraine I stayed out and decided to start hitting shots. I ended up all night being sick. Again passing out and spiking myself. My partner put me in the recovery position too as she said was struggling  for breath. After  a lot of grovelling I managed to convince her not to dump me. Later that year went out for friends birthday got very drunk  again had to have my partner stop me from choking on my sick. I had passed out and missed hitting my head on radiator by inches. Was given an ultimatum that if I ever Drs k again she would leave so I haven't drank alcohol since. ..Now on to present day and predicament since. I stopped drinking I have not been on too many night out with my friends. In contact with them daily but any time night out is on agenda and make excuses. A lot of it is down to me not really thinking my friends are on board with me being teetotal now. .My stag is being planned and Vegas has been mentioned. I don't want to be boring and not participate in stag activities however at the same time if I drink at my stag there won't be a wedding. .Should I get them altogether and explain that I want a sober stag and i mean it or bail on the stag altogether ?.

It seems pretty clear to me that every time you do drink there are negative consequences.....I think proposing a sober stag do would be an excellent idea... it's your party so you call the shots! (not those kind of shots obviously)... If your friends don't like it tough... I'm sure you can find something fun to do that doesn't involve pissed-up debauchery!..Congrats on your forthcoming wedding!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I could never throw a stag party with alcohol and I haven't craved alcohol for 25 years.
