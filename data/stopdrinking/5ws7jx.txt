I am a 23 year old male. And I've had addiction problems for years. First with drugs. Now with alcohol. And it's bad. And I know I have to stop. But I don't want to. But I do want to. And I'm scared. I'm scared of so many things. And I think some people here have gone through similar things. And I'm asking for any advice. ..I started using marijuana at fifteen then harder drugs at sixteen and seventeen. I drank a bit in high school but not much or very consistently. But I do now. I drink every night. And almost always alone. And I want to change and I want to stop. But I'm terrified. ..When I went to college I was drinking on the weekends. But eventually I got really addicted to DXM getting high on cough medicine. It was so bad that I was even stealing it. So After three semesters I took time off my school to work and save money and figure some stuff out. I moved back in with my parents and worked at my dads factory. Then I was making money and could afford drugs. One night after taking DXM while still at work I overestimated the time it took to hit me. I knew I was fucked when leaving. Still tried to drive. Eventually I knew it was really bad. I couldn't even see. So I pulled over on the highway and turned my hazard lights on. I ended up getting an OWI when a cop stopped by me to see what was wrong. Blowing zeros on the breathalyzer but failing miserably at the field sobriety tests. That experience and the aftermath made me go to counseling. And I can happily say I haven't done any DXM or "hard drugs" in almost four years. ..But then I turned twenty-one. And I had money from the factory job. And I started drinking. A lot. I essentially replaced my addiction with another addiction. Deluding myself into being proud. And I still seeped in arrogance say "I don't do drugs anymore."  But I do. And it's a problem.  ..I'm back in school have been for two years. My grades are great. I like my classes. But I'm still drinking every night all night. I'm constantly sad. I'm anxious about the future. And I don't know what's happening to me. ..I have a meeting with a counselor on campus for alcohol abuse and mental health. And I'm excited but I'm nervous. I want to stop drinking. But I love drinking. And I know that's the alcoholism talking. But I do enjoy drinking. It's fun. But I know it's a problem. And I don't know what to do. I'm so scared about quitting and having to face life. I'm so scared about relapse. I'm scared about losing friends. I'm scared about facing reality. I know that I need to stop. But I also know that I can't do it alone. I really want to be able to drink socially with friends and family. Even get "drunk" on occasion. But I'm worried that it has to be all or nothing for me. And that scares me too. ..I know this is long. But I think this community has gone through similar problems. And I'm looking for any bit of advice or comfort.

It sounds like you have "addiction ambivalence" I suffered from it too for a long time. I did want to stop but I didn't. I think it's fantastic that you're going to see a counselor. When you quit the drugs did you go to any support groups? I go to Refuge Recovery meetings you could also check out AA or NA. This internet stranger is proud of you for facing those fears. Honesty and willingness to change will stand you in good stead. Best wishes and keep us posted!
I'm scared too man. Life is scary shit. But I know one thing for sure: it's slightly less scary that first time you decide not to drink. I struggled to string days together for a while and I thought I LOVED alcohol. I had a job for the first time so $80 bottle of scotch? Fuck it that was classy! $50 on some high proof bourbon? Sophisticated! Until I started to notice that bottles didn't last me quite as long as I thought they might.. Credit card bills when up so I figured Jameson would do nicely! Until the Jameson was empty.. But I didn't remember emptying it...Forget all that though I loved alcohol! I was immediately relaxed after work man. Netflix seemed more interesting! Shows were funnier.. But then I stopped remembering what I was watching the night before. And the hangovers were getting worse.. My clothes stopped fitting because I'd managed to gain 50 pounds. And it wasn't 2014 anymore... It was 2016....But none of that mattered compared to one thing: when I really looked around I had nothing. No real friends no girlfriend (at least none that had spoken to me in a couple years)...Here's what I had: parents that hadn't given up on me a dog and one friend who lived a few states away. And then one day it clicked - I didn't love alcohol but the way it made me forget how little I had...So please believe me when I say that you can lose everything before you even notice it's gone - and that's a good scenario.. While I can't speak for you here's the worst thing that happens if you give up the alcohol: you'll save a little money remember more of your life and become healthier. And damn it I think that's worth fighting for. ..I've found being honest with a doctor helpful. On top of that therapy is helping me really like who I am again. I'm 24 and I'm putting all my chips on sobriety. I know it's hard but try to give it up for a bit - feel free to reach out. There are great humans here and we're here to help...All my best - xJT
