I've struggled with inertia again today the consequences of taking opiates on Mon to treat a migraine then sleeping all day yesterday as the headache continued. I really don't know which is worse: gutting through the migraine or the aftermath of the opiates. I need help.

Didn't you post in the narcotics anonymous sub that you were addicted to pain pills?  
I wish you good health my friend. &lt;3
