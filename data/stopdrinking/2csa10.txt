Here we are again: the week's half over and I'm on a mini-vacation!  Time to post your triumphs and struggles...**Triumph**: This has been a busy week starting with doing server maintenance on Sunday night from 9 PM to 3 AM.  In the old days I'd have been drunk half way through the maintenance but this time I stayed focused on the work and enjoyed a root beer while I worked.  Before after getting to bed somewhere around 3:30 I'd have basically missed the whole next day.  This time I was at work only about an hour later than usual...**Struggle**: Nothin'.  Life is good...**General Chat**: I'm in a tennis tournament this weekend that's out of town.  I'm looking forward to playing well and getting to the next level...So how are you doing?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: Today is the beginning of day 4. Woke up feeling relaxed today without any anxiety this never happens to me! Didn't even need any coffee...Struggle: Still dealing with the cry feelings. Almost started again earlier. Emotional rollercoaster is in full force...General Chat: I will not drink today.
**Triumph:** I'm 11 days from getting my 90 day chip. I attended my first AA convention with 355 other recovering alkies made new friends laughed a lot and immersed myself in the "experience  strength and hope" of those with so much more experience. ..My credit card is down to $109.99 balance now that I'm no longer charging $50+ weekly to my card. I'll pay it off soon...I'm down 5 lbs. This is the first time the scale moved down in the past year. ..**Struggle:** came home from convention and almost immediately got myself into an ugly fight with my spouse. Nearly melted down but used my support system to get me through...My sneaky sick mind is occasionally quietly telling me this whole "AA and alcoholic" thing is absurd.  Why am I spending so much thought time and energy to avoiding picking up a liquid? Why can't I just NOT DRINK? I'm allergic to coconut...so I just don't eat coconut! Damn this alcohol stuff is truly cunning...Oh..and my betta fish has fin rot. It is going to suck to treat it. First world problems. ..**General chat:**  I did two days of Zumba in a row. I hate exercise but I'm trying again and Zumba is the only thing I can "enjoy"...Oh and I'm raising money for a breast cancer research walk in my area for the 5th year in a row. Lost my grandma to that bastard cancer. **Screw you cancer.**..Stay sober my friends. .Mouse..
Triumph: Today is my "Friday"...taking a little (very little) time off...looking forward to some reading and relaxing with the kids...Struggle: I need to cram 3 days of work into one today so I'm ready for this mini staycation.....General Chat: Just digging life...I hope everybody else has a good one.
**Triumph**:  Avoided drinking at a work dinner with people I don't know well (normally would have had several drinks there then continued once I made it home...)!..**Struggle**:  Have just been feeling really sad anxious and stressed this week.  It's been hard to focus on work or anything else...**General Chat**:  None really - just wanted to say /u/JimBeamsHusband I love watching your amateur tennis career progress week by week!  :)
**Triumph:** Went away for an evening with my GF. Neither of us own a car so we rented a car.  Its pretty nice to be able to do things like this...**Struggle:** I got nothing. I have to clean my apartment go for a swim and do some laundry today.  The cleaning part is going to be the hardest...**General Chat:** Looking forward to going to an electronic music festival this Friday and Saturday.  I get to see a couple of artists for a second or third time.  I also get to see New World Punx for the first time.  There are going to be a couple of sober people in my posse I am going with. I have also seen the Facebook statuses of some friends from AA who I didn't know where attending.
**Triumph:** I made it under 200 pounds for the first time in probably three years... Super. Stoked. ..**Struggle:** My SO still drinks and while that in itself isn't an issue the past couple of days I have been really having this internal struggle with the notion of reintroducing moderate drinking. My scumbag brain keeps operating under the logic of "You started out in control why can't it be that way again?" ..It's really hard. I miss certain aspects of drinking and really wish there were a way for me to control it's impact on my life without an all or nothing method but I'm absolutely afraid of falling right back down the path where I was three months ago... ..Still sober though despite the struggle. I've gotten more done in these past three months than I have in the past three years (In terms of overall personal growth) and I really don't want to undo any of that. ..I just wish these negative thoughts would go the fuck away. Know what I mean?..**General Chat:** Other than what I mentioned above I'm doing great - I'm about a third of the way through my current training manual on Red Hat Linux and hope to be certified with them by the end of this year. In doing so I will be qualified for much better jobs. Which is *really* nice. 
**Triumph:**  5 days sober.  Feeling better by the day...**Struggle:** Can't sleep much.  ..**General Chat:**  Biking trip planned for Saturday
**Triumph**: I've made a few half-assed attempts to quit in the past but I want this time to stick so I'm doing things differently. I've finally been honest with my mother and SO about quitting and tomorrow I'm going to my first AA meeting (so nervous though!). It's only day 10 but I feel better than I have in years...**Struggle**: Sleep is still finicky and I hope these bizarro dreams go away soon...**General Chat**: The meeting I'm going to tomorrow is a women's discussion meeting if anyone has any tips or suggestions...
Triumph:Well I haven't drank this week so far so I've got that going for me. I drove past the grocery store last night and I was debating whether or not to get food for dinner. Not about whether I should get beer. That was a first. I decided against it and went home to eat cereal. Day two away from cigarettes...Struggle: I really hate going to bed. My dreams are starting to get out of control. I get about one drinking dream per night and the other night I had a really strange one where I was out in the middle of the desert alone left to wander alone until I ran out of water but I could drink all the alcohol I wanted. Also I'm trying to read this book with a lot of really small grammatical errors. Every time I see one my eye twitches a little bit. ..General chat: Just grinding until I can make it till my friday night AA meetings. Going to a gun show on saturday then I have another week ahead of me.

**Triumph:** Went to my 3rd creative writing class love it. Starting to feel a connection to a couple of people and considering taking it to the next level and asking if anyone wants to meet for coffee sometime and chat about books and writing. Not sure I'm going to do it but I know a few years ago this thought wouldn't even have occurred to me. I wouldn't have been in the class anyway. ("I'll sign up 'next semester'")  ..**Struggle:** Called in sick at work today and feeling a bit guilty about it. Slept like shit because someone has a dog outside and it barked all night. There's not much for me to do today no meetings or deadlines so it's not that big of a deal but still. Not something I want to make into a habit. This wasn't a problem for me before I quit drinking; I didn't have a job. ;)  ..**General chat:** None. I need to kick my ass off Reddit. Hope everyone has a great day.

TRIUMPH: I've lost 12 lbs in five weeks. Cutting out those extra 800-900 calories of alcohol a day sure helps..STRUGGLE: I'm having crazy mood swings. I thought I would feel better by now. I thought drinking was causing my depression but maybe I was drinking because I was depressed? It's been 5 years of serious alcoholism and I'm not sure what normal feels like. Is this typical of recovery?..Edit: This is my first time posting here. Thanks for all the hopeful positive stories everyone is posting.
**Triumph**: I am slowly but surely reversing my slob ways. I make Foul Bachelorette Frog look like Heloise or the ladies from How Clean Is Your House?..**Struggle**: I am going through a really difficult time emotionally and it's dragging up some demons I'd rather not have drug up...**General Chat**: MLS All-Stars vs Bayern M nchen tonight. Schweinsteiger   
1 week and things are going pretty good. 
**Triumph**: Got a raise this week have a date tomorrow night with a decently attractive girl that's not a crazy alcoholic like me...**Struggle**: Have thought a SHIT TON about drinking this past week not sure why all of a sudden I'm having these thoughts but I probably need to step my program game up and talk to some more drunks...**General Chat**: Not going to drink today. Huzzah!
Triumph- finally got a sponsor so I can start moving forward in the program working the steps. In the meetings I go to the hang the promises on the wall and I often gaze up. Realize though that those promises don't come just from showing up at the meetings. So I asked a lady I like who I've already called a few times and now we've established nightly check in calls. I feel good about this like I'm being more proactive...Struggle- feeling kind of empty right now. Not sure why. Just empty and adrift sometimes. I feel like I have a hard time connecting with people. Wanting to be alone is usually my default setting even after getting drugs and alcohol out of the picture...General chat- I spent last winter in winter In Guatemala and I'll be going back this winter. looking forward to doing it sober. Talked to my sponsor about maintaining contact while I'm gone. Also I have internet so I spect to be posting here. Want to keep seeing the numbers on my badge rise. but...need to focus on doing the next right thing for today.
