*EDIT After a very harsh comment by someone who told me flat out I'm not ready or able to quit I wanted to put the title in context (since I can't change it). I just realize they are a serious trigger and got blind sided earlier this week. I had started on a beautiful sobriety run (would have been the weeks now which is nothing to shake a stick at) but just got blind side by the anxiety of thinking about this weekendand had a knee jerk reaction. I will not make that mistake again this weekend. .____________________..So I don't want this to come access as me laying  blame of my struggles with alcohol on my parents. It's me and my stupid hands that drinks at the end of the day. ..But the childhood issues I faced that caused my substance abuse (thank God is only been alcohol) are in many parts due to my family. Now with the holidays here they will be visiting us and the kids this weekend. ..This should be happy right? But no. I fear the visit. I fear the inevitable emotional roller coaster I have coming my way and so earlier this week I fell off the wagon. ..Back fighting the good  fight and determined to have a sober Christmas with my wife and kids and in laws (my parents I'll have to endure... But they're still my parents and grand parents to my two munchkins) . ..Just wanted to share... Cause honestly last time I kicked the habit sharing my deep secrets and feelings (that I can only otherwise  share with my wife)  with SD was helpful. My wife is amazing and I couldn't have done any of this without her. But the perspective and support from you guys who actually know and understand how I feel has been pivotal. ..Thank you all Merry Christmas. Hopefully this time next year instead of celebrating my first sober Christmas I can celebrate my first sober year.

Family stuff can be tough. Have you considered getting help outside of your family to work on your feelings about your parents?..I am sending sober thoughts your way and I hope your visit is okay
When I fell off the wagon again and again it was because I am an alcoholic. It was nice for me at the time to think that it was due to my personal circumstances and that if anybody else had the life I did they'd be drinking their face off every day too...I'm not responsible for being an alcoholic. BUT I AM responsible for what I'm gonna do about it now today and I am responsible for putting my disease in remission. ..Here's to not drinking today...Best wishes to you.
Don't sweat the negativity of that commentator. I think the title might have have triggered the thought "hey! this alcoholic is trying to blame others for his problem!" which I know is generally considered off-track for recovery; taking responsibility and not blaming others is supposed to be foundational to getting better (and it probably is)...Not that I know much about being sober but I know about being an addict and addiction is not simply a matter of chemicals being irresistible. I know my parents fucked me up and stress me out! ..If I had been raised differently who knows if I would be having this problem right now but that doesn't matter anymore I just want to be sober for me and my poor little body. My last mess up with booze was when I was spending a lot of time with family so I feel you. Stay strong and carry on. No more booze for 2016...And then of course no more booze until my birthday. And then no more booze until 2017. And then no more booze until I'm 40....But most importantly no booze today...
Glad you're here.  Sorry for the harsh comment you experienced...First guideline here is "be Kind".  ..I wish you luck and a Merry Christmas!
