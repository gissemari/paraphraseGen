I'm not sleeping much I'm not working the program properly just now I'm not being particularly useful to others and I'm trying to run the whole show controlling everything and everyone. Honestly I thought it'd be straight forward to work the AA program - I'm a scholarly type (or like to think I am!) so have a book for AA notes a copy of the big book for annotations and a 'clean' copy also (for what?! an exam?!!) - it's just the way my mind works! However it only works if I work it and yet knowing this  I find I stop working it during times of the low mood/insomnia/tiredness cycle...when I need it the most! I can't seem to get back 'into it' -I'll be chatting with my sponsor later (she has been on holiday and I haven't called anyone else like I should have done!) and am about to do some big book reading. I left Sunday's meeting early and didn't go to my home group meeting last night. It's self sabotage I guess...subconsciously preparing for a relapse? I'm as sure as an alcoholic can ever be that I won't pick up a drink but not working the programme leaves my defences down. Gah sorry for the lack of coherence here. As clich  as it sounds - anyone else been through this?

This is a smart post.  I am one of those people who when I get even vaguely interested in a subject will do a google search read the Wikipedia entry and basically satisfy my curiosity.  I did this with recovery and since I originally got sober in 1986 I accomplished this with a lot of reading.  One excellent online resources is [silkworth.net](http://silkworth.net/) if you're interested in exploring more on the subject.  ..Don't be too self-critical if you're having a bad day--you got to bed sober right?  Sometimes in early sobriety that's all that matters.  Today's another day.
I spent ~3 months laboring under the belief that I would relapse  so I did. Then I shifted my thinking that I don't *have* to relapse. And haven't.
