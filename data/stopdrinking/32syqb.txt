For awhile I've been aware that I tend to be unappreciative of things in general. This wasn't always the case. I've also always admired people seemed to notice and voice the positive whether it be about circumstances or just genuinely cared about you. After some research I learned that coming up with 3 NEW things that you are genuinely grateful to have in your life causes your brain to start automatically "scanning" for things to be happy about. Science bitch! :) *Science of happiness*..I've struggled with being consistent with this so I wanted to take a different approach. Instead of privately handwriting them out in the morning publicly post them here...Today:..1) I am grateful I get to wrap my mind around the feeling of "I did it!" after making myself get outside and run my 3 miles. ..2) I love listening to the soaring fragile strong and beautiful female vocals in some of the songs I downloaded this week...3) I love getting to continue exploring the never-ending rabbit hole of what makes my life actually tick. What makes me come alive. ..4) *extra* I'm glad this sub exists and I'm glad I made the effort to switch my journaling approach up. It feels a little cooler already...*please feel very free to throw one up of your own! I love reading these things as much as making them

Great post!..**Gratitude is a key element in a positive attitude - which in turn is key to a successful happy recovery.**..It really is that simple.  ..When your head is up your ass the view is dark things tend to stink.   
Love this idea! .Today I'm grateful for: .a) a beautiful Spring day in the Pacific Nw .b) coffee .c) practiced public speaking at work today &amp; am grateful it went well.
