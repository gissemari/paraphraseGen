I just wanted to thank every one on this sub for posting. Whether you've got less than 24 hours or 24 years the stories of your successes and struggles are a source of inspiration for me every day. Addiction is rough what ever forms it takes it's mentally and physically draining and I needed - and still need - help to stop chasing that buzz. We may be strangers but I love you guys and I believe that we can all be better. ..-Eric
