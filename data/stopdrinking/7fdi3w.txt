I  made it through four straight holiday evenings (SO Mom's side Dad's side my Mom's side and Friendsgiving). I  didn't expect to survive this maelstrom but I  came out the other side and learned a lot about my family friends and myself...This victory is making all my  relapse plans  for Christmas and New Years and beyond lose their power. I  CAN retrain my brain and alter my reward system...It was very difficult. I  was the only sober person in virtually every scenario. For days and nights. Away from home. This feels really damn good y'all and is truly unprecedented for me. ..Onwards!.

And now I  finally have time to update my phone.
Woot! Nice work. 
Good work friend. 
4 NDV's in a row! (non-drinking victories)..Way to Go Midnite!!!
Onwards!  Just last weekend I had formulated a plan that involved getting and staying drunk only until the New year...close call but did not do it.  [Link here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7e8ipx/to_those_who_had_the_bottle_in_hand_or_were_on/) Onwards!
I am with you on that. So thankful for seeing the world without beer goggles..I will not drink with you today.
I was pretty much planning on giving in and drinking the last two days. But in the thick of it no pressure every came up no asked why I wasn't drinking it was just normal. .Not drinking with y'all today. 
I love that you mention "re-training your brain" because that's what it feels like I'm doing!..I love that you aren't just suffering through hard things for no reason but that this success makes the next success easier!..Great job!
