According to my badge I'm at mid 70s (is today my 75? Woo!) and it is *still* a daily struggle. What's really been hard for me hasn't been the drinking but all the stuff that I've been hiding from by drinking. ..Turns out I have anger issues tending to go off half cocked and completely undemocratic. I tend to be judgmental toward my family members I tend to be distant and condescending. And rather than deal with all these things I've spent a decade drinking it away slowly increasing my doses as I went. ..This is a radical departure from the story I tell myself that I'm successful hard working a model person etc. At this point I think that has been a big factor in my being "arms length" from my whole now mostly mature family. It's pretty tough to face my flaws weaknesses and marginality as a father and husband. I've worked long and hard as a provider but not so much as an emotional center. ..I get tempted to drink daily even though the feeling of intoxication itself isn't so much of a pull any more. I'm conflicted I'm often feeling depressed elated emotionally all over the map. It's exhausting to my wife - I think I may seek a counselor soon. My "picture perfect" life is much less together than I'd imagined. And the temptation to take the easy way out and drink an evening away rather than deal with these complex issues is each and every day. Much of my success thus far has simply been force of habit - going to the liquor store just 2 blocks away would be a change in my routine and I just delay the decision to go until I eventually fall asleep. ..I know that everybody's tale is different but my lesson so far is that drinking has been for me a way of avoiding real life problems problems that got worse the longer I did it. Quitting the bottle won't automatically make my life into a rainbow-farting unicorn life *it just gives me a chance that I should probably take*...Now I get why AA has all those steps about harm done and stuff - that always seemed silly to me. But the harsh reality is that if you're the type that has to go through the hassle of quitting drinking there's probably a fair number of things out there that you'll need to face down and fix and that process won't be painless. ..I refuse to cower from my past mistakes and will not drink again today. Thanks SD for being there!

I still do this one day at a time. The days do get better though. I have done the steps in AA multiple times and my behavior has markedly improved but is far from perfect so I still get regular opportunities to make amends. This is the freedom I now enjoy. When I make a mistake I can ask for forgiveness and move on to do the next right thing. This is the best I can do and I today I am comfortable with that...Have you been to any meetings? 
I can't believe how lucid your post is at 75 days. I only wish I felt this way at 75 days. It took me longer but I came around and realized that the ONLY way forward for me was to face everything and recover. So in addition to not drinking--my former coping mechanism--I also was facing all my stressors--no wonder so few people get and stay sober!! The key for me was I didn't face all that stuff all at the same time. I think that if I did I would vaporize into thin air as it felt like 99.99% of my whole being was character defects. ..So I did it one day at a time. Not drink for 24 hours maybe take a look at one defect pick it up study it discard it. I did not do this all by my lonesome. I found it's good to have a Steersman someone to lead me through all this that had also gone through it themselves...Yep it's not *going* to be OK nope...that's because it already is OK and so are you!
