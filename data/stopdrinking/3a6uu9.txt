It's been a while since last time I was here on Reddit but I need to come back because I need the support right now and I have no one to turn to.    .Let's start from the... start. Shall we?    .     .I started drinking when I was around 13 - my first hangover was at that age at my sister's friends' party and somehow I managed to drink a lot of wine enough for being so drunk I needed to throw up many times. A few years later I started going out with my own friends when I was around 16 and bars in Brazil back then couldn't care less if you were a minor ordering alcoholic beverages so I went out almost every weekend to get really drunk.     .Things started to complicate when I was around 19 when I got into college and started hanging out with some drunk guys - we went out to drink at least a couple of times a week and weekends. It went on until I was 22 when things got out of control.     .Basically in 2011 I was raped when I was out of the country and a way to let it go was drinking as much as I could. It was difficult but I kinda got over it - though I can't tell you the same about my drinking habits. In 2012 my ex-boyfriend came back to my life in January - long story short: we were together he vanished and reappeared in 2012 without even knowing who I was - and by the end of March close to our birthdays he passed away because of an aneurism. Well... Things got out of hand.     .I used to drink every single day. No exceptions. Skipped classes failed some others shut down and didn't let anyone in and became the sluttiest person I new just because I wanted to have sex with someone to let go of eventual sexual frustrations. I could say it was my rock bottom. I even got STDs because of that - nothing serious but yeah I was fucking with my health not only by drinking as much as I could.     .That habit went on during 2013 up until I met who would become my boyfriend. In the beginning of the relationship I was completely toxic to him - I lied to go out cheated on him got shitfaced on a lot of places he still don't know I went to. I was a terrible person but mostly I did because I was too drunk to care. It's important to say though that we were not officially dating when I did all of those things and I know it doesn't make it sound better I still went out with other people and lied to him. We had a huge argument and he almost broke up with me when he discovered everything I did but I convinced him to stay and actually tried to become a better person.     .I became devoted to him from that point on but then... The tables had turned. He became toxic to me because he just couldn't trust me anymore (and with a good reason tbh) but still he made me feel like crap even when I was doing things right. It kept going this way for months and months to the point I was doubting myself. I came here back then asking for help and many of you were incredible to me and I'm still grateful for all you've done.     .But you know... That relationship fucked me up. We broke up two months ago and somehow he still hates me talks shit about me everywhere. I started drinking again lost my job and now I'm having financial struggles because I'm just fucking broke.     .To be honest last night I was even thinking about suicide but I know it's not worth it. It's never gonna be worth it. I just gotta find inside myself that little spark to keep going.      .Like I've heard in some Paramore song (sorry about it): The blood in these veins isn't pumping any less than it ever has. And that's the hope I have the only thing I know it's keeping me alive.    .Sorry for the long rant/vent but... I needed to spill it all out. I need help. I can't live like this anymore.     .Thank you guys for supporting me back then thank you for all you've done :D I'm grateful I can come here and pour my heart out knowing I won't be judged. You guys are awesome..     .      .         .Sorry if I made any grammar mistakes!     .    .        .**EDIT:** Forgot an important information sorry >< I want to stop drinking and I want a healthier lifestyle. I NEED it.

I'm from Brazil too and started to drink when i was 16yo same as you. It was a weird time back then. We could go everywhere and drink like grown ups. Nobody really cared as long as you paid....My badge is not correct and i'm still struggling. I hope you get better real soon.
