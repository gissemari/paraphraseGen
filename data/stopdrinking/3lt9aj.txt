tl;dr - Brain dump amongst my peers. Still chugging along happy for suggestions to keep the ball rolling as I approach a sticky period...No revelations no white knuckle struggles .... just carrying on through the good and the bad. Sober people sober places isn't always possible and I find myself faced with unexpected thoughts of cracking on what seems to becoming a regular basis (SO drinks a couple times a week just been noticing it a lot more lately). The thoughts of tossing it away are really starting to piss me off. Not because I can't/won't drink but because this *thing* keeps showing up to needle me. I love being sober. I don't want to be buzzed or wasted. I love having a clear head and a natural rhythm to my day. Even the nano-second that I might think I'd want that first one the thought rushes in that I really don't because I don't want *anything* that follows after no matter how well things may go.  It pisses me off that I got caught up in something so pointless and damaging to the point that I can't just walk away and be done with it. It's got to come back and poke poke poke.  ..But there's always good for the bad and light in the dark.  Not drinking is becoming less of a decision and more of the way things are. I don't drink.  There's no decision in that. Whatever follows as a result of that is just internal mumbo jumbo that I'm learning how to navigate more efficiently. I LOVE waking up following a sober day. Literally every morning one of my first 3 thoughts is "I'm so glad I didn't drink yesterday."  I feel *right* that I'm available whenever for whatever with a sober mind. I've been irresponsible and unreliable for far too long in my life. Some moments can be very *blah* and *eh* but really that's life.  Where the hell did I get the idea that life didn't include this aspect? Because I drank my way through those times too and instead of just spicing the day up a bit I often went beyond "spicing" to embarrassed regretful dangerous sick incapacitated... you name it it came along at some point...Also on my mind is that over the last two years this is my 5th staunch attempt at sobriety. The other 4 all came to a screeching halt a couple weeks shy of or beyond the 2 month mark. I'm well aware that this time is approaching.  Though I *feel* this time is different that carries very little security in my opinion. I *feel* like I've managed to grow up since the last try and I'm looking at things a lot more realistically and a lot less emotion-driven.  Emotions are fine and all they just don't get the job done. So I'm starting on a quest to add a few more tools for different situations in anticipation of this period. Mostly I need to prepare for the fuckits and the "you done good you can handle a little". I've made it this far on SD and taking each situation for what it is making sure the final outcome has been not drinking. I'm going to have to step up my game and though meetings are last on my list of things I'm willing to do I am staying open to the idea as a last resort. ..I plan on putting into motion some additional improvements that will keep me on my toes (and out of a rut). I've already quit sugared pop as of this weekend. I've had no weight loss quitting booze because I doubled up on all my other bad intake habits.  I feel good about this small challenge.  Coming in the next couple of weeks is to quit smoking.  This one will be huge. I'm just not stepping out on that ledge until I feel I can give it a real effort. That's not today though and probably not tomorrow either! I like lists but I'm prone to abandon the habit pretty quickly so I don't know that's a good tool for me.  However I like to *do* so I may add in a positive daily *do* that requires me to make a deliberate action.  As long as I feel I'm moving forward as a person I'm much less likely to fall back. Suggestions are welcome of course! I'm not very creative/original so this is a great place for your fabulous ideas!

Instead of focusing on the prior history of "failure"--focus on the here and now and before you know it you will be beyond those tumbledown dates of yore. 
&gt;though meetings are last on my list of things I'm willing to do I am staying open to the idea as a last resort...Just a thought but I know that if I was struggling I was less likely to do something that I hadn't done before or was unfamiliar with. It may be a good idea to check out a meeting before hand...think of it as preventative maintenance.
