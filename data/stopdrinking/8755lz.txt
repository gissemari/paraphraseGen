I am 44 days sober today. After a four year stint of dryness following treatment I relapsed 19 months ago. I just got out of treatment again on Monday and I feel AMAZING!!! I don't have any insane alcohol cravings but I do not have a sponsor yet. Tonight I skipped the women's meeting because there were only two cars in the parking lot.... I got scared. So I thought this would be a good way to get honest about missing my meeting. I feel guilty for not going in now.. Bur I do know that all is NOT lost because I am still sober. I never want to go back to that. It's amazing that y'all are all here for each other!!! Glad to join

Maybe those two cars were filled with women who missed you at the meeting. Even if it was only two that's all it takes for a meeting. Glad you're back. Sobriety was easier and more fun for me with a support system.
Welcome back!
