I'd like to share the success of being sober now for a little over two weeks.  I have had some 'forced' help during this time.  Most of last week I was camping and had no access to get anything due to literally miles and miles of wilderness separating me and a liquor store.  The thought crossed my mind to bring out some hard alcohol to have around the campfire but I decided to just say no.  This week my wife will be out of town with our car and I have no intention of walking my ass to get anything...I have been struggling with the thoughts of 'when will this end' now more than simply craving a drink.  These thoughts are almost as bad.  But at the same time I almost feel nervous to get anything to drink also.  For some of you folks who have been free a month or longer what kinds of things help you?

Oh man. I remember the "when will this end." It gets said a lot but the whole "one day at a time" is a really good start. Don't think about tomorrow or next weekend or next year because you will drive yourself crazy. ..Another thing that has helped me is thinking about the things I don't want to end that I now have because of sobriety. I don't ever want to wake up with a hangover again I don't want to have to look over my texts to remember what stupid stuff I did the night before I don't want my closest relationship to be with a bottle... Those are the things that I never want to end. ..Keep at it! 
I do a lot of reciting to myself every day of all the benefits I am experiencing from sobriety usually while driving to work. It keeps me focused on why my choice is the right one. And I don't treat it as a punishment with part of me still resisting. I decided wholeheartedly to quit and I keep up that whole body desire to stay sober through reading books on sobriety being part of a recovery group and being very honest with my friends about it. It normalizes it for me to talk about it. Reading the Allen Carr book noted in the sidebar helped recalibrate my view on what I was "missing out on". Good luck you can do it!
