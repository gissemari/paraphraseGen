*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---    .Numerous metaphors have been used to describe life. Among them is the metaphor of life as a battle. Try not to think of life in these terms because if you regard life as a struggle it will become one and you will have little joy. It is far better to think of life as a journey in which the difficulties are hills to climb. The hills are there for a reason (even if you don't know what that reason is) and the sense of satisfaction after climbing the hill is almost always worth the effort. ~Richard E. Turner.

Tomorrow will be 1 month! I will not drink with you today..
Staying sober today means I have a fighting chance of a great day tomorrow- Im not ready to give this up so I wont be drinking with you all today SD...Stay strong and remember that you can do this &lt;3
Omg it's 3:50AM and I'm awake. I won't drink today but I can't promise I won't eat some Reece's Pieces by the end of the day. Again I won't drink today!
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.
I won't drink today!! 
That's a fun number of days for me today!  I'm really focused on being intentional this week and making clear conscious choices rather than being tossed around by circumstances.  As always the most important part of that is actively choosing sobriety.  I will not drink today!
Went to bed early. Woke up early with no alarm clock. Get to watch the sunrise with coffee and without a hangover. There's no way I could have done this before! I will not drink with you today. 
Still dealing with aftermath from last weekend ~ day 3 and not drinking today!
I will not drink with you guys today 
I won't drink today.
It's day 3 I will not drink with you today! 
Thank you! 
Checking in! IWNDWYT!
Today I'm not drinking. I'm not drinking for joy and I'm not drinking for sorrow. I will experience both feelings as they are for what they are...My joy is richer without alcohol. My sorrow and worries are better faced than clouded in alcohol.
Got through one week without drinking and was astonished about how much more alive I felt. Like I had been sleepwalking my whole life. Then my girlfriend brought home a bottle of red wine last night arguing that I shouldn't completely quit that I should instead drink more moderately and have a glass with her because its not fair to her if I don't drink with her. I caved. ..After a couple of glasses I could feel the alcoholic thirst taking over agreeing with her that we should get another bottle but then I stopped myself and thought about the last week. And knew that I can start sobriety again...Now that I know what is on the other side. I will not drink today.

Hey SD! I'm not drinking today. Have a great day! xo
I will not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking today!
Double digits. Feeling great!! 
I will not drink today 
I was up until 1 AM yesterday without noticing the passing of time not because i was drinking (sweaty and miserable and sick!) but because i was so caught up in my work. I always get surprised by these little gems of sober life..I will not drink with you today.
I went to bed around 3 am while also eating around that hour. This has happened several times already in the past week. While I'm thrilled to be sober and reach my 10th day of freedom I need to quit eating unhealthy stop drinking coffee in the afternoon and go to bed at a normal hour...No matter what happens I am not drinking with you all today.
Not gonna drink today . 7 days !!! WuuuuWeee
I'm feeling inspired by you all my fellow SDers. New challenges ahead. Socialising tonight for the first time in this new non drinking week with friends who always have a drink in hand ... but I will remember these 7 simple all important words ...I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink with you all today.
I completely agree with todays writing Kis :) I spent so many years *Fighting that Battle* &amp; couldn't work out why I was still so angry.... Acceptance of the Journey is hard to understand sometimes But it makes living so much more satisfying (even on the 'ugly' days)!!!..I am happy to say that I didn't drink this morning nor this afternoon &amp; I proudly will not be drinking (or smoking) tonight :)
I will not drink with you today!!.
I'm in.
Good morning! I will not drink today.

I will not drink that poison today no matter what. 
I will not drink today!

I will not drink today or tonight. And i will not scarf up a pound of cheese and crackers at book group.
I will not drink today.
Closing in on 90 days. Again. I can do it for today. I can get closer to my goals!
My ex-wife has contacted me out of the blue. Not a triggering event at least I don't think so just odd. I will not drink either way.
Looking forward to another dry day with you all.

Good morning SD!!..The heat will finally break today...which is OK even though I *just* finished installing the downstairs ductless A/C unit this weekend and I'm having fun keeping things cool in the living room even though it's over 90 outside...But...that's an expensive indulgence and I still have to install the upstairs unit(s) so the Fall-like turn of weather will be welcome...So much stuff going on when I would have just Jacked my way through the days and nights...maybe it's the time of year I dunno.  But I'm once again in new territory...*not* pouring a drink every time I have to stop and consider what to do...But it worked for me yesterday and I'm going to keep not drinking for today...So: I will not drink today SD...Take care my friends..
No alcohol today for me. 
I will not drink today...I've been stressing all week waiting to hear back from a job. ..Last night my husband and I had a date and this was the first night all week where I didn't dream about drinking or smoking. ..Getting out of the house and having some fun really helped...I'm grateful for my loved ones. ..Have a great day SD.

Hi all! I'd like to share a quote that really struck me last night - it's from D.T. Suzuki's book Essays In Zen Buddhism and while it is specifically addressing the history and growth of Zen I think it has a lot of meaning for any kind of personal growth as well:.."We know that the acorn is so different from the oak but as long as there is a continuation of growth their identity is a logical conclusion. To really see into the nature of the acorn is to trace an uninterrupted development through its various historical stages. When the seed remains a seed and means nothing more there is no life in it"..I love you all and believe in all of you. I won't drink with you today...- Emma
I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today!

I will not drink today. Been getting up earlier and writing and it feels great! Aiming for 1000 words a day!
Been lurking here for awhile. I got burned really badly by AA about 10 years ago and have shied away from affiliating myself with any group for my binge-y issues but my drinking is getting worse and I'm worried it'll turn into something truly uncontrollable if I don't deal with it now..I can do this. I can stay sober today. Thanks for giving me this space.  
Not today. 
Checking in for the day. Really close to a year now!
Not drinking today. Depression has been a real bitch lately but I'm not giving in. Seeking other ways to make it through

I will not drink with you today!
Ughhhhhh I won't drink today. 
I will not drink today.  (Day 60 what??!)
I thought today was Wednesday. What a pleasant surprise. Not drinking today.
Went to a show in Minneapolis and stayed in a hotel by myself last night. Normally would have been a huge drinking night. I'd be trying to piece together what happened at the show mentally and checking my purse for my debit card etc nervously wondering if I'd lost anything. But not today. Had every bit as much fun sober as I'd have had drunk. It was so much fun that I'm definitely doing it again today. Touring Paisley Park before heading back home to small town midwest USA this afternoon and all day and all night I will be not drinking with you all.
I will not drink with all you lovely people today!
The longer I have gone without alcohol the better I am feeling. It's crazy that I used to think alcohol made me feel better.....I realized yesterday that alcohol has controlled my mind for many many years. And I still think about it as much as I ever did when I was drinking. Except now my frame of reference has changed and now I'm able to see what a destructive force alcohol has been in my life. I'm grateful for my sobriety...I can't wait to not drink with you all today!
I will not drink with you today.   
I will not drink with you today.  Going to a concert later and I am looking forward to remembering it!!!!
Didn't drink last night and feeling better this morning than I did yesterday.  Hoping I can drag myself into a meeting tonight.  Looking forward to feeling even better tomorrow.
It's 1:40AM. I had trouble getting to sleep last night. I could easily have broken my streak since it was easily the hardest night so far what with my narcissistic alcoholic parents giving me shit for not being good enough and it turning into a nasty argument yada yada yada   but I've resolved that I'm going to be better than them and that I'm not going to let it get to me and deal with my problems by numbing myself with poison like they do. That (1) star is looking pretty good to me this evening! Fuck drinking today.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today no matter what. 
I will not drink  today.
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today! Thanks to all for being here.
not drinking today!
I took my time making coffee in the morning enjoyed a nice drive into work and now I'm getting situated for a long busy day. I won't drink with y'all today!
I will not drink with you today. I will live life instead.
I will not drink today no matter what! 
I'm staying clean today! No drinking for me.
 Feeling good today! The nasty bug has finally exited and I'm eager to get back into my routine.      .So Happy It's Thursday!  .I will not drink with you today!
I won't drink today 
No drinking today! Feeling a lot better after pulling a muscle in my back on Monday. I felt pretty helpless and in pain but taking care of myself helped it heal a lot quicker than if I had been drinking! Always gotta focus on the positive! 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today no matter what.
I won't be drinking I'll be working! Not drinking with any of you today!

Day 3.  I actually slept and stopped getting shivers.  I won't drink today.
I have a big interview tomorrow. I won't be drinking today - instead I will be focusing on prepping! IWNDWYT
Lovely morning with no hangover. I will not drink with you today!.
Day 2 - Day one was hard today will be harder.  I decided to decline an invitation to see some friends from my old job at a bar tonight and yesterday was a shit day at work.  Next week will be the big trial when I have a 3 day conference.  I go to conferences a few times a year and usually drink until lunch foggily attend a session and then head back to another bar.  Maybe this time I'll learn something.
Hiya friends. No drinking for me today. Thought I'd share one of my recent meditations. ..H.A.L.T.  Take a minute if you're feeling low and check to see if you are: Hungry Angry Lonely Tired...You can fix all of these things some easier than others but identification is half the fight. Keep it up dudes!
I will not drink today! :D
Sounds like a deal to me not drinking today or 2moro    
I will not drink with you all today!
I will not be drinking today!
Good morning Sobernauts! Today is a good day :)..I will not drink today.
Not drinking for 24 hours
So I had a big letdown yesterday and I wasn't in a good place but I managed not to crumble and drink although I was really tempted. It was a different tempted though. I was angry against the system and wanted to rebel and get drunk because f it why not. I didn't actually want to drink though. I didn't need want or crave it I just wanted to protest. Who would I have been protesting against though...? Myself so what's the point. Anyway I've slept on it calmed down and I'm glad I didn't drink. Baby steps.
Won't drink today. It's going to be a good day :) 
Hey SD; I will not drink with you today!

Feeling awesome this morning! Woke up wrote in my journal and got the lawn mowed. Now I'm chilling in my fisherman pants while a cool breeze rolls through the window. It's been a great morning. Looking forward to a great day too. Good I am so grateful for the wonderful morning I've had so far and the potential for a wonderful rest of the day. I have complete power over alcohol through my decision-making: I will choose to not poison my body today I will eat healthy vegan bodybuilding foods today I will not put ethanol in my mouth today!
  FTZ!
Not today

Not going to do it today.  I won't drink with you today.  .I woke up early and cleaned three rooms of my house had breakfast and coffee (which I have been off of recently because my stomach has been a mess which I attribute to drinking and not actually dealing with my stress) got my kids outta here and on their buses and did not fuss with them at all got groceries and I'm going to have an early lunch and walk my doofball dogs.  Who else loves boxers??.

Bingo bango I don't be drinko with you todayo.
Last night was the first challenge I've faced since quitting - I took some cold medication since I'm starting to get sick and it gave me a little bit of a buzz. All of a sudden all I could think about was chasing that feeling; I almost went out to the liquor store more than once and seriously considered ordering something as the clock ticked away towards closing time. Every time the urges got too strong I came back here and remembered the promise I'd made in the Wednesday check-in. I'm so thankful for the existence of this community: because of you I woke up with a stuffy nose and sore throat instead of a massive hangover...I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you all today! 
Not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today.
Ok nearly made it all the way round. Last Thursday was the day it crashed down. A couple of glasses of wine turned into a good hard shot of introspection a dash of honesty and rather large slice of humility...Tonight. Well I'm apprehensive but positive. I have a bi-weekly board game night and I'm hosting. Beers will be had (not too much as they're good guys with work tomorrow) and I bought some earlier. But I had my first pang of 'well I could have just one.'..I WILL not drink with you all and I'll see you tomorrow...I have some Pepsi max for me and I'm quite determined.
I will not drink today! 
Hola. Not drinking with y'all today
Back at it again and I won't drink today :)
Just passed my 3 months turned 27 on 90 days. Haven't had my license out of pure laziness the past 6 years so decided to take my road test on my birthday! Now looking forward to more adventures!!..

Miserable night of reset last night.   I wont drink with you all today.
Sooo it's noon just a few hours before my normal "danger zone" (I freelance from home and anywhere between 2 and 5 is when I'd typically start binge drinking alone)...But! I will not drink today.
I will not drink today no matter what good day or bad day.
Not today.
I won't drink today. 
Day 3 and I'm not going to drink today...I liked that my counter went up to "2" today. I understand why but I was bummed to see "1" for two days in a row. Little thing but I like seeing it moving up. 
Didn't get much sleep last night but at least I'm sober.  I will not drink today.

Wow 200 days not drinking!  It's been quite the ride learned how to stand up for myself more how to be more emotionally resilient express emotions better and other things. There were lots of difficult and stressful Times but there are other ways to cope with negative emotions than drinking!

Just had my best day ever at the gym! I feel strong again! SO excited! I will not drink with all you beautiful people today! :)
Checking in late.... but didn't and won't be drinking with you today. Was a crazy emotional roller coaster of me a day! 
The tiniest bubble of attention in the dark recesses of my brain is slowly growing and surfacing sending out "Friday happy hour...Friday happy hour...Friday happy hour....you deserve it!" beacon....It is at this point a merely faint irritation but I am on the alert. More than once my car has somehow taken over control and driving downtown when I meant it to turn towards home. NO I WILL NOT SUCCUMB. Instead I'll pick up a fancy dessert from the excellent town bakery tomorrow to have after dinner. Something to look forward to at the end of the week.
4 Days 18 hours sober I will not drink today. ..Funny something so small as writing that sentence gives me power
Still not drinking!
I won't drink today! Thanks for being a great community.
I will not be drinking today. My brother is going to come stay with me when he gets out of rehab soon and I am really happy I can provide a nice stable environment for him.
Heading out to the Sturgil concert tonight. No drinks for me please. 
Tried out a SMART Recovery meeting tonight. It was a nice diversion from AA. I have an appointment Monday morning with a therapist. Going to get things moving the right direction.  
Enjoyed not drinking with you all today.
Won't drink today! 
Something about this....I truly believe checking in has a profound effect on keeping  abstinence alive and ever present in my mind. ..I rarely think about drinking anymore but I always think about checking in. ....I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. ...
Crushing a large root beer.  The safe beer! My sweet tooth is ALIIIIIVE
Not drinking with any of you today.
