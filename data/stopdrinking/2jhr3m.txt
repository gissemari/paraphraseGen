Here is a story that will hopefully have a happy ending..."You look beautiful today...No - you look beautiful every day." said the liquor store clerk to the girl. And he never saw her again...She realized at that moment just how far her problem had progressed - gradually and euphorically with the wool pulled willingly over her eyes. So she changed liquor stores - there was one every quarter miles or so in Medford anyways. Sure she had been hiding her drinking from friends and family for years but something about the liquor store staff inadvertently stepping in gave me the spooks...I stopped for a few days and it felt like a lifetime. I looked into AAA and found it to be an ineffective trap. So I went to the next liquor store. 750ml max just so I didn't kill myself. I wasn't there yet. I can cope. I knew I'd drink until the bottle was empty. I was protecting myself. Drink until empty shove the bottles under my bed until I was free to dispose of them when my roommates were out of town. Next month do the same. A fifth every day or two with a few nips on my way to a friends house or the grocery store or the bank...A new guy got hired as the cashier at my new liquor store. "ID please" - sure I reach for it... "Don't bother she's in here all the time." another employee butted in. I froze. All the time. I'm in here all the time. Even though I rotate between this liquor store and the one on Broadway..all the time. It resonated in my mind. I'm one of their regulars who they want to deter - even though it's their business to take my desperate money. They witness the pain the struggle every day. Not just mine but everyone who wakes up feeling like they can't hand on through the pain they feel in any given day...This pain is worse than any actual physical pain I've ever experienced - It's a gnawing incessant pain that you can't express to even your closest friends. A pain I've felt since I was a little girl. A pain you hide from your family your boyfriend your coworkers...It leads to a life that is inherently a lie. I feel like a liar. I am not happy and there are few times in my life that I have felt happy. I've come to expect that that's the way it probably always will be. It's not easy it's horrible. It's like torture. But the enemy is my own brain and getting "treatment" scares me to death and I don't have insurance to cover it at the moment. I don't want to lose myself in the process. Paradoxically the only time I feel excited or motivated about life is when I'm under the influence and this is more often than I'll ever admit to any of my friends or family. I know I have liver damage I know I'm slowly killing my body. I know I don't want to die. But that's the cycle of depression and alcoholism. It slowly eats you from the inside out. It's a silent killer that gets you by  taking away your purpose pride joy and willingness to get better...Why am I constantly trying to protect my demons? I do wont to get better and I honestly believe that I could give up alcohol at any time or that when I find love I'll let go of this devil that has ahold of my neck. In reality no one wants to be with a drunk girl like me. I'm going to have to be the agent of change but I just don't know where to start. Any help is much appreciated. ..EDIT: Thank you for the support and advice guys. It helped me to see this seemingly complex issue in simpler terms - not necessarily easier just more black and white. It is a problem. It does need to stop. There is no work-around or perfect timing I just have to commit and take action. Last year I reached out to my parents about my struggle with depression and alcoholism the hardest thing I've ever had to admit. It was in an effort to make my intervention on their alcoholism less of an attack. In a nutshell it was fruitless and they told me "You wouldn't like it if someone told you to stop drinking." But I would. I realized I don't have to succumb to this - I can reach out in other directions. Thank you for the kind words and telling me what I desperately needed to hear!

It's okay to feel the way you do but don't beat yourself up too much over it. A lot of us have been in that exact spot. ..This can be the motivation you need to change. All you need to do is commit to it. Use how you feel as the fuel to make the change. While doing that find new hobbies to enjoy that keep you away from your old ways. Heck maybe discover old ones you left behind due to life...It's not easy at first but it does get easier. Please make sure you talk to someone close about all this. Talking helps and they can also help you. Plus this sub is always here to listen and help too....
Hi /u/whatshernextstep. Thanks for posting. ..You talk about pain and what to do about it. My experience is that drinking prolongs pain kicks it down the road. But it always waits and grows stronger as it does by adding regret. Not drinking was the only way I could deal with life problems. Stopping didn't solve any of them it just made it possible for me to start dealing with life. That's it. ..&gt;  I honestly believe that I could give up alcohol at any time or that when I find love I'll let go of this devil that has ahold of my neck. ..I spent a long time waiting for sobriety to find me. When things got bad enough I thought I'd have to stop drinking. So I set about making things bad. I wanted things to be bad so I'd *have to* stop. ..That of course never happened. I finally learned that sobriety wasn't *ever* going to find me. I'd be dead first. I had to go out and track it down. ..&gt;I just don't know where to start...Don't drink today. That's where to start. Do anything you need to do get support attend meetings stay with a friend--anything so long as it helps you not drink. ..If you don't drink today you'll be more capable of dealing with the bigger issues. Repeat tomorrow. ..You know the reasons why. The how is *don't drink today.*..Good luck and welcome.
I would surrender. I surrendered. What I mean by this is....when you're ready...tell a close loved one that you are an alcoholic and tell them that you need them to intervene. ..Admit that you aren't strong enough. It is ok to not be strong enough. Let somebody help. ..u/sunjim is correct. Don't drink TODAY. You can only worry about today. I did 30 days sober. Relapsed on my wedding anniversary. Wife left on business. I realized those 30 sober days were better than my 10 days not. I realized that even though temporary I would hate to lose my wife permanently. ..Surrender to somebody. I wrote a letter to my wife. That was my surrender. In it I admitted I was an alcoholic. It was the hardest part. Honestly it was the hardest part. Admitting you have a problem is like the smallest speed bump that you refuse to drive your car towards because you are CONVINCED it is a god-da%$ mountain!..Once you admit it not only to yourself but somebody close things start clicking. ..Good luck. Let's get today under our belt.
This post hits home with me. I stopped when I was a 24 year old girl (now I'm a much happier 25 year old girl). So much of what you said sounds so familiar to me. That sense of living a lie. The unending depression. The fear of "losing myself" if I sought treatment (turns out that's insane!)...I stopped as a result of being given an ultimatum - which an ineffective reason for the long term by the way. When it comes down to it you have to do it for yourself...However after a torturous first month I finally realized that I actually had a problem since it was so horrible for me to not drink. I checked out a number of different AA meetings got involved here at stopdrinking and contacted a friend of mine who is 11 years sober to get his advice. I was so desperate...Maybe 6 weeks or so after being given the ultimatum I potentially had the opportunity to get out of my commitment to sobriety I had given this person. But thankfully by then I had shaken off the thick fog of denial knew I had a serious problem and never wanted to feel as shitty as I did when I first quit ever again. So I kept going this time for me...This sub was and is a huge support for me. I also attend AA meetings though I am admittedly not very involved or "working a program" (i.e. having a sponsor etc). They help me feel less alone in recovery they help me get out of the self-pity spiral etc. I like to listen to what people have to say. I sought therapy and found a therapist who is awesome and does my sessions for free because she is amazing. Therapy is so good can't recommend it enough...I'll try not to ramble on too much about how my life has improved in under a year because I don't want to sound gloaty during your time of struggle. But trust me - I thought I was hopeless and suicide seemed like a viable option. I am so happy to be alive now. It's possible. I hear so much of myself just a few months ago in your post and I really want you to get help so you don't have to keep suffering. If you ever want to please feel free to send me a message.
This may seem heavy-handed but I think you need to face the facts that you included in your post along with lots of excuses rationalizations and denial...Normal drinkers don't rotate liquor stores or hide empties..Alcoholism is the only disease that tells you that you don't have it..It also hates "AAA".  Why?  Cuz that is how you stop drinking..Not drinking for a few days 'felt like a lifetime'..Clerks witness '...the pain the struggle every day.'  .Liver damage isolation depression...but the denial "I honestly believe I could give up alcohol at any time".  Really?  Give it a try.  ...So...the facts are that you are an alcoholic. Without health insurance in-patient is probably not an option.  AA is free.  All that is required is a desire to stop drinking. ..Saved my life could save yours.  ..
&gt;It leads to a life that is inherently a lie...And no surprise that life will lie to you saying its ok.  You are not that bad. Yet...thing is yet's going to come sooner or later.      .**and that bad is really THAT BAD** ..not sure what your issues ware with AA I had most or all of the  possible issue at one time or another and still it saved my butt when the yets were starting to circle.   Or try Smart ..in anycase now that you are here - read some of our stories linked in the sidebar I suspect you may find them illuminating..&gt;It leads to a life that is inherently a lie...When you think about that statement - its not good... but it can change starting here.
A place to start is to stop drinking and go to AA where you will receive support and guidance from experts.                   If you  think you will have trouble withdrawing see a doctor and be honest about how much you drink. .."Protecting demons" = DENIAL!
In my opinion rarely do we handle our addictions. Rather our addictions handle us...&gt;Why am I constantly trying to protect my demons?..Because that's how we cope when we don't know any other way. Read this sub check out an AA meeting see if there are any SMART meetings near you or check some out online. Learn some new coping strategies...&gt;...or that when I find love I'll let go of this devil that has ahold of my neck...If you're physically or mentally/emotionally addicted to alcohol then there's never going to be a "perfect moment". The mind of an addict will always find a shiny new reason to continue using..."I've found the one! I should quit drinking! Well...I should hold off until I know for sure we're going to make it.".."He proposed! I'll wait until after the bachelorette party...the wedding...the honeymoon..."..The best time to quit is and always will be **NOW**...As suggested the best starting point is today. If you feel weak read the sub post whatever you need to let someone else who's struggling that you're feeling the same way so that they know they aren't so incredibly fucking alone after all. ..If you want to quit drinking you can. You do it one single day/hour/minute/second at a time and you are only as alone in this as you allow yourself to be. There are over 20000 people subscribed to this subreddit. Even if only half of those usernames are active you've still got 10k people standing in your corner...Keep posting. Keep coming back.
I too kept thinking something would happen - my wife would get pregnant or I'd have some medical issue that would force me to stop. Even then I worried that I wouldn't. Then one day I looked in the mirror and asked myself what the hell I was doing. I had no answer and knew I needed to quit. I hope you find the strength and support to do what you need to do. Let us know how we can help.
I was in the same boat changing liquor stores as soon as they stopped carding me. I felt ashamed to be recognized in the stores I was going to. I ended up going in to the ER when I tried to quit the amount of anxiety had me fearing for my life. I was drinking since 11th grade in High School. That's five years of daily drinking. I was afraid of the consequences of stopping having never done it before. They fixed me up with a light subscription of benzos to aid with the withdrawl and some sleeping pills. I'm nine days into it and the first week was the toughest. It's breaking the pattern you set up over time. ..Get home from work take a drink. Have a bite to eat take a drink. This would repeat for me until I passed out...In short seek help you can do this this sub is full of people that have been in similar situations. It's tough at first you wonder what you'll fill your spare time with. But you'll find things to do. I've read through two books so far and taken up daily bike rides to keep my mind occupied. When you emerge from the fog of alcohol you're amazed at how much more you can do. 
I looked into AA and thought like Admiral Akhbar "It's a trap!" (his initials are AA?!)... Anyways I had already tried everything else and they said it worked for them. I had nothing else to do except to try what they said. I found out that their theory proved true for me so long as I am willing to try their program.  .  .Not saying you have to try their program but what harm can come of going to a women's only AA meeting? Maybe you will hear something maybe you won't; but to continue on as you are going will lead you to the bitter end I was once at... Something I do not wish upon anyone :(
I can't type much I'm at the dmv currently. But if you think you can handle it alone you can't. Tell someone a family member or friend find a doctor and get started. Good luck!
You're a great writer. I hope you are able to make it thru this because you have a real talent there. I'm not good with words but know that I support you. :)
Same thing happened to me. I would switch up which stores I'd get my booze from so that the clerks would not think I was big of an alcoholic as I was. Trust me you'll be better off not drinking but you'll have to figure that out on your own...Good luck and seek support. It's hard to do alone.
Hey there!  Just wanted to say I can really relate to your story.  I am not too much older than you and I have been in that same situation/circumstances (not too long ago as you can tell from looking at my badge).  I wanted to stop on my own but ended up having to go to the ER for a few days due to horrible hallucinating withdrawals.  ....* Just a note here - if you start to get withdrawal symptoms like that please get whatever medical help you can.  I'm sure my hospital bills will be large even with insurance but it's better than dying...  withdrawals can be dangerous.  Don't let it deter you from stopping just something to keep an eye on.*....I am not too far in yet but now that I don't have to worry about withdrawals anymore it's like a weight has been lifted.  I'm still struggling with depression and life issues (which are probably what led me down this road in the first place) but it's a huge. huge. relief to not have to sneak around and lie anymore.  I feel a lot better physically too.....Also AA meetings can differ from each other - I'd recommend maybe trying out a few different ones and seeing if you find one that you like.  Even if you don't relate to all of it or all of what everyone is saying I've found that there are always bits and pieces I can take away and it's a supportive and hopeful environment.
This is a good post that I can relate to but have no advice on... Your words express exactly how I feel only your vocabulary is far superior. ..Keep posting and talking. It helps me.
You're in good company here...I like this passage from The Road Less Travelled by M. Scott Peck:..*Life is difficult.*..*This is a great truth one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult--once we truly understand and accept it--then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted the fact that life is difficult no longer matters.*..At first alcohol made life better otherwise why would I have drank. But alcoholism made my life miserable and was on it's way to making it short too. I had my shot with alcohol and I lost. I accept that now and I'm far better for it. Acceptance is that powerful...As for happiness I believe that everyone has different innate happiness levels. I'd say mine is probably below average despite having a great life. However I'm a very satisfied person and I have a meaningful life. That means something too. It's kind of a reward for getting over myself. :)..The change of course starts with putting the drink down...and *leaving* it down long enough to not want to pick it up again. The confusion and complexity for me came from the thousand ideas I entertained *other* than just putting the drink down. And I didn't like to have to need people for anything but I did need people to stay sober. I accepted that too.
I can relate to so many of the things you said in this post... Im after fucking up the final year of my degree course from drinking. Using drink as a crutch to deal with the stress and other issues when in fact it was doing the total opposite.. I became quite gifted at hiding the fact I drank so much. Used to go to different tellers in a big supermarket chain. Went to college drunk/ drinking in there drank in the morning....it goes on an on...What I'm trying to say and its sth another poster said was it wont go away. It might slow down/ stop for a while if you find love but it WON'T. Like a parasite it will eat you. I have decided today that I need help not gloating by any means just saying that it sounds like you could do with some as well like some other posts said. ..My point is this is a good place to get some honest advice and a place where we can help and support each other. Good luck and keep us updated
