Hi guys thanks for all your posts and support...Really struggling to get even a day sober these days. I was previously in NA from 2008-2011 and haven't gone back to using drugs but since the time I left NA my drinking has been getting progressively worse...My wife is struggling watching me struggle. I'm not drinking in the mornings but am moving away from beer due to the volume required to get drunk these days...I have fond memories of being happy joyous and free in a 12 step program but am so scared of going back. I guess that's admitting defeat...If you're here and sober please cherish what you have and maintain your sobriety. Many of us are struggling to get one day up...Thanks guys. Hope to get to a meeting soon.
