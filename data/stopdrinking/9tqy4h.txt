Fell off and got back on the bandwagon more times than I can count since the last stint. But I'm at the point where I can try again so I'm taking steps to make some better lifestyle changes. One of those changes was being frank with myself and tackling the lies I tell myself which are like a mental crab bucket so I wrote down a lot of these lies and made logical arguments against them. But the one I ultimately struggle with is "Life is meaningless so why should I do anything or achieve anything?" I did write a reply to it but I couldn't come up with a solid answer and I won't post it here because there's a character limit lol. ..&amp;#x200B;..So how does an individual give themselves a purpose? ..&amp;#x200B;..Is finding a purpose like "finding a unicorn" in that it doesn't exist (or is a red herring) and your meaning is just making the best of what you have? Is it just becoming a better you? Is it wandering down the paths of where your talents lie and consistently working on them in the hopes for something awesome to happen?  Am I making the answer out to be more than what it should be? Examples like "I'm a chef and becoming a head chef at a top restaurant has given me purpose" or "I'm a parent and being there for my kids give me purpose" trip me up because I can't say that about my life. I feel like the answer should be something greater than what you choose to identify as because there is nothing in my life I want to say "hey this is me!" so what else is there? ..&amp;#x200B;..One of the lies I confronted was "I can't do something/be happy until I get something else done" and  know that I can't lie to myself that "Once I find my purpose THEN I'll stop drinking" because I think we all know where that outcome leads.
