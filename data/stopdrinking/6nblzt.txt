I woke up in a great mood and by lunch time today I've just been pissed off sad emotional. There's like a deep deep sadness in he pit of my stomach for no reason at all. I can't focus on work at all and mostly I'm in the never ending cycle of guilt in my head because I want to drink. Every time I want to drink I tell myself how stupid that would be and I ask myself WHY? Why do you want to or need to? I distract myself from the feelings and they come back full force moments later. Around and around and around. That's it. I feel like I'm waiting for relapse all the time. I'm a ticking time bomb and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the constant arguing going on in my head over alcohol. I'm tired of feeling this depressing feeling. I'm tired of feeling left out of everything because I don't drink anymore. I'm just plain tired of it all.
