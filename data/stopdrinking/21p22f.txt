I've asked about films before and got a lot of great  suggestions. .I was wondering the same about books. Any novels with a character trying to stop drinking or struggling with alcoholism? Any stories where drinking is portrayed negatively? .I'm sure there are loads but I need help finding the best ones. .Thanks in advance! ..p.s.: I've been through enough Bukowskis already  someting different ..Edit: wow 90 days already!

hans fallada - the drinker. 
I'm not a big reader and when I do its usually one type of books - books about/by hockey players. Derek Sanderson talks a lot about his struggles with alcoholism in his book Crossing the Lines. I read it a few months ago but now that I've finally decided to stop drinking I'm going to read it again. I'd highly recommend the book if you want something a bit different.
Are you only looking for fiction? Do you want the main focus of the story to be on the struggle with alcoholism?..The Shining by Stephen King.
**Dry: A Memoir** by Augusten Burroughs.
