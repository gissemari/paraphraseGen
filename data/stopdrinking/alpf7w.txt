..If you went for dry January or just simply quit at New Year if you made it straight or stumbled and got back up - **well done!!**..Some have had it fairly easy others struggle every day. Some are determined to stay dry others may now play with the thought of possibly being magically cured (we all have) and thinking that maybe just one wouldn't be so bad (ditto)...This is where I would ask myself: Do I really want to go through all that pain again? And again?? *And again?!*..Fellow traveller - you're doing great!! Keep doing great! ..I will not drink with you today!.
