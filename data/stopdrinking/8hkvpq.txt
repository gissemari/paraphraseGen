Damn that's quite a story. You're a talented writer. ..I can really relate to the secret drinking. Started that in early high school and continued through law school before bottoming out. It was the worst. ..If it was me I'd delete the specific unit numbers. This is a terrific sub but the Internet is a weird place.
