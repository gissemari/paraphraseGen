I've of sort of struggled internally in managing my decision not to drink but also not wanting to avoid social situations. I also am insecure about the stigma attached to not drinking and kinda worry that if I am "outed" as not drinking then people will think the worst and that terrible things have happened I'm out of control drink all day can't stop booze hound etc...The truth is probably somewhere in the middle like most of life. But then if I don't drink gf thinks she's dragging me to things and worried Im not having fun (sometimes true still). Damned if I do damned if I dont...Anyway I went to a beer dabbler yesterday after I was invited by gf and a few friends.  Tons of craft brewers entry fee but then unlimited drinks. Theoretically everyone is just there to "dabble" and sip some craft brews (Normally I would have done more than dabble). I had some trepidation throughout the week hesitantly agreed to go and wound up actually having a fun time!  Sure the drinking looked like fun. I like craft beer. Some temptation was there but I still didnt drink and still had fun. .Pretty big victory for me!..Closing in on 60 consecutive days and building some confidence. Just wanted to share! Happy sober Sunday everyone. Thanks for being here for me.
