I wanted to share an interesting story I heard in rehab. There is this guy who had been sober for about 8 years and then the other day he relapsed. At the meeting he said:.. The weird thing is that I felt like I had travelled back in time. They told the same jokes and played the same songs. It was as if I was in that exact same party 8 years ago. Nothing had changed. ..I felt that. Nothing ever changes unless you make the change yourself. I can't keep sleeping on myself. I need to stop trying to fill a void inside me with self hatred juice. I feel so alone. I'm pouring the flask down the sink. I'm not giving up...IWNDWYT.

drinking becomes a waste of time  i am on day 28 now and read the naked mind and come here dailyit is helping me  my last time drinking i was an absolute messThere is more to life than drinking
I realized in horror that I'd returned home from Thanksgiving at a friends with an open bottle of wine- oh no! What to do? How can I resist? I promised myself no more! So I poured it down the drain... pragmatic budgeting me was nagging about the waste of $$ while sober me was celebrating my newfound strength. .IWNDWYT
