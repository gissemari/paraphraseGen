Greetings sobernauts! Glad to be here with you. Just finished day three sober. Been reading lots of posts here on this fabulous sub and they are so helpful. Also started to read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. It's awesome. Met with my support group tonight which was really great. Sending best wishes to you all especially those of us still struggling.  Let's hang in there ladies and gents. We are so worth it:-)
