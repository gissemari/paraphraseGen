So I stupidly tried a bit of weed last night despite heavy use before and being clean of it for some time ("it's medicine right? Maybe it was just alcohol that was the problem and not weed"). Now I'm having serious alcohol cravings (cross-sensitisation? I'm not sure). Any thoughts or advice would be really appreciated. Has anyone struggled with both substances? And gone back to smoking without drinking?

They are totally different for me but I am clean of both. I know some people who can't do any intoxicant without wanting to drink...For me not drinking feels like life or death. Shit just does not work out when I drink. ..Smoking to me feels like not leading my best life. Sure I enjoy it and it doesn't totally wreck my baseline I can still do all my stuff but there are so many other things I just don't do I either don't do them well or at all when I smoke. And some of those things are things I both want to do and do well...For me I HAVE to not drink and I choose to not smoke...But like I say I know people who can't do one and not the other.
I smoked a lot of weed trying to quit booze.   It was an absolute fail.   To stay off booze I need my judgment willpower and presence of mind.    Weed took all those things from me..
Some can make it work some cant life is just about lessons.  The trick is to not let the lessons define us.
