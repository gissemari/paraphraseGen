I just poured the remaining half of the wine into the toilet. This time it's for real it's do or die...If someone is kind enough to sponsor me I will try my hardest to keep myself inline and not relapse... ..Universe please give me the power to overcome this.

In my experience showy displays of "quitting" for yourself are a prelude to relapse. Why the toilet? Just stop don't plan it don't think about don't convince yourself that this is "it." Do or don't do. There is no try.
