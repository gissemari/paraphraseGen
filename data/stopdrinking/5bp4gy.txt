Like I know we are separate things and his sobriety and my own are not the same. But hey I do depend on him in ways. If nothing else we have close friendship. ..Called him yesterday and he told me he was in a halfway house because he went on another heroin kick. And here I am very confused. ..But it's alright. ..No point to this post just wanted to say that

I'm so sorry I imagine that can be difficult..and feel like a betrayal and loss of a stronghold...Hoping for the best for your sponsor and wishing you strength and acceptance to keep moving forward...:-)  Hoping your week just improves from here.

Uggh that's awful...I think the world of my sponser and can't imagine what it's like for you...There's no rule you can only have one sponser. I need to form closer bonds with more sober people. I shouldn't depend on only one person to talk with and get support from...Hang in there!
My sponsor started coming on to my wife. Needless to say I've made a change.
