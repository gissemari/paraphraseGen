I have just over 200 days and all of a sudden these are coming like every single night.  I have had relapse dreams before but they were not nearly this vivid or frequent.  It took me almost 20 minutes this morning to fully believe I hadn't actually relapsed and didn't need a new sober date.  ..Trying to look for a silver lining and here is what I got.  These dreams are not pleasant.  It's not like I am having a great time with friends and being the suave classy person my disease wants me to think alcohol made me.  These are dreams of secret drinking mistakes guilt and regret.  If my subconscious has decided I am going to have these for a bit I am going to try to use them to remind myself of how powerless over alcohol I am and how ugly a relapse would be.  A single drink will quickly lead to me isolating drinking alone and hating myself (Step 1 work for the fellow AAers).  But still fuck these dreams...I will not drink with you tonight.

I had the same thing happen to me a few weeks ago. I was thinking about drinking a lot because my bday was coming up and I've always celebrated by getting wasted. The night before I had a drinking dream and for about 10 mind after I woke up I was convinced I had drank. It was a crazy experience to be tricked like that. Those dreams are horrible but also a reminder of how I was and how shitty that feeling was to blackout and wake up thinking what the hell did I do this time and who did I hurt. I hate them but they bring me back to reality for whenever I think drinking is ok for me
