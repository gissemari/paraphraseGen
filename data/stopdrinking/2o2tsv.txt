Tried 4 times posted here once for support and promptly (like an asshole) relapsed--fifth times the charm I think been sober since September.  Last week I realized something...I actually feel pretty fucking good now when I wake up. When I was depressed and drinking I would wake up (hopefully in my own bed)- stumble to the mirror have a good piss and beer shit then check myself for any scrapes bruises cuts that I may have gotten or accidentally given myself the night before. Then I would drink a boat full of coffee and try to get to work...Mentally I'm a fucked desperate angry sad pissed I've lost 98% of my friends (the first 50% I lost years ago when I really starting drinking heavily now the remaining 48% seem to have left because I don't drink) lost the last 5 gf's because of this shit but physically I actually feel..good?!? ..Anyone else wake up feeling good? It's been so long I forgot it was even a thing. ....

Yeah and on only 3 hours of sleep not having a hangover is a real good thing. ..Now speaking as an asshole (people I care about have told me so) relapsing isn't the sign of an asshole. It's the sign of someone with a drinking problem who hasn't yet figured out all the pieces of their nondrinking program. I mean one that's going to work long-term. So what's your program?
Three months is fantastic!  I know if is weird to lose friends over not drinking.  I lost a few myself.  Turns out they were just drinking buddies.  Though a few that I thought were drinking buddies turned into very awesome sober buddies (well they still drink -- not as much as when I did -- but I don't and they don't care)...In the last two years I've made a lot of new friends that don't know me as a drinker.  So when drinking comes up I just say "I don't drink" and we move on.  I get invited out (even to bars) because they don't know any different...None of this happened overnight.  It took a year-ish or so for me to build up these friendships.  But I was patient...Good luck...EDIT: I forgot to add about waking up.....So for months and months (maybe a year) I was waking up early feeling great every morning.  But over time I've changed my habits... Some of them back to what I had been doing while I was drinking: I'm staying up later; I'm watching TV before bed instead of reading; and I'm waking up feeling tired just like I always used to.  I think I'm going to try going back to going to bed earlier; no TV; reading instead and seeing if that helps.
Alright /u/LeoAPG so did you ever give the ["Baby Steps"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) a shot?
I wake up feeling good now and it is AWESOME!  I used to feel like total crap every morning.  Hooray for being sober!
