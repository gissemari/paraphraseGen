I was up to three weeks then I drank. I don't even know why. Now I feel back to where I started. I'm embarrassed to go back to meetings and admit I failed...On top of that I tried to go back to work today and had a panic attack outside and had to go straight home again. So I'll probably lose my job on top of everything else...But I am sober...I don't even know why I'm posting this to be honest. I just want to go to bed. Thank you for letting me vent.

Well done for getting back on the wagon. .One day at a time or even 1 hour when things are rough. Hang in there. I will not drink with you today. 
Good for you for putting it down again so fast. Sometimes a relapse only serves to prove to us why we put it down in the first placeor it does to me at any rate. Don't feel badcelebrate that yes recognized what you need to do. IWNDWYT.
Well done.  You can do this we are all hanging in there with you.  I will not drink with you today!
You are not alone and are not the first person to go through this. Go back to the meetings I promise you the will welcome you with open arms. One thing that help me a lot when I was in a similar position was to listen to AA speaker tapes on youtube. They helped me out so much. I won't drink with you today Be gentle on yourself.
I had a similar thing happen with a panic attack right as I approached the door for work.  I would explain the situation with anxiety to your boss. (maybe leave out the alcohol part)  A lot of people don't understand exactly what a panic attack is and you'd be surprised how understanding they can be if you explain it..Hope it all works out.  keep it up!
