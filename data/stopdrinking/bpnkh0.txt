(24 F) Here I am at 1:49am typing this downing what I hope will be my last whiskey as I have to be awake by 6:15 to get ready for work. I'm going to the beach with my family and boyfriend who I l all love very much this weekend. I've spiraled this past year. I've gained so much weight and it's killed not only my self esteem but also my sex life as a result of that. My relationship has therefore suffered and I feel like I'm stuck and cannot dig myself out. I'll usually drink more than my boyfriend and I (sometimes) purposely black out when I get too far gone in my thoughts. I've struggled with substance abuse with benzos in the past but now hardly if ever use them except for their intended purpose. ..I'm a psych major I've studied addiction for countless courses. If you're at all familiar with the course of addiction/recovery from an academic standpoint I'm past the  contemplation  phase although for myself it has lasted longer than the typical ~6 month period. I've been in denial but I've come to accept that due to family history of alcoholism my poor choices under the influence and lack of ability to stop after 1-2 drinks (social drinking thought I know a majority of alcoholics choose to abstain entirely) I know that I have a problem...I guess my question to you all how did you start? I'm very distrusting of my cities AA/NA and I've worked for people that have established  sober houses  and have taken advantage of the clients seeking help and have thoroughly taken advantage of them. I have some trauma that's mostly dealt with/I have come to accept. I'm trying to finish my last half year of university and it's become more mentally and physically exhausting as ever.....To put it simply this sub has provided me much more support/familiarity than I would have ever anticipated. I'm not looking for an end all be all answer but if you have experienced anything at all similar to my situation how did you first pull yourself out of the  rut ? I hate to use the phrase rock bottom because it's not a necessity to every person's recovery and I feel like I have hit visited there at least twice in my short time on earth I would like to know if anyone has found some reprieve despite how small it may be...TLDR: weight gain from extreme drinking in turn effecting my relationship/life/etc. Depressed and need advice

Do you think you could go and pour away everything in the house? Like this second? Could you admit to your partner that you have a problem?..Just a heads up this will likely be taken down you're not supposed to contribute when you're in your cups.
