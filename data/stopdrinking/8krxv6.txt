Hi all..This is my first post of 90 posts in 90 days. Ive been here before and relapsed multiple times. I have been sober two days now after 8 beers every second night for the past month. I cant drink alcohol though i tend to trick myself into thinking I can. Today marks my genuine and honest attempt towards sobriety...I am an alcoholic. My daily mantra is "no more poisen"...I am happy to rejoin this community again as an active alcholohic who is prepared to get sober. I am rejoining AA this week and plan to go to atleast 3 meetings a week...Thanks for reading..

I think the 90 posts in 90 days is a really smart idea!  Good luck to you! IWNDWYT 
You got this! IWNDWYT
90 posts in 90 days is a good idea. AA did nothing for me but one guy there when he stopped did 90 meetings in 90 days and that worked for him and sounded like a good idea to me. Good luck.
Good luck!
Looking forward to your posts and wishing you strength in the next 90 days    iwndwyt
