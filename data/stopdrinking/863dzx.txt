Life's been hard. I'm approaching 2 weeks since my heart broke and life changed. I decided to stop drinking because I no longer had control. The first week was near impossible. I was literally going hour to hour just to stay alive. Intense negative thoughts. Constant panic attacks. I sent out signal flares and my old crowd of friends answered. ..It got me through along with help from the suicide hotline for one hour I felt so alone I couldn't hold myself accountable for anything so I just called instinctively. They helped me immensely...This week has been closure confirmation that there's no repairing or going back 2 weeks. It's only forward from here even if forward feels so lonely. I've come to terms with everything...I feel okay today. I feel like myself for the first time in over a year. But I'm feeling distracted and unmotivated I can feel my heart beat and I'm only able to do one thing at a time and not that well. Struggling to get work done but my mood is better. I feel like myself again just a little bit damaged version of what I remember. ..I can't say what a relief it is to feel okay and even good. I can breathe. I was so frantic and panicked and desperate before. I felt like I was barely afloat and someone pulled me under. That I was breathing in water and flailing for my life. ..Today is a reminder to keep on this path. To not drown.
