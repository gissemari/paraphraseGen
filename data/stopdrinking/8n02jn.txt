Went to a bbq yesterday and brought ginger beer "Cock and bull" looks like a beer bottel so no one asks "what are you drinking"  had a great time only drank two of them.  If i had been drinking real beer i would have drank at least 10.  I was able to drive home and feel great this morning.  After about a year and a half of mental struggles this non-drinker thing is starting to feel less awkward and more the norm.

I keep looking for things like that to enjoy. I'm a new non-drinker but so far have not found my new drink. I will have to try that!
Those ginger beer's are sooooo good. Even the non calorie version is pretty decent!..u/OptimisticTrip I know everyone on here raves about it but there's a reason...try LaCroix!
