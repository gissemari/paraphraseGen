I take just 1 benedryl if I have a few bad nights of sleep and usually once I get one good night of sleep I'm mostly back on track
I use melatonin. I don't think I need it at this point however my doctor wants me on it to promote good sleep.
Yeah I felt like I was covered with spiders the first couple days. For me the thing that fixed it was time. Every day got a little better until it wasn't an issue any more. 
Sleep was really rough for me for a while but it did improve relatively quickly. Although that part is a bit shitty in the short run the good news I can tell you is that for me after not very long at all (maybe a week or so) all of a sudden sleep became AMAZING! I just felt 1000 times better physically pretty quickly. Reading before I go to sleep was (and is) my personal "trick" if it's of any help. 
Sounds good I'll give it a try 
Close your eyes don't think about anything and breathe in deeply and slowly through your knows and exhale out of your mouth. You will be surprised what it does.
Insomnia is very common in early sobriety. I used a few squirts of CBD oil before bed to help me sleep through the night. It will get better with time.
One thing that helped me get into a good sleep routine was doing yoga nidra which is a kind of meditation. I found one online and listened to it in bed every night and it really helped put me out!
