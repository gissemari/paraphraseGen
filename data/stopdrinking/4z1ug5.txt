I feel for you. It's scary but as you said it's the right thing to do. If you look at the carnage left behind by alcoholism - all the ruined lives etc. You're doing the right thing. All the best.
I think you are very brave and smart to know yourself so well at "only 21". I know I would have saved myself much money and heartache if I'd stopped drinking when I was 21. Oh well I keep telling myself that you can teach an old dog new tricks...I can understand your fear as you are heading into this new area of your life. But it's a good "scary" I hope. Like heading off to an unexplored country and meeting new people and trying new things..I can hear the determination in your words when you say you will do anything to get better...Thank you for sharing and know that I am sending you positive thoughts as you tackle this. Let us know how it goes!
A simple pleasure - you will be in a place where everyone else is going through the same thing. I am scared as well 22 years old here - can't take off work to go though. My husband got sober at 21. He loved rehab! Made tons of friends and got healthy. This is the best thing you could possibly be doing right now. It feels scary at first but eventually you'll be sure that it's the best choice you've ever made. I will be sending positive vibes your way!
