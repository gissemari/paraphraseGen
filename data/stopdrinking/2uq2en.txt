Day 31: Kitten did not imbibe. Did my morning mantra I am an alcoholic I will not drink today but I still love myself and I am working a solution. I met with my sponsor today it was good after last night. Last night scared me. Scared me because I realized how powerless I am over alcohol. I thought I knew before I thought I understood how cunning and baffling it was but last night I really saw it. That scared the shit outta me. ..But I'm doing what I need to to stay sober. I met with my sponsor which was awesome and totally helped me. I went to my Tuesday meeting with amazing people totally helped me. I don't want to live in fear of my alcoholism I want to understand what can happen if I relapse understand the depth of what it will do to try and get me to drink again and respect it enough to know what I need to do to ensure I keep myself healthy and sober. I can't make it go away; there will be no magical number of days of sobriety I have that will take away my alcoholism. I am an alcoholic & that was crazy evident last night. But I got 31 days so I got that going for me lol. Tonight I did not drink and that's amazing to me. ..Thanks for reading fellow SD'ers and sobies stay safe out there. Kitten out.
