http://www.thestar.com/news/stardispatches/2014/05/22/to_hell_and_back_alcoholism_addiction_and_lessons_they_taught_me.html..I was doing some googling for some literature about struggles with alcohol. Every once in a while I like to read through people's recovery stories or listen to podcasts about recovery and alcoholism. Anyway here is a great (long) account of Canadian journalist Jim Coyle and his love affair with alcohol. He is now sober and has been for some time but like many especially those who write for a living he spent his youth in an alcoholic haze buying in to the myth of the high functioning alcoholic.
