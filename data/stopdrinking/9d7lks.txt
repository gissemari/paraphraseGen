I went to Vermont enjoyed the green mountains and fresh air and some how never thought about having a craft beer or even going to a brewery.  I was too busy hiking and enjoying the company of my wife and two dogs to notice I was sober almost felt like I was drunk on life for a change.  AA has always been a part of my recovery but knowing I post these comments to the entire world has changed the game for me and has made me more accountable for my stupidity.  I've seen quite a few of relapse posts today while scanning r/stopdrinking and it really hits home.  To often this disease plays mind games and can convince us that sober days is just a number and has nothing to do with recovery and just one drink and a number reset is nothing to worry about.  Well at least with me when I have that one drink I'm usually off to the races with a minimum of 6-8 months of daily drinking and extreme weight gain before I can stop myself.  I'm tired of the long runs of drinking and have finally come to terms that regardless of what happens in my life drinking will not even help .01% of the time.  Please if you start to see the signs and feel the urges post and get your feelings out and call someone.  Your life may depend on it and you may not realize it but you will help and motivate others too!

Last time I quit was what I consider the first time because I made it six months. A year and a half+ after convincing myself a drink here or there wouldn't hurt and I'm on day two.
