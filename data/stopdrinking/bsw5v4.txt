Hi guys. ..So I had a relapse in April and I'm getting back to my life without alcohol. It's crazy just how much can change in the space of just over a week not drinking I'm still not exactly in the best place in my life and things can definitely improve but it's nice to know that even with the struggles of wanting to drink my life is 10x better without actually drinking. ..Guess I just wanted to check in to keep myself accountable and also to read all of your stories of success and struggle. This is a wonderful community and I'm so grateful to have found you all. It's nice knowing through the good and the bad there's a great group of people just a post away who pass on such wise words and have great care for people they've never met. ..Hope you're all enjoying today and may we all have a great sober Saturday evening x
