Hi everyone! Yesterday was day 44 out of the [90 days of goals I set myself to kick-start my sobriety.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ykia8/day_2890_report/cpamtjj)..My four goals are: ..1. See a therapist weekly and do the "homework" she assigns...2. Answer my phone appropriately and use it to reach out to people .in my sober support networks...3. Post here daily...4. Attend a support group meeting daily. ..Yesterday I did the check-ins and meditation "homework" my therapist and decided on at our last session. I answered my phone and texted my sponsor and a woman I met at my Monday meeting. I checked in here. And I went to an AA meeting...I haven't yet found regular meetings for Wednesday and Thursday. In some ways that's a good thing - it's helpful to have some flexibility in my schedule and it keeps me going to new meetings and meeting new people. I'm lucky enough to live in a city with literally hundreds of meetings every week so I've got a lot to choose from. ..Yesterday I went to an afternoon Big Book meeting. The format was read from the book for 15 minutes then go around the room discussing what we read. They happened to be on "We Agnostics."  ..As I've mentioned before I have no problem with the "Higher Power" concept as it is currently practiced in the rooms. But I find some of the literature to be pretty heavy-handed. This is one example of that. However since AA is *not* a religion I don't see any reason to treat the literature as sacred texts or the word of God. So while I find the arguments in this chapter supporting belief in God to be a little ridiculous (and strongly resembling arguments I've heard supporting Creationism....) I feel entirely free to ignore the Deist tangents and practice the program according to the dictates of my own conscience. Or in simpler terms I don't see myself finding God anytime soon but I feel comfortable working the program...I posted earlier about the two mistakes I see people making in early sobriety. Which may in itself have been a mistake. I dunno. It seems self-evident to me that if you're going to quit doing something it's probably not a good idea to hang around and watch people doing that thing. I personally have struggled with feeling like I should make "healthy" changes in early sobriety - less sugar less caffeine more exercise. But I've found that doing those things has made it harder for me to keep up with the rest of my sobriety program so I've stopped worrying about them. It turns out that pretty much everyone in /SD is healthier than me! And there's a ton of new posts about "tests" people are so proud of themselves for passing. Maybe I should just stop reading those. ..Anyway I am off to a meeting. And I will post with the full plan for the Chicago meet-up tonight. Take care everyone!

This is awesome! Sounds like you've got a solid plan and you're killing it. Well done! :)
