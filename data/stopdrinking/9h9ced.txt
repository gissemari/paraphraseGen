last night i had my first drink in a month my third in three months...It seems like I have a really hard time making it much past a month before relapsing. And when i relapse I relapse hard. My plan was to take 1-2 shots. I drank so (killed a bottle) in about an hour. blacked out...Does anyone have any advice? I really need to stop doing this

Welcome back!..What have you tried in the past to stay sober? I know a lot of people like AA or other programs. Reading *This Naked Mind* and spending ungodly amounts of time here did it for me. ..Don't despair! You're still figuring out what's gonna work for you. 
Keep going. Consider what might help you succeed in the long run.

Stay busy and always have a plan in advance- because you already know ***that*** day will come. I know for myself i can not have even one drink so I can not even consider bringing alcohol into my life. Alcohol is gone for me-because I said so-It is that simple. Someone else suggested THIS NAKED MIND (book). I really think you may find it enlightening I know I did. Try not to get disappointed make a firm commitment have an escape plan ( for cravings) and fight for your sobriety. IWNDWYTD
