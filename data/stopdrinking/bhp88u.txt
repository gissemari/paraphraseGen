I don't really have people to share this with that would be able to relate. Like many others here I've had more than a handful of "Day 1's" and "this time is when I really quit." And each relapse led to a downward spiral of self destruction and loathing. ..Today is my day 50 of not drinking. The longest I've gone since I started drinking a decade ago. (Badge update request has been put in.) It's honestly such a surreal feeling. Being able to decline a drink without an internal battle and convincing myself why "just a few is ok." There's so much more time in the day I'm happier and handling my bad days in a healthy way instead of blacking out then lashing out at the people around me. ..For so long drinking was part of if not the majority of my personality. Everything revolved around it. And now I can say I don't drink. I'm still an alcoholic that hasn't changed but I'm no longer allowing it to be a controlling factor in my life. Sober life is a better life. ..I won't drink today. Much love.
