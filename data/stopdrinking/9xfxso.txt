Day 30 today of no alcohol and all i want right now is a fucking drink. I feel like a child who's not allowed to have a snack before tea or something i feel like i'm being deprived.  I'm angry that I can't drink because I can't moderate my drinking. I'm angry that I can't drink because I become depressed and/or angry. I'm angry that when I have one drink I have a bit of a buzz and after that one I am trying to constantly chase that buzz but it fades further and further away. I just want to drink.

I know the feeling
It'll pass. Trust me. You just need to put your head down and plow through it. 30 days is amazing so be proud of that. It's easy to get frustrated so it's not a bad thing every once and a while to look over your shoulder and see where you came from. You can do it it won't be easy but it does get easier.....
Day 3. Want a beer. I am angry with myself.  I have read that as often as I drank that my brain and body are both messed up.  I hope the body can heal itself quick.  I hope that you can get through the rest of today.  Thanks for sharing. not drinking is not for sissies.
I feel you friend - I'm in the same boat tonight. Stay strong and plow through- we can do this!   
Happened to me as well and a lot of other folks I know. For some reason 30 60 90 days 6 months and annual anniversaries are heightened times for people falling off. Stay the course friend. It'll pass!
