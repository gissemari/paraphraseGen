I made it through my Vegas trip sober with very few cravings actually.  I think this is partially due to lingering shame from my last drunk as well as the support of my (normie) sober husband. We were together for the entire trip.  Now I'm back at work and apparantly back to craving. Even on my way into the office at 8am the thought of grabbing some spiked seltzer and/or airplane bottles of booze crossed my mind.  I'm determined not to relapse as I dont want to lose my new sponsor who has been very clear that we cant work together if I'm not done drinking. I certainly feel "done" today. I WANT desperately to be "done" for good!  I know however in the days and weeks ahead my mind will try to play all sorts of tricks on me that has led to relapses in the past.  I need to stay focused and reading/posting on SD helps!..IWNDWYT!

Relapse is often a part of recovery.  I'd fire a sponsor who said they'd drop me if I relapsed and I wouldn't bail on a sponsee who ran into rough times unless they didn't re-dedicate themselves to sobriety.  That's when we need our sober network most.
Good job in Vegas If you can make it through that.. You got today...IWNDWYT
