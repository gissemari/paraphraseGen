I can close on three occasions this weekend. The worst was three hours ago when I felt like celebrating my team's last ditch survival on the final day of the season. This would normally lead to a marathon drinking session- especially when coupled with the wonderful hot weather we've had across central England today...Driving home passed packed beer gardens I was getting the old feelings thank god for my wife who saw what I was thinking and stepped in. I talked myself round and read some more Reddit sd...I need to get myself a sponsor as she shouldn't have to go through it with me. ..Feels good to have fought what could have been the old relapse and won!

Awesome!  Good for you. Not drinking with you today. :)
Fantastic yes it is hard when the weather is nice. I'm from the uk and spent the afternoon digging my mums garden. Normally I would reward myself with a few glasses of wine but I didn't. Think of all the people sat in those beer gardens having a very big hangover! Not for me and you though lol! I won't drink with you tonight 
Well done I relapsed at a match back in February (long suffering Spurs fan here). Keep it up mate....well done! 
Nice one! :) Thats so cool.
