It wasn't drinking related but it just puts the cap on a stressful time...**Edit:** *Hit submit way too fast.*..So not mad at my boss or anything.  He's been great; the company has been struggling financially and he had to let about 25% of the staff go.  The fact that he couldn't find another contract for me (IT consulting) and that I was already on the bench for six weeks meant that I was on the block.  It's the nature of the business...What **is** a result of my drinking is this:  on the past three years making an extra $$ for this kind if risk I didn't build up a nest egg; instead I drank that money away as well as maxxing out my credit at bars across the southeast.  That's on me and my bad past choice....Besides the financial side of things I'm gonna need some good reasons to not drink tonight.  I'm working on racking them up (the reasons not the drinks) but any support here will be appreciated.

I'm sorry to hear this Fahrenheit. I was also laid off when I was a few months into sobriety. I wanted to drink over it; instead I reached out here to SD - hung out with the amazing friends in our IRC - and realized that there is nothing so bad that I should drink over it. Instead I felt the 'feels' cried a bit and went to sleep. Yup right in the middle of the day I closed the blinds and put my mind at ease. I meditated let myself grieve for a bit and remained mindful that there are plenty of other jobs out there...I know this is a stressful time and I applaud you for reaching out. Not sure if you go to meetings but I found that going to a meeting when this happened to me was very helpful. The people in that room had been where I was (drinking related or not) and were able to give me feedback and support which made things a lot easier to accept...You're going to hit *DOUBLE DIGITS* tomorrow morning! Regardless of what's going on with the job front you're SOBER. You're winning!!!..Please hang in there and keep posting :)..
I'm sorry about your job and anything else you might be dealing with Fahrenheit. On your note about reasons not to drink tonight: 1.) By not drinking you will have more clarity and time to find a new job and do the research you need to on potential employers. 2.) You will go to your future interviews without a hangover more alert and more mentally present. 3.) You won't get yourself into trouble that could show up on a future employers background check (DUI etc.) ..Hang in there. I won't drink with you today. 
I got laid off started drinking and didn't look for a job and kept drinking and was still laid off so I kept drinking and didn't look for jobs and kept drinking.....Play the decision to drink forward in your head. Are you going to have one? How late you going to stay up? How late are you going to sleep in tomorrow? How much work you going to do tomorrow?
