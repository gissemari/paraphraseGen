I got a late night call and was able to talk a friend through a tough moment and be present for them tonight. This would have been a struggle before- either trying to act sober and follow what they were saying or I would have missed the call entirely.  This makes the struggle worth it.  ..Thinking of all of you who show up for others! Iwndwyt!

This makes me really appreciate my friend who did the same for me recently. This is really positive thank you for sharing. IWNDWYT.
YES!! Being sober means we can help others which in terms reminds us why we must remain sober. Sounds like you're a great friend :)
Brilliant.  I feel like I'm a better friend now as I can help out when needed and I'm more present and positive due to not being hungover.
