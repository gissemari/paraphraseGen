Went over 50 days sober and picked up a drink on Thursday. Been going out and drinking every night since. I don't miss this feeling and I pick up a drink anytime I feel the PAWS kicking in. I'm afraid of going through the first week of being sober again but it needs to be done.

Hi Matrix. You say " but it needs to be done " You are on a good trajectory now. When the idea in our heads shifts from stopping drinking being desirable to it being necessary then the balance begins to tilt in our favour. When the voices in your head start going off try pushing back with "because this is what has to be done"... the inner voice struggle to find a counter argument for that one. Keep doing what's working.
