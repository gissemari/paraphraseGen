We need people like you too. To get different experiences and both good &amp; bad experiences. We are all here for each other..
I heard earlier this week "We're not here to see through each other but rather to see each other through..." That's so true. My sobriety has been very dependent on others around me trying to get/stay sober as well.
Yes!  Me too.  
aw thank you.
Thanks for caring. Everyone here needs support. Happy Thanksgiving!
