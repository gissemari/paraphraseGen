I am new here but I've been reading and quietly sharing in many of your experiences...Today is the morning of my 6th day. ..I don't actually feel much different yet physically. I know from experience that it takes a long time for me to feel improvement on that front. I wish I could be one of those who says "day three and I already feel better" but I know everybody's road is unique. I don't want to fall back into the trap of "I don't feel much different so maybe drinking wasn't hurting me as much as I thought it was." Patience often eludes me so I am struggling here...But that's not to say nothing has changed. It is wonderful to wake up and not feel like I need to recover from something. I can get up and just start *doing things* without coffee water and lying on the couch wondering when I'll feel well enough to start my day. The nightmares have subsided. I wear a sleep tracker and the amount of time I'm in deep sleep has improved the last couple of nights...I'm also happy that despite wanting to wrap up work and have a drink every day instead I've had some water a decaf coffee or a sports drink made it past the craving and found something else to do...I am looking forward to a fun and productive weekend where every moment will be savored and plans for the future will be considered. Today is my day and tomorrow we have a really fun outdoor activity planned. This will be a good weekend. Thank you for inspiring me.
