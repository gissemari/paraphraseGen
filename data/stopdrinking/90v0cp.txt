I wanted to say first of all that this sub is inspiring. As someone who has struggled with drugs and alcohol for roughly 4 years now I find it very helpful to read through these posts just as hearing a story at a meeting can change your whole day. Thanks for that...As for the reason I'm posting I guess I'm just wanting to share and maybe take some advice if I can get it...I've been to rehab twice in one year. The second time really helped and I was able to get 89 days sober but sadly I've relapsed and my desire is back stronger than ever. I know I'm getting complacent but when I left rehab for the last time I had no desire. I think I'm also addicted to the "thrill" that the initial consumption gives me. I dont know how to shake it again without just whiteknuckling it. ..I'm moving away to a job I used to have before (which I lost twice due to my addiction) on Sunday and I'm so scared I'm just going to make the same mistakes again. ..I did have a win today though. I planned to have a drink tonight when I got home from the beach. But here I am typing this stone sober at 11:28pm...Any advice guys and gals?..

I wish I had advice to give friend. .I'm happy for your small victory for staying sober for another day .I'm here with only three days. But I'm here with you and we can get through the rest of this day sober together. 
Thank you(:
The book This Naked Mind helped me immensely. It reduced my cravings dramatically. I hear you about the thrill; I felt that way too. Just take it one day at a time. You got this!
