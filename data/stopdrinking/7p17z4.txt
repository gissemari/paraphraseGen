It's been a great week of sobriety and i'm looking forward to many more weeks ahead.  After a long cold snap it's warming up out there today and as I watch the snow melt and the sun light up the neighborhood i'm reminded that beautiful sunny afternoons like this one are some of my biggest triggers.  There's definitely a precedent for my relapsing on days like this and I'm not going to let it happen today.  Nope not today.

Ahhh yes. I'm waiting for some of my weather triggers to kick in - that random early spring warm day the first BBQ of the season cold beers after a hard renovation or yard work. I won't drink with you either.
