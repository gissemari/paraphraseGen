What does this have to do with not drinking? Well I've noticed in the past ^ that many days that alcohol really was like this... scrambler? Dumber-downer. That just kind of flooded all the peaks and valleys in feeling so that you don't really know where whatever-feeling-ill-at-ease is coming from. Without it I notice so much how nearly-instantly food affects feelings-- and not just physically but mental clarity outlook etc...I've also shared on here before how much I've been surprised by my struggles with sugar in the past two months or so. It wasn't an issue in the beginning but it really snuck up on me. I feel ready to tackle that now...So this morning I did a full pantry clean-out. Last night I did a week of menu planning...Also I think I have come to peace with the decision to return to work full-time. Originally I wanted to stay home part-time until my daughter was in school but I think part of the reason I wanted to do that is so I could live the "chardonnay in the afternoon" mommy lifestyle. My current work situation is pretty toxic so I am definitely not looking to return there full-time but I've updated my Linked In and am just making myself mentally and "spiritually" open for the universe to bring something full-time my way. ..In general feeling good but also ready to take this to the next level. Bring it!

Not sure how old your daughter is but my wife has never regretted being a stay at home mom for our 3 children. ..We are definitely labor class and we manage.
