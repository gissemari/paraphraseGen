Anyone else struggle with anger and feeling like life is unfair. Like all the drinkers get that release that you don't get to have any more? Like you have to keep plodding away on your own?

Somebody pulled out in front of me in their car today without giving enough space. I had to lightly apply the breaks. I actually took a moment to be angry and ponder the horrible injustices of life. But it's day 2. Give me time.
I will share something with you that happened to me in early sobriety...My ex and I were newly sober.  We got into a fight (we fought a lot) ..Suddenly he stopped looked at me took two steps back... and said 13 words that changed my life. ..*You're back on the sh!t!* he said.  *I can TELL by the way you're acting!"* ..But... I was **sober**.  ..And that was the moment I realized that **even without alcohol I acted like a raging alcoholic.**  ..The following weekend I went to a meeting of AA - and I went to listen.  I am not saying AA is for everyone - but the steps really helped me to get a grip on my rage. ..He relapsed and went to prison.  I picked up a 22 year chip last week...and I have NEVER raged like a lunatic again. ...Rage was comfortable to me..I don't drink - or rage - anymore. 
I know how you feel i miss the 'release' as well. But it was a lie i was never released of anything it only made me look away. It was a temporary distraction. With all the 'release' i permitted myself i should have been free as a bird...
I didn't "plod away on my own". Having support and guidance from a therapist and AA made being sober easier and more fun. There is more to getting well than simply not drinking. With help I learned sober coping tools. Realizing that I cannot change other people goes a long way to staving off anger. I have serenity today.
I certainly do and get that feeling. I keep reminding myself how much better life is not drinking and forgetting things is though. For instance I played Beyond: Two Souls again sober as a ... sober thing. I realized the first time I played it I was so drunk I didn't remember or realize half of what is going on - a reward to my senses. I am alert and aware and safe and my release is definitely in the fact that my life feels more accomplished and every day is one more release for me.
