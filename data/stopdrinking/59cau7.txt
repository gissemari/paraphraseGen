This is by far the longest I've gone since I was 18 and I'm 34 now. A year ago I would have sworn that this was literally impossible...I haven't had any strong urges to actually drink. I've tasted (not sipped or drank) my wife's beer a handful of times to find out what some new beer tastes like. Every time it tasted very bad and at no point did get cravings. For some this would count as a relapse because a taste of a drink would begin the slippery slope. I respect that. But not for me because my sobriety isn't about actually drinking. ..I didn't drink to numb any pain or mute sadness. The reason I drank was to do something / anything to kill time or switch it up or make things more interesting and unpredictable (for better or for worse). ..Last January I was diagnosed with ADD (inattention not hyperaction) but I know I've had it all my life. One major symptom of it (for me) is that it lessens the enjoyment or happiness or gratification I get from things. In my past I have engaged in destructive and reckless behavior to try and counteract this. ..For a long time I chose drinking because it's legal it's acceptable it's easy and no one bats an eye when you use it was a social lubricant/enhancer (in America). I developed a taste for it. It became the locus of my social gatherings and hobbies. Being with friends had to include alcohol or it would be boring. If alcohol weren't so normalized I probably would have chosen something else. ..As you all know alcohol's net effects are NOT pleasurable :) It made me sad anxious tired dehydrated wrinkled irritable depressed fat bloated lazy broke etc. etc. etc. So I decided to stop. It was either that or keep mistreating myself and I was done with feeling like garbage. ..It has taken a lot of struggle out of my life. A LOT of struggle. Things are so much easier now wowie. Things are also more predictable less mysterious and more boring. Whether I was drunk or hungover alcohol definitely added variables to my life. They weren't good but they were different and so in a weird morbid way I even enjoyed being hung over sometimes. ..So now I am in this sort of limbo where I know drinking isn't good for me and so I am searching for something else. Ideally I get an owl from Hogwarts telling me I've been accepted to their adult-learner program but aside from that I am not sure what I'm looking for. ..**I am rambling. Does anyone else feel like this? I am more grateful than I can say to be free from drinking and I'm also hopeful to discover new ways of being happy.**

Can totally relate. My GF is sure that I have AD(H)D and wants me to go and get tested. I have always sought drugs &amp; boose to make live interesting I get so bored with ordinary life. But after year after year my life &amp; hpysical health has gotten ruined so I am forced to quit. And want to quit as well so far 3 weeks in it is feeling great. But at the same time dull. I really should go get tested for ADHD but what will it help me knowing the cause? Won't make life less dull. .So yes i can totally relate. If you discover these new ways of being happy please let me know
I relate so much to this. While I did use alcohol to numb sadness I also used it because it made life feel less mundane. Adulting is such a chore and alcohol is a cheap easy high. ..I also have ADHD diagnosed at 10 years old (29 now). I take a medication called Strattera which helps me focus... but it also seems to have a dampening effect on the constant pleasure-seeking shiny-chasing impulses I have. *shrug* Not sure that helps the sobriety but I do just feel more leveled out. ..I have just over 4 months too! If you'd told me a year ago I was going to be this sober I'd have laughed in your face. :) ..About how to enjoy life... someone here told me that having a goal keeps their mind in line. Even if it's just as simple as getting fit or trying a new hobby. I'm working towards grad school and having a goal to work towards makes me feel like life is at least meaningful. I can't always have the heart-pounding excitement but I can have a vision for something I want and work towards it. ..Also... I've gotten into coloring books (I know lame) and it helps calm me the F down when I start to feel too restless.
