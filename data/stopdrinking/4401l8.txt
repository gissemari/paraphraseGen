M26. It only took roughly 2.5 years but I finally got my own place and moved out of my parents house. Just over 2.5 years ago I graduated college landed my first job and moved back into my parents place "temporarily". I then spent 1.5 years getting drunk by myself most weekends and hating life. With another year of struggling to sober up I finally decided it was time to move out and last night was my first official night in my new place. I even went on a 3rd date with a girl last weekend. I am still trying to figure out who I am and the last couple of months feel almost like a dream. All I know is for the first time in a long time I am starting to like the person staring back at me when I look in the mirror.

Good for you! Funny how alcohol keeps us stuck but quitting it helps us move on and grow and change. I hope I have such a triumphant post in a few months.
