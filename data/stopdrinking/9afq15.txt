Hi everyone! Burning Man starts this weekend. I went last year and I was set to go again but as soon as I realized that I needed to get sober I realized that it would not be a good situation for me to put myself in. So I'm home. I recouped the costs that I could &amp; walked away from the sunk ones because nothing's more expensive than a relapse...I'm glad that I made the decision to prioritize my sobriety. Sobriety has to come first or I can't do the things that I want to do have the life that I want to have or be the person who I want to be. And I'm celebrating my decision by hosting a picnic. Anyone in Chicago is welcome details are over in r/SDChicago...I'm still sad that I'm not going to Burning Man. It's an incredible experience. There is so much positivity and support there I had some amazing interactions with people and it recharged my sense of creativity and wonder. ..I'm not ruling out going in the future. There are people who do it sober and I know that there's at least one sober camp Camp Anonymous. I just know that there's a tremendous party atmosphere. Alcohol is everywhere and drugs are also easily available. ..I didn't go there last year for the party and I found a lot of enjoyment and fun out of just biking around looking at art interacting with people and stumbling on various theme camps. But I'm sticking strictly to  sober people and sober places  while I get my sobriety established and that means giving some things up. And I'm fine with that. If I don't sacrifice some things that I want in the short term I will lose many more things that I value and need in the long term...And I don't need to be at Burning Man to find people who are kind supportive creative and excited about life. I don't need to be at Burning Man to connect with people be creative and have fun. And Lord knows that I don't need to be at Burning Man to dress up geek out or horse around...So that's it. I gotta go make my frittata for the picnic. Hope life is treating you well sobernauts!..Ginger_Sprout Out

Good for you checking in with yourself and making the decision to not test your willpower for days on end. I'm not saying you wouldn't have succeeded  but if i'm not entering such a situation brimming with confidence and full- up on willpower reserves I'd spend all my energy dodging and deflecting and very little fun would be had...
Being in Chicago look up Soberfest. It's an AA party held up in Lake Geneva. One of the best parties I've ever been and nobody is drinking. Maybe some sneak off to the local bars during the event but not at the event...Congratulations on your decision to get sober and good luck! IWNDWYT
