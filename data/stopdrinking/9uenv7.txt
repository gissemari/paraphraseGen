Last time I posted I was seriously considering drinking. I felt like it was inevitable and I was losing control. I made some changes and am happy to say I feel much better. My strength to fight this damn disease has been renewed and I'm so happy I powered through that depression and urge to drink and am on the other side. Even after 8 months those struggles will crop up and I'm just so sincerely grateful for everybody that gave me that support and advice when I really needed it.    If you are where I was please seek out help here or else where. You deserve not to drink.

Wise words. So glad you made it through x
Happy to hear you stuck it out there may be tunnels of darkness to go through along this journey but there is still going to be open sky on the other side.  IWNDWYT
