Had a relapse on Tuesday and ended up messaging a bunch of my old friends incoherent nonsense in a blackout....Feel extremely down about returning to such foolish behavior and trying to crawl my way back out.  Any advice would be great thanks in advance.

Don't dwell on it self loathing gets you nowhere. .In the big scheme of things it's a very minor mistake and it sounds like you haven't hurt anyone. All you've done is dent your pride..Try and use it as a positive and remind yourself of your current feelings next time you think of getting drunk.
