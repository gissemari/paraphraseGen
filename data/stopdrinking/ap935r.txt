It's been awhile since I've been on Reddit and today I was inspired to pop in. I am about a week away from 21 months sober and there were many many days in the beginning where that would have seemed an impossible dream. My life has changed in beautiful and drastic ways and continues to surprise and amaze me. There are still days I struggle (Christmas is hard) but it is nothing like it used to be and I have gathered so much empirical evidence as to why being sober is better for me at this point that any argument my brain attempts is pretty pathetic...For me education and action were key. In the beginning I read everything I could on the science of substance abuse and recovery. I was on this forum practically every day reading posts. Eventually I found an awesome therapist. I checked out a few local Refuge Recovery Meetings. I tried a million hobbies and a few stuck. I went back to school. I did everything different than how I had been living my life for the 15 years previous...The hardest part by far was restructuring my social life. I lost some friends and that was difficult. There were some lonely times. But sober was already outside my comfort zone so I felt like I could keep challenging that comfort zone and I did. I met people via meetings yoga classes meetup groups and fostered better relationships with the family and friends who were supportive and thrilled at my recovery. I found a lot of love that was there right under my nose...It's not easy- don't let anyone invalidate your journey. Healing isn't linear so don't stop trying if you slip up. Know you are worth it-- you are worth pursuing every possible solution and attempt and support system despite stigma or fear. You are worth it and sobriety is worth it. ..  ...Keep fighting the good fight.  .  .
