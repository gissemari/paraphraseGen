No wisdom here just an accountability post. I'm also hoping that seeing this might help someone new who's struggling...So I've officially made it without a drink exactly as long as a pregnant lady would. It went quickly and very slowly at the same time. There were low points but I'm here to say you can make it this far and I'll do it again tomorrow. Come join me...And my coworker who sits facing me came in late this morning very hungover and looking like fried hell. I enjoyed both pointing it out (in good fun he just had a late night out) and the realization that I haven't been there in 3/4 of a year. Here's to another day of coffee and water! Cheers?

&gt; And my coworker who sits facing me came in late this morning very hungover and looking like fried hell...Yes seeing and smelling co-workers when they are hungover makes me realize how happy I am that I will never feel that way again due to my own poisoning of myself...Congrats on 270 days!
Congrats fellow 9-monther! \0/
