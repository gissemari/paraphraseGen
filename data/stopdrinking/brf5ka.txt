After having reached the 4 month mark this week and spending the last couple years dreading and resenting work I found out that I will be starting at a new job next week! ..There are many things to be grateful for but I'll keep the list concise:..\- This incredible place we call SD and every single one of you for your support and courage. You all rock!..\- Mindfulness meditation for teaching me that every breath every moment and every challenging thought/feeling comes and goes...\- My psychologist whom I **adore**. Their wit humour and compassion have enabled me to pursue the person I always dreamed of becoming...\- Mark Manson and Bren  Brown for shining light on some of my most difficult struggles...\- Lastly but certainly not least my parents. For being there when I needed them most...On a side note I just recently went two days where I **FORGOT** to pledge on my sober app! This was a shock to me a day without thinking of alcohol would've been un heard of a month ago. I'm still very much a work in progress but I wouldn't be able to progress at all if I still had alcohol in my life. ..My newest project is leaning in and trying to "listen" to difficult emotions when they arise. I'm also trying to be more vulnerable (gulp) so I thought I'd leave you with a quote from *Daring Greatly* which I thought accurately reflected my experience with alcohol. .. *"...numbing vulnerability also dulls our experiences of love joy belonging creativity and empathy. We can't selectively numb emotion. Numb the dark and you numb the light."*..&amp;#x200B;..Thank you have a great day. IWNDWYT

Congrats! I am going for the same narrative in process of interviewing... and thanks for the reminder to read Brene brown I bought the book so long ago before I started sobriety and never read it. IWNDWYT-!
