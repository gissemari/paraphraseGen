I need help!..A friend (f) of mine (m) who is also in recovery has recently been ejected from where she lives.  She called me in the middle of the night about 2 weeks ago after getting dragged out of the flat she was staying with by the police.  The (nice) guy she was staying with had ejected her because of an argument they had. (She according to him was drunk relapsed after 6 months not drinking)  I did what I could for her and got her to mine with her belongings and offered her a place to stay for the night but it was pretty clear early on she wanted to move in which I (rightly) thought was a bad idea.  I'm 6 months into recovery and my sponsor (also rightly) said it could be potentially catastrophic.  My friend is really erratic full of resentments and whilst I care for immeasurably I know she's pretty toxic for my recovery it doesn't help that I'm fairly attracted to her...Anyways after letting her stay the night I explained to her that she couldn't stay at mine it would be a bad idea for a number of reasons including the fact i'm attracted to her and she needed to go to the council (i'm in the UK) to see if she could get into a womens refuge or get housed.  ..I said I'd be happy to let her stash her stuff at mine but she could under no circumstances stay in my home.  She didn't take this very well and decided to book a bus ticket to another city for the next day.  I implored her to go through the homelessness housing process but she was adamant she wanted to go to another city.  So I told her I'd hold onto her belongings for safe keeping until she decided what she was doing in the other city and the next day she left...I've stayed in touch with her over the last two weeks and she said she'd been going to meetings in the city and staying in a backpacking hostel.  She seemed in good spirits up until yesterday when I got a text from her saying she was homesick and wanted to come back home.  I told her that she should and we could try to get her sorted with the housing situation.  Again she starts kind of angling to move into mine again I repeat that it's a bad idea and it could all go horribly wrong...Today I've sent her a text telling her I'm there for her and explaining again what she needs to do to get sorted with a flat/house by going to the council and telling them she's homeless.  In the short term this may be not exactly what she wants but it seems like the best option I (and others including my sponsor) can think of...This situation is tearing me apart.  I WANT to help her more but I CAN'T help her.  I can't make these decisions for her or force her to do what needs to be done.  I feel horribly guilty for keeping someone homeless and not helping them as much as I could but everybody I speak to says if I do let her stay at mine I'm enabling her not sorting out her own problem.  I KNOW that I'm making the right choice and that I have to be cruel to be kind how do I stop feeling so fucking guilty about it????

I have a hard time standing up for myself and setting boundaries too. I think people who are good at manipulating and crossing boundaries are able to find people like us and take advantage. Don't feel guilty. Take care of yourself first. This person needs to find their own way it isn't your job to take care of them.  
You're doing great!..Clear boundaries established with courtesy and respect are essential to my health and well being...I always remember:  "I can't be 'guilted' without my participation"...Having empathy; feeling compassion; having a caring heart; - none of these preclude taking care of myself first.  Remember the airlines have a clear message for very important reasons:  "Put on your oxygen mask before assisting others."..You're a good person!  Stand firm on what you know in your heart is healthy...
