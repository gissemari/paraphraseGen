I feel strong and healthier able to make better choices. I probably wasn't much of an alcoholic but definitely abuse. As in I only drank every now and then but it was always in secret always alone and always to the point where I was incoherent. It wasn't the frequency that was my problem it was the the magnitude when I did. I normally relapse around this the week mark and do it again but not this time. This time I have support. Last time I was drunk I told my partner and my best friend and my brother. I feel free in honesty.

Good for you friend. You sound like me in drinking styles.  Where a lot of people spread their drinks out over the week I make up for lost time on a Friday or Saturday night :/  Here's hoping we can both break the cycle once and for all!
