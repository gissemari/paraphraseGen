My best friend's father passed away this week and his funeral was today. We've been a part of each other's families for about 35 years so it has been difficult to watch my friend struggle through her loss while also experiencing my own level of grief.  I was anticipating some difficulty with being the only sober person at the wake. And it was hard initially but as the afternoon wore on I noticed how much more meaningful my exchanges were with everyone and how much more it meant to actually be there. Tbh I can't even remember most of the wakes I've attended as an adult due to being so intoxicated.

Sorry for your loss. I too used to  coast through' events without really being there. My kids asked me about something (after I sobered up) that happened at a wedding back when I was still drinking; You were at Ken and Em's wedding!  And I said  Yeah it was at a church right?'. And I was pretty sure it was at a church but clearly I wasn't all there. IWNDWYT I'm gonna be busy living not coasting.
I am sorry for your loss. I have had two wakes in the past two weeks. The first was the hardest in terms of not drinking and not knowing quite what to do with myself yesterday's much easier. I felt it is definitely worth being fully present even for grief. .
I'm so sorry for your loss I can imagine how difficult this must be...Great job on staying vigilant and feeling the feels :).
