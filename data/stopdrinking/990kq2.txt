21 days here. I still have a lot of things to work out emotionally for myself but right now I feel better than I have in a very long time. ..I had gotten to that point where I felt totally helpless and I felt trapped by my drinking and my negative emotions. I almost felt like I couldn't handle it anymore. There really wasn't anything for me to do other than quit because drinking was screwing with my anxiety in a really scary way. ..For anyone struggling right now I really wish you the best. You deserve to feel better. You are important.
