Highly recommended! After coming off a relapse which basically started at my wedding I was really apprehensive about going on a trip. I was an emotional wreck after the relapse (see previous post but be warned it's rough). The day of the flight I was getting advice left and right about whether I should go on the honeymoon go seek treatment etc. I eventually had to do what felt honestly right to me. I knew if I didn't go I would regret it and fall into a pathetic hole of self-pity and despair. And when I'm in that hole I tend to drink. Therefore I decided to go but with a strong plan in place to stay sober. This included going to AA meetings while in Spain (which I did and it was a really wonderful experience) calling my sponsor and other people in my program daily and knowing that if I thought I might drink I was going to get on a plane and come home. ...I don't think going would have been right for everyone but it was right for me. It was important that my husband and I experience our honeymoon and I'm SO happy I got to experience it sober! And for anyone that might say otherwise Europe has so much to offer and for you to experience besides drinking....Two things happened while I was here that I'm proud of: .1. I offended a sommelier at a fancy restaurant when I turned down her first wine pairing and told her I would not be drinking at all. By the look on her face I don't think she knew that there are people out there that simply can't drink ..2. The hotel surprised us with a bottle of champagne which I immediately poured down the sink before I could even give it a second thought ...Very happy to be back on the wagon and building sober memories again. IWNDWYT!
