Last night I cracked and had a most of a beer and all of a shot.  ..I had just gotten off work and wanted a round.  I didn't want to get hammered or even a second round.  I got about 2/3 of the way done with my beer...looked around to the handful of people in the same dive bar Ive seen all over this country and didn't miss it or think I was missing out...Then I walked home in the cold struggling for footing because it just snowed a fair amount in the Mile High. ..Woke up at five a.m. Day one of school is today...between work and school I don't get a day off for at least 2 months... hopefully no more than 4..

Hey you're right back here and getting back in the game.  Those 55 days count as far as I am concerned.  I have seen lots of people here say that a reset has been very informative for them.  It proves that they don't enjoy the scene or the booze or the feeling the next day.  Congrats on getting straight back in the game.  Good luck in school and let's go get this day!
It's me your buddy Fish!  I grabbed something for you to look at just in [case](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7munyz/one_month_so_much_can_happen/?st=JCQD6DVN&amp;sh=b7fa08d6) .    I'm right beside you HomeAlone rooting for you 100%.  Take care out there I will not be drinking with you today.  
There have been some hard days where I wanted to drink lately...to get drunk...Last night was not that...still a moment of weakness.  And I dont feel like I beat my problem...or proved I can moderate so now I can no. I cant...more so I don't want to...As I ordered last night the couple next to me were obviously having an argument exacer
