17 days in and it's surprising that I've had my first drinking dream. It wasn't like a relapse dream. I've had those. It was more of random scenes and there was booze in involved. In one i have like this weird fake old beer I'm not even sure if I drink it. Makes me hopeful feels like I'm at the end of being done. 14 days till I crush it. Not drinking with you today. ..How often do you get drankin dreams?..What do you think drankin dreams mean? I feel like they indicate that the addiction has been pushed so far back it can only bleed into my dreams.

I get drinking dreams often....in my opinion it indicates that this is a topic that had been on my mind a lot lately sometimes maybe something I worry about.  I will say that since I have stopped drinking I less seriously disturbing nightmares which is really nice.
I actually just had one last night and it scared me so badly. I was thinking the whole time "Like how/why could I do this?! It's only day two and I've already told quite a few people how alcohol has been a problem for me. And I already let them down...". Just made me feel terrible. Then I woke up realized I had been in bed for the past 6 hours and the relief washed over me...Idk what it means. I thought about it on my drive into work and figured it's just the alcohol trying it's best to battle back against my attempt to stay sober.
