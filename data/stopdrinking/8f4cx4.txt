So I've been working on quitting for a bit... With mixed results.  ..But I'm getting better... Every misstep has taught me something new; the last one that I can *never* moderate or really drink *at all*...I have one of those cool Wi-Fi body analysis scales and I've been using it regularly from about a month before my drinking problem got into full swing until now...I was looking at my year to date progression and that felt pretty good... 15 pounds down since the end of January...Then I looked back and there it was: the complete history of my drinking problem laid out in my weight histogram.  Every attempt to cut back every major relapse...I went from 235 lbs (about 10 over my target) to 275 in less than three years.  40 pounds.  Crazy...I'm a bit better now and /r/stopdrinking has been a big part of it.  I've been doing /r/keto and while that's helped every time I drink I plateau.  ..In short if I *ever* want to be at a healthy weight again I can't drink.  Yet another reason that this place is helping me save my own life...Here's a link if you want to check it out.  There's no personally identifiable information and I decided to leave off marks where I cut back/moderated/quit/relapsed.  They were redundant as the fluctuations day more than a label ever could...[Weight Histogram](https://i.imgur.com/cVD677Q.jpg)..I will not drink with you today.

Very interesting! I haven't had a lot of weight gain through my drinking years but I could stand to lose some. Two things I'm looking forward to in sobriety: getting thinner/fit ( if I can get energy again!) and saving money!
I'm right there with you. My drinking binges are tied perfectly with my periods of weight gain. 100% if I want the body I used to have I gotta be off the sauce...I will not drink with you today
Alcohol = all calories and no nutrients.  All the cells start crying when we drink because they are getting poisoned.  It's a lot easier dropping weight without the booze for sure.  IWNDWYT
It's really an eye opener to see it like that. The last time I relapsed I gained a kilo/2 pounds in a week. But I will not drink with you today! 
Ha.  It took me six years to lose 40lbs because I would go down up down up and could easily gain 10 in any given month.  Then I quit drinking and lost 20lbs in a few months.  
This is so me too. If you want to tell if I'm drinking just look at me I'm about 20 pounds heavier
