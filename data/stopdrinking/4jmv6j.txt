I have a huge fear of flying particularly when I'm on my own. Airports are a huge trigger for me as I associate them with drinking. my big relapse back in August started at an airport I took one shot of vodka that they were handing out at the duty free shop at 9am and it just went downhill from there leading to a multi-day blackout bender and me waking up with a punched up face and black eye. I then couldn't get together again until Janurary. I'm going back to to the UK where I don't have a sober support network. Although I am going to hit up some meetings and what not. I am just posting this so I can be accountable to myself. I will not get drunk at the airport I will embrace my fear.

Go to a bookstore and pick out a big good cheesy page turner. And maybe some puzzle books. Get a starbucks or something. When you're on the plane notice how...amazingly...not that many people drink alcohol. Enjoy the UK! At least you know you will find meetings in English. You'll be saving money too by not drinking there that's for sure. Good luck!
Ack I also have a similar association with airports and train stations--airports especially because flying is scary for me. But drinking was also just something to DO while I waited. ..Today I flew home by myself after visiting a friend and felt really anxious on takeoff. I remembered that alcohol could calm me down (in the most meaningless temporary way) but I resisted without even thinking about it much. ..Also I had breakfast before getting to my gate and I saw some dudes drinking bloody marys. It actually seemed pretty lame--like they were just looking for an excuse to drink on a Monday morning. I was proud not to be in on it...Now I'm back home and so happy I didn't try to deal with the problem by drinking...You can do it and you won't ever regret not drinking. Good luck!
I survived sober!
