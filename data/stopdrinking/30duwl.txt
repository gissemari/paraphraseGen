And didn't buy myself anything! Last night the boyfriend asked if I could pick him up some beer (Something i wouldn't drink anyway - i don't like the stuff) and I negotiated with him that if I picked him up beer he's paying for my new found chocolate needs...I walked in picked up his 6-pack and the attendant asked if that was it as he was leaning back getting ready to grab me my vodka and again I said I was sure just the beer...It was a little tough not gonna lie - but powered through that..... THEN TWO chocolate bars before bed. God I"m a piggy - and that's VERY NOT KETO! Gah. But I did not drink...Woke up today early despite wanting to sleep in since I work 2 jobs and this is a day off - but instead I"ll just take a shower do some grocery shopping and start my day :)... Maybe MORE cleaning like I did last week hah...The struggle was real but got through it - If I did you can too! Next up I need to learn not to step on a scale every day.. up a pound this week lol...
