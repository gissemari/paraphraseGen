Oye I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. I'm not worried about drinking or relapsing in any way. I'm in a safe place at home (in the boonies) with my family.  I'm just nervous about something. I've been feeling increasingly anxious for the past couple of weeks.  I'm chucking it up to being my first holiday season sober in over ten years but wowzers this anxiety or whatever it is had better settle down because I'm running out of things to clean and cleaning already clean things can't be a good sign!  Ok time to throw the lasagna in the oven! Thanks for reading.  Happy and safe New Year everyone!

I empathize  I get anxiety like that too and it usually doesn't go away until I take a good hard look at what I am upset about. But sometimes I can't figure out what that is!..Happy New Year! Enjoy the lasagna!
Lately for me meditation has been a very effective solution for the restless irritable and discontents.
