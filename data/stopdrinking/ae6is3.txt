Hi everyone. Huge mountain to climb but need to start somewhere. Struggling but trying to take a day at a time.

Whitney Houston's "Step By Step" is my go to song when I'm struggling to keep going if music helps you. Stay strong and good luck!

You're not alone.  I'm on day 4 and struggling too.  Stay with this group.  It really helps!
Thank you so much. I feel isolated and stuck in an unhappy marriage. Your words mean so much at this time
