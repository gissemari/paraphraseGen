I have tried previously to stop drinking but struggle with a partner and friends who cannot comprehend a like without alcohol. This time I feel more determined but I guess that's easy to say on day 1. All advice welcome.

Congratulations what a great choice to make! You can do it...We're always here to support. What I find has helped/is helping me is  getting a badge [here](https://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/) and using the daily thread to check in.
Day 1 for me too although I have previously given up alcohol and annoyingly returned once faced with a few unmanageable life dilemas.  I have been reading Russell Brands Recovery and it is filled with good ideas....the best one I would say is.....1 day at a time.  It seems so much more manageable to not drink for just one day.  Good luck 
If your friends and partner "cannot comprehend a life without alcohol" it may be time to find new friends. The company we keep has a major influence on ourselves. I hang out with people who meet at caf s not bars. Drinking tea or coffee not beer..Your own health and sobriety is more important than being friends with bad influences.
I am back on day one having quit for 18 months previously. I found Jason Vale's quit drinking book enormously helpful in the beginning. I plan to reread it. Good luck!
