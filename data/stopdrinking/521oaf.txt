I can't say I didn't see it coming.  I didn't want it to but always knew it was inevitable.  I have wanted this for so long and am so afraid of failing.  What if I  relapse.....again? What if I can't do it? What am I hiding from? I have been unhappy for so long.  Why am I so unhappy? I have so much work to do on myself.  I have been broken for so long I don't even know if I have all the pieces.

I couldn't give up my alcohol crutch without a lot of outside support from my family &amp; friends psychiatrist and AA. I was surprised at how many people really wanted to help. Actually I still pretty much use the same support system today because it works and I enjoy the company of those involved. You don't have to go through this alone.
Welcome! I totally get everything you are feeling and thinking. I've felt and feel the same but honestly it truly does get better :) .Please stick around it WILL change your life! It's changing mine! 
Take a breath!  ..You've put together 20 days.  There was a time when I worried I couldn't get ONE day.  Then what would I do?..I had to learn to not obsess about the past and not worry about the future.  Was that easy?  NO!..Was it amazing when I did it?  YES!!..There was a post about relapse and the future yesterday at this link [What about after X Time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/520du5/what_happens_when_ive_gone_months_a_year_or_years/)...When I removed the alcohol then I got tools to work on myself...All the pieces are there.  They've just been covered up and numbed...A little time day by day.  With tools and support and fellowship...I got boatloads of that at meetings...Been to some meetings?..Just for today I forgo ONE drink:  The First One...
How young were you when you knew it was inevitable? I reached that point too but further down the line when I tried just stopping on my own and found that I couldn't (what a revelation that was). I relapsed many times and went through many rehabs but I think most people get it way quicker and with less trouble than that. The unhappy thing may later be seen as a gift because who is going to stop and make a change the biggest change of their lives perhaps while they are still happily drinking themselves to death? And if you're like you'll find that while a lot of the pieces were lost none were destroyed all were found and that Humpty-Dumpty CAN be put back together again! :)
