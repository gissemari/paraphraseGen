Didn't even realize until I 'checked in' today that I'm at the 3 month mark. ..Time flies when you're having fun I guess. ..Anyways straight up - for those of you on Day 1 thinking about it struggling to sleep can't imagine your life without it . . . ..I went from 15-18 beers a day to not even thinking about it. ..You can do it.

Congrats on 90 days. Did you use other resources besides SD to get where you are at? AA therapy SMART?
Congratulations! I remember counting days like it was yesterday.  I had stopped counting quite a while ago but then I added a "Clean Time Counter" app to my phone. It has helped remind me that it really is "one day at a time". 
Congratulations...that was a lot of beer...so glad you are with us many need your role model.
Congrats and thanks for the inspiration!
Great post.  Thanks for the positive vibes
Fucking A!!! 
Congratulations on getting to 3 months! I plan to be there at the end of March. I feel like my day count is slowing down post-30. Each day is not celebrated because the likelihood of drinking is getting so low. Somehow 50 feels like a big number bc it is halfway to triple digits. That said sobriety has not quite gotten "automatic" for me yet. I know each day I'm taking that decision. Echo your remarks to those early on. Sobriety is an attainable goal with the support here on r/sd. One day at a time.
