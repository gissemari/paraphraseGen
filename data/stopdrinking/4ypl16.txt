I woke up this morning in a great mood and full of gratitude. I'm just grateful to be sober today. I have an acquaintance that is struggling right now and it makes me glad that I was finally able to put down the booze and get my life together. I love that when something happens good or bad I'm sober and clear headed and able to deal with things easily now. Anyways I'm starting to ramble so I'll just say that I'm very blessed to have found SD because it has been the only thing that's worked for me. Thank you all for being here for me and keeping me out of a bottle today. Peace and good vibes.
