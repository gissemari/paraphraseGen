Been going through some things and the chain reaction of my actions from drinking have gotten the best of me. I spent Christmas today with my family and my girlfriends and all day she had to act like she was happy with me when come tomorrow she will be going back to her parents house and staying there. I made it 11 days and then drank for 4 and today is my first day sober. I want it so bad but I let the daily events get to me and relapse and end up right back to where I am now. I'm having my baby in March and I need to get this done. I know everyone says AA is the first step. But I still feel lost. This is my first post and I'm here for new friends and anything positive I can grasp.

Welcome! This place helped me get sober.  Wishing you the best! You can do this. IWNDWYT 
Happy first post!  I hope it's the first of many.  I've spent so much time reading on this sub my brain can sort of auto-fill what the folks here might say in support when I'm having a tough time.  It's been invaluable.  Glad you pasted and hope it gets easier for you soon.  Also congratulations on the baby!
Welcome. It's going to be okay. AA doesn't have to be the first step in my experience. Relapses are difficult but it helps me to keep coming back and keep recommitting to sobriety. Congratulations on the baby. 
Hiya. Welcome to SD. IWNDWYT   
Welcome friend. Plenty of support understanding and wisdom available here at SD. For me the first step was an honest desire to stop. I had admitted to myself over and over again that I had a problem w/alcohol but no honest desire to stop. Keep coming back. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
