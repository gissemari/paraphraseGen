Hi guys ..I have commented on a post before about how much I hate my life and I decided to finally make a post...I have struggled for 10 years with wine I cringe when I think back to the times I have started arguments embarrassed myself embarrassed my husband and woken up the next day feeling full on anxiety and bloated with no energy. ..I don't know when the turning point for me was but I do recall getting really turned off by my husbands behaviour (he is an alcoholic as well and we enable each other) recently he has been starting fights with me and they don't make any sense he started being so obnoxious about everything that I seriously thought "wow you are AWFUL"!!! ..We don't move forward in life and something in me just snapped. I have had enough. I know looks aren't everything but I have gained at least 25kgs over the years and have turned into a bloated blobby mess and I hate my body. I know what I can look like and now I just have zero confidence and am stuck... Seems vain I know but I kind of just gave up on myself.. You know? ..I haven't had a drink for two days and neither has my husband we went to bed early both weeknights and today I woke up happy with all my dogs in bed and my husband next to me he woke up happy too and we were laughing this morning.. I can't remember the last time that happened but I finally felt like we could beat this we CAN do it we CAN have a good life. We DONT need booze because it is destroying us...We might fall off the wagon we might not but I want to savour this renewed energy and positive thinking we have for as long as I can and I hope I am strong enough to say "no" to a drink the next time I feel like one. ..Thanks for reading guys! This is a bit all over the place but I do log on here everyday to read your stories and you have given me hope and inspired me xo

I know you can do it and move your lives forward.  So many people on here have.  Your both going to have to dig up some fight to beat this but it's worth it!  Great job so far.
What a wonderful share. Thanks for posting it! Hang in there. I quit with my wife too and it made our relationship all the stronger.
