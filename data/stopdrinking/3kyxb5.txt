I'm really struggling this evening. Ive had the kids by myself for four days and my hubs just got home and I want so badly to have "a glass of wine" which obviously will be the whole economy size bottle. Or half of a box.  I'm mad at everything right now and feel like crying because I can't just be "normal." I hate this. But I won't drink.

Hang in!  Can you get outside for a quick walk or even stand in the back yard/front yard/driveway and take 10 slow deep breaths?  A change of scenery and adding some oxygen back to my system always helps me.  You already know that drinking will just make things worse since "a glass of wine" doesn't exist in our world.  You can do this!
I've had plenty of those days.  Just hit the pillow sober and tomorrow is a new day!!!
update: so so glad I did not cave last night. The three hours of grumpiness was with waking up sober. I can't believe I almost lost all 5 days of sobriety for one lousy night of getting drunk feeling like crap forgetting the events of the evening sleeping on the couch until probably like 1:00 then crawling up to bed and waking up wondering if I did anything stupid the night before. Maybe I will be crabby again tonight maybe not. But I have 6 days under my belt. I'm not gonna screw this up. As one redditor on this sub said to me "you can't let your life be ruled by geometry filled with alcohol." So again I will say "Not today wine cube not today!"
