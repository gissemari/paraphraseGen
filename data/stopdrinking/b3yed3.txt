I have been struggling on and off for years with alcohol addiction.   Vodka has always been my go to and recently it's become so easy to drink that I was polishing a bottle of Ketel in one evening and looking for more.   I got so tired of waking up and finding things I had done the night before in full blackout mode.  Entire Netflix series I'd watch and not remember I had watched them. Finding half eaten food all over. Cigarette butts etc.....I quit very recently and it had been very hard to say the least ... but there is one thing that helps me I'd like to share .....When I'm feeling tempted to numb out I listen to the song  Happier  by Marshmello featuring Bastille.  I know it sounds corny but if you listen to the lyrics and picture the singer as a bottle of vodka it really hits home.  Every lyric is spot on to why I need to be done with booze.   To anyone dealing with the temptation ... try listening to this song and picture the alcohol of your choice being the singer.   It gets me choked up every time but it really resonates ... ..Just thought I'd share....Love this community and IWNDWYT...

I do the same thing with my anxiety/depression/self doubts- that song is so well written :)
