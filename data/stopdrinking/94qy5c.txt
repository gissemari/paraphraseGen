Is anyone else facing this problem? r/stopdrinking has been such a major part of my recovery but now I'm coming to terms with my addiction to Reddit. It's like I'm playing the "shell game" with my addiction. Moving the ball around from booze to cookies to video games to Reddit...fuuuuuuck. I just went over to r/nosurf for the first time. The parallels between this sub and that sub are pretty amazing. It's FULL of helpful tips. I would encourage anyone who seems to be struggling with this same problem to go check it out. Anyway...my rant is over. As always: thank you beautiful people for being here. IWNDWYT

I'm sorry I just can't bring myself to see how an addiction to information in the information age is nearly as debilitating as copious consumption of a class 1 carcinogen concluding casketization. 
I hear ya Papi...as I did with alcohol I am now in taper down mode. I truly love SD and use it as a major branch of my support system. I will continue to be a regular here but no more sitting in front of screen for hours on end. I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace
I try to set limits for myself like 15 minute rules. I totally hear you--it's really easy to spend all your free time on your phone! Signing off now hah!
Yeah i get this I am such a procrastinator and alcohol was a great way to procrastinate. Now I'm spending way too much free time online instead albeit mostly lurking on here so maybe thats not so bad after all it seems to be working.
Good that your getting support...Just remeber no one has yet been charged with DUIR....  *Driving Under Influence of Reddit*....   ;D
Yup. Real problem. "Every form of refuge has its price."  Good luck! 
Yes!  Check email Reddit SD twitter facebook news repeat.  I'm going over to nosurf now.
