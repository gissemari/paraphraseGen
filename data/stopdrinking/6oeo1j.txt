I've drank 3 days out of the last 7. You're the only ones I can tell. Friends and family are 100% behind me on this quitting drinking thing and I've failed. Didn't even make it 2 weeks. I just posted in my local SD subreddit for recommendations for places for therapy/meds. I can't do this alone. I just... I love that buzzed feeling. I would love to take up weed instead as it's legal in my state but my job drug tests and I love my job and can't take that risk. I just don't know what to do...I know relapse isn't a rare phenomenon. And I know I can go several days without drinking. I also know I can't do moderation because I will slip right back into drinking every day...I read this sub all day at work and when I get home. It's a huge help. I just can't trust myself to not buy alcohol when I can afford it. I don't know how to get over that. I'm also reading This Naked Mind at work and hopefully I'll get to a point where things click and I understand why drinking is bad. But I'm not there yet...Please any help or inspiration would be great. A family member almost died from alcohol and probably needs a liver transplant. I don't want to go down that road. I need to be here for my child. I would love to keep drinking to special occasions like holidays and birthdays but I know I would just keep drinking afterwards. I need it out if my life and I don't know how to just not buy alcohol...In sorry that I have failed. I can't even request a badge reset at this time. I didn't drink tonight (no money) but I get paid tomorrow and don't know how to stop myself from heading to the liquor store or 7-11 after work...Please... Help me...
