I couldn't find any reason to go keep going felt depressed and only could think of having a drink. Altough I was actively avoiding this subreddit I remembered some phrases in particular these two: ''If you walk through hell keep walking"and "This too will pass." So I decided to keep walking and take it one day a time. I picked up This Naked Mind had a talk with my therapist and here I am happy and confident and reading all your posts again. Thank you all and please keep walking.

Awesome congrats on 11 months!..You're well on the way to a whole year - keep up the good work!!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
it's encouraging to hear even that close to a year you still get tested but preservere! I surmise it's like a marriage or raising kids....you never get to cross the finish line....it's work everyday.. hence: one day at a time. Thanks for the post. .I won't drink with you today.
