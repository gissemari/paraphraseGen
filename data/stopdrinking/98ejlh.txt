Woke up on this beautiful Saturday in a very pissy mood.  I soon realized that I had a dream full of chaos and intermittent drinking on my part. The dream scenes featured me in sketchy unsafe places even a bar my father frequented.  At one point I told my brother I had relapsed and he was his usual judgmental self.  As I sit here processing this dream I am struck with the thought that my actual drinking life was also a very bad dream that I struggled to wake up from.  Cheers to a Sober Saturday everyone!!

Sober Saturdays are amazing!! IWNDWYT  
You're right!  My real life was like a bad dream compared to now being sober!  Phew!  Glad I'm out   
I had the same type of dream last night! I dreamt I got drunk alone in my room and was so ashamed of myself for blowing my sobriety. I remember being ashamed that I got drunk alone as well and that I blew it  for no reason . I woke up to find out it was just a dream but also to the realization that drinking alone in my room was so common before and now I realize how sad that reality was. Yay sober Saturday :)
