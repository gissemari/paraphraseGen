So tomorrow makes three weeks!  On tuesday of this week I had a little friendsgiving here at my condo and it ended up being around 20 people.  Most of my friends drink and most of them don't know that I have completely quit.  Anyway at the end of the night everyone left and the next morning I woke up and opened the fridge.  Oh shit there's like 20 beers in here!  I have to admit it crossed my mind when I ran out of milk that a beer should would be great with breakfast.  It was just a fleeting thought though and I went to work and came home and last night I opened the fridge only again to be surprised by the beer.  In my laziness I just overlooked it and made my dinner and didn't give it any more thought.  This morning I got up to make breakfast and this time when I opened the fridge I couldn't help but laugh.  It just felt strange to open the fridge and see the beer there again.  This time I gathered the 20 some odd beers and put them in the extra room in the condo.  I guess I just came here to say that I am profoundly greatful to the reaction that I've had to the booze in my fridge.  ...I know that a lot of you do not believe in God.  And I know many of you rely on God to get you through each day.  My feelings about God in general for the past decade have been that of estrangement.  I've always believed in God but have struggled to understand why I've had to experience what I have.  This may sound strange but as far as my struggles are concerned I no longer wonder why.  I am just happy waking up every morning with a clear head and the confidence that I'm going to walk through each day without the need or desire to drink that each day I can build up myself and others around me and I can go to sleep with true peace about my future.  That feels good and I don't really know who to thank for that except God because whatever switch that was flipped in me doesn't feel like it came completely from within.  So I am thankful to God for that.  ...I am also thankful for all of you SD.  Transcending personal philosophy and theology you are a great community full of encouragement and true thoughtfulness.  I hope you all are strong for yourselves and for those you love throughout the holidays.  Safe travels and peace of mind.
