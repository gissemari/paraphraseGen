I feel so thankful to have found this group being able to check in read share and identify with others is unquestionably helping my recovery. ..I had  drank consistently for the last 20+ years since my teen years some binge-ing some sociable some wreckless and lots of other forms of drinking in between (secret drinking was probably the worst of all and no doubt done most and many forms of damage). There was a point when I couldn't imagine life without alcohol now I am trying on a daily basis to envision a life without all the ills and problems it brought. .I am heartened at how quickly I feel positive change occur thoughts are clearer energy is returning and my sharp whit which had been absent for so long is becoming obvious to friends and colleagues again. ..I have been broken I have been damaged I have hurt others I was unreliable and irresponsible and at times could not see a way out. But today I am hopeful hopeful of a better clearer and more fulfilled life without alcohol. ..I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this community and secondly to anyone who is struggling -  stay hopeful  - if I can go 20 years a drunk and achieve 20 days sober ..Anyone can.........Thank you ..Chris

Congratulations &amp; best wishes!
Congratulations on 20 days.  The first few weeks were the toughest for me.  I too had to break decades of habit to let in even a little light... but it's getting brighter every day! I will not drink with you today. 
Thank you! After 20 years I'm hoping to reach 20 days too soon. This sub is this best.
