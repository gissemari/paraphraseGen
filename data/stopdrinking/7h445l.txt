Passed the 100-day mark.  My big takeaway so far is how many more hours in the day there are when alcohol is removed from the equation.  I can't emphasize this enough.  The other big takeaway is that alcohol was negatively affecting my health even on days I didn't drink.  My body was struggling constantly - I realize this now.  Even if I went a few days in between drinking I still didn't feel ok on a deep level.  This has been going on for 20+ f'ing years.  100 days later my sensory perception is back to where it was when I was a teen.  I'm middle-aged now so I haven't instantly lost a significant amount of weight but the bloating is gone. Physically I feel more energy than I've had since I was a teen.   .  What's worked super well for me is having fizzy canned drinks in my fridge at all times.  You'll be shocked at how well this works if you are a "can person" alcohol drinker.  My thing is drinking out of can wrapped in a foam "cozy".  I can still do that just not cans of beer.  Feels very natural..     What also worked is not worrying about starting on a significant day.  .     When cravings hit I refuse to think about them. Who says I have to think about them?  Thinking about cravings just opens the doors to negotiation and nostalgia.  .     Another word of advice to women (guys cover your eyes) - don't quit when you have PMS.  Wait a few days..     That's all for now.  Good night and good luck.

Congrats!...I agree with the fizzy drink/mocktail thing. Made a world of difference for me. I experiment with different combinations all the time and it seems to weaken the urge to drink alcohol. I was a beer drinker so soda water has been a life saver.
