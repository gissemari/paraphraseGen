I read a lot of posts and comments on here asking how to deal with the things we have done in the past specifically while drinking. This is something I have struggled with too usually while laying in bed and drifting off to sleep a memory will pop up that will make me cringe myself inside out. How could I have done those things? What the hell was wrong with me? ..Just yesterday I was listening to the Comedy Bang Bang podcast and Scott Silverman the host was talking to another comedian about their dreams and aspirations when they first got into the Comedy game. Basically Scott said he originally wanted to see his name painted on the side of the club he started out at but now that he has achieved success he wouldn't want that at all. He was basically cringing at the thought of that being his goal. That's when he pointed out that being able to look back and realize that something he did was incredibly stupid but means that he's grown as a person. ..I thought it was a great example of how I try to frame my regrets. I can only cringe at these memories because I learned from them and became a better person that would hopefully never make those mistakes again. I hope this helps someone out there. Stay sober SD.
