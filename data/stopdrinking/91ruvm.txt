Unabashedly looking for congratulations and pats on the back. I have been struggling for years and years with a heavy habit. Last night I took the reins and only consumed half of my regular. I went to bed and fell asleep peacefully as opposed to all-at-once and feel good this morning. ..It's not perfectly where I want to be but the fact that I exerted some control makes me happy. Thanks for listening!
