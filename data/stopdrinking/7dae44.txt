 I've bounced around the program for years. I keep my distance from people in the program because when I was new a bunch of people hurt my feelings. It felt like middle school. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't spiritual. That's a very inarticulate and immature explanation.... But in a lot of ways I still am stuck in the emotional mindset of a child. ..I'm coming up on almost a year sober finally.  My sponsor fired me. I'm depressed. Like clinically seriously crying for hours and laying in bed. Depressed. .. I was testing her. But it wasn't about willingness or because I thought the program didn't work. It was fear. A lot of fear. That what happened would indeed happen. I know  I set it in motion and pushed her away and that she's human and was not obligated to help me in the least...but it felt like it was more she just didn't want to deal with  me and it felt punitive.  It took me a long long time to be brave enough to try again.  I'm terrified of relapse...but at the same time. I don't want to be open with anyone...but this isolation will only lead me back to relapse. I need to figure out how to separate the fellowship from the program. People are flawed. The steps are not. I know this but still.....I also am really struggling to connect to a higher power. Obviously. ...

Looks like you have good or at the very least some insight in how your own mechanisms of contact in this case work into the bigger picture...To push away to not be pushed away to cause that what we fear is a well known human defense mechanism. Call it testing call it preventive action. It's something we all every human have to work with and through. Nothing weird about you there...A good way to approach this for me is to not go either/or. I try to combine my apprehensiveness with knowing I may also win. It's not black or white. And the more negative the scenarios in my head are the more likely they're false. Or: if predicting the future why not make positive scenarios?..So open up with the caution that you may get hurt by someone sometime while knowing that opening up also will provide you the opportunity to find a rewarding contact with someone sometime...As for a higher power -- I think that's how it is supposed to be. It's a push-pull type of relationship where sometimes we need and ask sometimes we thank and sometimes we blame...It helps me to think about God (substitute with "higher power" if that word makes you uncomfortable) as limited by the free will of people. I love for God to be a wizard waving a magic wand to make things happen -- but I realize that in many ways God *wishes* for the best of people *wants* the best for people but can't *make* people do the best. ..Meanwhile whether it comes to the program or higher power we're all here for you.
