I've been struggling a bit recently. Have huge finals coming up but I'm also very depressed. Studying every day is a battle and my concentration is off. Then I feel guilty and like I am  broken.  I decided pretending I'm not depressed was making things worse and recently confided in my mom. She was encouraging and I'm trying to move forwards...It feels like when I was drinking functioning through my day to day commitments was almost easier in a weird way. Now I'm not hiding from my emotions and past traumatic stuff but it takes ongoing time and energy to process. However I notice I'm not as anxious and I feel more grounded and clearer. ..A few days ago I got the flu shot (one of my teachers advised all students to do it to avoid falling sick during the exams). I expected to feel bad after but it is still really annoying that I'm doubly tired and kind of shaky. At least I like the new doctor I saw to get it and after finals I plan to see him again and check my thyroid out. I'm scared to do anything till then because treatment takes a bit of adjustment supposedly and adding in new stuff before the tests scares me. I have an autoimmune thyroid disorder that has never required medication but is supposed to be monitored yearly. As part of anxiety and drinking too much I haven't checked it in about five years. At that point it had been consistently normal for over ten years but I don't know why I stopped monitoring. If that is okay but I'm still having depression I'm going to inquire about antidepressants. Tried them in the past with limited help but I was still drinking then. I don't know why just deciding to address all this stuff is so hard. I feel exhausted all the time.

Feeling exhausted all the time prompted a physician visit  for me - it actually was low thyroid and was an easy fix...Hang in there and IWNDWYT.
Awareness of the distance between the grey state and your real self is heartbreaking. Exhausting. It takes more plates spinning with self-care and self-work for us to reach baseline peace than it does for some. We have to work very hard at the same time we feel impossible and incapable. But it *is* possible and the short straw can still be turned gold. I have seen it...For me it takes: overcoming a major life-threatening addiction doing daily self work seeing a doctor seeing a therapist doing a daily mental health practice of either meditation or yoga or the like daily exercise decent diet and probably supplements group support here or in some form therapeutic or somatic bodywork and a creative practice. Also we have to keep a roof over our heads and care for others through all this. This is not a light schedule. Let's be honest about that. Let's be compassionate about it...I don't have any solutions or shortcuts to offer and I haven't worked very far down the transformational to-do list I just want to acknowledge that this is A LOT and it's really hard work and it takes a ton of patience and heart. I want to acknowledge that we are all willing to go this hard way for something sacred and that it is honorable and meaningful. It is brave. It will work. And it will be okay.
