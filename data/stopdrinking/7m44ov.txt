I remember hearing a prayer when I was a kid that went something like "... and a prayer for all those who have no one else to pray for them."..20+ years later that line still sticks with me. I'm not particularly religious but I have nothing against those who are. And in that spirit I'd like to offer my own quick thought:..---..On this my first Christmas sober in a long while I'm thankful that I'm present in this moment. I'll not dwell on the pain from the past but rather appreciate the support of everyone here at SD...This Christmas has been scary for me. I feel out of place and uncomfortable. Like a screw up and a weirdo. But most importantly I now know in my gut that I can get through the holidays without drinking...I hope and pray that everyone out there struggling with alcohol knows they aren't alone. Better futures are possible. ***Better futures are well within reach.*** Those folks whether they're lurking here now or far away from SD are in my thoughts. ***I'm*** in my own thoughts this evening. I hope with everything in me that we all find lasting happiness and sobriety...---..Not drinking with you today! ~xJT

And thank you for supporting all of us.  It's sad to think that some people have no one else to pray for them.  That's a profound and sobering thought...Thanks for sharing.
