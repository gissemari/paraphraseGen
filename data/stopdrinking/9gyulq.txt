I have a job interview scheduled for 7 later this week (I normally work 9:30-6:00 so this is unusually early for me). I'm pumped about the interview and I texted a friend about it noting that "the only downside.... interview is at 7am." They didn't respond to anything else in the text and just said "I swear to god if you stay up late and get drunk the night before..." ..&amp;#x200B;..Feels fucking bad man. I mean *I* know how much I'm struggling. I guess I thought that somehow magically no one else was aware of what a shitshow my life has become. Yeah I've sent him drunk-texts and made a fool of myself and obviously he had some inkling. We've always laughed it off.  But it really hurts knowing that my friend genuinely doubts my ability to succeed at something very important to me because of my addiction to alcohol. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've been operating under this fantasy that I was (convincingly) compartmentalizing this part of my life. I live alone and I do most of my drinking alone where no one can see it (because we're not really drinking to enjoy it at this point are we?) But clearly I'm not managing my brand as well as I thought I was. ..&amp;#x200B;..How many other people are starting to have their doubts about me? ..&amp;#x200B;..I really want to be better than this. I just have to want it more than I "want" my next drink.

Hey!  This could be the marker of a Virtuous Upward Spiral!
We are always the last to know. .Do the next right thing. .Don't drink. Go to the interview. See what happens.
