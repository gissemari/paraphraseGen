Well I got a new job after leaving my toxic work environment about a month ago that ultimately led to me having a HUGE relapse. I've been sober a week now and I'm sleeping better and life is just good. It's supposed to rain tonight which actually makes me happy because rain is my absolute favourite weather. ...Just a few nights ago I was super depressed but you know what? I didn't drink. And I'm not drinking tonight either :)

Excellent!!
Great news! I will celebrate with you by not drinking tonight and also enjoying the rain.
