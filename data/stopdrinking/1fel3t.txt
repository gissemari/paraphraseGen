I got in a spat with my spouse.  We're generally pretty low conflict.  I was struggling with my daughter this morning.  She and I are similar in temperament so we clash more often than I'd like...Spouse started giving me parenting advice and I snapped.  I said "Well since you know so much I'll leave you to it and just go to work." He said he'd get the kids ready and drop them off the summer camp bus. Then I gathered my things and slammed the door on the way out.  I cried in the car on the way to work...I'm not sure why I had such an explosive (for me) reaction.  I thought writing it out might help. I think he was trying to help and I took it as criticism.  I do the majority of the parenting so when I got what felt like criticism I had this flash of "How dare you!" cross my mind.  I think I also felt a bit of fear because although quitting drinking has made me a better person I was kinda sorta thinking quitting drinking would make me a GREAT person ALL the time.  Which is pretty silly...I'm still feeling a bit sniffly and it's been a couple of hours.  Thanks for letting me vent.
