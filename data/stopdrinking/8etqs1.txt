I have a lot of things going on in my life... My wife and I are separated due to my drinking habits depression and anxiety. I recently 3 weeks ago started outpatient treatment for alcohol. I've used alcohol for the last 13 years to cope with everyday struggles (mostly depression anxiety related.) I didn't drink everyday but when I did it was until I blacked out and became a monster. I get very angry when I drink. So I have admitted to myself that I have a problem and started outpatient treatment. I am having a very hard time being sober due to being separated and my wife wanting to go through with the divorce. Her constant need to ask me when we are going to finalize it is driving me more close to saying screw it and hit the bottle. I recently told her to stop bringing it up and let me get through treatment so i am not so tempted to start drinking again. I have been sober for just over a month. It has not gotten an easier to not drink so far. In the back of my mind I keep thinking once I get divorced I am going to give up on sobriety and hopefully just drink myself to jail/death. The other half of me wants to continue sobriety and see if I can actually get over all this shit going on. So my question is do you think I can keep down the sober path and never drink again with my current situation of divorce right around the corner? I feel as though I can't and I will ultimately turn into a worse pissed off drunk than I was prior and I am scared of what i will do. She also drinks every weekend and is out partying flirting/ sleeping with other men which is driving me insane.

Man one of the things I was most worried about in getting sober was that I would turn into a "dry drunk" ..Thankfully this hasnt happened. But its not by accident. I knew that in order to avoid becoming a dry drunk I was going to have to do a lot more than just not drink. Drinking was a symptom of larger problems that I had. I've had to be intentional. I've had to sit and think about what I want in life and what is important to me and I've had to come up with a game plan to accomplish it. ..I think working some type of program can be really beneficial. Some people do AA some people do SMART recovery. Personally I really like Refuge Recovery but there are many different options. There is no one way to walk the path of sobriety...Can you do it? Absolutely.
I agree with Jonah. I had to find really strong reason to motivate me to stay sober because I could see myself just saying Fuck it who cares. Case in point two deaths of good friends this week but I already realized that life can be cruel and I don't want to drink myself to death. So going to funerals - huge triggers sober. Anyway death by alcohol is not how I want to be remembered. I also remember that everytime I go down the drowning myself with alcohol path it gets harder to stop. I've been in very similar situations as yours and not wanting them to win by destroying myself kept me sober. I mean sometimes I was able to use my anger constructively and not turn it in on myself. Hope this helps.
