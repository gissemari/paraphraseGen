I relapsed last night. I couldn't stand the anxiety and I could not stop thinking about my girl. I woke up drunk and couldn't go to work. Im sober now. I have no other reason to not got to a rehab program now. I'm going to check myself in after my sponsor gets off work. ..I love you all and thank you for all your support over these last few days. I'll see y'all in 30 days.

I'm so sorry. I know all too well about using alcohol to calm your anxiety. Best of luck at detox and I hope you're able to see a therapist when you're done. Start working on getting that anxiety under control. IWNDWYT
