Just one of the little benefits I've noticed during this point of my sobriety is that i'm finding it easier to make friends. I've seen on SD some people talk of struggling to socialise without alcohol so thought i would just offer my experience as a positive way to look at this. ..I do a lot of casual bar work where theres lots of new faces coming and going. Usually I would be barely keeping myself stood up with such a bad hangover that having a real conversation with anyone was the last thing on my mind. ..Now with a fresh and quickened mind i'm finding it so much easier and fun to meet new people. Really enjoying laughing again real laughing real feelings.

I know how you feel . I'm starting to be more present at work. Im a server. The hangovers seemed to put a vail over my face. Plus the hands shaking.. I relized the other night how great to place a martini without fear of loosing it. And just loosing the guilt of the secret life of a drunk. For me its a great beginning to a fuller richer life with the human race. Glad someone else shares that with me. Onward we go!!!! Our faces out in the open no vails!
That's wonderful. I laughed so hard my sides ached today. Felt so good. Feelings aren't all bad.
