Dum spiro spero   While I breath I hope.   Even though I struggle through each day and remember that one day it shall be my last I am still breathing.  With every breath I take I acknowledge the hope that exists just by being alive.  This life of mine is precious.  It is the only one like it ever to exist.  Other's may have similar experiences but this life will never be repeated.  Each sunrise is beautiful but no more beautiful than the sunset.  No door can close without opening another.  No breath sweeter than this one.

Love this.
Very nice.
I'm saving this. This is beautiful. 
Thank you for the positive feedback.  The first part is a quote in Latin.  The rest was written by Depressed Drunk Phil late at night trying to remind myself of the way out.
