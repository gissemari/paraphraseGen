I've been pretty good overall for the last few weeks minus the last 2 days and today I'm on EDGE over the day and am trying EVERYTHING from mediating to walking dogs to yoga to chill out and all I want to do is enjoy the day away from everyone and everything in a bar having drinks. Having to deal with life sober is so hard but I KNOW it's way harder not sober. It's crazy how my mind tells me it's easier drinking but I know better. Been at this along time. Any suggestions on calming down with this anxiety would be great. #IWNDWYT even though struggling!

This will pass. I was a mood swinging mess for the first bit. I would just always take time for myself. Even 5 minutes to breathe and kind of process what and why I felt that way. It's hard when you get fed up with the feelings but you can get through this  ..I will not drink with you today 
Look up post acute withdrawal syndrome it will help you understand where these feelings come from. Understanding that it isn't something you can change helped me to accept it and just take it real easy when I am feeling irritatedanxious and annoyed. There was an awesome post on here linking to an article on it. It is the top post on r/SDSouthAfrica. Hope it helps. Great job on the 15 days! IWNDWYT
