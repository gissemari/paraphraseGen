I went for my first therapy session today and boy did we cover alot of stuff. I have had quite a stressful month surprisingly it began when I made the decision to quit drinking. I was tired of spending hours trying to figure out ways to taper and I had essentially convinced myself that my problem with alcohol was physical dependence. And that I was continuing to drink because it wasn't safe for me to attempt to quit on my own. ..So after speaking to my doctor we chose to do an outpatient detox at home. Within 5 days of finishing a 4 day benzo detox stressors arose and I chose to drink again trying to cope with them. ..I came off of that drinking span of a few days and dealt with the nausea and night sweats and not sleeping well which was nothing as bad as I had been afraid of. Essentially a two day hangover. Another stressful event another relapse and now another attempt to get myself sorted... And I have just chosen to do that again because I now have realized- I was making excuses why I couldn't do it. And I wasn't even truly attempting to try. I didn't even try to go without drinking because I had convinced myself I couldn't...Coming to this realization is a huge step forward in realizing why I'm ready to take control of this...This has been the first time I have felt like I control my drinking not that it controls me. ..Little victories. I will not drink today- and I don't NEED to drink today.
