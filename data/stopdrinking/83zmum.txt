I'm watching the third season and I just yelled NO MICKEY at the tv. Now I feel a bit foolish. She is at a bar with two friends the friends went out to smoke and she impulsively ordered a vodka tonic...It's a good show. She is a 30ish alcoholic recovering relapsing recovering well in this season (so far).

I like the scene where the AA members encourage the fatuous radio show host to get real. It may be bit cartoonish but the show does a pretty good PR job for 12-step programs.
What is the show called? 
We need to write judd apatow and ask for season 4. Its apparently the last season :(
Fuuuu spoiler alert :[
Tried to like this show but man there is not one likeable character at all. They're all jerks.
My wife and I just started the series.  Good show!
I just finished all 3 seasons in a couple days. I really really liked it! ..And I'm also sad I will have to wait however long now for the next season!
