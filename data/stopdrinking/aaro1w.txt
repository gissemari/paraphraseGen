It's around the 45 day mark that I start to get shaky. It really doesn't help that New Year's Eve is coming up which is basically the olympics of drinking for my friend group. So instead of spending $30 out drinking on Monday night I spent $30 on books at the half priced books sale. I bought a few self help books and some about recovery. The funny thing is that I felt embarrassed standing in the  Psychology-Addiction  section. I kept looking around making sure I didn't know anyone or to check that no one was staring at me. I didn't buy as many as I'd like because I was worried the cashier would judge me. It's pretty silly to feel embarrassed about buying a book that will help keep me sober but feel perfectly fine whenever I'd buy booze. ..Instead of a wine glass I'll raise my book and mug to you all. Hope you're enjoying your sober Saturday.
