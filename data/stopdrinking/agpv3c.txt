Just a little mush for you all today and some self appreciation. I'm not glorifying the struggle but rather saying I've never met a stronger more resilient bullheaded dogged group of dreamers that could hit the rockiest of bottoms again and again and still get up and say FUCK YOU LIZARD BRAIN. I choose life!..Love and respect to you all. IWNDWYT.

Ha!  I guess we all are pretty much characters with crazy stories to tell.  IWNDWYT 
You talking bout me. Thank you love     
I hear ya. I feel so lucky to have been able to meet so many wonderful people through rehab and detox stays... I would have never met such a diverse mix of genuine people ever in my life if it weren't for my own experience with addiction. I have so much respect for people struggling with and recovering from substance abuse. 
Thank you fellow mush head IWNDWYTD
I hear you. I've finally found my tribe!
Even when I peed in the closet and passed out at the table at dinner time...Thanks you for the support but IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
 Fuck you lizard brain  is my new mantra!
Love this!!!

Aayyyye yeah man.  Fuck booze fuck weakness own your life luv y'all keep yo head up fuck that shit.  
Here here is more empathy more kindness to strangers and more listening and not talking all through a common struggle than anywhere on the interweb in my humble opinion.
Could not agree more!
