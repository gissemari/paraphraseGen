Hi r/stopdrinking...I've finally made the decision to address my problem. It's been about 18 hours since my last drop and I'm struggling a bit with withdrawal. I got next to no sleep last night and I'm feeling hot flushes in my hands. Is this normal? I guess I just want some reassurance and support. I've been attending both AA and have been receiving counselling sessions but it's been a struggle...I will not drink today!

Day 2 for me and a bit shaky and sleepless as well so I feel ya...I will not drink today with you!
Hey welcome Aboard! ..That sounds pretty normal certainly if you are chemically dependent on alcohol (as I was) then there are various symptoms you might expect to encounter over the next few days of drying out.....This [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_withdrawal_syndrome) was quite useful for me to learn about what is happening physically and I also sought help from my doctor to check my blood pressure and was prescribed something to help ease the withdrawals and make sure I was doing it safely so I'm really glad I made the appointment... ..I also documented some of my withdrawal symptoms in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6kof2x/all_aboard_for_the_emotional_rollercoaster_ding/) on about day 2 or so.....I'm so glad I pushed through it and nearly 10 days in now I feel better than I've felt in years......Hang in there you can do this!..Stick around and let us know how you're getting on?..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Random suggestion I remembered myself tonight. Sleep on a towel. Helps with the sweats and temperature fluctuations that being cold from sweat can cause. Not sure if that's part of your problem but night sweats are common and this helped my insomnia a bit. 
It is "normal." Happened to me and it's miserable. I really feel your pain. Just get through these first few days as they are mentally the worst. ..I wish you the very best of luck.
