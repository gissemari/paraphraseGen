I officially started this "seriously" on March 1st.  ..The big voice told me it would be difficult but it was important.  ..The little voice told me "Fair enough we have done this before.  Let's give it a couple of days and we can have a relapse or two and see how it goes."..Somewhere along the lines it didn't happen.  ..This morning little voice "Woohoo the weekend let's have an 'accident'!"..Big voice "Nice try jackass not with 24 days in."  Sounds like I missed the boat.  :-)..It helps to be sleeping like the dead and not waking up in a cold pool of something.
