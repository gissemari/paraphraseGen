Hello sobernauts...I must admit the past couple of weeks have been among the most difficult so far. I've been reading about the pink cloud and Paws recently. It appears I have been evicted from the lush green parks of the pink cloud and am now residing in the difficult dangerous part of town: Paws street. .Luckily for me there are some great and inspirational people who live here with me and the sense of community here is 2nd to none...So I've been struggling but I played the tape forward did some exercise and reached out to a loved one. I did not drink and I got my 4 stars today. I just want to send my love and respect to anyone who is having a difficult time right now (and maybe doesn't have a comprehensive support system). ..I am 4 months sober today and I'm grateful. Thank you SD for showing me the way...Stay strong folks and keep fighting the good fight.

Congrats on 4 months! I've never really stopped long enough to get to the "pink cloud" phase before. I've had truly awesome moments in the past couple weeks but then it's back to the struggle. We're all different and are going to experience sobriety in our own ways. Nothing in life is guaranteed pink clouds included. But the fact that you worked through it and here you are now is very inspiring to me.
Thank you for posting! Today when I'm having thoughts of drinking (and I will) I'm going to use this to push those thoughts away!..I will not drink with you today.
