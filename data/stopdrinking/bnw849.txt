I just want to come on here and tell you that you are not alone. Thousands of us struggle with alcohol daily...It's especially difficult for people like me who are in the beginnings of their journey and alcohol seems to just be thrusted in your face almost daily. As I type this watching the Raptors vs 76ers I've seen a few beer commercials... ..Luckily I haven't really been paying attention too much to the ads as I have been reading "The Naked Mind". It was recommended to me to read this book when I first posted on this sub. Hopefully you or whoever is reading this and is new to this; I definitely recommend this book. ..Anyways the alcohol ads are everywhere!!! And it's frustrating but you have to remind yourself that you are finally awake. I realize now that we have been systematically programmed since we were children to want alcohol. Almost as if we were groomed for it. ..But look at everyone on here struggling to stop it? And look at all the success stories on this sub reddit alone. I'm proud of each and everyone of you for being here and not drinking with me tonight.
