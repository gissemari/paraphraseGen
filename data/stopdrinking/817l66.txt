I had (another) relapse over Xmas/New Year's which is happily almost 7 weeks behind me. I'm grateful in that time frame I've avoided drinking several times and am still going strong. I am hopeful that sobriety will stick this time...More recently I noticed I'm having a hard time passing up junk food and candy. Turning away junk food is hard in a way that reminds me of how hard it has been to turn away alcohol. Its sure nice to get up in the morning where my only regret is eating a little too much. I'm grateful to be a father and husband with a sweet tooth and waist a little thicker than I would like rather than something worse...There was a time when I didn't think I would ever be able to recover to this point. To any of you struggling with alcohol I wish for you to come share my current problems instead. ..High class problems. ..First things First. Easy does it. Please share my peanut M&amp;Ms.

I see your M and Ms and offer you a tin full of haribo and toffees (the purest sugar hit I can get my hands on!). Here's to thick waistlines but not thick heads
The sweet tooth is a very common side effect.  I ate chocolate cake today when I'm notoriously the person who always says "no" to sweets.  Not anymore!
I have nightly weakness for Ben &amp; Jerry's.  Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. You are not alone in your vulnerability to sugar.  Good job on your 32 days!
Someone once said in a meeting in January that it's called the Bermuda Triangle of relapse Thanksgiving Christmas &amp; .New Years Eve..I eat a ton of candy went to the dentist in December and shocked I didn't have cavities!.
