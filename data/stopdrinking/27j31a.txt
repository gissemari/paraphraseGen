I know it's way too early to be testing my resolve like this but last night I ended up at three bars.  This includes my neighborhood bar that I used to frequent (that one where everyone knows your name... yeah it's just like that)...Part of why I was previously hesitant to stop drinking all together was because I was worried I would lose friends or not get as much social time. I hung out with a friend that I frequently drank with (we do lots of other things but also did lots of drinking together)...She wanted to go for a drink and I obliged.  I had ginger ale and club soda. No urge to drink whatsoever no flack from anyone and no feeling left out.  We went to the three bars we used  to always hit up...I don't think I'll be doing it again anytime soon because it's still so early on and I wanted to get more settled in this new way of thinking before I put myself up to a challenge like that.  But I'm glad it went well and it wasn't a struggle at all...Score one for double-digit sober days!.
