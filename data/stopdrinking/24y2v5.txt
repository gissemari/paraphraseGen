Way to go with the party NMBP!  They can be tough...Triumph: Life is great.  I've been playing a ton of tennis been running a bit and am totally enjoying myself.  We got together with some friends over the weekend and had a ball too...Struggle: I've got nothing!..General chat: Half marathon this weekend.  Looking forward to it but a little nervous.
Long time no see everyone...Triumph #1 : I've been to a pub with friends no desire to have beer...Triumph #2 : There's a bottle of wine open at home that was given to us as a super late wedding gift; my wife has been having it slowly (well reasonably I guess) and I don't even want to touch the thing. I also don't like the way her breath smells after she's had it but she doesn't have to know that!..Struggle : I've had dreams where I drink for a week or so it hadn't happened before. Fortunately I feel afraid and ashamed in the dream and when I wake up so that's a plus.
Triumph: Almost at 7 months! Also my condo was on the market for 3 days before we accepted an offer well over listing price...Struggle: Where the hell am I gonna live next month?..General Chat: Go Blackhawks
**Triumph**: I had a great session at the gym before work this morning. I had been making excuses for the past two days after having had a few lackluster sessions. Set a new OHP PR and everything went well...**Struggle**: The resentments are at arm's length. They're never quite gone entirely but if I chose to I could easily grab and nurture them again. It's just a part of developing emotional maturity that I neglected throughout my formative years. It's not always easy...**General**: I'm pretty sure I lost my bus card on the way to work. I threw myself a nice little ten second pity party before snapping back to reality and thinking of solutions. Adversity is a gift. I'm glad that I have these opportunities to grow instead of having excuses to retreat to the bottle.
Triumph:  Went to a friend's show at a local bar.  I drank only bottled waters and cokes (and I drank a LOT of them. :))  No one even seemed to notice that I wasn't drinking booze.  I had more fun than usual actually and I drove my people home without any fear of hurting them or others.  Remembered everything the next day...Struggle: Been feeling sad a lot these past few days.  I've been so busy and haven't had time to work out daily like I did my first week of sobriety and I think that is affecting me.
Triumph: Well I'm back to day 3 but day 3 is better than no days. Edit: I actually ended up going to an AA meeting at noon today. Both of my bosses aren't in today so I took an extra long lunch and went. It was probably the best AA meeting I've been to and I saw someone there that I had met at another one. We talked for a bit after and it was nice. I related to a lot of the people at this one. ..Struggle: Drank after 20 days of being sober acted a fool it's been 3 days and I'm still feeling the regret. This has been a hard one to get over and has depressed me. I'm not feeling too hopeful right now. The weather is getting really nice and I'm being invited to BBQs/Parties that I'll have to skip. ..General Chat: Go Wild!
Triumph: 13 days! Pretty much record territory for me. .Struggle: a little distracted at work took down DNS at my job so no one could reach our sites for about 15 minutes. Think I'm in trouble :).Chat: beautiful day in Northern California! Looking forward to a long walk.
Triumph: 28 days sober.  Am now a volunteer fireman and work at the animal sanctuary...Struggle: still jobless and in love with my ex-wife...General: the sun is nice.
Triumph: The Insult Comic Dog...Struggle: It's all in my head?...General Chat: At ease.
Triumph: 24 days wothout a drink 24 hours without smoking weed and over a month without cigarettes...Struggle: I keep having dreams where I'm drinking and every time I wake up from them I'm disappointed in myself and I look around for empty beer bottles. Even when I don't find them I sometimes can't believe I didn't drink because I remember it so clearly...General chat: I managed to pass my english class last semester but missed the deadline to sign up for spring semester. I'm wanting to travel not sure where but I just want to get up and go somewhere. Hard to do that with 70 dollars to your name though.
Triumph: Getting in the swing of being sober. Cautiously optimistic...Struggle: Actually none at the moment(!)..General chat: Finally getting a new computer since windows XP support has ended.
Triumph: Made it to class early today!.Struggle: Finals are next week the workload is pretty overwhelming. .General Chat: It is raining! I love rain. And I am eating a really good cookie. 
Triumph: I'm choosing to go to a meeting instead of out with friends tonight because I'm feeling weak.Struggle: Money is a mess; I have to provide a security deposit for a new apartment and I don't have access to the funds.General chat: I had three meals each day for the last few days and I'm starting to like eating again :)
