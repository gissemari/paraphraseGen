I was forced to confront my drinking habits last year when I woke up in detox in May (no recollection of getting there). A few weeks later a friend suggested I go to AA after she found out I had been drinking alone. Anyways last year alcohol really put me through hell but I've got about 2 months sober now and have mostly lost the desire to drink. I don't go to AA anymore I've found other recovery resources that work better for me. It's continuous work and improvement..What is hardest for me now is that my sister is going through the same thing. She went to the hospital and woke up in detox this weekend. I was able to share resources that helped me but I haven't really told her the full extent of what I went through. Part of me is still trying to keep up the image of having it all together and part of me is trying to be the older sister setting a good example. ..I also just feel so bad for our parents. I don't want them to worry or be sad or feel like they failed us.

I got some great advice this weekend.  I realize that I'm being selfish when I'm not sharing myself or my experience.  I am so grateful to have met people in my life and here who had the courage to put their embarrassments aside and show their imperfections.  We learn from each other.  We help each other feel less alone when we share ourselves. ..Perfect is boring.  The stories here about pain and loss and triumph and slipping and getting back up these are interesting and dynamic and shine a light on different paths to take...I am so so grateful to all of my teachers who give themselves to me in ways that are not shiny.  I can identify with their humanity and feel close to them.  Maybe your sister is also trying to keep up an image of having it more together than she truly does.  I've never regretted being honest when I know it's coming from a place of love.
Yesterday I shared my last weeks experience with my older brother. Turns out he is doing the exact same thing for the last 45 days.  We both admitted to each other where we were at before we stopped and each of us was shocked to learn how similar our experience is/was. It is encouraging to know I am not alone especially with someone I am so close with. ..I would encourage you to let your past weakness be known to you sister. You have 57 days under your belt... that's strength and a good example that you need to tell her about. Knowing that she is not alone may be what she needs to realize that she needs to follow your example. I was surprised to learn about my older brother but knowing what I know now gives me faith that its possible...As a younger sibling I can say that I look up to my brother a lot. Knowing what I know now about him makes me respect him so much more. Also Im not embarrassed about where I was at because I know he was in the same position. Right now your sister may be embarrassed about where she is at... let her save face tell her your story. Be strong together.
