It seems a bit absurd to post this but since everyone makes changes in their lives for a smattering of reasons--maybe I should share mine...Alcohol didn't ruin my life. It didn't hurt my relationships it didn't burn out my finances it hasn't caused significant impairment in my occupational social or academic life. I may not have  met sufficient criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder. I drank significantly less (frequency/magnitude) than most of my peers. I drank before class once or twice and didn't care for it so I didn't do it again. I have knowingly drank to cope with stress only once or twice though I may have done it unconsciously an unknown number of times. I have never blacked out...**And I still think I drank too much I still think I need to quit.**..See that's the thing about substance use abuse. It's very personal it's something everyone has their own experience with and it affects everyone differently. For me I feel like it was excessive. I binged (i.e. 5 standard drinks in a single session) at least a couple times a week more while I was in graduate school. My peers binged most nights started drinking early in the day drank in their parked cars during their jobs at the school before working out before everything really. We were all very successful students. They had established cultural mores which revolved around drinking they had defined such high parameters that I always felt like I was doing okay. ..Now I've got a fresh Master's degree and start a new job tomorrow that I am so excited about. A new set of mores to learn a new level of self-discipline to achieve. I want to quit drinking to prove to myself I can to catalyze my fitness goals and to keep the poison in the tail and not the vein...I have never been very disciplined. Laid back calm perhaps even lazy are better words. But I have a new set of standards I will have to meet to keep lubricated the moving parts of my new job and life. If I can't adhere to a high standard for myself it's unlikely that I'll meet the ones set by others. It is time to learn responsibility and self discipline it is time to grow up. I also want to set the standard for some of my peers so that they don't set themselves down the arduous path of alcoholism...I have lost about 25 pounds since September and while I am proud of that fact I constantly kick myself for how much further along I would be in my fitness journey if I hadn't unwound from a hard workout with a beer. Alcohol is a huge source of calories and over the past few months has seriously sabotaged my calorie intake. I was so careful with what I ate throughout the day but ended quite a few days with 400-1200 calories of alcohol. I am a beginner in powerlifting and I'm excited to lose enough weight so I can start bulking up and rebuilding my body with new muscle tissue. I can't do that (efficiently/effectively) until I lose weight and I know alcohol doesn't help achieve that goal. Further researchers at UNT found that the closer you drink alcohol to a workout the longer your body takes to repair muscle fibers. I could be lifting more weight but alcohol has slowed that process...Finally while I never saw my drinking as huge problem--hell I don't even have a strong urge to quit right now-- I want to quit drinking to address the title of this post. In Cauda Venenum. Nobody sets out to become an alcoholic it creeps up on them. It waits and whittles one away while life and stress dictate distraction necessitates numbing. It's something you build become. The poison is in the tail and you won't realize you've been stung until it's too late. Until you start to see the consequences. My dad was a (stress-mediated) alcoholic for a while he's been sober three or four years. I have depression in partial remission alcoholism is comorbid. I don't want to start a habit that becomes a lifestyle. ..For what it's worth I'm planning on taking a 6 week moratorium. I'm not sure if I will start drinking after that but I know for sure I won't be drinking as often as heavily. I will miss beer but will hopefully be able to enjoy a nice saison once spring has reached full pace. I am a week in sofar and it has gone about as well as I expected...If you read all of this I really appreciate you! Thank you for your time and if you're struggling know that if you can't control a behavior controlling your thinking will change that--and vice versa.

Good post. Good luck. 
Indeed with many substance abuse patterns the *poison is indeed int the tail*...Alcohol is notoriously sneaky insidious and patient.  Similar to the pitcher plant example appropriated by A. Grace.  ..More eloquently stated by Samuel Johnson I believe:.."The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are to strong to break."..&gt;if you can't control a behavior controlling your thinking will change that..Not for me.  Not for most people I know...I couldn't think my way to sober living.  I did Live my way to sober thinking...The process of healing is Action driven.  The thinking will follow.  ..My body does not always go where my brain does...My brain **always** accompanies by body...At least so far.
