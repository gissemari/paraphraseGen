I've been lurking in here for a while now. While I don't drink everyday I can't control how much I do consume when I drink. It was nice to see that there are many people out there struggling. I have bad anxiety and am not working at the moment because of moving states for my SO's job. I drink out of boredom because he also travels a lot. Friday I started drinking around 2 in the afternoon and by 4 or 5 I was blackout. I had gone almost a month without drinking and slipped up. I have decided enough is enough and I will not drink with you today.

OPwelcome!I too drink out of boredom as my SO is deployed for a year so I understand that. Keep your head up we're all in this together. IWNDWYT 
I am much like you. I'm 13 days today and don't plan to go back. There's just something about us that inhibits is from stopping ourselves. IWNDWYT and good luck on your future sober life :)
Hello! Well done on your day 3. The boredom thing is definitely an issue with lots of us. Accepting boredom and being in it has helped me and then it passes.
