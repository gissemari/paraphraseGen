Today I am thankful for /u/dirtysurfdog who's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/41wotc/i_am_done_drinking/) reminded me how amazing this sub is and even the tiniest things that we don't even think about can make a difference. /r/stopdrinking is freaking amazing! 
I am thankful to my other half for putting up with me all those years and for the support she gives me now. ..I am thankful to be alive and well and looking forward to the future. 
I am thankful to be free of hangovers..My SO was sick last night and I didn't get a lot of sleep.  I was still in way better condition than I used to be when I lost sleep because of drinking.  .I am also thankful for my body which has had to deal with years of punishment.  I promise to treat you better now body!
Today I am thankful for a warm house and a warmer bed during this snow storm instead of staggering home drunk in the cold. 
I'm thankful for going to bed sober last night and not being hung over this morning! 
Today I am thankful for the 178 days sober the will and desire to make it happen and this sub for its major influence and support. I will not drink today.
So thankful my family still loves me and so thankful I found you all. Life is good.
.Really I am luccky to re-start my journey with only "medium" problems to solve. (Professional identity confusion and the basic bio-social effects of alcohol.) ..I am lucky not to have any further big ticket super-challenges so I have a pocket to get strong before one DOES hit!!!..
I'm thankful that (granted it took a DWAI) my eyes are continually being opened more and more to the fact that I was indeed addicted to alcohol. Little to no withdrawal symptoms tricked me for years. I'm also thankful that I'm working on sobriety before I did any serious damage to my body.
I'm thankful for hire much sobriety changed me. It was one of the things I was most afraid of when I was still using. But the changes turned out to be good! I'm way more clear headed have a much better job and a richer social life and I have sobriety to thank for it!
I am grateful for a warm home. I am grateful for a healthy body. I am grateful for my sobriety. I am grateful I can afford therapy. 
I'm thankful for a loving family and a puppy who keeps me laughing.
I am thankful for SD.
I'm thankful that my blood work came back OK so my husband and I can focus on next steps for having a baby. I *guarantee* you that drinking made it impossible for me to even step foot in that lab for years. the anxiety around the action (and putting it off) practically ate me alive. and here we are taking concrete positive steps forward with good results. eyes on the prize. just keep going.
I am thankful for my therapist and most therapist in general for showing myself my SO and others that there are better paths to choose than the ones our hurting minds and souls find. 
So much. .. My wonderful family and amazing friends my career my home and community. Basically my life. The things that are not the best are really insignificant and few in all reality.
Short and sweet: I am thankful for my husband who CHOOSES to put up with my crazy ass :)....Also all my fellow sobernauts I wouldn't be where I am today without you. A month of inpatient/outpatient (for me personally) didn't give me half the encouragement strength pride confidence feeling of acceptance or drive that SD has. From every ounce of my being - *Thank you*
I'm thankful I have conversations at night with my 15 year old son that I actually remember the next morning. 
I am home sick with a cold and a sick kid. I am thankful for the job stability that lets me care for us both. I am thankful for the patience and centeredness I've found that lets me care for us both. I'm extremely thankful for tissues and soap!
I'm thankful for discovering this place to share stories and get healthy with my many new friends. 
I'm thankful that I my wife and son still love me. 
I am thankful that my partner is being so supportive...Hell I am thankful that he is still here after all these years of stupid things.
I'm thankful I've spent some time reading 'Easy Way' if for nothing else than the mindset that it's not that I CANNOT drink today it's that I CHOOSE not to.
I'm so thankful for all the comments I received on my post yesterday from some really lovely helpful and supportive /r/stopdrinking folks. It's incredible to see a group of folks who have never even met before coming together. And it's an incredible feeling to know that I'm not alone in the struggles that come with not drinking...I'm thankful for early mornings being able to actually wake up (!) when the alarm goes off and having some spare moments to cuddle with my SO prepare a coffee and feel ready for the day ahead. ..I'm thankful for being able to dream again. I rarely dream when I've been drinking; last night I had the cutest little dream ever about going to the adoption shelter to adopt a new cat. (Hi I'm obsessed with cats but don't have one. I realize this is tragic haha.)
I'm thankful my creativity doesn't require alcohol. In might not have even been enhanced by booze in the first place. ..The last couple of months have been an incredibly fertile period of creativity for me. I can't wait for the weekend so I can continue painting!  
Very thankful to not wake up hungover. 
I am thankful for you /u/finally_woken for having my back this morning. I am thankful for /u/kilayo for checking up on me. I am thankful for the roof over my head and the lasagna in my belly. ..Cheers!
I'm grateful that I have not picked up today this place and my wonderful sponsor. ..I'm also grateful to know that even though today is a hard day I don't have to drink over it. 
I'm thankful for having a ton of stuff to do today at my job and the patience and focus to face it and complete it all. If I'd had all this to do in one day while still drinking every few days I'd be freaking out about it and anxious instead of just completing one task at a time...I'm grateful for being sober one day at a time.
I'm thankful to have some control of my life again. To not live the constant fear/regret cycle that was fueling my delusional anxiety. This sub and the caring people here are the main reason for my  modest achievements so I'm thankful to all of you most of all! Cheers friends :)
I am really thankful I found this subreddit today!  I am 21 days sober and have been reading lots of posts that are encouraging and inspiring! 
I'm thankful to be closing in on 2 weeks for my SMART meetings and work which is helping me in a way I had not thought a program could for this sub and for my cuddly cat!
I'm thankful for all the people in my life who are models for what I want to become. Whether they know it or not I can better handle where I am on my journey knowing they've already done it (sobriety career and family at the same time health running goals etc.). 
I am thankful for my loving fiance my family the roof over my head and my health and safety!
I am thankful for being alive today. For being aware for being loved and for finding this sub. I'm thank for all of you and your strength. :)
I didn't drink yesterday today and I wont drink tomorrow. Day 4.
I am so thankful that my sobriety has made me a better student. I am focussed I am engaged and I am connecting and finding true joy in the learning process. 
Today I am thankful that I went to sleep sober last night and was able to wake up at 2 a.m. My friend called me to tell me that she had her twin babies. I was able to talk to her and remember every detail of the conversation. 
Grateful for 12 days of sobriety.  I was sober for 7 years but relapsed a year and a half ago.  The grief of losing that sobriety that followed was horrible and I almost lost hope.  These past 12 days have re-awakened that hope and for that I am truly thankful.
I'm thankful for this inspiring and encouraging corner of the interwebs. Im thankful that I can indeed not drink and its not a problem. And Im thankful for Netflix and chocolate; my beautiful babies; my husband; my friends and Dad jokes..
The things that I have read here this week have the potential to change my life for the better. I am thankful for that.
I am thankful for everything big and small from the creature comforts of my daily life to a strong recovery program. Each day I write a list of 5 things I am for which I am grateful. I am really thankful for finding this site and all of you.
I'm thankful for you today /u/finally_woken. I know it's been a hard road lately round these parts so please know you are loved and appreciated for your service and sacrifice. :-)
I am thankful to be in a warm house and a warm bed with three warm dogs around me. Thankful I finally realized this is so so much better than a night at the bar. And I'm really thankful I discovered stopdrinking. Everything you guys share is so important and helpful. Thank you. 
I am grateful for sponsorship having someone to bounce my great ideas off of and girls to help. My unique qualifications. Grateful to know when I'm in my own way and knowing how to get out of it. All the things I have that I don't deserve. Sunshine. Love. Being able to be vulnerable. My life is so good today thanks to sobriety in the 12 steps. 
I am grateful that I no longer live in my past. I live today. I am happy sober and content.
I am thankful that I was alive and sober to tuck my kid into bed tonight.
