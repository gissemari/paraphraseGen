I'm on day 8 today one week completed. That's the longest I've gone in a loooooong time. I'm sitting in the hospital waiting room waiting to see a cardiologist. I'm only 34 years old female. I have been having shortness of breath for months now and I'm scared my drinking really messed something up. I'm supposed to get some kind of heart monitor thing that I have to wear for 30 days. Everyone in this waiting room is much older than me around 60s-80s. I'm seriously scared. ..I'm bipolar 2 prone to anxiety and am a bit of a shut in. Social anxiety is one of my triggersespecially with family. My dad is visiting today also and I have to do this medical stuff. ..I had some really long and realistic relapse dreams last night where I was having fun with my old drinking friends. I woke up relieved that it wasn't real but it reminded me how fun drinking used to be. ..I have this feeling like I deserve a break for making it a week. I can't remember going this long without alcohol. That plus all the stress I'm having today is really making me want to quit. Being at the cardiologist's office should be a deterrent but the stress of being here is overriding my rational side. I've been reading The Naked Mind and it makes a lot of sense but it's hard to focus right now on the rational points it makes. ..I guess what I'm saying is help? I don't want to go back to drinking. I don't want to reset my badge.

Just focus on getting through your appt right now. Hospitals are stressful even to those without anxiety issues and it's 100x worse for people like us...Let us know how your appt goes... you can get through this just keep focusing how much better you will feel when you make it a few more hours without drinking.
