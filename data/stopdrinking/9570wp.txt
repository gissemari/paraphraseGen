Today has been a little more rough. I've had a headache and almost felt hungover throughout the day. Grouchy as heck this evening. Doesn't help with the whiskey sitting on the counter as hubby drinks. I need to sleep. Come on it's only day 5! I'm sure this is all normal right? I'm also extremely tired from a nightmare waking me up super early this morning. Sorry for griping! IWNDWYT

Hang in there!! IWNDWYT.
Yep.  The night of Day 4 and early Day 5 were the worst for me.  The withdrawals became fairly intense.  I'm still reeling a little bit here on Day 7 not gonna lie...but WAY better than I was.  Keep super hydrated.  I hate Gatorade but it has been a life saver these past few days.  We can do this!  IWNDWYT.
Everything you describe is super normal at about this point!..You're nearly over the hump now.....I found that a low dose of melatonin and a magnesium supplement before bed helped a bit with the sleep.....Could you ask your husband to put his whiskey away somewhere? I know it would have driven me potty having to look at it every time I went in the kitchen.....Hang in there and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Sounds about right.  Hang in there it does get better guaranteed.
