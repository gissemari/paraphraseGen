Without drinking life is immensely less complicated. Whatever life throws at me I'm prepared to react with a clear mind. I have so much less anxiety fewer messes to clean up. As I put more distance between my current self and my past drinking this rings truer every day...That said - I still struggle with anxiety and guilt/shame left over from my drinking days. Any advice on dealing with this?..Thanks - IWNDWYT

It has to lessen with time..Iwndwyt 
What has helped me is changing my behaviours and then watching how my new behaviours everyone I come in contact with.  Like- the opposite of guilt.  
you're setting things right.. that's the way I look at what I'm doing right now: I'm setting things right.. keep doing it
There are still things I did when I was drinking that I regret both in terms of ways I've wronged people and ways I've hurt myself. ..On one hand those things are part of why I was so determined to quit in the first place. I accepted that I would be miserable and continue doing those things unless I quit drinking. ..At the same time I also try to remember the context that those things happened in. Most of the worst things happened in the months before I quit. While it doesn't excuse hurting other people I have to remember I was deeply ill at that time. ..Do your best to make amends/right your wrongs but remember that an apology means nothing if you aren't able to show you're serious about making change. ..IWNDWYT
