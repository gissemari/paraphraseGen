I feel so positive that this will be my time. That after so many day ones I won't ever see another day one. The difference I got right back on track after only a short week of tricking myself that I was a normal drinker. I reached out to my sponsor I read my Big Book I got on my knees and prayed to God (my higher power). I hosted a small bbq yesterday. This is something that would absolutely have required drinks for me to enjoy. I sipped Red Bull and La Croix. It wasn't perfect. At one point in the evening I was just wanting to be alone. My friends know my struggles and enjoyed alcohol free drinks with no issues. They said they enjoyed my company so much more when I don't drink. I said I missed bubbly joke filled boozey me. They shocked me by saying the  bubbly  was actually annoying bc I was so wasted typically no one was able to have a conversation with me. Turns out no one likes when I drink. I don't even like when I drink.Out of maybe 2 times of fun with alcohol there would be 10 of misery loss vomiting binge eating confusion embarrassment and sorrow. Thanks so much for listening ..IWNDWYT
