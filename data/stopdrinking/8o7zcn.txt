Reset my badge. I just wanted a break from my reality with a gift bottle I for some reason didn't get rid of. Didn't really enjoy it but did it anyway yesterday too. And then I did enjoy it. How fucked up is that? I felt "normal" even after 10+ months. I guess I'll be wired like this for the rest of my life. Nothing bad happened but I am running out of ideas and actions to choose from. I was starting to have my shit together. I don't want to go back to the nightmare that drunk life was. AA is not for me but Russell Brand's book (which is based on the 12 steps) might be. I won't drink today.

Glad to see you back and that you won't drink today &lt;3 If AA isn't for you have you heard of SMART recovery? A friend of mine swears by it and I think it's like AA but less spiritual based? Unsure! But support groups are great. ..IWNDWYT!
I am so sad to see this from u/garrlip! You have sent me some very kind messages in the past. Ya know what? I slipped last year on July 3. I drank for about 2 hours felt it for 4 hours reset the badge the next morning. I didn't want a break so much as I wanted to be like other people. I had been to a 4th of July party at our oldest son's with a lot of our friends his younger friends all drinking. But not me... until I left his house. I went straight to a liquor store then sat in the park near my house drinking alone. Alone &amp; crying. Please don't let this get you down my friend. You still know how to get and stay sober. This is some hard shit. But you can do it again. I did so I have to think that if *I* can get and stay sober anyone can. I will be here for you. I promise.
I've just started reading this book too..All the best my friend...IWNDWYT
