   Well this is probably the 3rd time in the past 3 months that I've tried.to detox myself.   In the prior 2 times I couldn't make it past Day 6-7 (which always came the following weekend). I'd just always seem to find a simple way to justify it to myself as making perfect sense and I could handle it. Course during those relapses getting sober made perfect sense and the cycle has continued up to tonight.  The longest I've ever been sober is probably 6 mos (after latest rehab)...So it's night 3 of no sleep and its never (the no sleep) lasted this long usually by now I've been able to get in an hour or two.  I've tried Sominex (max dosage is 50mg anyone know how soon I can take it again?) and Melatonin each night with no success...I was able to finally eat food again today and today was much lower on the anxiety scale so I thought my body would finally crash tonight (it doesn't agree).  Sleepless days/nights are just so frustrating because it leaves me way too much time for **reflection** on a life that I've wasted so far...I know most all the reasons I keep relapsing have to do with my inability to make the correct life-style changes (hobby exercise support group) to my current life.  Has anyone managed to do it without a good/any support group(other than /r/sd)?..Thanks for listening and to all who post here it really is a wonderful resource.

Oh man it gets crazy right?  Nothing like laying awake when your body craves sleep and your mind is going 100 miles a minute.  Getting weird thoughts?  Strange semi dreams?  I remember it all too clearly my friend.  I swore to myself never to forget that personal torture.  Hell is a place on earth my friend we alcoholics all end up there.  This is no hangover friend this is an active disease of which you are experiencing physical symptoms.  Your cells have  become abnormal your brain is confused.  Your liver looks for alcohol to break down for energy not food.  Your blood is poisoned.  Yet in a few days you will feel better.  So good to do it all over again?  It's not really up to you poor guy.  Pray for some help.
 Yeah my brain usually seems to hire David Lynch tomstart directing my dreams so I'm sure even if I could start to sleep it wouldn't last long. 
yes lack of sleep... welcome to the dark side... ..Uh I mean... It should go away in the next few days. If it helps just get off the computer and lay in bed with the lights off no phone nothing and let yourself lay there. It may take an hour or two but your mind will eventually get bored enough that it'll konk out (technical term)...I wouldn't worry too much about the hobby / exercise / support group at this point I'd just focus on maybe some chamomile tea listening to some Yani or Enya......My own opinion is rushing into a bunch of life-style changes at once increases the likelihood of a collective failure of all of them but that's just from my experience. Your mileage may vary...Sometimes a nice fatty meal before bed can help... I know it's bad for the body but you need to take care of you yah know and sleep is essential. ..I take 2 mg of melatonin and hydroxyzine which is a prescription but is basically glorified benadryl. Seems to work when I take that combination. ..As for Sominex recommended dosage is 50mg max dosage is actually like 300mg per 24 hours so you're probably safe to take another 50mg if you really need to for sleep though I am neither a doctor nurse nor pharmacist. ..Just remember you're not the only one not sleeping well tonight ;)
those sleepless nights sucks ass. i managed to stop drinking for a little over a year on my own with no support group. however the thought "i could go out and handle just a couple" kept creeping into my brain. it was suggested i go try AA. the meetings seem to be helping its nice being in a room with others who know what ive been through and understand how i feel. so far its worked for me....good luck
I didn't sleep for weeks. It's normal. It gets worse everytime so get some help this time rather than trying to do it on your own because that always fails...Good Look
No advice to offer on the sleep. It'll come when it's time for it to. I sympathize though. It took me a long time before I was able to string together more than a couple of hours at a time...I do know of a couple of people who are using SD as their primary means of support/program. My understanding from them is that they work their program just as hard as anyone in one of the more formal programs do. That means that they read every single post and comment copy and paste helpful or inspirational comments (one person said that they actually hand-write the comments from their computer into a notebook rather than copying) and generally read as much about alcoholism and addiction as they can. They're also very active in the group. Finally one of the persons I know has said that they have worked a couple of the twelve steps as written in the book by themselves. I don't know which step they did but I would suggest that step 4 is a pretty great one for just about anyone to attempt on their own; you'll learn a tremendous amount about yourself...So yes there are people who are using SD as the major part of their program. Without the peer aspect of it there's a lot more dedication that needs to come straight for you so it's not the best program if you're not already motivated. Either way I hope you stick around and continue posting. Hope that sleep comes for you soon and I hope this is the last go-around on the detox for you too. Be well.
To answer your question:..No I don't know anyone with a satisfying productive sober life who has done it without a support system. (This is a great website but obviously not enough for you right now.)..Why do it by yourself when there's available support to make the recovery journey less lonely and more successful? ..Besides you already know the answer to your question. You are arm-wrestling with this disease. If you continue drinking you will lose more than sleep. ..You mentioned "rehab". My best suggestion is to follow the recommendations given to you at discharge. Seeing a doctor might be a good idea also. ..Take care of yourself!
I have good health insurance and have been seeing a psychologist with many years experience in treating alcoholism and depression. This still took 2 years and lots of effort and re-tries on my part but I'm good now. ../r/sd/ is awesome. Other than my psychologist /r/SD/ was my only 'group' . My advice for you right now is: one level of bad at a time. Don't pile self-hate on top of the crap your body is putting you through. Put it off for when you feel awesome in a few months or year (spoiler you won't hate yourself nearly as much then) 
for what it's worth going for a run is easier than it sounds. I have very little endurance (I walk most of the time) but just going for it and getting a good sweat going will turn my day around. just find the will to get out there once and that could be all it'll take. pick a scenic park or something instead of a track. tracks are dull.
Journaling works for me. .But the Best Solution I have ever found is high school Physical Education textbooks. .You can get a lot of old text books but some of them are kinda interesting so you can get hooked. But health books at a high school level are so basic and boring that it puts the mind at ease. Not only will it be free of anything thought provoking but it will be a great refresher course for all the things you already know..It sounds so tedious but that is why it works for me.
I'm in the same boat you are. Let's call it the: ''SS I can't fucking sleep but really need to''..I've got like close to two weeks in and last night I actually slept. Full on ten hours and I awoke feeling like a new man. About morbid self-reflection: Don't do it. I my experience it has only led to me drinking again. I've found that going to meetings and venting my frustrations helpful. After all **EVERY** old timer there has gone through those same feelings. Also my Doctor prescribed some medications that have helped me out (librium trazadone zoloft). I'm sure there are people that exist that can stop and **stay** stopped without support but they are in the minority. I've found it best to find a support system and lean on them when you can't be strong.
I've got no answers but if it helps I'm right there with you!..We can kick it with or without sleep.
