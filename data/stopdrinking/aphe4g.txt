With quite a few resets in the last year Day 35 is the longest I've managed to make it so far. My tax return just deposited into my account and instead of heading straight to the liquor store and buying a fancier bottle of whiskey I'm heading to Walmart to get a money order for my and my girlfriend's first months rent and deposit on an apartment! .I'm sure tax season is gonna be tough for all of us with the extra cash burning holes in our pockets. I know I struggle with that temptation but I'm not gonna let it get me this time. Keep on keeping on everyone. IWNDWYT
