Alright day 3 and my body is still suffering from my last five day bender. The anxiety is dissolving but the depression is still kicking. Still not sure what happened over those 5 days been too afraid to ask. I'm entirely focused on my sobriety for now and i hope it's not just the sickness fooling me. I've spent the majority of the last few day laid out and walking my dog And hydrating. The disgusting dark yellow piss and poop i cant even put into words without gaging! I've read many of you're post and you all understand the feeling and pain I'm in now..  Now or never is the time for me. School starts back in a few weeks and my mind is so fuzzy i wouldn't make it. Simply put i feel half retarded. I know it gets better and things become clear but fuck my ass with ass with a cactus if i fall again i could loose it all. .Anyway we can all do this. I found that when I'm feeling weak and need immediate counsel sometimes writing a thread on here takes longer then the walk to the liquor store. .I've created a group in kik called DrinkNoMore and its an experimental tool for relapse prevention. .If your thinking about that drink and wanna hear all the reasons to not and hear it from people in the same boat to over come craving together head over! We are small right now but have had some great conversation and feed back. While we continue to vent here and tell our stories if recovery relapse DrinkNoMore is an instant relapse prevention tool! Hope to see some new members weather you're in fear of a fall or would like to provide prevention help.
