I feel like I have come to this very decision so many times and for so many different reasons...&amp;#x200B;..And yet here I am.  Struggling with that very decision again...&amp;#x200B;..No matter what positive habits I try to reinforce no matter how many meditations I do no matter how much I know even while I'm wanting it how much it would cost me...&amp;#x200B;..Sometimes I just really want the oblivion it once offered me...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
