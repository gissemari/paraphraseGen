I just found out my wife is expecting (we're thrilled as we've been trying for two years now).  For the last couple years I've been struggling with my relationship to alcohol - I'm not an every day drinker but have a bad habit of binging on the weekends and blackouts are not uncommon.....The baby is obviously going to be my number one priority so I'm telling myself no more drinking once the child is born.  It seems like an easy decision now 9 months out.  I'm wondering if anyone  has experience with this?  Was it easy to quit when you became a parent?  Or am I being naive thinking that the baby will be my ticket out of this bad habit?  Will the stresses of parenthood just be another driver to want to drink?..Thanks for your input just curious what other parents have gone through...

My drinking got worse after my kids were born.  I am not sure of the cause and effect but my drinking went from bad to worse.  I am grateful I was able to quit when they were two and four so they do not remember.
Mine really started after my second. There is correlation though. It was me. Laziness and addiction. My children and wife are a key motivator for me now. However I quit for ME. Only me. It is the best selfish thing I have ever done. The hardest too. I have accepted that I won't drink again in a way I haven't before this. I am in Refuge Recovery. I am practicing mindful meditation. I am here on SD all the time. These tools well I never really used them. I thought I could handle it. I was wrong though. Really wrong...Spending time with my children is a complete joy. A way to pamper my soul. They know me. They will have better and better memories of me because of my sobriety...Congratulations! Be well friend! I won't be drinking with you today!
Hi &amp; huge congrats!!!!..Ok I'm gonna be blunt...yes your being naive to think that a baby will be a ticket out of anything!! Babies don't make things easier....they make them harder......That being said!.....they'll also be the best thing that happened to you &amp; you'll WANT to be better for them. But along with all the joy comes a BIG life change. Especially with your 1st. Because the spontaneous life you know....going to the movies when you want...out to dinner...not having to be home at a certain time cause your wife is exhausted &amp; hadn't slept &amp; needs a break! All of that is stress.....and stress can easily lead to drinking. ..My son is 9 1/2 &amp; my daughter 4. I actually didn't start drinking daily/heavily until my daughter was about 16 months. Some life events made things stressful I started to convince myself I deserved the break at the end of every nite. Nite started to become early afternoon &amp; eventually shots every morning. ..If you think quitting now is tough....wait until you have to be up all nite w/ a baby.....or the endless energy it takes watching a toddler. If you feel bad about yourself now sometimes...I can tell you it's nothing compared to how bad you feel when your child wants to go to the park on a beautiful spring day but "Daddy has to rest". My 4 year old heard "we are just resting today" too many times to count. ..Jeez I hope I haven't scared you about parenthood! It is awesome but it's a full time job. Your in a great position where you could stop now....by the time the baby comes you'll be I such a different place! ..Again congrats!!
It didn't! And that was bad for the kids.
**CONGRATULATIONS!**..My son is 6 years old. My husband and I were both heavy drinkers and once we decided to have children I stopped drinking. Just like that. I didn't have more than 5 sips of beer throughout the whole pregnancy. It was easy because I wanted my healthy baby more than anything. ..Once he was born I had one Guinness each night for a few months (I was nursing him). That was also totally doable and fine by me. Once he started taking bottles of pumped milk I started drinking more. By 9 months my breastmilk supply tanked (probably because I'd do a half assed job at pumping) and he weaned from me. I'd wanted to make it to one year before he stopped nursing but somehow I allowed booze to become more important. And I **hate** that I did that...Fast forward to about a week before my son was to start kindergarten and I wound up in the hospital with alcoholic hepatitis. I had to beg the doctors to let me out of the hospital so I could take him to his first day. That's fucking sad. ..My son is the best. Seriously. He's healthy happy smart. He sleeps well eats well listens well. Like... in the grand scheme of children I won the freaking lottery. All that said parenthood was **way** harder on me than I could've expected. A lot of that has to do with my own depression/anxiety and past. We made the decision when my son was 2 that we were good with one child. I wonder how many kids we would've had if I hadn't started drinking again. ..I really don't want to scare you. Parenthood is amazing. Babies and kids will blow your mind (in a really great way). I love my son more than I thought possible. But booze can **absolutely** weasel it's way in and cause a ton of hurt. I wish I'd just stayed dry after he was born. ..Sorry for rambling. Everything is so much better now that I'm sober. I've got the patience and energy that my son deserves. I fight less with my husband. It's pretty awesome honestly. I'm really sad I didn't enjoy my first 5 years of parenting more. All thanks to being chained to a bottle. I will not drink with you. 
Got worse and now I need to change that
Drank more to help with the stress. 
My drinking went from borderline to problematic when I became a father.  The increase stress the selfish annoyance from losing my wife's primary attention the late nights... it all came together in a very bad way.  ..It seems counterintuitive because all you want is the best for your kids but the stress and pressure put me over the line. ..but when I decided to get my shit together they were the main motivation.  It's too late to hope that my kids never see me drunk but I know if I don't go back they won't remember it.  
I was one of those people that hide their drinking. It wasn't always that way but after my wife basically told me I had to quit drinking or lose her I quit for a few month then decided I liked life better with booze.  So I started hiding it and I was really good at hiding it. I got to a point where I didn't want to drink anymore because it was ruining my body(I started puking blood on a pretty regular basis) but I was physically addicted and needed to drink just to function throughout the day and not be sick. I was sure my wife would leave me if I came clean about my drinking. Well we found out that she was pregnant and I was so happy I was excited to be a dad and I was sure that this baby would be the motivation I needed to get the courage to quit on my own. I had 7 months to quit plenty of time to ween myself off the booze by cutting back slowly and I'd be able to avoid going through terrible withdrawal. Then I had 5 months then 3 months then a month...When my daughter was born I hadn't had a drink in 18 hours. Watching the birth cutting the cord and holding my daughter for the first time were some of the most powerful moments of my life but I was starting to go through withdrawal and I wasn't truly present for those moments. I made some excuse about going to get lunch across street about two hours after the birth and of course I proceeded to pound down three triple vodka tonics while I was waiting for the food. It was only then that I could go be with my family and feel normal. ..The three months that followed were an absolute shitshow. I didn't quit drinking if anything I started drinking more because I had two weeks off work after the birth. My relationship with my wife fell apart quickly. It was to the point where she was sleeping with the baby in the living room every night while I was passed out in bed. She couldn't look at me. She also didn't understand why I was such a useless asshole because she believed I wasn't drinking just smoking a lot of weed. I hated myself for being an alcoholic and a liar and for not being there for my daughter but I couldn't stop. My wife was going to leave me. That combined with my body really beginning to just give up on me was what got me to the point of total surrender. I came clean to my wife(she was going to leave me anyway it was really a blessing in disguise) and went to the hospital to detox. ..It's been a little over a year and my life is better than I could have ever imagined it being. My relationship with my wife is the best it's ever been she has forgiven me and I'm earning back her trust slowly. We're a real family and I'm a good father and a pretty decent husband today. I love being a dad. If I keep doing the next right thing and living right my daughter will never know the version of her father that I used to be...As for your questions:..You're not an every day drinker so you may not have the physical addiction like I did so you've got that going for you. But for me no it was not easy to quit just because I was going to be a parent. ..You say that this baby is going to be your number one priority but if you're a real deal alcoholic it won't be. Booze will always be number one and there is nothing that will come before it. ..I think the stresses of parenthood actually help keep me sober. I want to be present and available 24/7 and it's an incredible feeling to know that no matter how frustrating or scary a given situation may be I'm 100% there for my daughter and my wife. ..I didn't do this alone AA has taught me how to deal with the problems and situations in life that would normally just completely break my brain and make me want to drink. I know it's not for everyone but it has been working for me and I owe a lot to the program. If you're worried about not being able to handle things in your life without booze I'd suggest giving it a try. I avoided it for years because of the whole god/higher power thing but in my experience that was blown way out of proportion by people who had a bad experience or no experience at all with the program. I don't believe in a traditional god I don't think there's someone out there guiding my life and worried about what I do or how I live my life. Anyway this is getting long-winded. Congratulations on becoming a father! It's an incredible experience and I hope you find a way to stay sober be happy and be an excellent parent.   
For me I stopped drinking completely both times I was pregnant and it was really easy.  However the second I wasn't pregnant any more and drinking was back on the table it negatively impacted my primary goal of being a good parent.  After one drink I would hold that goal more and more loosely and I believe that if I hadn't stopped when I did I would have ended up doing just as fucked up and shitty a job as my alcoholic dad.  I missed out on some beautiful golden moments because I was impatient for the babies to get to sleep so I could drink.  Or because I wanted to see if the beach shack sold wine.  Or because I'd stayed up too late the night before drinking and couldn't be bothered to get down on the floor and play when my babies were begging me to.  I wasn't an every day drinker either but I know that if I kept going I would have been.  As far as waiting for 9 months I would encourage you to think about whether the excitement and joy or the journey you're starting on is something you want to be blurred by blackouts and binging and regret? Instead of thinking about doing it for the baby think about doing it right now for yourself so that you don't miss out...  
I continued to drink after I had my daughter. I am a single mom so I kept it to weekends she went to her dads house. I was also very young so it seemed like the normal thing to be doing. ..My daughter is soon turning 15. I spent a few years sober in that time but now that she is self sufficient my drinking started spiralling to a whole new level. I still only drank when she went for sleepovers or was away from home and I have never kept booze in the house...BUT to stop my blackouts I started using drugs. Mostly cocaine but other stuff if it was offered to me. I would be hung over and strung out the next day and I wasn't able to do all the fun stuff together that we used to do and at first it seemed ok because she is a teen and she doesn't really want to go to the zoo or the pool anymore anyway. ..I couldn't handle to deep depression and anxiety however and my hangovers were carrying on until Tuesday (drank on Friday) so negatively impacting my performance at work. ..Also I realized in a few short years she will be out of the house and on her own soon and I knew I'd be in big trouble with my substance issues then. ..When I told my daughter I am quitting drinking and going to AA she laughed her ass off at me- but she has no clue I drank a half a bottle of gin and snorted a gram or more of blow up my nose the night before. ..Now I am quitting not just for her but for my future too. ..My point is I think that a kid isn't enough to make you quit. All the kids in social services and foster homes make that clear. I am pretty damned glad I kept my shit together enough to be a decent mom- but barely. Quit for yourself and you'll be an A+ dad. Good luck! 
It was hard to quit. One day though a bunch of things hit me at once. I knew I didn't want it to be normal for his dad to drink wine every night. I'm going to fuck the kid up plenty just by virtue of who I am. : ) Why make it that much harder on him if I can avoid it? And if he's not worth that commitment to me what kind of piece of shit am I? . .  . Seems obvious / simple in retrospect. But I didn't quit until he'd been home from the hospital (after a very long NICU stay) for three months. ..Now I'm proud that whatever my fuck-ups as a parent will be this won't be one of them. Plus waking up w him at all hours and having early mornings w him SOBER is a good feeling. ..You will see. : ) 
I checked myself into rehab 1 month before my son's 8th birthday (1 year ago in Feb).  He was well aware of my problem by then.  His father motioned for full custody while I was there and we've been battling ever since.  It actually helped me stay sober.  He deserves for me to be present and clear minded.  His father checked into rehab last week for drug addiction.  Oh  the irony.  Truth is  your kid will love you in spite of your short comings  but it will greatly affect them sooner or later.  I quit for me  but I stay sober so that I can be the mother he deserves.
