Hello guys! Hope you're doing well?..I'm doing okay in college and the new city. But I also feel more vulnerable in my sorbiety. College life revolves around drinking and even though I don't feel any peer pressure to drink I feel like I'm peer pressuring myself in some way. A small voice nagging in my head: "You don't fit in you're not like them!" and it's driving me crazy. It shouldn't bother me the way it does. Also a few nights ago I had a drinking dream which I ENJOYED. That scared the crap out of me and I felt uneasy all day. Also have been feeling some major almost physical cravings. Like a thirst. But at the same time alcohol seems so far away from me now even though it's everywhere. Maybe that's the reason my brain has ereased all the bad memories from drinking which scares me even more...I've attended meetings here but have been coming up with way too many excuses not to go lately. So I went tonight and signed up for a list for hospital/detox visits so I can reach out and help someone else rather than wallow in my own self pity. I don't know what I want with this post really just some tough love from you guys? Put my thoughts into perspective? I'm just really thankful of how aware I am of my way of thinking. I recognize it. I feel like this each time I'm about to relapse. But I don't want to. Dear God I don't. I've come so far during this year...**Update:** Thank you so much for your comments. Really meas a lot to me and as of now I feel better. I tested the whole HALT thing on myself and sure enough I was TIRED. Also drank a LOT of water. :) I'm going to visit my family in a few hours which will be nice. Love you all. <3

The reason I relapsed after 15 continuous years of sobriety is that I retained a mental reservation that I was not an alcoholic but I am.  My relapse cost me most of the material things in my life it endangered my health and others.  My relapse nearly destroyed my family.  I doubt that knowing any of this will stop you or anyone else on the verge of relapse--only you can identify the "reservation" within yourself and analyze it honestly for the Big Lie that it probably is.  I wish I had done that and I wish I had taken my concerns into a local AA meeting and sought support--perhaps the ashes and tears would have been spared.  ..In my experience there is nothing at all out there for the relapsing alcoholic except hospitals detox jails and funeral homes.
Sounds like you are working to keep your recovery on track.   Keep doing
Keep choosing life Prkle. You have sufficient evidence to know that the thirst can't be quenched by alcohol. If it was me I would dig into that feeling of *need* and work out what's going on.
Nobody needs to drink to fit in and if they do then they're hanging with a crappy crowd. But I suspect you already know this...Reach out. Other people keep me sober. And by people I mean recovering alcoholics. You did that by making this post. You say you're going to AA. These are the right moves IMO. ..That's about as much wisdom as I've got. But I'm rooting for you. I believe in you! Don't let the drinking voice win.
I know it doesn't feel like it but college is a really short time in your life. If you spend the next few years studying networking and building your career you will not regret it. Hell look on the financial independence subreddit and map out your retirement at 30. 
Fantastic post! You are doing the right thing by coming here to post going to meetings and reaching out in service to others. You are taking action to prevent a relapse. Your feelings are just feelings if you keep one foot in front of the other they will pass and change and evolve as they always do. When I feel the slightest bit wonky now I reach out to my sponsor or another alcoholic IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting for the last possible second and rolling the dice that I will remember my toolbox instead of reaching for a drink first. Before my relapse I isolated myself and kept quiet until I was in so much pain I panicked. Acting before I **need** to has been gold for me. Sounds like what you are doing now there's no such thing as too much recovery :)
Identified a problem. Reached out for support. Found and implemented a solution. To me that looks like a solid win /u/Prkle ! Going even farther in your second year!..I live near a university consistently ranked among the top party schools. They've got an excellent [recovery center](http://www.colorado.edu/recoverycenter/) that is part of the growing movement of campus sobriety.
