I'm going to give this a go. Mostly for health reasons but also I've noticed im a huge asshole when i drink and i have a much shorter fuse than normal. I want that to stop. Im 34 and i have been drinking pretty much every weekend since i was 16. I dont know if that makes me an alcoholic but take that as you will. I have tried not drinking before and the most i have gone is 3 weeks and in those 3 weeks i felt great. Ive noticed every time i try to quit i relapse and i know i have no one else to blame but myself for that.  One thing i have found that makes it difficult to stop is that almoat everyone i socialize woth drinks. Almost all drink heavily. How do you all deal with being around all the temptation when socializing with friends/family? Do you just shut them out entirely? Any tips or tricks on how to deal with this?

I was able to stop drinking and get sober by doing the things [at this link to a post called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  By getting active in recovery from the outset I quickly created a "tribe" of sober friends who really helped me negotiate the crazy drinking friends and family challenges.  
When I was not comfortable with being a non-drinker when I first quit since it was all very new and scary I avoided any event where I thought I might be tempted to drink.  After a few months I started to do what I normally did again which sometimes involved restaurants or social events where alcohol was present but by that point I had no desire to drink.  I don't envy drinkers or want to do what they're doing.  When I decided to quit it was because I did not want to drink anymore so seeing others partake doesn't affect my decision for myself and my life.  What they do has nothing to do with me or my life.
I try to maintain relationships but also keep myself from temptation...To do this I socialize with friends and family during events that revolve around something other than drinking and leave once that event is over.  For example I will go with them to a baseball game but i will not go to the bar before or after the baseball game. ..Usually everyone is drinking during these events but there is something to focus on...I also remind myself to not bring anyone's mood down because I'm not drinking.  Most people get giddy when drinking and I rather leave than be a sourpuss.  It's my problem/decision to stop drinking not anyone else's.
If you really want to stop drinking then a switch has to go off in your head that it's never going to happen again no matter what...Being sober also has an underrated benefit in that you are free to drive a car at any time. If you're not feeling it anymore you have the luxury of calling it a night and just going home.
I had to change my habits and followed the 'dry people/ dry places' advice for about the first 3 months or so. As a result I'm happy socialising where booze is served don't get tempted however I don't go to events where alcohol is the main attraction any longer...I don't see some friends as much as a result but sometimes in life you've got to do what you've got to do...
