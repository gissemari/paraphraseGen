The past couple weeks have been hard..been on the course for about 9 months now...I work at a very very busy dive bar. I see people having a great time all day/night. I miss being a part of the fun and the good times. Every time I walk into the cooler all the vodka is staring at me just saying "one shot won't hurt" take the edge off pass the time quicker...it's a constant fight.

It's amazing to me that you've gone 9 months working in those conditions. Any chance of a job change? I don't think I could handle that. Sending internet strength your way today.
You've done great so far. What else do you like to do outside of work?
Don't forget that what you are witnessing at work is but a small window of time. The hangovers regrets failed relationships and declining health may not be on display. I know I would drink and appear happy to anyone looking but the reality of what I was feeling was very different. ..It's tough to be around that though and not be tempted. Not sure what to say except hang in there. Sober life is pretty awesome.
