* A good night's sleep..* No more working while hungover..* More money..* Not having to lie constantly..* Having the time/interest for hobbies..If there were some way to make any one of these things a corporeal object that I would have to physically give away in return for a bottle of vodka I'd never worry about relapse. I'm grateful for what I have now in this (relatively) short period of sobriety so far for my family and for the fact that I've been given another chance to try and be a better person. I'm grateful that you're all here with me.

These are all great things I'm glad you have them! Congrats on 41 and now 42 days!
42 was a great day for me. I am a little further on and I will tell you it is getting better as well. I feel like I have wasted five years hiding in a bottle (probably more). Not today my friend. Today I won't pick it up. I won't drink. 
Love it!
