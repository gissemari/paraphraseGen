Had no problem going months 1 through 4 but had to white knuckle my way through month 5.  Made it to month six which is a personal record...Work is getting really busy for me I've never been in such a bad/angry mood snapped at a boss's boss this morning for no good reason...I routinely find myself getting overly emotional and I'm also gaining weight...Everyone else seems to be flourishing what am I doing wrong?  I have a therapist I see infrequently and she's been very helpful in other areas of my life but has been pretty useless for this.

What kind of stuff do you do for coping/relaxation on a day-to-day basis? 
I got tools and support to address my "Big 7": fear resentment impatience intolerance guilt pride and anger...Now I'm better equipped to notice address and process those in order to be more conscious and purposeful.
I'm right there with you. I just made 6 months myself and I can tell things are getting a little more difficult. I also go to weekly relapse prevention groups and therapist sessions but I've noticed a bit more irritability and just a blanketing feeling of being tired. For me I think it's just the change of seasons it happens every year when summer ends and autumn rolls around I can feel it to my core like a darkness closing in on me that holds me until late spring unless I go on vacation to a nice sunny place. So my advice is to get some sun!! I live in Maryland btw
