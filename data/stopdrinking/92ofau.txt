It's like sometimes I feel sheepish and actually no longer talk about it with anybody. I mean I'm 40 years old now. I kind of feel silly saying "Hey look everybody! I've been acting like a responsible adult for 30 days in a row!!" Just wondering if anyone else has gone through this.

Ha this reminds me of an AA meeting I was in one time where the speaker was talking about how they called their mom to tell them how many days sober they had that they had found a job current on their bills etc. Her response was "these are all things everyone else does." ..It's hard for "normal" people to relate but I think this place is the best place to celebrate milestones. We know how hard it is to string together days without alcohol. I've celebrated with women who have gotten their children back which is an unimaginable situation for most people. While others may not acutely understand we absolutely do. 
Ha! Yes absolutely. I'm nearly at 8 weeks and the only people that I can count on to understand the enormity of this achievement are those at my recovery meetings and the members of SD. ..We're here to celebrate with you  
Literally just posted about this myself. I feel you.
