I'm currently reading  'Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction' by Elizabeth Vargas. My boyfriend downloaded it onto my Kindle for me yesterday and I haven't put it down since. It's a very compelling story of one person's struggle through addiction and anxiety I can really relate to Elizabeth (not being American I'm only familiar with her name rather than her work). Hopefully some of you might pick up a copy really feel it is worth a read.
