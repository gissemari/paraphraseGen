Hi SD. Making an effort to be more involved here. I need the support. Met up with old friends last night didn't want to drink drank anyway. Called my SO and told him I wanted to die. So unfair to him and everyone. Horrible hangover and self-loathing today. I'm trying to forgive myself. Haven't been counting days for a while but I'm starting today again. I want to feel good I want to be happy I want to be my best me. So day 1. I will not drink with you today.

Slip ups happen the important part is that you get back up and try again. .Much love keep moving forward!
Welcome back. I hope you find peace and forgiveness for yourself. We have all fucked up and it is hard to deal with. But you have the present so you can decide to move forward by not going back to that place. 
I spent today trying to love myself through a hangover too.  I want to not feel that way again.  I understand.  Here's to getting back to taking good care of ourselves.  iwndwyt.
