I got home last night with a bottle after a bad day and I ended up calling my mom when I poured the first drink. We ended up talking for about 4 hours and I kept drinking through the call which wasn't the best idea but we talked about a lot of issues that I had been and was drinking and I found out something huge.   ...I always thought my dad had stopped drinking when I was born he actually just hid it from us he didn't drink a lot but when he would go out he would get drunk from time to time. I honestly never knew this and I felt worse before because I thought he was able to do it and I wasn't. Come to find out I am doing better at staying off it than he did. This is a weird feeling but it took a lot of shame away and that I hope will make no drinking easier and relapses less shameful for me.   ...I have started to view relapses as part of the process they should be avoided at all costs but when they happen it is time to look at your history your stress your job and see what could be done to make yourself healthier to build better behaviours and to reflect on what happened. I will not drink with you today I might someday but if I do it will be something I intended to keep learning from.
