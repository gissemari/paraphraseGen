I don't know what's wrong with me. I made so many bad decisions last night the first one being drinking. I don't know what to do. I reset my clock on the nomo app and put in a badge reset request so I guess that's a start. I will not drink with you today.

Don't beat yourself up. Count it as a trip along your road to recovery. Focus on the positivity for starting over again being able to anticipate all the feelings and knowing you're strong enough to move past it. 
You are standing here admitting it and resetting because you're jumping back onto your path!  I am proud of you  and I will not drink with you today!
Welcome back! Nothing is wrong with you. We're in this together one day at a time.
