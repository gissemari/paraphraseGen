Sober for 6 days and not hungover. Coffee is going to serve its intended purpose of making me more productive. Last weekend I ruined a 25 day clean spell Saturday day that consisted of many walks to 7-11 and many beers consumed...that lasted 48 hours..I was worthless because of my hangover on Monday..not much better Tuesday and it really wasn't until Thursday that I felt "normal". I used that as motivation this weekend. I told myself..."remember that moment and every one like it and ask yourself (yes that's sober self talking to addict self) if you really want to keep doing that to yourself." Im going to remember that week as the turning point. I never want to lay there sleepless drinking a beer to fall asleep or to taper after a binge. Want to know what I did during the binge? I sat on the couch and watched TV by myself. Really cool right?..I don't like AA meetings for a personal reason I won't share as to not discourage people who it can help but I did reconnect with an old friend who has 12 years under his belt and is active. i trust him and Just having somebody to talk to who knows where I am (he quit the same age as me (30) with the struggle is great. ..I did lie to myself a bit..I told myself Id start reading Allen Carr and I didn't so I need to change that this week. Other than that Im pretty impressed with myself for a sober weekend...Congrats to the rest of the sober army who made it through this weekend and if you're struggling right now...Dont be too hard on yourself. Tomorrow is a great day to start the rest of your life.

Congrats on the 6 days--each is precious. ..I once was quite a weekend warrior. 5 weekdays seemed the perfect amount of time for me to forget the pain of the previous weekend. The difficulty for me was remembering to remember. The need for a daily routine for sobriety slowly became self-evident...Glad you reconnected with someone who is well into the solution. Stick with the winners!
