I have been struggling with quitting alcohol and meth for 9 months with plenty of relapses. I have been drinking and using for 10 years. I have lost everything in my life. I have lost myself. I am having trouble picking myself back up. Does anyone have any encouraging words? Advice? I don't feel like I have an identity anymore. I don't know what I want in life. My world is consumed by this. Trying to crawl out of this hole alone. Was sober for 52 days and relapsed hard for 2 weeks. The last 9 months of my life have been a living hell. Rehab IOP retreats 90 in 90 sponsorship fellowship big book reading etc etc etc. Am I doomed? Anyone really struggle their first year of attempted sobriety? I appreciate any feedback. ..Thanks.W.

I'm reading a book called Recover! by Stanton Peele PhD.  I'm only on page 28 and it is intriguing and logical.  It's philosophy is rather opposite of the AA approach.  If you are struggling it might be a real breath of fresh air.  IWNDWYT
I struggled with sobriety for a long time. I was a textbook case of a chronic relapser. It was for me a problem of trust. I went through all the motions of A.A. and therapy but I had trouble believing that I was truly capable of changing my stripes. I was so terrified of disappointment that I sabotaged myself repeatedly just to get it over with. ..I changed when I start learning to trust. People in A.A. knew that I had it in me. My therapists my family they all knew I had it in me. The only obstacle was me. I had to face up to the fear of not knowing who sober-me was and just trust in the process of discovery. And I'm still emerging...You're not doomed. Sobriety is difficult anyone who says otherwise is a cheat but it'll always be worth striving for. Just a matter of finding out what your obstacles are and getting over them.
