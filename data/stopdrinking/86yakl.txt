So a friend came over for dinner last night and she loves a drink like I used to. Beforehand I'd let her know I wasn't drinking but that it was okay to bring something for herself if she wanted to...I know this might sound like a bad idea but the reality is there are 3 pubs and a bottle shop within 5 minutes walk from my house so if I want a drink at almost anytime I can get one. Also given the pervasive alcohol culture where I live I've got no hope of avoiding situations where there's alcohol unless I want to be hermit...She arrived and had obviously had a few before she got to mine; we started with some sashimi and she broke out a nice bottle of saki (she'd also bought a bottle of red) and she asked several times over the course of the night if I wanted some. Despite being tempted a bit at first I didn't...The way I've been feeling lately I really thought last night was the night that I'd relapse but I didn't...Thank you r/stopdrinking - IWNDWYT!

Well done!!  .I had a very similar experience tonight. .I didn't drink either and this has been my biggest trip-up (i.e. drinking with my best friend/wine drinking buddy). .Feels so good I pushed through using ALL my tools + wanting sobriety more than those 3 glasses of wine..Yay for us!! IWNDWYT.
Good on you for sticking to your guns!.Nice NDV you earned yourself:D.IWNDWYT 
I found hanging around my drinking people super boring when I was sober.....A lot of the shine wears off when I see the drunkeness. Its usually at the three drink point.
