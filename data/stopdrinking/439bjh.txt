I already made a post this morning but I wanted to share a personal triumph :). I know it might be TMI but I had only showered ONCE since my relapse...that's right folks once in 10 days! I'd cleaned my bits and bobs and such and always made sure to brush my teeth and wear deodorant...but I was damned if I was going to shower...last night I made the link (other than not having self care whilst in the midst of my relapses)...I ALWAYS and without fail would shower when I'd had "too many".....Well I faced my "fear" jumped in the shower and started repeating positive things I was feeling aloud to myself in an effort to to de-stigmatize the "dreaded" shower. I feel amazing!!! ..Yay me. Baby steps!

:) Congratulations on 10 days.
Congrats!! One step at a time I was like that too. Now I use it as a relaxing/me time. I hang some herbs from the shower head so when it gets steamy you can really smells them (eucalyptus or lavender) I get put on some teeth whitening stuff (eventually spitting out cuz it tastes horrible lol) shave my legs and think happy thoughts and positive things oh and I generally have some jams playing lol...High Five!!
