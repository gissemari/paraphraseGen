Being at work all day had me so busy I couldn't even think about anything but work. However the moment I was headed home I wanted to get a drink or more honestly a pint of whiskey. The pint has been my choice the past year because i was limited myself. Unfortunately as the night wore on at home and my wife and daughters yelled at each other I would get in my car drunk and go get another half-pint.....and not feel well the next day...So off to the gym shortly for some alone time. Need to just power through the rest of the day so I can start day three sober tomorrow...

That's awesome that you didn't give in. Hope you're patting yourself on the back right now. I think you'll feel a lot better after the gym. I always do. 
26 hours for me and you're right a struggle indeed. I just keep reminding myself-- why i'm doing this. The chaos is too much time to give your mind and body sometime to rest.   
Kudos for two days. Step to the sidebar if you'd like a badge.---------------&gt;  ..Exercise helped me as did having a therapist and going to support group meetings. Stay in touch. Thanks for your post.
