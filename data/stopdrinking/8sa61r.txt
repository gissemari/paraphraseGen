God this has been a rollercoaster. Getting cravings really badly. Walking by the 7-11 I almost stopped in and got my daily box wine. ..Pushing through but I have one of my best friends weddings this weekend- and it's at a fucking brewery. I'm a high functioning alcoholic so no one (other than my significant other) knows that I've been struggling to stop. ..What's a good strategy to avoid drinking at this thing? I'm often the party guy of the group so the temptation is going to be extremely high.

Well I'm similar in a lot of ways you just described. I'm 6 days sober and as much as it may suck I'd avoid the wedding altogether. I know weddings are awesome but if you're serious about quitting in such a fragile stage of the process the wedding will be too much for you right now. If you were already say 6months to a year into your journey I'd say you've got this! ..I'm not at all trying to sound like I'm demeaning your strength of character I just know myself and your post sounded like something I would post and if it were me I wouldn't even go. Like I said tomorrow will be day 7 for me so if I got invited to a wedding at a brewery next week I would decline. If just walking by a 7-11 and battling with yourself to go in to get box wine or not was a real struggle imagine the struggle to watch those around you tempting you at a wedding!? It sounds like a level of hell from Dante's inferno IMO. I wouldn't want to endure that kind of torture. I just wouldn't feel ready yet. I know it sounds like a crummy option but it is an option you could take nevertheless. ..What I used to do in the past when I quit before my dad was teaching me how to brew beer and I would fill and cap sterilized bottles that looked like beer with topo Chico and when I'd go to a function I would decline other's drinks because  I'd have brought my own.  So to others I was drinking and to me it felt like I was drinking but in reality I was just getting wildly hydrated and digesting a healthy level of calcium! So that's an option as well? ..Good luck mate and if you do end up going and get tempted message us in this sub! I will not drink with you at the wedding! I'll be your cheerleader through the process in this digital platform! 
That is indeed a tricky proposition so early in sobriety but it can most assuredly be done.....[The Myth Of The Functioning Alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45bndo/the_myth_of_the_functioning_alcoholic/) describes the typical trajectory of a drinking problem very accurately... I made it well into Stage 3 before I stopped and it was awful! Wouldn't recommend it......I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look.....Perhaps some of the [past posts about weddings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=wedding&amp;restrict_sr=on) might give you some inspiration.....It's a good idea to keep a non-alcoholic beverage in your hand at all times and rehearse what you might say if someone offers you a drink... Don't fool yourself into thinking that you can '*Just have One*' it doesn't work like that! Also it might be prudent to leave early before things start to get too sloppy and if you feel your resolve wavering take a minute to come here and talk about it instead of caving in.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Oh hi there twin! 3 days here and wedding this weekend as well. Wine also my vice. I also consider myself "high functioning"...Here's my plan: lots of seltzer water with lime. Coffee after dinner to keep the energy going on the dance floor. ..I've been to a couple weddings sober and let me tell you they were some of my very favorite weddings. I "let loose" with all those who were drinking and didn't get the energy drop that inevitably comes after a few too many drinks. I danced like an idiot and felt more alive than I had in a long while. Better yet I get to fully enjoy the brunch on Sunday morning and didn't have anxiety on the flight home. ..Someone offers you a shot or drink? With a big smile "oh man thanks! i'm good for now though." ..Let's do this!
