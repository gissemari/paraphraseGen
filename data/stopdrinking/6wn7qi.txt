Day 11 without alcohol. Still in hospital for depression and suicidal thourghts. Lost track of how long ive been in here. Im sick of depression idk how much longer i can live with it. I am really struggling. Hospital is boring i no they r here to help me but im getting sick of being in hospital. I no i am better off in here than i am out of hospital atm. I am still very much depressed and feeling alone and like im just not worth being here or like ppl dont care. I my thourghts and feelings r not correct but thats how i feel. Tbh i seem to think about drinking or using or suicide alot lately. I no ppl care but i just dont feel like ppl care im just sick of feeling depressed all the time. No doubt im not fun to be around when depressed. I try to act happy but it never works. When will it all stop? I wake up daily and i want to die.  i wake and have thourghts of drinking or using. Sure i no they dont help i guess my mind tricks me in to remembering all the good times and feelings that come with drinking and using. I feel like i just bother everyone.

* What kind of depression do you have? Is it due to a personality disorder? Clinical depression? "Just" depression?..* Being in hospital doesn't magically fix any condition right away. Diagnosis and treatment take time...* People are overwhelmingly good. Most everyone you see or meet cares. Not everyone has time to do something with it. Saying "hospital" is short for saying "the place where people work who studied long and hard to do a job where they get to help people but are now by themselves doing the job of 5 people". Hospital staff is *always* severely cut with many people pulling 12-16 hour shifts. They care but the nurses you see day to day to got to do their shit or *everybody* suffers..* Not drinking may not fix the depression but drinking doesn't fix it either *and* makes it worse (alcohol = depressor)
Be well in there. You're in the right place to be for right now.
