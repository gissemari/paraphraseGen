Just wanted to have it said. Funny how time flies past...It's been one Hell of an emotional rollercoaster but the lessons were great and what I learned from stopdrinkinged has been so valuable. It taught me that deprivation is not always bad and that sometimes you just have to say no to yourself. I used those lessons to very successfully lose 43 kg last year and today I'm not only sober but for the first time in my life normal weight as well...Haven't posted in here for quite the while barely at all with this username even but I want to say thank you anyway for being there in what was easily the most difficult time in my life so far. Got a long way to go still until I can comfortably feel like a "real" person but I would never have come this far without you guys and this struggle...And for those who are still in the early stages of your process I say: hang in there. It gets easier and it's worth it!
