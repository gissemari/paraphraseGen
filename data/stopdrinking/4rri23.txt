Today I went to my usual bi-weekly therapy appointment. I've been seeing this therapist for quite some time and she has helped me a lot with my depression and drinking issues. I told her that tomorrow I will have one week sober.  ..She said she was proud of me. But then we got deeper into the discussion and essentially she told me that therapy and meds alone are not enough and if I don't want to relapse again I need to seek additional treatment. I was shocked. Rehab was the LAST thing from my mind. I can barely call myself an alcoholic and here she is suggesting I do two weeks of outpatient rehab...  ..At the end of the session (after a lot of crying and long pregnant pauses) I agreed to go. I have to talk to my parents about the healthcare and get a note to give to my job but... yeah. I'm going. Never in a million years did I think I would be doing this. I told my therapist I was afraid. She put it like this: "What are you more afraid of? Doing two weeks in a program that will help you or going back to drinking again and dealing with the perhaps fatal consequences?" That did me in.  ..Anyways I wanted to post because I love this community and other than my BF and parents I can't share this with anyone. Thanks guys.

I was terrified at the thought of going to a 35 day inpatient program...I thought they were be ordering me around. I wanted to be an independent woman!..But alcohol was controlling me. I needed help...After I got out I did two weeks of outpatient (10 days Monday to Friday 9-5) and loved it...Do you feel betrayed by your therapist?
