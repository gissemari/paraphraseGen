Giraldo was candid about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction and the challenges of life on the road. In 2005 he said "I would go on the road and live like a fucking maniac that's just the way it was. And then eventually it starts bleeding into your regular life. At first it starts out on the road and it's no big deal. So you keep denying that you're about to destroy your children's lives because it's happening in Phoenix as opposed to home. Slowly but surely though it starts impacting everything and then you have decisions to make. There's part of me that wants to be an uninhibited unrestrained lunatic doing whatever I want. Frankly that was a lot of the fun of it at the beginning. You hear people make grand artistic statements about why they love stand-up. But really you're choosing to tell dick jokes in a nightclub for a living. So if you go on the road and get fucked up all the time you have to take everything that comes with that. You can't have it both ways. You have to be a reasonable adult or a maniacal party road machine.
