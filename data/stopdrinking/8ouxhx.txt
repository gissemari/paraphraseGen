I quit drinking roughly a week ago because I am trying to lose a significant amount of weight and I realized that drinking was becoming an addiction that was fueling my food addiction and binging tendencies. I went for a long bike ride today and then a long walk after and ended up close to one of my favorite bars. ..I should add for background info: I don't consider my drinking days as full blown alcoholism I consider myself in that  grey area  of addiction; I definitely had urges that I didn't attempt to resist but I didn't drink everyday. When I did drink though it was always to excess and in combination with a large amount of food (sometimes 3x my daily calorie limit). I went sober for 18 months before my 21st birthday had a few drinks on the actual day I was 21 and then it's been a slow descent since then. I've gained 40-50 pounds and haven't gone a week without at least drinking to excess once; most weeks had 3-4 days where I'd have 5-6 beers or multiple shots of liquor. I've come to terms with my addictive tendencies and have been working at replacing alcohol and unhealthy food with exercise and a healthier diet. ..But today was a tough one it was the first day since I quit drinking again that I had a very very serious urge. I ended up at this bar by myself and sat at the counter. I knew if I had one beer I'd want 3-4 at least I can't stop at one. It took a lot of will power but when the bartender asked me what I wanted I simply asked for an iced tea and a plate of small fries (which I only ate half of definitely would've polished them off had I been under the influence). The feeling of saying no and drinking that iced tea felt better than any level of drunk I've ever felt. I know I'll have hard urges to resist again in the future but I'm happy with this streak I've started. ..If anyone out there is struggling with food addiction and alcoholism simultaneously I'd love to hear your stories the two seem to go hand in hand for a lot of people. I'll believe in myself the way you all have shown you believed in yourselves! .

You did real good! ..Next time side salad - NO dressing. Just kiddin'  ..Way to go! 
At one week sober I stayed out of bars. It made sobriety easier.
