Clean house embroider (my hobby) read books work out answer phone calls...Things I do when I'm sober: all of those things plus eat a lot of junk food (but that's still healthier than alcohol and I'm choosing my battles right now). ..I have to remember that it's worth the struggle. Failed last night but IWNDWYT.

My home is very clean when I'm sober!
During my drinking career I believed a lot of things about myself that have proven untrue since sobering up: one of them was  I'm too tired to do chores on weeknights.  This included any kind of housework other than cooking and cleaning up after myself. This left me with an unmanageable amount of work to do on the weekends and my house was a mess pretty much all the time...Now I come home from work and tidy up do a load of laundry dishes etc. The truth was that having a glass of wine when I walked in the door made it much more difficult to manage any of those things which now seem incredibly easy...IWNDWYT
I did a lot of cleaning this weekend when I was sober. It feels pretty good. Next weekend I plan to tackle cleaning the refrigerator (big excitement!)
I love to read and I can't read drunk. It's almost the crown jewel for me when I stopped drinking.
