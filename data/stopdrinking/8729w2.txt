I feel like I did so so well the first 30 days and now I am struggling so bad. I just don't know how to have fun sober anymore. I was really put to the test this weekend. I spent the weekend visiting my parents and they drink like I used to. I felt like I was missing out the whole time. I don't know how to change this mindset of "missing out". I am so tired of feeling like I need alcohol to have fun. Any tips?

Just think back to how you were at your lowest point while drinking.  Do you want to go back to that place again?  I know I don't!  We can do this.  I know it's not easy but it is so worth it to carry on and you have done so well to get to 35 days!  :) IWNDWYT

I had to also focus on the facts: .1) I don't want to get back what I had before.2) don't shortchange myself.3) **stick with the program**; I have no idea and can not grasp what's around the corner in my present state of mind work my program do the next  right' thing profit.  ..That saved my hide.  I'm able to have better perspective from here this spot today; going into the future facing any uncertainty I can always refer to the facts to sustain me.  ..IWNDWYT
