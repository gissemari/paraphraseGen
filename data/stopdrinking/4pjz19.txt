Pray for me extremely nervous walking back into the room after being away so long (and relapsing after years of sobriety). 5 minutes 'til we start just want some good vibes. Thank you.

Sending good vibes your way
Internet good vibes coming to you!
Hope it went well!
I am sure you were welcomed. Glad you are back on track.
Feel better now? 
Good on you to be back! Keep us posted.
Thanks everyone. I've never regretted going to a meeting and today was no exception. Tonight I feel empowered in a way that's hard to describe but it's a feeling I've been missing for several months (I've been away from the program for 6 or so months). I also shared for the first time which surprised even me so thank you again for the positive thoughts it really means a lot.
