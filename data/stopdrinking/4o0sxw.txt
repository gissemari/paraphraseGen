I have been struggling with alcohol for a while now. I've just finished my university degree and so often drinking gets dismissed as being part of university life. Especially here in the UK. However I feel like my relationship with alcohol has gone way too far now. Today is the day that things need to change.      ..I think initially I want to cut day to day drinking out and just drink at social occasions. However I know that approach is sometimes looked down upon. Does anyone have any advice?          ..Also I read someone else's thread where they recommended The Naked Mind which I have just downloaded from Amazon. This community is great and it feels good to know that there are other people out there at different stages in their sobriety.

Hi there. I too went to Uni in the UK and towards the end was aware that drinking was a problem for me. I waited another 8 years to stop. I could have saved myself a lot of unhappiness if I'd managed to stop around your age (I'm assuming you're 20-22?). I tried moderation throughout uni promising myself to just drink one day a week or just four beers at a time and various other rules and regulations I set myself. I wasn't able to do it. I only truly got a handle on my life when I stopped completely in January. I know my badge says 1 but I had 5 months until a couple days ago when shit got real in my life. I already realise that I didn't need to drink through that. Good luck mate
Welcome /u/stopdrinkingacc -- here's my [Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which sets out some basic ideas based on my experiences of stopping drinking and getting sober. Good luck to you jump in the lifeboat!
&gt; I want to cut day the day drinking out and just drink at social occasions. However I know that approach is sometimes looked down upon. Does anyone have any advice? ..It's not frowned upon. The sidebar says that: "We welcome anyone who wishes to join in by asking for advice sharing our experiences and stories or just encouraging someone who is trying to quit or cut down."..It's just that I like many others have concluded that this method was not effective for me. To be honest I have doubts that it will work well for anyone with a similar problem but you can try it. Monitor your drinking carefully and take notice if you start breaking your own rules.
