I have been sober since my ridiculous alcohol fueled  trip to Reno 4 days ago. While everyone was being somewhat responsible I was pounding vodka getting lost in neighborhoods looking for cheap thrills..I had been in a relapse since April after I was 10 months sober.  I never have had friends till me they were worried..Most of my screw ups have been kept between My Wife and I. This time I had a friend who went to Reno tell me I really scared him. He said a bunch of the guys from the trip were worried about me. He said he was there for me if I needed to talk after I told him I am sober again..Felt good but was really a reality check. I am so uncomfortable in my skin right now. I feel like everyone is talking about me. This is hard. Time will help me. Thanks all.

It's really hard. Sitting through that first week is terrible...What resources or coping skills were you using during your almost one year of sobriety?
The burning shame is something I guess we're all familiar with but from an objective perspective I can see some positives here. They said they were worried not utterly embarrassed of you. They said they were there for support not wanting to abandon you. And lastly the reality check has kicked off a new beginning for you. They likely had one or two conversations  (like they said out of concern) but are now busy getting on with their own lives. Good luck.
