And I know they sometimes visit here. So whilst this may not be the place for this post just in case they do visit I want them to know that I care - they have done this before and they can do it again. Whatever has happened someone in this space has done it too - thinking about me probably done it shed loads. And them some. I don't want them to be alone so this is my shout out to all of us struggling with sobriety. It's easier with someone there for you. You can do it. And I am truly grateful for all the support I have received whilst struggling too.
