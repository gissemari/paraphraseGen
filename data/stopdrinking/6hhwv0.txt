I'm struggling so hard not to drink. The withdrawal is awful. How do you stop this? I've thrown up 3 times today. How long do I have to ride it out when do things start to get better?

The best way to answer any of those questions is to go see a doctor.  Everybody is different and their physical dependence on alcohol can't be gauged over the internet.  My road to recovery is different from yours and yours will be different from others'.  We'll all be here for you but seriously a doctor will help most.
There is no medical advice on S/D.  It's best to talk to a Dr.  Some people who are heavy drinkers can get D.T.s and have seizures or die during withdrawal.  I didn't sleep well on night one. I had been slowly sipping a wine bottle sometimes more maximum over 12 hours 2 bottles.  Each night the sleep got better.  That's it for me.  
See a doctor. That is the only thing that helped me. It takes awhile to get better. For me it took about 4 months before I started feeling hopeful. Those four months sucked not gonna lie. But what was so great about the months before that? They also fucking blew. ..I did nearly die. In fact I spoke about it in detail yesterday... [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6ha7s8/they_say_its_all_in_the_eyes/) post. ***Please*** take care of yourself. I will not drink with you. 
Maybe try detoxing at a hospital. Luckily I went through withdrawals in rehab so I had medical attention 
&gt; when do things start to get better?..While you don't believe it now they have already started to get better!  You'll be feeling pretty good by day-6.  Just remember your post today so you never have to feel this way again.  It gets easier and a whole lot better in time.  Good luck to you!
I'm thinking of you today. I hope you feel improvement very soon. 
Please get medical care if you need it!  I remember reading your post from a few days ago and it seems that you're reluctant to see a doctor because you're worried about being labeled an alcoholic for insurance purposes.  Even if you are labeled as such I doubt that will ever be an insurmountable issue.  Cross that bridge if and when you come to it.  Your current health situation is far more important!   
Please consider seeing a doctor ASAP - even if that means going to the emergency room. Getting medical attention won't just help keep you safe it will also help you feel a lot better too.
