My husband is stage 4 renal stage dialysis is will start soon.  He was very sick last week his diuretics wiped him out and he was hospitalized to get his electrolytes potassium calcium magnesium up to par.  His meds have changed and he's home but not having a good week. Yesterday was spent calling a plethora of doctors and nurses to change ONE prescription so our insurance would cover it This has been on going since Saturday finally got someone to take care of it.  This was the tipping point that resulted in sobs and fermented grape sauce. ..I'm resigning from my construction accounting position and working from home permanently -so I can take care of my husband and run our business . My children are in college.  I'm fortunate we are financially stable.  I've been hitting the wine bottles again I need to stop this.  I was doing well this year.  There's an empty 1.5 liter of Woodbridge in the trash this morning...Please send good vibes zen prayers chants etc my way.  I need to pull myself together.  I have a call into my doctor I may need to get on a very small dose of Ativan to take the edge off.  Tears are welling up as I type this....thanks for reading my friends...           ..IWNDWYT
