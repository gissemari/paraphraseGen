Alcoholism is a family disease for me. My brothers and I all have issues with addiction. When I was talking to one of my brothers today he said our other brother is living in a flop house with just the things in his back. He sold his running car for $300. .I wish I could bottle up willingness and give it to my brother. Sometimes I have guilt that I'm sober and he's struggled to get sobriety. I know this is something outside of my control and I have to give up any sense of control I think I have over the situation but the waves of guilt are so hard. .I'm glad you are all here collectively not drinking together today.

I'm glad you're here too shibantics.  Glad I'm here not drinking with you.

Considering that you are sober when everyone in your family is still struggling makes your 535 even a bigger accomplishment.   ..I guess you are feeling survivors guilt in a way. You obviously rationally know that your brother's situation is not your fault and that you have no control over his drinking yet you still feel guilty. Try to let it go I guess. Continue doing your thing and maybe he will want what you have. Attraction not promotion. IWDWYT.
It's so hard to watch ones we love slide downhill.  I'm sorry.  I do believe the best thing I can do is enjoy life sober as a signal to others that it is possible.  A friend of mine rocking sober life was a real motivator for me.
