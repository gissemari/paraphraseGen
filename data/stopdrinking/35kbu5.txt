Lately I've been thinking "Man seems like it's taken forever to get to 2 weeks."..Only when I commented on another post did I see my flair showing 3 weeks! What a great surprise!..Even though it's not directed to me the sincere caring many of you respond to others' struggles is truly inspiring to read...Thank you all for all the encouragement.
