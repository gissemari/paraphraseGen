OK OK so it's probably not the best of the whole entire *year*...  ..http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2qqlwv/so_it_finally_happened_i_relapsed/cn8pn83..But it's pretty damned good no?.

Well articulated and illustrated how those pics were mated.
I'm crying laughing over my breakfast. /u/kansyk GETS IT. ..Do we have a hall of fame for stuff like this?
Best comment of the year. Even had a cat. Grade A stuff. 
That comment and [this reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2qqlwv/so_it_finally_happened_i_relapsed/cn8r66o) had me giggling.  With a hangover...Definitely HOF material!
Thanks for the link!  I read that thread before the boatiful post.  Made me snort at least twice.
