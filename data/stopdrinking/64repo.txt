I've been reading this sub for awhile decided to finally join...I typed Day 2 with a sad realization that I most likely won't make it further than a week. I'm not trying to be a downer or anything I just want to recognize that this will be a struggle...I went to a concert last night and surprisingly did not have a drink! We went out for dinner afterwards where I was sure I would have a cocktail but the urge never came. I had a great time anyways.  It was a small victory but showed me that I truly did not need alcohol to have a good time...Thanks for reading and I will not drink with you all today!

Don't even look far into the future. 24 hours at a time is all that matters. Good luck not drinking with you. 
I am struggling also keep coming back. I am trying to just focus on today. I am back on day 1 and determined to get through. 
Don't think about a week.....just today. I know it sounds cliche but it's true. Sounds like you already made it thru some major hurdles! I won't drink with you today!
here's hoping you fail and relapse!
