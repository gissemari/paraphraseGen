Long story short I asked for a reset a few days ago after I relapsed really hard. I am on day 3 of a crushing hangover and even though I am suddenly eating non-stop (my digestion was destroyed up until about yesterday morning) I am dealing with intense feelings of nervousness depression and disappointment...I know I can do this I've done it before and I know I'll get there. I miss the feeling of feeling healthy and sober so much I honestly could cry. I want nothing more than for this current feeling to pass. Why I do this to myself knowing how much it hurts I just don't know. But i'm trying to learn from my failures and become a stronger person. All that being said... f*ck alcohol!!!!! I will not drink with you today.

You'll be through the worst of it in a few days. It sounds like you've been through this before...It's hell. I know. Hang in there hour by hour if you have to.
I'm rooting for you!!
I'm sorry you're going through this - I can completely relate to the horrible anxiety depression and racing thoughts that come with a hangover along with of course the regret and self-blame that come with wondering why you put yourself in that position to begin with. It will pass and you will be okay. It might be hard to remember right now but it's true! Don't beat yourself up for slipping up or making mistakes; I've been there so many times and I'd bet most of the people in this community have. Slipping up doesn't make us weak or bad people. It does however make us all the more appreciative of our successes when we have them.  ..I'm rooting for you! IWNDWYT.
