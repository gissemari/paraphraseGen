TL;DR: 9 days sober after a steaming shit-show of a relapse. Feels good to be back here..*******************************************.So a while back (121 days ago according to my badge) I came here and professed that I needed to stop drinking for my health. Doctor's orders etc...Welp that didn't work...I "cut back" enough so that my blood work showed positive change at my next doctor's appointment. Goal achieved right? Nope...I went right back to my old habits  getting shit-faced and pissing all over myself...Lot's of family stress over the Thanksgiving holiday made it worse. Friday November 30th was the straw that broke the camel's back...After 8 vodka seltzers I was blackout drunk...Saturday December 1st I recouped. No drinking. Of course I felt like a bag of mashed up assholes...The next day I was confronted by an already stressed nuclear family (we've got an ailing grandmother in hospital)...Words were said. Emotions high. I'd fucked up for the last time...And I'm doing it. 9 days as of today. It's been hard. and I don't feel great... yet...But I'm doing well so far. I keep thinking about this sub and all you folks and I'm appreciative...IWNDWYT. (And this time I mean it!)
