Hi all first post for me I am coming up to one month since I last had a drink. For years I would work through the week without drinking usually and look forward to getting buzzed after work on Friday. I have a huge tolerance for alcohol and of course I never stopped at getting buzzed. Lately it has been a lot more than just Friday I wasn't lying to myself I just didn't care as I never hurt anyone but myself (physically anyway...).  Lurking here has been very helpful as I see myself reflected in so many posts. I recognise the behaviour the shame anxiety and self disregard that comes from being what I am..I was always the last guy standing at the party (whether there was a party or not) for no other reason than I just didn't know when to lie down and go to sleep due to my high tolerance. Terrible sleep for a few hours or less then get up do the housework grocery shopping sports just get through the day. I wouldn't drink on a hangover unless on holiday that made it worse..This is progressive blackouts were becoming something I was starting to accept and that terrifies me the most so I stopped after one last bender on the 27th of January. I just knew I was done haven't struggled yet but I know it will creep back in if I don't talk about it .My wife doesnt get drunk I cannot really talk to her about this for reasons. It's funny she is cheating on her low carb diet tonight and I could say why don't I cheat then - I know I am doing ok as the thought passed right on through my head and made me laugh..Thanks for the help so far talking will helpand I hope I can help others down the road..

You have the voice... as do we all...My voice said I was a grown ass man who had been to war and if I wanted a beer or a shot by god I deserved one.  My voice said I could go to the bar and have a few with the guys and be good to go.  My voice said real Texan's don't BBQ without a beer or mow the grass without a beer... or a 1000 other dumb ass things...MY VOICE IS AN ASS HOLE!!!!!..It doesn't care if I provide for my wife my children or my friends.  It doesn't care if I work or not keep promises or not.  It doesn't care for anything except booze and it sure didn't care about me...I have never been able to silence my voice but I do tell it to shut the fuck up thank goodness I don't say it as much now as I did when I first recognized it.  When I used to drink I couldn't understand how anyone could have fun without it how could you hang out without it how can you relax without it how can you enjoy a night out without it......I now remember my nights out I remember weddings and parties  the way my wife looked when she heard a joke for the first time how my children looked experiencing something for the first time.  I remember these things because I am sober and I am thankful for every single memory I have...I traveled the world for seven years and can't recall a lot of it friends tell me stories that I can't relate to even though it is about me.... because I was too drunk too often...It took my wife and I a bit of time to be able to openly communicate about what was happening in my head but breaking through and opening those lines of communication are what have helped me make it to today.  I depend on her as she depends on me...Today is your day you only get it once.  Today I will not drink with you...
