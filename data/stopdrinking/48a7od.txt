But NOT from what you're thinking. I took my strong sleep med last night and now I am so draggy and tired. OK...I almost DO feel hungover! I guess that the med did not agree with me and I was actually nauseous and almost at the point of passing out...I was struggling so bad last night (fantasizing about going to a bar and just saying fuck it...) but now...I am glad I am sober and not needing to reset my badge. I thought a lot about that too and it didn't bother me that I would have to reset it. I even thought of quitting here (just not posting at all) for a while so I could go back to that hell I know so well. I now do NOT want to reset and I am posting here instead of doing something I KNOW I will regret...I am OK again...no worries. Strong as ever and still counting the days!..Gosh it is so tempting though...argh. ..Sigh. See ya Sobernauts for now..

I know what you mean about the sleep meds. So happy for you that you resisted the temptation to drink. Have a good Monday! 
I have had the same thoughts Mama.  I will not be going back.  I love my new life.  I am going to fight for it.
