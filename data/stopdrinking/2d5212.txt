I've got 439 days.  My dad has something like 12-14 years.  Not liking AA is not a reason to keep drinking AA doesn't have the monopoly on not drinking..   .   ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|31|0|OnaPaleBlueDot|*Stop Using Your Problems with AA as an Excuse to Not Get Sober.* by everythingsreal|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cijmw/stop_using_your_problems_with_aa_as_an_excuse_to/cjftucl)|.I've been guilty of this and am going to my first AA meeting tonight because even though I am an atheist I can't do this shit by myself.

Can we stop with the AA hate?* by Anthinee|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cjsir/we_should_be_promoting_any_and_all_methods_of/cjg8fh3)|.**No we shouldn't.**..No one should be promoting ANY method of sobriety here.  /r/stopdrinking is not about promotion.   It is about talking about what worked for you.  That's it.  ..I haven't seen many recent comments bashing AA or any other method so perhaps you could show me where you're getting this.  ..There's currently an active thread titled "Stop Using Your Problems with AA as an Excuse to Not Get Sober."  Which is if anything an attempt to promote AA not bash AA.  When you make a post like that telling people to just get over themselves and go to AA you're gonna get some pushback.  Over half the threads on this sub mention AA many right in the title despite the fact that fewer than half of the people here use AA. ..If you are somehow under the impression that this sub regularly bashes AA you are very mistaken. AA is mentioned here far more than one would expect based on the numbers alone.  That's what happens when you're the big dog in an area.  Along with praise comes criticism.  And very very small amount of criticism here I might add.  That's just how the world works...Your whole post calling for an end to this alleged "bashing" talks strictly about AA and is if anything an attempt at promotion. You even put it in **ALL CAPS AND BOLD LETTERS** to make sure everyone reads AA's position. ..It looks like this is your first day here.  Perhaps you should spend some time listening before you make these assertions....**Edit:**   [Here are some charts.  Your impression is not shared by most of the community members who have been here for more than a day or two.](http://i.imgur.com/fcdBOlm.png)..   .   ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|23|0|coolcrosby|*After 10 years need to reset my badge* by darkhorse3|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cotng/after_10_years_need_to_reset_my_badge/cjhjqsn)|.I am so sorry /u/darkhorse3 -- you are where I was at 5 years ago but I had to comeback after 7 years in HELL and after giving up 15 years of continuous sobriety. So friend you and I have the opportunity to prove that it can be done.  Don't drink TODAY; and dive all-in the recovery resources.  Move the feet.  You know how this is done.  Let's use this dark chapter to be the key to hope and life for others.

I can't afford to be picky or else it will all end very badly for me. ..Edit: To expand on what I wrote above: "I'd rather be sober than proud" is the mantra I've been repeating in my head anytime I find myself disagreeing with the religious aspects of AA. While I might not 100% agree with the way in which the program presents some information I 100% agree with my mantra. I've caught myself a lot with this method and it has really reinforced why I'm there - to stay sober. Hopefully other people find this useful too...35 days here - my badge hasn't been minted yet. .   .   ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|21|0|closetalcoholic|*If I were addicted to any drug other than alcohol no one would expect me to attend functions where everyone is consuming that drug.* by rubberhead|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ck1cu/if_i_were_addicted_to_any_drug_other_than_alcohol/cjgb5b0)|.I know how you feel but it could be worse - you could be a *food* addict...You know those obese people that need to be lifted out of their house through a hole in the wall by the fire department...Imagine having to consume a small amount of your drug every day for the sake of your actual sustenance. Stopping every day after a little must be gut wrenching.

That's like the most important prayer in Christianity and that prayer is only used in Christianity. The Big Book repeatedly refers to God as "Him."  ..What you're saying is that they don't require their members to be Christians.  That is true.  My church also doesn't require all of its members to be Christians.  They accept anyone who walks in off the street. But much like AA they're not going to stop talking about the Christian God or revise their literature or do things differently in an attempt to be more accommodating to non-Christians.  The AA literature was written with one God in mind..   .   ..|Ups|Downs|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|-----|----|---|----|.|20|0|VictoriaElaine|*I'm not dead! I got married!

I love AA and I didn't follow the suggestions before and relapsed. I am willing to go to any lengths now...and it seems to be working.

I will say how it's helped me but if someone wants to talk shit about it or call it a cult I just back down and let them be...AA is able to be worked by people of all philosophies religions and the lack thereof. It's simply about setting one's intellectual pride aside and asking for some help...EDIT: I've totally contradicted myself by defending AA in this post but never before have I heard of people equivocating AA to a group of [rapists]( http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cijmw/stop_using_your_problems_with_aa_as_an_excuse_to/cjg6dcg).
