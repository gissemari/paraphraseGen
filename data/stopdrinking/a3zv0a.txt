I'm sitting in a meeting where a member is picking up 30 years. Part of his story is a suicide attempt by overdose 7 years ago. That seems like a relapse to me. Am I wrong?

&gt;That seems like a relapse to me...That seems like a **tragedy** to me...I'm glad he is still on this earth and celebrating his 30 years of sobriety.
Judging other people's definition of sobriety rarely helps anyone.
Yes it is a relapse technically
Look at yourself not others.
