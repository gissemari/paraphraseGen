Made progress with my sponsor today wanted to share and also sort of ask a question that might be entirely too personal but hey it's the internet =)..So basically we have read the Doctor's Opinion Bill's Story and the first 3 chapters of the Big Book. I was totally on board for all of these readings - I get the physical allergy thing I totally have it I have experienced the phenomena of craving I relate to Bill's struggles and can see how he triumphed I am learning about the steps and overall I have been gung-ho about AA. My sponsor told me I was through steps 1 and 2. I feel like largely she spoke and I listened although we have had a couple discussions. I did feel as if it was a little stilted and maybe not the open honest discourse that I have heard about in sponsorship. I recognize my own part in this because I need to actively ask questions and engage but it just didn't feel so easy. I began to really question if she should be my sponsor or if she was just going through the motions with me. ..So today we got to We Agnostics. I was really excited because I identify as an agnostic and am really confused about this whole God business. I know that it is something about a higher power and a God as I understand it. So we're reading We Agnostics and for the first few pages I'm thinking *alright I can feel this.* And then the book starts to talk about believing in electricity even though you can't see it and somehow comparing that to believing in God. And I start to think *wait a minute here...* and then the book says something about a reasonable assumption about a Creator and I'm like *what the fuck.* It just didn't make ANY sense to me. My mind was screaming *bullshit!*..Up until that point I had been totally on board and followed the logic of the book but everything in me is feeling that this does not make sense. And I realize in that moment that it is now or never to interrupt her reading and ask a question. I mean it's my sobriety! So I just let out a "huh wait a minute..."..She already knew I was an agnostic (I gave her a hard no when she asked if I believe in God and she replied "we'll work on that.") so she brought up that this chapter would be relevant to me. But just my little bit of action even just a little reluctance caused us to stop and having this TOTALLY AMAZING conversation about God and my reservations and everything. ..We talked about how I have been living my life and thinking this same way for 24 years and now I am trying to undo all of that and how it is hard...I informed her more of my beliefs - I firmly believe that I will never can never know whether or not there is a God. She said well do you think it could be? And I said yes but there could be a flying spaghetti monster or a bunch of gods no one knows or there could be nothing. I just don't think it's in the human realm to ever really *know*. I could tell she was struggling to respond to me. She said she was never quite where I was but she didn't believe in God and thought AA was a cult etc. ..I told her that you know up until that point I was genuinely invested and I didn't want to just bullshit this. It felt wrong. And I know that you don't need to totally have it all right now just a little willingness and an open mind.... I do have an open mind to think it's possible but I was not sure whether or not I would ever be able to have *faith* in a higher power. Her response? Well did you ever think that you were going to be able to stop drinking?..Blew my mind. And then it stopped raining and a rainbow appeared =)..So anyways we stopped reading. We went into our home group's commitment at a treatment center for teens. I listened to the group members talk about how they were not down for the God business. They went through how religion/God and spirituality were ENTIRELY different things. My sponsor said "I feel like this is God talking to you."..So ya things are still pretty up in the air for the God as I understand her. Who knows? I just want to make sure that I truly invest in this and can really believe it. If I fool myself even just a little that crack will be enough for me to sink back down into the black hole I came from. I am glad that I stood up for this to myself and to my sponsor...Now for the question - if this is not too personal to ask what is YOUR God as you understand it? My sponsor said how sometimes she imagines a beautiful nature scene or even several gods like Zeus. She said many people in AA are Buddhists and just believe in kindness (I can get behind that). Might have to check out that Taoism text again (can "the way" be my higher power? I can have faith in that I guess). I just need IDEAS..Apologies for all the run-ons it is late and I had a long day.
----------immediate responses--------

I do not believe in God in a religious sense. I was raised a Catholic and spent 7 years as a nun. My spirituality evolved into facing scientific reality. I don't like religion very much. Most of the wars in the history of the world have been and are fought in the name of religion. So I guess that makes me atheist a word that sounds cold and detached which I am not...I am a spiritual person with a love and respect for life. Causes which I'm passionate about are drug addiction particularly alcoholism and domestic violence. Hospice is another involvement..I do not begrudge anyone their religious beliefs. They have a god which make the challenges of life easier to cope with. But it doesn't fit for me. You can be an atheist and still have a rich spiritual life. I love nature beauty music babies ...you get the pictue.  We'll never have the answers to all of life's mysteries. People who think they do are the scary ones...To me spirituality has to do with health truth love nature fellowship humor creativity and simple human kindness. These are things "of the spirit" or spiritual. ..AA saved my life but I just try to ignore the god-stuff. Don't overthink things. The writings were written in the 1930's and have historical value but they are not the ten commandments or the torah. Take what helps you and let the rest waft away. My sponsor told me to wear my teflon shield. If you search this subreddit you will likely find multiple discussions on this topic. .____________________________________________________________________________________________..**Here's how I look at the steps**:..Step 1: I'm in a mess and over my head...Step 2: Maybe I don't have all the answers . so I'll ask for help...Step 3: Decide to pay attention to advice given. ..Step 4: Take an honest look at how I've been living my life...Step 5: Tell someone else about my unhealthy lifestyle and harm to others. ..Step 6: Decide to live a healthier kinder life...Step 7: Make specific changes toward that goal. ..Step 8: List everyone I have hurt...Step 9: Have the courage to tell them I'm sorry &amp; make amends except if doing so would cause harm. ..Step 10: Keep an eye on myself alert to old thinking and behaviors. ..Step 11: Be aware of the beauty in the world and people. ..Step 12: Pass on to others the kindness extended to me. ..
I am an atheist in AA...You are doing just fine just fine. Put the program first continue raising these concerns and being honest. AA does not ask you to believe *anything* you cannot believe...I can pick apart about five logical fallacies in the 'to the agnostic' chapter. I still read it with my sponsees but it's hard. I learn more and more about being accepting of the beliefs of others and focusing on spirituality and character and principles and humility rather than knee-jerk reaction. ..Since you're already in the book here's something you might find useful:..We Agnostics: Page 47:..&gt;When therefore we speak to you of God we mean your own conception of God. This applies too to other spiritual expressions which you find in this book. Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you...I take this paragraph *Very VERY* seriously. I see it to mean that EVERY single mention of god religious christianity anything of that vibe I can re-write it using ANY words I want provided that I ask myself honestly what spiritual principles are being considered...Pretty much I can pick anything that's meaningful to me as long as it isn't me and that there's some element of an 'examined life' in there...My higher powers over the years:..-My Treatment Counselor..-My Outpatient Group..-People in AA meetings..-Nothing..-The Objective Truth..-Nothing [Again]..-Spiritual Principles..-The Great Emptiness..-Humility..-Compassion..-A boundless ocean of compassion..And on and on. I'm a bit of an intellectual fuck my brain doesn't settle. So I put it to work thinking up shit that is hopefully useful to me.
Evangelical Christian. ..In the Big Book the only religion that is mentioned is Christianity and even then it's discounted and we're told that Jesus isn't Divine. It was a good thing to learn early on that AA isn't for everyone 
I'm an atheist but sometimes when I need help I pray to Stevie Wonder. He gives me really good advice...I found Zen to be really helpful in developing a spiritual path in AA -- there's no god in Zen and perfect divinity exists inside each of us if we can pull our heads out of our asses long enough to notice it. Works for me!
I struggle daily with what the big book has to say on religion and God. You are not the only one :). I didn't believe in anything for a long time I hated the idea of organized religion and anything to do with it. I always did kind of believe that there was something greater than us. I remember the night I decided to stop drinking I was so drunk and high out of my mind that I thought I was going to die. And there I was lying in bed alone praying to a god that I never believed in to let me stay alive. ..Now I follow buddhism lightly but I also believe that you don't need to believe in religion to be a good human being. From what I've heard your desire for sobriety can be your God. ..Good luck with your search!!
If I were trying be consistent I guess I'd have to look back at my own comment history but I'm not trying to be consistent. Point is my higher power is still evolving changing morphing. Part of my definition is based on how my understanding of the universe grows over time and part of it is based on what I need a higher power to be. ..There are some constants in my definition though. My HP only wants good things to happen to me (because "it" loves me) but will allow me to take full control at any time even if the result is less than good. My HP laughs with me not at me but expects me not to take myself too seriously. I do not ask my HP for material things but rather for strength courage integrity patience wisdom and the ability to find some good in every bad situation...I used to ask my HP to show me the way to sobriety but I have that now. I mean why should I keep praying for something I already have? So now I just say thanks (good habit for me). We have unspoken conversations when I drive but I can't hear if the radio is on. But who knows I might be just talking to myself and tapping into some part of the brain as yet unknown to science that lies dormant unless I go through these motions to light it up. I have a bit of an intellectual streak myself so wouldn't it be ironic if I closed off a part of my mind because I was sure it didn't exist?
Agnostic theist here... we were reading from chapter 3 last night at my home-group and it pissed me off more than it has in a while...I believe in god/gods I have no idea what they are and rarely talk about it with others the nature of god is something beyond me and not something I discuss with my sponsees. I do not believe that knowledge of what god is is possible and that most of what I hear about god in the rooms is trite and sentimental drivel. ..My sponsor is an atheist he can no more help not believing in god than I can help believing in god(s). Asking someone to claim to believe something they don't or to compromise their beliefs is fucking stupid. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. When I work with other men I focus on practical concrete behaviours which when practiced can help someone remain sober and seek to live a happier more productive life...I really like appendix "The Spiritual Experience" it is probably my favourite part of the big book (after The Doctor's Opinion); on the other hand Dr. Bob's story is a big steaming pile of horse shit. There is a lot of great stuff in the book *Alcoholics Anonymous* but there is also some crap. ..Like anything else read it critically and evaluate is while evaluating your own beliefs. Do you not like what you are reading because it threatens your ego or sense of self worth? Are you uncomfortable because it brings to mind uncomfortable thoughts and memories? If so then you should probably look really closely at those things. If on the other hand you read something that directly contradicts one of your core beliefs then discard it as you would any other statement in any other work of arts and letters.
I am not a fan of the big book.    Interesting some amazing passages but on the whole does not ring my bell.    The 12and 12 on the other hand while loaded with god this and that is navigable for me. (As an alcoholic I can ignore some things and change others to suit me - quite well)..**As we understand him = as I don't have a clue.**.  That works for me...Currently my dog represents my higher power.   I make offerings to him throw sticks get licks and wagging tail in return.   Just for today.
FWIW I am an agnostic as well although attending church with friends who believe praying none of that stuff bothers me...However my God as I understand it is my family my dog my friends my health my job and my happiness with all those things - I simply call it *My Life*. That is what gives me strength to stay sober.
I don't have a higher power.  I have a higher purpose.  My higher power looked like Heidi Klum and said I could drink all I wanted.  She had to go.  I found a purpose in trying to be a human being which I had either never learned or forgotten.  It is a funny thing but "the will of god" often lines up with the will of Tom Dick or Harry...depending what Tom Dick or Harry want that day.  The allergy thing?  Well if it works for you go for it.  Go to an allergist and tell her you are alcoholic and she will send you to an addictions specialist.  They can't help us unless they do that.  Addictions specialists will usually send you to AA..Make AA work FOR YOU not for the aforementioned Tom Dick or Harry. I do what I have learned needs to be done.  Sometimes T D or Harry helped me sometimes they drove me nuts...teaching me how crazy addicts are.  Everybody has a lesson for me.  If you have god run with it.  If not find anything else.  Never let anyone TELL you you MUST HAVE god for sobriety.  They are telling you THEY must have god which may or may not mean something or anything to you.  Remember it is a very common human failing to say YOU when they mean ME to say "everybody" when they mean "I".  Good luck.  It is a journey.  I was raised Irish Catholic as a result went agnostic at the age of five and am a part time atheist now.  There are many "atheists in foxholes" BTW but that guy wasn't lying he was talking about himself.  I embrace my humanity.  I never fully was human until I sobered up.
Today it's a bit different than it was when I first worked though the steps  back in 95 and 96...Today it's Good Orderly Direction.  I don't think it's a coincidence that when people including myself focus on goodness (as you put it kindness) both being good and doing good good things happen.  And it doesn't matter if they're (or I am) "come to Jesus" types nature spiritualists agnostic or atheists... it's about attitude and action.  ..The details regarding my conception of my higher power really don't matter at all.  All that does matter is that whatever it is it works for me.  It wasn't developed during steps 2 and 3.  It started to be developed as I worked 4 and 5 with my sponsor.  It continues to be developed and morph and change as more has been revealed to me over the last half of my life...Sounds like you're on the right path.  If you continue to keep an open mind and do the work more WILL be revealed. :)
