I'm not planning relapse etc. but I can no longer find a spark of enthusiasm about abstinence alot of the time. ..I'll stay sober. It's for the best. I still recall the worst of it. But the incredible drive I felt has really really disappeared. ..Maybe I'm just normalizing yet more into being abstinent?  ..edit: Should have added I have no desire to drink. It's just there's no novelty great pride or much intrigue left to being "sober." Seems kind of mundane now. There probably doesn't need to be or shouldn't be but it just feels somehow very *different.*

Having a therapist and going to AA meetings helped me work on personal issues and stay focused. The fellowship of AA was also motivating and comforting. 
The disease is cunning baffling and powerful.  My motivation for significant behavioural improvements (like fitness career weight loss etc) waxes and wanes also.  My success depends more on my actions when recovery is challenging.
As someone who does rational recovery I know the ambivalence you speak of. We are of two minds about drinking. We know it's no good for us but that beast voice in us tell us go ahead. The more I abstain the weaker that voice gets. The it becomes recognizing any thought belief or action that supports drinking as being the beast and shutting it down. You can do it! We are here to support you friend
