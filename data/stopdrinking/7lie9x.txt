2017 has been a great year spent most of it sober.  During that time I created an awesome side business and life was wonderful.  Still lingering in the back of my mind I'm not done.  I can have a beer or two.  That's all fine for only so long till my alcoholism came back and it always comes back meaner and stronger than before.  Every time it does I lose just a little more like one step forward 3 steps back.  This time at the tail end I woke up at 4am to start drinking to be prepared for the day.  I had a good pint of vodka and went to work at 7.  There I drank hidden mini bottles till 11 and around then I was pretty much useless.  I can't even describe how upset I was and angry at myself for allowing this to happen again.  It was a huge flood of emotions and I knew I couldn't continue like this.  I just apologized to my coworkers put on my coat went home and got a ride to detox for the 7th time.  That first night was probably the loneliest and saddest night of my life.  I just lost my fiance over it my finances are in shambles my business is slipping away lost all my friends but 1 and my family is beyond disappointed.  It's so fucking miserable and it's trying to ruin my life piece by piece.  ..So I'm not messing around this time.  I always thought I had it beat no need for AA just read stop drinking every now and again and I'll be fine.  Nothing can be further than the truth.  So I'm dead set on doing 90 meetings in 90 days give every ounce of effort I have towards destroying this problem.  I've come to realize that there's no possible way to do this on my own it's bigger and stronger than me.  The absolute chaos it creates in it's wake is enough to bring anyone to their knees which is where I am now.  So I'm trying to stay positive live in the moment day by day find a meeting no matter what and then begin rebuilding my life sober.  .Thanks for listening it's been a roller coaster had to get that out.

Sorry to hear about your relapse. I know that after I had a bit of sobriety my relapse took me back to drinking stronger than it was before. So I know where you are coming from. ..Time to get busy living. You can do it! .
every time i've stopped and started again it's only been a bigger animal - do whatever you need to do in order to get out from under it. 90 meetings in 90 days sounds like a great place to start. good luck! iwndwyt.
