Hello all ..As a person that has struggled with addiction for over 10 years and starting and stopping several times.. one thing I am noticing is that when we get a few days sober and start feeling better  we need to remember this feeling maybe even writing it down and reading it daily because in my experience as time goes on and we stay sober we tend to forget how good we felt when we first stopped we become complacent maybe weeks or months down the road...When we forget just how good we feel as time goes on and maybe we have a bad day or just get bored and decide  well maybe one wont hurt... I beleive this can happen when we forget just how good we actually feel.. we just get used to the good feeling...Just like we get so used to feeling shitty from useing and drinking constantly.. we cant remember what feeling good feels like...So what I am going to do is start to write down the main things I thought or feel as I travel down this path keeping it simple and to the point to remind my self that when the initial "high" and "good feelings" we got when we first got sober.. this feeling is still here...Also.. the momentum of feeling good after getting sober.. instead of just keeping it there I am going to pick something else to tackle so i can feel good from this task also and so on and so on...Thanks guys. Have a great and sober day...and remember..."You will never regret not having that drink or drug at night when you go to lay your head for bed but you will surley regret it in the morning when you wake." -Dero

Right on. Smart thinking. 
I did a lot of journalling and it's really helpful to look back on some of my writing. Really painful too. But just in case I ever wonder if things were really so bad... it's all there.
