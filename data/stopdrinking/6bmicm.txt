[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I received an email that I had written to myself six months ago that I had completely forgotten about. It was a message saying congratulations on making it two years and how happy I should be to still be sober. ..Sometimes it's hard to see the good in what I'm doing because it's only me but if I imagine the Mary of the future it's almost like thinking about a different person and so six months ago I was able to picture her and feel proud and write her a note. I had put it out of my mind after I'd done it and when I got the message a few days ago I was totally surprised and touched. I actually cried a little which is totally out of character for me...**Struggle:** Today I am flying from San Francisco to Tampa. Living between two coasts is the way I choose to live my life but I have to say that packing to live elsewhere for a few months is a lot of work. Plus being in airports all day means more triggers than a gun store...**General:** If you could say something to your future self what would it be?..(If you think you might actually want to write a note to the future you check out FutureMe.org.).
----------immediate responses--------

[removed]
T: I spend my free time on side business. Nothing fancy. But maybe in a few weeks time Ibwould be able to pull some extra cash from it. ..S: Being sober didn't magically clean my house! I need to have some kind of routine because I can't stand clutter!..G: Life is good!
Triumph: I'm from a country where we get like 3 months of sun. Today is sunny! Summer will be here in a couple of weeks. Also my bootstrapped business is (very slowly) starting to take off..Struggle: Trying to get my blood pressure down. I eat healthy avoid salt I'm normal weight and exercise regularly. BP was ruined by drinking slowly trying to fix that..General: I feel that things will get better.
Triumph: I reached 100 subscribers on my YouTube channel! This was a big goal of mine. Also I told my mom I don't drink anymore...Struggle: I have to work until 8 PM and I'm salary so I'm basically working 5+ hours after my contractual time. So 5 free hours. I'm tired of my job...General: I got to hang with my niece yesterday. She's so cute. 
**Triumph:** I've been thinking a lot about the Thought-Feeling-Action triangle the inward and outward connection of koshas and the physiology of pain. Those are newer thoughts. Three years ago I would have asked for a painkiller 'script and promptly taken doses large enough to get high...**Struggle:** I had dental surgery last week. Far greater impact than I expected. My triumph is all about  a sitting with understanding and managing the associated pain. 6 days later I'm finally feeling better..."Future Me Past Me says you should spend more time being Now Me."
Triumph: I made it through my first full day off work without drinking! It was triggers aplenty -- boredom and a wandering mind does that for me -- but caffeine helped. Lots and lots of caffeine. I also finally got my eye contact prescription renewed something I could have never afforded if I were still drinking my paycheck every week. ..Struggle: A major work project that got significantly altered by the publishing staff went to print this morning so I'm kinda wallowing in disappointment about that. I'm a freelance writer and there's a saying among writers that goes something like "you have to kill your babies (ie the sentences/moments you're most proud of) every now and then" and the edits made to this project constituted some serious word slaughter at least in my mind. This was a paid advertising piece/article so the publisher gets the final say on the whole shibang and readers certainly won't know this version from Adam but I'm still bummed know what COULD have been. Or at least that's what my arrogance is feeding me. Anyway a few weeks ago I would have bought a six pack (or three) and drank at this problem so I just need to ride this out today and ground myself and my ego and not pick up that first drink. ..General: "Sorry for the fledgling caffeine dependency!"
Triumph: one week sober and just got a sponsor and feel ready to put in the effort!..Struggle: first real cravings in a week. If anyone has some advice that would be great!..Overall I feel I am where I need to be. Yes it is a beautiful day out and I don't have work but that doesn't mean I am bad if I end up watching Netflix inside- there will be nice days in the future. I am going to get out for a meeting at some point- 10 or noon. ALL I HAVE TO DO TODAY is NOT DRINK! 
Triumph:  Made it through a potluck on Saturday that was always a major booze fest for me. ..Struggle: going on Vacay this weekend it's supposed to storm a bunch so we'll see how that goes.  I'm also afraid I'm going to be no fun for my wife since it's her 30th and she won't have anyone to drink with. ..General:  I'd probably just tell myself to keep being awesome and don't forget to enjoy life. 
Quickie from Trickie! No drinkin' today! Yay!
TIFU.Future self. Next time make your fucking husband hire the damn packers!
Triumph: I made it through my dad's last days of life and his passing without breaking down or having a drink. I am sober and sober me can handle whatever happens. ..Struggle: I miss my home. I really need to get back and have some time alone and with my husband. Memorial service is in two and a half weeks and I just need some space after living with my family for a month. I am tired. ..General: my dad wrote four words he would say to his past self - pursue your dreams vigorously. Those are going to be the words I live by from here on out. My dreams may shift and change in the future but I must pursue them. 
Checking in. My Preds won last night's hockey game. Watched the game sober. Normally I would have drank and probably fallen asleep missing the last period of the game.
Triumph: 9 nights sober! First time in 5 years.
Congrats on 2 (+) year u/sfgirlmary! Have a safe flight and an enjoyable trip to Tampa :)...Triumph:     I didn't drink over my first heartbreak in sobriety...Struggle:     See above...General:      I'm blessed to have amazing friends at SD. You pulled me back from the ledge on Monday night; thank you for being here at coming to my rescue. Much love to you!! xoxoo
Triumph: have avoided drinking alcohol this month!..Struggle: flying to a wedding this weekend it's going to be a tough one. But I can do it. ..General: had so many stupid moments with my amazing boyfriend over the past year due to my drinking. I want to keep showing him that I respect and love him and am grateful for him. Sober is definitely the way to make that happen. Glad I am on track. 
**Triumph**: I actually got out of bed and went for a run this morning instead of putting it off until the evening when it will be too hot...**Struggle**: My going-on-13-year-old and I struggle to communicate effectively. She gets snarky I get sarcastic she gets butthurt I sigh...I love her so much and I would like to be more patient with her...**General**: I can't think of anything I would say to my future self that I wouldn't say to myself right now. But I guess it's because I've been reading up on stoicism lately so I kind of have "the now" on my mind lately.
Triumph: It has been over 2 weeks since my last cigarette and I am winning on this front. ..Struggle: I am back to day 1 on drinking after having a glass of wine with my folks. It was a small mistake but in my experience the difference between 1 and 8 glasses is a very thin line. ..General: I started a running program 3 weeks ago and I can finally run 3.5k without feeling like I am going to die. 
Triumph: It's my second day sober and my first day out of detox..Struggle: I can tell that my girlfriend is pissed super distant and stressed out after I told her I have a drinking problem that I've been hiding. ..General: : I'm off work for the summer (teaching is great) though I'm not sure what to do with myself today. Walk clean the garage work out not sure
Triumph: this is the longest I have been sober probably in at least six years! I feel really good and can already sense some water weight coming off...Struggle: I'm beginning to realize how much my alcoholic father and his death have affected me. My drinking my relationships my perception of myself--I'm wondering if any of it is my own or if I really am just that damaged by him. I'm struggling with a TON of anxiety during the day and early evening--probably partially due to withdrawals but mostly due to not having better coping mechanisms in place. ..General: "This is hard but I'm doing it for you!!"..
**Triumph:** My apprenticeship has started work is going well (even though I am very overwhelmed) and my life feels like it is EXPLODING with good things...**Struggle:** Those good things are awesome! But I am uncomfortable with good things. ..**General:** I have aaaaa cruuuuuuuuuuush.  (*^_^*).. I love your story about the letter. I did a FutureMe once set for years in the future...but when I finally got it I was disappointed with what it said. You inspired me to go back and read it and it wasn't as bad as I remembered...As for my future self I have no idea what I'd say. I guess just that I hope she's happy. 
**Triumph:** Still going one day at a time.  ..**Struggle:** I am so broke this month.  I spend so much time working and driving the kids around that I can hardly manage to get anything else done. ..**General:** Hey future Antsy remember when you were so poor and worked all the time and shit kind of sucked?  Well your hard work paid off and you have the career and security you dreamed of so great job.  Now get out there and do some volunteer work and give back.
**Triumph:** I have been killin' it at work the last week or so. There's a particularly stressful project we're working on and last week my manager said that the content I made that week "set the bar high" for the rest of the project. That felt great although it means I have to keep kicking ass for the next several weeks until this is over...**Struggle:** I am moving to a new apartment at the end of the month and so I am in the middle of culling my items so I don't have to move as much as well as switching my renters insurance changing utilities etc. It's just such a freakin hassle and I can't wait till it is all over...**General:** "Go through your photo backlog post more goddamnit!"
Daaaaay 2. I got a great night of sleep. I'm not drinking today!!
Triumph: I'm at the peak of my marathon training. Not drinking this year has really helped with my speed and overall fitness...fingers crossed for a PR. I'll be really disappointed if this race isn't better than last years...since I ran that on wine fumes. ..Struggle: After spending the majority of my life suppressing anger I am SHOCKED at how mad I am all the time. I never thought I was the angry bitter type but I am and I don't like it. Trying to work through it. ..General: To my future self: If you're still at that job you hate just quit already and find something else anything else. 
Triumph: I'm in between reps right now and I'm feeling better than ever physically. Not where I want to be but I'm working everyday! Also been vegan and it's the best I've ever felt morally/physically. ..Struggle: my sisters bachelorette party was this past weekend and I definitely had champagne. I didn't do anything stupid but I don't want to hit rock bottom again to realize I want to stop drinking. ..I won't drink today!
Triumph: everything is coming together I'm getting used to not drinking or even thinking about drinking and only on day 69. I don't even look at the lq stores when I drive past them that's pretty cool. Much happier now focusing on myself and my next solo camping trip with lots of meditation hiking and deep thought ..Struggle: money still sucks I've saved about 500 according to the AP but it's not a horrible struggle because I've been eating great getting trimmer and I'd rather spend it on nutrition instead of booze. Still struggling with going back to school maybe in the next couple years if I can ever figure out what else I want to do.....General: something I could say to my future self: you are fucking amazing and nothing and nobody holds you back. Be proud of yourself and keep moving forward 
Triumph: Made it the 3 nights my girlfriend has been away without drinking! Night 4 will be today and I'm ready to conquer it! ..Struggle: I have a bridal shower coming up the 27th that I am not looking forward to going to because there will be alcohol and friends that I know will try and pressure me into drinking..General: I'm sorry it took so long to get to a good place in life because of alcohol but I am glad you're there now! 
Not today not tomorrow stay away from the sorrow
T:  I passed my class!  I was failing almost all semester and I pulled it off.  This means that I am half way done with nursing school! !!..S:  I sacrificed a lot to make it through this semester.   I have to get my shit together.  My house is a mess!  So I'll start there...G:  You can do or be anything you want.  What do you want to do?  Who do you want to be?
Triumph: I visited out of town friends on the weekend my first time doing so sober. It turns out I DON'T sleep terribly when I travel! It was the booze. ..Struggle: it's feeling like long dry days are stretched out before me and it's daunting. Must stay in the moment and take things day by day. ..General: "getting sober was the best thing you have ever done for yourself. You are an awesome connected mom and your yoga practice healthy eating healthy finances and strong and romantic relationship with your husband are the best parts of your life. You are the architect of your own well-being."
Triumph - this week I called the debt collectors and have set up a fee to pay them back. I can now answer my phone without worrying who's on the end of it and repair my shitty credit rating..I realised the only reason I haven't paid them back is because I wanted as much money as possible to spend on booze every month. Cutting it out gives me so many more options...Struggle - almost at the two week mark and really really craving a beer. Taking my mind off it by cycling and stoked to have found this sub. ..Future message - no more pay day loans sucker. If you can't afford it now you can't afford it next month. 
Triumph: I've been sticking to my diet.  .Struggle: None right now.. knock on skull knock on wood!  .General: Al Horford is a babe.
Triumph: It's been 45 days since my last drink. This has been the longest I went in 5 years and feeling good about it. I'm looking forward to checking off that 60th day then 90th etc...Struggle: There are days where I feel unusually bored. When anxiety hits me I have to remind myself that I was worse off before I stopped drinking. ..General: I still have trouble getting good sleep but its improved from how it was 45 days ago. Not as depressed and anxious as I was for the past few months in between days of drinking. Been getting back into a positive mindset and it is slowly working. Pretty happy with my progress.
Triumph: I poured the half of the vodka I had left down the drain this morning. I am ready to make a real effort as the longest I've gone in the past 2ish years is around 2 weeks enough is enough...Struggle: I have been sweating and shaking since this afternoon after throwing up water and I don't even want a drink but I know that it would help the sweats. 
Day 2 and not drinking today. Should be fairly straightforward as I'm working today and tomorrow. The real challenge is going to be Saturday
