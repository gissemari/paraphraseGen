7 months ago I was miserable.  I binge drank at least 4 times per week.  The other days became recovery days.  I missed out on so much during that time but am trying to make up for it now...7 months ago I didn't think I could do this.  I struggled for a year prior to stop and failed every time.  Then something just changed in me and here I am happy financial situation improving friendships and family in the process of being repaired and am enjoying life again.  ..Just like a lot of you said it really *can* be done!  Thank you /stopdrinking.
