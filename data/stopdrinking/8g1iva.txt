I forgot how horrendous post-drinking anxiety is. Wow. I thought I would bounce back after my relapse this weekend but I still don't feel good. I feel paranoid and pretty depressed. And I've tried not to beat myself up but I'm having a hard time not obsessing and hating myself for screwing up. I've been crying all day. Sober life is so so so much better. I have no idea why I jeopardized myself and hurt myself like that. ..Just a really bad day. I can't wait to distance myself from this past weekend and go back to feeling good.

Try to keep these feelings in mind next time you're tempted! It's how I plan to combat cravings myself when they arise. I know that I'll just feel worse after if I do give in to drinking...Don't sweat the past. Focus on moving ahead :)
Thinking of you. 
There's a book? I just downloaded some of the podcasts for this flight I'm about to board ;)
The anxiety is why I quit. You got this I can't stress how much better your quality of life gets. My only regret wasn't quitting sooner.
