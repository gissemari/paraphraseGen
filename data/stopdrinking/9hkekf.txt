Hello everyone. I've been reading posts here on and off for weeks and I think I have realized that having a community is the missing piece for me.  I've put together a few days here and there and even posted a couple times in another online community but then I stopped.  I guess I didn't have a solid plan and the results showed. So inspiring to read everyone's stories and also to know other people are out there with same/similar struggles. So glad I found this resource. I'm totally new to Reddit so I'm still learning my way around. Thank you for being here!  IWNDWYT!

Welcome friend! Support is critical for me on my sober journey! SD is a major branch of my support. Lots of useful info available in the side bar here including link to set a day count badge if you are so inclined. I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace
