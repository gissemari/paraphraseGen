First let me start off by saying I went the past 6 years or so being a heavy drinker of the hard liquor (29/f/ for the curious). I've hit rock bottom before had black outs made REALLY poor decisions some of which will go to the grave... BUT I decided that I am sick and tired of feeling sick and tired I had gained weight slowly over the yeras so I'm a no muscle all fluff lady my skin was terrible and man I was tired of being broke all the time! The past year or two (when I met my current boyfriend) I haven't been 'self-destructive' or beligerent but I would usually come home from work and have a few double or triples over the evening to 'relax' or 'makes things more interesting/less boring'. Depending on how I felt about my life would influence how much I had. Towards the start of my sobriety I was drinking anywhere from $15/day or $15/every second day (Usually a mickey would last 2 evenings unless I had a day off - then it would last one as I would be nursing it over the course of 12 hours keeping a small buzz. If it was a bad week I'd have a mickey a night)...**OK - NOW FOR ZEE LIST!**..**1) Week one was full of stinky sweats.** Mother of GOD! It was awful I washed my work shirts twice before hanging them up it was just akrid? Is that the word? Sure let's go with that. GOOD NEWS! THAT PASSES! I smell like a normal human being now :D.. I used to sweat by simply existing (not so much on my face or anything but the armpits yep!).. Now I can walk almost 2 hours to work on an OK weathered day and barely feel it. Weeeeeeeeeird! But WHAT a welcome change! The volume and smell have changed completely. I still lift my arm in my favorite new shirt and panic thinking I must have pit-stains starting - NOPE! Dry and full of yays!..**2) My skin Is FAAAR more healthier looking.** Within the first few weeks the tone went from pinky blotchy to this nice even tone.The bags under my eyes are nearly gone (and let me tell you WOW I looked like that?!) and for the first few weeks my face was SUPER greasy. I felt pretty depressed about it thinking "is this my new tone? Is this what my skin is to be normally like?". Nope! A month of staying sober and it's no longer sweaty or gross looking or feeling. It just takes TIME!..**3) NO MORE GAGGING/PUKING in the morning.** YEP! I used to wake up coughing a lung then coughing so hard that my stomach puked up bile then when I was walking to my bus stop I'd be spitting these nasty globs of saliva the whole way trying to get it out of my system. None of that exists anymore. I feel fantastic when I wake up!..**4) NO MORE MIDNIGHT SWEATS - YEP!** Apparently my body had grown a dependancy over the years so I slowly forgot what it was like to sleep at a normal temperature... Just before quitting my boyfriend came to cuddle me once and said I was just pouring sweat all over my body "are you ok???". Truth be told that was my final straw that's when I made my decision to quit...**5) DAT SWEET TOOTH!** I've never been a big fan of chocolate. Once in a blue moon something nice like a lidt or a fererocher... Couple times a year tops! WELL THEN - LET ME TELL YOU - I've had this nagging sweet tooth all month. Not sure why but I hear that it's a VERY common thing. Being on KETO (low carb diet) it has been a struggle but I have finally settled with chocolate covered almonds and chocolate-ee tea :). My boyfriend has gone to the treats drawer we have and found that half of his chocolate bar has gone missing. I think the other day I had 2 bars back to back. I KNOW you're not supposed to tackle too many goals at once (quit drinking and weight loss in my case lol) but I let myself have some chocolate as it's far superior to picking up rum. AMIRIGHT?!..**6) I did go through a fairly bitchy and jumpy phase but that too passed.** ..**7) Hygiene. HYGIENE!** You start to give a damn. Sure you THINK you did but you probably didn't REALLY take the time to brush your teeth FULLY not just swirl the toothbrush around for a bit and chew gum at work! I just found that I started to give more of a damn... Maybe not rocking a hangover or fuzzy brain has something to do with being more cognitive and present mentally to doing so. To take that time to loofa all your creases makes you feel better about simply existing! It's such a simple thing to just clean well but I had no idea I had let myself half-ass it for so long. I thought I was just sliding by doing bare minimum now I look back and think that I'm sure I looked like someone who wasn't giving too many damns!..**8) Cleaning the house.** OK so one of the first things I noticed and did was clean the apartment top to bottom. I had soo much free time (AKA SOBER TIME) that I felt I should do SOMETHING with my hands to keep myself busy. YOu want to talk about cathartic? OH MY GOSH! I have a boyfriend that doesn't really lend a hand with the cleaning (which reminds me I need to give him hell soon) so I still find some peace and fulfillment in doing a full kitchen scrub down or finding every bit of garbage and bringing it out to the bin. It just FEELS better to be sober in a nice clean environment ;)..**9) Water - the water intake has gone up IMMENSELY.** For a while there I thought I was getting dehydrated for no reason. Then I realised I wasn't downing my usual 2L of liquor+mix that I used to at night so I HAVE to supplement that with other liquids. 2L of water a day is what my goal is and I do try to keep to that - maybe that's why my skin is clearing up sooooo nicely!..**10) Sleep?** I had nothing but terrible nightmares for the first bit and I've been listening to audiobooks the entire time while I sleep so I can't speak for much about quality of sleep - I will next month though as I want to ween myself off of noise when I sleep - maybe I"m not getting full blown rest because of it. BUT I will say I wake up by far WAAAY earlier and do not feel groggy. Sometimes I wake up @ 5 or 6am wheras my alarm is set ofr 7:30 (bf's is set for 6 though). My rest is greatly improved compared to just 'passed out' which I've been rocking for 6 years lol. ...**11) My largest / biggest issue right now is feeling REALLY ANTSY.** I feel like I should always be doing something. I am NOT used to this level of energy it's a little bit of a shock to my brain to be honest and I DO feel weird about it. I had opened up to my boyfriend about my 'problem' during week 1 so he knows that I am going through changes and he said that maybe me feeling of anxiousness/feeling like I should be doing something all the time to stay busy is from all this extra energy so I need to start filling my time with some other activities on a steady basis (like my gaming or going out for a jog etc). I'm also secretly afraid that if I go back to gaming or just 'sit around' idle that I may be more likely to relapse and go grab a bevie... BUT one day at a time. I've never had two jobs at once like I do now maybe part of getting to know myself again means that maybe I'm just one of those people that has to be always be doing something ya know? I used to drink out of boredom... I never really thought about that - I mean really THOUGHT about that statement... Hmm...  Why not like say paint a figurine or cross stitch or something simple like do my nails WHILE playing my games or watching my shows?**. Why not embrace my current antsyness and ADD it up if necessary? I have also signed up for the gym near us so I hope to fill up more time with that... ...**12) The changes come quick.** Changes mentally and physically as you detox and become healthier - (even though I thought I was moderately healthy I REALLY was not) will come swiftly. By that I mean I can have a craving/freak out for an hour and it'll feel like the most REAL thing and panic in the world - but if you power through it it too will pass. Each 'aha!' moment I went through in noticing changes in thinking and physical detox symptoms was a victory even the sweating itself was a victory in its own right - I just had to hang on read the forums for inspiration to keep going and let another day pass. Breathe in breathe out :). IT DOES get easier!...**Milestones:**...**Relationship:** The boyfriend has been nothing but supportive. I am very serious about this relationship and hadn't even told the guy that I dated for EIGHT years or the guy after that one that I had a 'problem' - I was still in denial then. However I do love and respect my current relationship to the moon and wanted to share this with him. He needed to know and he didn't judge me. He's been there the entire time being understanding as I went through easy-to-scare days bitchy days I'm eating your chocolate bar days......**Work: PROMOTIONS!** I was working two part time jobs... My main job has decided to make me full-time and because of this I went to my other part-time job where I had just been promoted (week 2 of sobriety heh) and told them that if they wanted to keep me we would need to adjust the hours or else I would burn out between two jobs. SO I now work Mon-Fri with my white collar great paying job and an easy 3 evening shifts during the week (mon-wed-fri) with the other pays min. wage but gives me an extra 600/mo job + weekends off between the two! :D YAY!..My boss at the main job told me when she gave me the good news that they managed to get me full time: "During the past few weeks you have been more present. It's nice to have you feeling better and being your high energy happy self!"... So there's something!.....**Additional thoughts:** You do go through a euphoric phase during the first few weeks you feel unstopable and like if you can take on the world. That does fade but you will feel better than you did before regardless =). That being said I think I am 'evening out' and finding my norm for the first time in 6 years. It's much like having to get to know yourself and body ALL over again. But that's OK I'd like to live to 100 and bear healthy children one day. For now though I need to form healthier habits with all this high energy sober time I have that is driving me batty lol. ALSO my confidence has gone up - swear to god it has jumped a bit :D.. I have self-image issues with weight as I remember being 120 lbs now @ 173 I feel gross so I will look into working out as my next big thing to further improve my self confidence! :)..**BIG SHOUT OUT TO /r/stopdrinking - that IRC channel kept me company and the users on the boards here are nothing short of absolutely amazing support - if you're reading this seriously make a throw-away account if you like for anonymity purposes and ask questions participate! I and others will be here for you <3 Thank you everyone <3 This is the longest I have been sober in LITERALLY 6-7 YEARS**.. **Lastly - I haven't missed a single day of work between the two jobs at all this month - VERY WEIRD**..I'll let you know more about sleep and the antsy-ness next month :)...**EDIT: WOW my first reddit gold - thank you kind stranger I am not worthy!!**
----------immediate responses--------

congrats.
I am currently going through some of the earlier symptoms and it is really nice to hear there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks so much for this post.
Wow - all in 30 days! ..I recognise many of those victories in my own recovery. I don't miss the stinky armpit sweats and night sweats at all!..It's a beautiful day here off for a cycle to sweat the right way :)
This is a fantastic post. So glad to have read it!!! Keep going - - I'll keep following back here! 
This post has opened my eyes to knowing what I'm going through now. And there are others out there that had been in my shoes and have been able to turn it all around for the better. I'm really motivated now to follow suit and stop my drinking habits. I think what you pointed out that hit home to me that you had said "I used to drink out of boredom... ". .This is exactly my problem and I will find something to keep me busy when I get home from work and not fall into the current phase of having nothing to do so I will just drink instead..Once again thank you for your well written post.
Badass! Great work and self analysis. You are well on your way.
Fantastic.  You sound great.
Damn!  Get it!
Congrats on your one month celebration :) I'm not there yet but noticed several of the changes you listed (well except for the cleaning. I'm a dude after all). 
Good on ya! And I really appreciate the list of positives as I am struggling to start stopping.
Great post much chuckles! Plus I have to thank you for clearing something up for me - I've been feeling antsy every now and then like I've forgotten something and just reading this it's clicked that I'm just wanting to be doing something! I'm not used to it I'm used to just being in standby mode. Thank gawd for that I've spent years wondering why I have zero motivation and since quitting have been waiting for motivation to kick in and it clearly is; it's just a language I have to relearn...Keep at it it's clearly working :)
Congratulations! Making it through that first 30 days is huge and your life will continue to change for the better. It won't always be easy but by staying sober you'll have the kind of mental tools and tricks to help you cope and increase your tolerance to the normal pain and emotions of being a human being. The sleep thing tends to sort itself out after a while as well your metabolism is changing. One other word of advice...when you first sober up it can feel absolutely amazing like what you have described. A lot of folks describe this as a "pink cloud" and it's truly fantastic just getting a newfound sense of control over your life. I've kind of viewed sobriety like a marriage: the wedding and honeymoon is relatively easy maintaining a great relationship over the longterm takes work and dedication. Or like fitness: losing that weight feels great but keeping it off and staying healthy longer term is where you need tools and support. If you aren't in any type of support group in real life see if you can find some other sober friends for the long run. IRC buddies are awesome too. Getting the support of a doctor and or psychiatrist is helpful to to keep you going on what sounds like the start of a happy new life. After a few months in if you are still feeling super antsy you may want to do a deeper dive with a doctor or spend some time with a psychiatrist to see if you have any underlying conditions that can be actively managed. Great job though keep going!!
