At our company Christmas party when coworker brought in a big juicy rum cake (with an uncooked glaze). No big deal to anyone that I didn't try it (or drink wine at 11am out of my coffee mug which I don't miss dealing with the aftermath of at all) but I died a little inside. I love rum cake. I should've cheated. It wouldn't have even been a shot worth. I'm just not sure where to draw the line and I don't want to make a decision I can't take back *sigh* Iwndwyt ..P.s. So when I get sick should I skip NyQuil? Looking for insights on both sides of the argument. I'm not saying I'm above the struggles of sobriety but I don't think I'm really the type of person to go ape shit on a relapse and chug a bottle of medicine lol. There are still alcoholic drinks in my house that I'm not interested in that don't  tempt  me.

It's just cake. Unless you're eating the entire thing trying to get a buzz and shoving away your coworkers when they try to eat any
For me I stay away from things that could trigger me to pick up again.  I want to live a alcohol free life. No matter what it is. I even use alcohol free mouth wash.
