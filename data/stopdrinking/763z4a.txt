Each of the last few years of actually getting some sober time under my belt &amp; then relapsing it is usually in late October or November &amp; the relapses are nasty &amp; ugly.... I don't think to myself that a beer or wine would be nice..... I plot in my head what I can buy for the quickest meanest grossest drunk I can get... I plan on leaving my house when the neighbours are busy so they won't see me because I am sure the words "drunk loser" are written on me in neon I go to a bottle shop where I won't know the server (because my local guys will know that I had stopped drinking) &amp; I will be doubly sure to have a carry bag that hides the shape of my purchase!!! I will skulk use stealth plan &amp; rage at myself. I will have my *drunking* possie all set up so that when I return home all I need to do is put my old clothes on &amp; not move for anything except refills smokes &amp; toilet. I will not open my curtains or windows I will cancel any appointments with support workers &amp; I will give myself free reign to hate the universe &amp; myself..... That is how my relapse's look &amp; they last for months. And my trigger time is just around the corner...... I also have some major new stressors to cope with as well...So why am I writing this post? Because I have been told by several people (support workers GP &amp; a caring but reserved neighbour) that they believe "I can do it this time" they have watched my struggle to come up for air to try &amp; live a life that I want for myself they have watched as I have ended up back in hospital because I am again suicidal or I just simply can no longer do even basic things for myself. They have seen me again &amp; again try to find a way for myself to take care of my home my pets my garden to try new things to find a way of living that I can feel proud of..... some things worked others didn't (I will scream at the next person who tells me to relax in a bathtub or join a gym LMAO). They have stood next to me in hope watched in sadness as I continue to destroy myself &amp; offer support when they think I am ready to accept it they know me &amp; this  amazingly ugly but healing journey I have on. ..And after many many years today I can say words to myself that I never thought I would be able to utter - "I deserve happiness" "I believe that my life is a gift" (that one still a bit tricky) "I believe that my future is worth living in" &amp; the absolute shocker of all "I am a good person &amp; I can embrace all that I am offered by this universe"...... These might seem like affirmations but I don't use them as such - if I am having a shitty day I don't try &amp; tell myself that the world is wonderful I just accept that my day is shitty &amp; I don't have to destroy myself over it...... The difference for me is that I now enjoy being alive &amp; that is a total WTF for me..... If you have ever heard an old timer at AA say "if I can do it then anyone can" - that is a bit how I feel about where I am in my life today. I am proud &amp; grateful &amp; happy amidst my pain anxieties &amp; human faults &amp; if I can find this then anyone can!..Anyway back to the convoluted point I think I was getting to in my own waffling way - it is wonderful &amp; amazing that I have these supportive people to believe in me. ..But for the very first time *I believe that I can do it this time* that is why today I am not living in terror of that relapse I am just simply living sober :)..Thank you for listening the SD community is the single most amazing place for support good friends &amp; quirky humour.......Stay strong stay brave &amp; I proudly &amp; gratefully will not be drinking with you!.
