Well it's been about a year since I relapsed. A year of drinking and being in denial about what it's doing to my health and my life...Today I make a new start. I will not drink today. I will not smoke weed. I'll be present in my own life painful though that might be...Thanks to whoever listened and answered my prayers this morning. I did this before. I can do it again. I will.
