Not gonna lie. Yesterday was a tough one. Not because of any struggle with stress or some calamity but because of comfort and familiarity. ..Had another Adventure Day with The Wife which involves wandering the streets of New York in search of new restaurants and cool things to do. However in the past this has always involved drinking. And therein lies the comfort and familiarity. Because it's always been a ritual and it's always been  safe  because the next day is Sunday so no big deal if I wake up hungover. ..So why not  cheat ? It's just one day. Why not have a glass of wine or two?..Because that's not how I work. As Leo McGarry said in a West Wing  The problem is I don't want a drink I want ten drinks. ..So I decided no. I won't cheat. I'll stay true to my promise to myself and stick to cranberry juice or seltzer...Guess what? I did it and survived. And I still had a great time...Me: 1. Booze: 0...We can do this. IWNDWYT.

Congratulations on the win! IWNDWYT 
Great job. Your story highlights one of the major challenges associated with sobriety: re-establishing new habits sans booze. I read somewhere that it takes roughly 60 days. It's easier for sure after a while but I think that you taught yourself that you can stay sober one day at a time. IWNDWYT 
Well done for not doing it!
