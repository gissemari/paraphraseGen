Congrats friend! It's your first double digit palindrome! A day to celebrate sobriety! As I travel along my sober adventure..."One day at a time." I feel that every day is worth celebrating. Stay strong &amp; Sober on! I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Thank you for sharing.  You are strong and courageous to overcome and be sober!  Congrats on 11 days.  LET US ALL not drink with you today and every day!
