Struggled so hard last night but came through it sober. Was rewarded by a very joyful and productive day. Wasn't even tempted this evening. Hope you're all doing well out there. If it's a hard evening - hang in there. Tomorrow morning may reward you in proportion to your struggle tonight...or even more.

That's not worded strongly enough. Your struggle not to drink tonight damn well WILL be rewarded at least 10x in the morning. Test me on that. If I'm wrong please come back and let me know.
Hey~ I'm only four days ahead of you and the sleep gets better and better.  Isn't it great not having dehydrated skin? IWnDWYT
