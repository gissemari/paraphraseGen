I saw this poem the other day and thought you all might enjoy it. Hope I don't screw up the formatting!..*nobody but you*.Charles Bukowski ...nobody can save you but.yourself..you will be put again and again.into nearly impossible.situations..they will attempt again and again.through subterfuge guise and.force.to make you submit quit and /or die quietly.inside...nobody can save you but.yourself.and it will be easy enough to fail.so very easily.but don't don't don't..just watch them..listen to them..do you want to be like that?.a faceless mindless heartless.being?.do you want to experience.death before death?..nobody can save you but.yourself.and you're worth saving..it's a war not easily won.but if anything is worth winning then.this is it...think about it..think about saving your self..your spiritual self..your gut self..your singing magical self and.your beautiful self..save it..don't join the dead-in-spirit...maintain your self.with humor and grace.and finally.if necessary.wager your self as you struggle.damn the odds damn.the price...only you can save your.self...do it! do it!..then you'll know exactly what.I am talking about.
