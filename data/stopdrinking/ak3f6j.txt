Had a few NDV this week I'd like to share. I got the results of my liver function test back and all my levels are completely normal. I truly was expecting the worst and so seeing that everything was ok was a huge relief to me. ..I'd be lying if I didn't say that after seeing my numbers I was afraid that might trigger a relapse. After all I'd avoided damage so far I could keep drinking right? Wrong. I kept reminding myself  how miserable I was mentally when drinking. My liver may be ok for now but my brain certainly isn't. And I'm going to keep nurturing my mental health as well as my physical by not drinking. ..Of course I was at another work event this week. Actually got my LFT results while on the plane there. The first night was a 4 hour long dinner where all my colleagues drank copious amounts. By the end of the evening they all were slurring their words and saying things to each other they wouldn't sober whereas I felt totally in control...The following night I had several people say to me  Owl you need a drink!  All of which I politely declined. ..TL;DR This week I faced my fears and got a LFT &amp; I didn't let the good results of the test lure me into drinking again despite a couple alcohol heavy situations. ..IWNDWYT  .

Congrats you are breaking down that common social excuse we all use to justify drinking. If you can do that you can go all the way!
