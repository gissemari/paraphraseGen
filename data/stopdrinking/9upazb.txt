Who has a tattoo with their sobriety date? I want to get one that incorporates my date 11/25/17 and also possibly the letters IWNDWYT because this group has been my main source of support. But then what if I end up relapsing? Any thoughts on that? Also any good tattoo ideas?

Everyone i know that has ever gotten a sobriety date tatted has relapsed. I think bad idea 
Bad idea in my opinion. 
I'm not a big fan of dates or letters as tattoos but that is just me...I like getting images of things that illicit thought about other things. I got a wheel design that makes me think about my evolution as a better human and also reminds me to not recreate the wheel... Plus I just like the darn design.  I have been thinking of getting one in particular that symbolizes my sobriety but it might be a flower or something like that...What you tat on your bod is completely up to you! Let us know what you get :)
I've always thought it would be funny to get IWNDWYT in giant gang-style calligraphy across my chest or back. lol    .    .When my wife got sober she got a tattoo of a very tiny minimalist lotus blossom on the inside of her wrist that reminds her of the Buddhist monk Thich Naht Han's quote:."No mud no lotus."
I got a little forget-me-not flower on my wrist for my 2 year anniversary 
I think I would get a symbol or mantra instead of the date. 
Thanks all for your input! If I end up getting one I'll share here!
