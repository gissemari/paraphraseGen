It took a while but today is the first time since I stopped drinking that I didn't struggle with some kind of anxiety issue during the day. I haven't had panic attacks like I used to and my anxiety hasn't been anywhere close to where it was a month ago but I have still had strange moments where I just haven't felt right mentally. I have really thought I was going crazy or something. I tried Zoloft but it made my heart skip beats and/or beat irregularly so I stopped taking that crap. I haven't been taking lorazepam regularly for quite a while either so I've had to man up and logic myself through these anxiety issues when they would pop up. I think that has been good in the long run. I'm returning to my normal self that doesn't have the stupid anxiety crap going on. My PTSD is still an issue but I'm doing much better with it since I've stopped with the sauce. I'm feeling pretty damn good today even though the Royals lost tonight. Ha!  Have a good night SD. Thanks for the support and not banning me a month ago!!

Congratulations. One thing that helped me with anxiety while getting sober was learning mindfulness meditation. You might want to look it up!
Definitely seem more rational. Good job!
Wow I'm totally excited for you.  This is great news.
