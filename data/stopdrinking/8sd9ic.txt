The first few days were so easy. I had no desire to drink at all I was just done with it. I assumed that was gonna be the hard part but it went by so smoothly. Now about a week in it's kinda itching at me. I'm not going to relapse. This isn't an "attempt" to quit I'm done having it in my life but it just feels weird to get the urge out of nowhere like this. I was just curious if other people that are further along randomly get this feeling or not. .Thanks for letting me vent a bit.

Yeah. Neurologically speaking drinking is strongly rewarding. What I mean by that is that it lights up the mesolimbic reward pathway and this results in learning. You drink for a long time and you learn many mental associations between everyday things and the reward associated with drinking. These pathways will fade with disuse but it's totally normal for the idea of drinking to pop in your head at times when you least expect it. It's not a sign of weakness on your part.
That itch is a bitch yeah. I've found that for me there's almost always an emotional component driving my cravings. I drank to cope with things so when I took away the alcohol I didn't treat the underlying emotional issues and that's where cravings come in. For me those cravings diminish substantially after a while provided I'm addressing the reasons why I drank in the past.
