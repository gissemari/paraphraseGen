I made it two weeks and relapsed last night.  I'm not beating myself up though because I didn't even enjoy it and that gives me strength and hope.  I'm determined to recover and get my life back!  Two weeks was the longest I've made it sober for a whole year.  I'm making progress in one way at least -- time.  Before I was starting to think even two weeks was impossible.   Prior to that it had only been five days off and on...usually more like two days.  It isn't fun anymore...I see it for what it is avoiding life avoiding regrets fear to live and face things too.  I'm ready.  It feels different these days.  My determination I mean.  I'm smart enough to know that relapse is part of the process to recovery.  In ways I'm glad I did because I realized while doing it that it isn't even worth it.  The way I feel sober feels so much better.  I miss being productive creating art being outdoors enjoying the company of my friends...that is more important to me.  I only relapsed because I stupidly went to a wine tasting with friends thinking I'd be able to just be there for the company.  It didn't even feel good or fun or anything positive.  It tasted like regret and guilt.  I did it more from habit than actual desire because deep down what I want is sobriety.  I know now that I can't be around it this early in the game.  I'm too fragile to not cave at events like that.  It is going to be okay though.  I'm sticking around here and I'm going to do this.  Here's to day one again!

Can relate to this - word for word. good luck man!
I also relapsed yesterday.  Looking at it as part of the process and will work twice as hard to put drinking behind me once and for all...Sober with you today!
