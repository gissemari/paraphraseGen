Today i am on day 73 alcohol free i am also on day 4 heroin free. Getting off and staying off both heroin and alcohol has been a struggle. I have been rather depressed lately and been feeling like no one really cares about me and that i am a burden to most ppl i meet i understand that it is all in my head. Some days i feel like going screw u world and flushing my clean and sober time down the drain. But i do plan on keeping on with the clean and sober time.  i didnt really do too uch today but i walked my friends dog to the groomers for a haircut.

Hi Koly!..Your feelings are totally normal right now. And what? Going to take a dog to a groomers on only 4 days clean? That's incredible!.We care here - a lot....Getting sober you just made yourself a massive amount of sober friends who care. You just have to kind of put your hand up to flag us sometimes ....You are advocating for yourself by being here and speaking up..Be proud!!...I can tell you from recent experience alcohol has not changed in 73 days - it is still a horribly depressing dark place to be in and out here is much better....Stick it out we love you you are here from a reason....Later on you can look back and say oh man I am so glad I stuck around and waited this out! It gets better. ....Your system is fighting you but it will get better...And the bottom line - we do all this together. I need YOU to be here to help ME stay sober. This is a "we" thing. Pull up a chair and stay a while :) :) ..
Hey there Kolya!  You are not alone. And it's just like /u/JumbledEdge says -- this works because we do it *together*...I've had that feeling sometimes of "oh screw it I just want to get wasted who cares anyway" but that's just the disease talking.  We are worthy of sobriety of waking up with that clean feeling.  ..Keep posting and let us know how it's going?.
