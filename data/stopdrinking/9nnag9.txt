I have been sober for 3 weeks from alcohol and cigarettes. One of my best friends and I used to go on the biggest binges (2-3 days) of just total hooligan crazyness together...I am seeing him tonight. He is having a cookout at his place and I can already feel the  high /excitement of drinking. I am already telling myself  One drink won't hurt right?  And  Smoking a cigarette tonight won't affect you ..What should I do to counter this? I'm very excited and  very much on a  high  at the moment. Bad sign.

Im right there with ya man feeling EXACTLY the same way!.
3 weeks is a decent amount of time. You are so close to 30 days. Do you really want to have to start over and deal with that shitty first week? I use the play the tape forward idea. When I binged i also had such a shitty hangover and was useless to my wife and kids. They deserve better. ..I know you got this. Take my vibes and use them as necessary...IWNDWYT.
