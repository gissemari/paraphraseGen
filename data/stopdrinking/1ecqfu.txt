Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..I've posted this a few hours early since I'm exhausted and need to get as much sleep as possible tomorrow morning...Triumph: 3 more days of outpatient treatment left.

I can't wait for the weekend...General chat: 5 weeks till I get my new place!..Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

But but but but it's Tuesday...Triumph: cried my eyes out at a meeting tonight and shared with a group of ladies. Felt so good to listen and feel like I was really heard...Struggle: having some boundary setting issues with my future father-in-law...General chat: Go Sens Go.
Triumph: Sunday will be 4 months sober!..Struggle: I feel like I have enough sobriety under my belt that I can't excuse other unhealthy behaviors with "Hey I'm trying to quit drinking here."  I've been eating a bunch of candy which never really tempted me before I quit and I've been chewing nicotine gum.  I quit smoking years ago but developed the habit of picking up a box of the gum when I had stressful situations.  I started chewing it again when I quit and now I know it's gone on too long.  So I need to stop.  I'll go 4 days without and then buy another box.  I keep rationalizing it with thoughts that it's not as bad as smoking and it's not as bad as drinking.  But it's still not how I want to be...General chat: Spouse's birthday is coming up and I don't know what to get him.
Oh my God! You're from the future!..Triumph: Sobriety is cool. I just left a good meeting and am feeling great...Struggle: I need more sleep. Must get sleep...General chat: Go Hawks Go. (Detroit sucks)
Dude... you **know** I weigh myself on Wednesday mornings... I can't respond (officially) yet. :)
Triumph: Getting really motivated to get a better job so I can move out of the madhouse I'm in now...Struggle: 4th step. (anyone who's done one knows what I'm talking about)..General Chat: Looking forward to the Red Wings to pull off an upset over the Blackhawks!
Triumph: I have traveled into the future and am anxiously awaiting a sneak-peek at the powerball numbers...Struggle: I don't know how it happened so I don't know if I'll be able to go back. I may have just lost a day. :/..General Chat: Man I suck at running.  Taking a few months off killed my stamina. I must look like AF out there.  
Triumph: 15 months sober yesterday.  My Levi's Vintage Collection Jeans came in! Picked em up today!..Struggle: To be honest I haven't really had any of late.  But I see one coming up.  I want to quit smoking I am going to find and read Allan Carr's book...General Chat: A good friend is taking her 4 year medallion at CA on Thursday night so I get cake!../u/VictoriaElaine let me fix that last line for you:..&gt; General chat: Go ~~Sens~~ Penguins Go...I want to see our captain get his name on the cup.  (I don't care where he is playing Iggy will always be our captain.)
triumph: starting to get to know the people at my new job and like it pretty well considering it pays less than half of my old job with none of the prestige or passion but as one of my friends from the room says after just about everything "but that's OK."..struggle: trying to figure out how to reward myself/de-stress after a 9 hour shift cuz i've never worked sober before. definitely felt a lot more temptation today than i have been in sobriety though i was never worried i was actually going to cross the line...general chat: i'm going to try to make my grandma's pineapple squares recipe this week. i don't even remember if they tasted good or not but i bought all the ingredients so let's give it a go... !
Triumph: I'm finally writing again. Ferociously. ..Struggle: I'm having issues emotionally connecting with my SO and am not sure what I should do or say to remedy this. And sleeping. ::glares are clock::..General chat: I get the key to our new apartment tomorrow! Also the Giants will beat the Jays and the Sharks will destroy the Kings...
Triumph: graduations are fun..Struggle: not so much this week..General chat: catching up with folks that I've not seen in an age. I've still got friends!
Triumph:  Ten days! I love waking up not hungover and I'm sleeping through the night for the first time in months. Feels like a superpower...Struggle:  The mood swings aren't fun especially in the afternoon when my strongest cravings hit and I start feeling pessimistic. I've been journaling every day which has been helping a bit...General chat:  Who knew cooking sober is not only not awful but produces a better product and zero arm burns? Inconceivable!
Triumph: Finished a 6 month court mandated class this week. ..Struggle:  Why do I struggle the most when I'm starting to get a bit happier content and things are looking up.  I'm struggling with my sobriety during my best moments more so than I did when I was down and out.  Not fair...General:  just...meh :(
OK... for my **real** WuW post.....**Struggle**: I traveled last week (after cracking a rib) and it totally threw me off my routine.  While drinking wasn't too much of a concern (I made it easy on myself by verifying no minibar in my room &amp; not going to bars or restaurants that served while away) I missed my routine.  I couldn't work out and I didn't weigh myself last week.  So I weighed myself after I got home Saturday morning: I gained 3 pounds and clocked in at 222.5.  I was pretty distraught.  After seeing the graph go down by 3-4 pounds a week seeing it go up was disconcerting...**Triumph**: So the scale said "214" this morning!  That means a total of 75 pounds since July!  I'm the fucking man!  I guess it really was "water weight" as my wife said...I'm feeling really good about my sobriety.  It's just become part of my life; and that's a good thing coming up on my 6 months "soberversary" on Saturday...**General Chat**: Hang in there fellow SD'ers.  Do things to make this easier on yourself: recruit people/family/friends for help get support via AA or SMART or therapy don't put yourself in difficult situations when you're not sure if you can handle it yet and POST/COMMENT to /r/stopdrinking early and often!  You can do this!..(PS: Glad Treatment is working for you NMBP!  Congrats on the new place too!)
Triumph: I'm chairing two meetings this week.  I'm getting more involved coming out of my shell more and being more friendly to my fellow AA peeps.  . .Struggle: Rigorous honesty.  Just when I consider myself honest something happens that knocks me on my ass and makes me realize that I'm not nearly as honest as I thought.. .General: Congrats to NoMoreBeers for the end of treatment.  I'm really looking forward to seeing Star Trek in IMAX/3D this weekend.  .

Triumph: I'm feeling really good and strong. Got through making amends with someone and they are still talking to me which was an enormous relief for me...Struggle: My moods are all over the place. I go from elated and happy about the present to crying about the past... then back in a flash. I feel less like I'm facing a huge mountain of unresolved issues than I did a few months ago but things still creep up on me...General: This spring is one of the most beautiful I've ever known.
Triumph: Life is good. I survived yet another camping trip without freezing or wanting to drink. Enjoyed some nature and good times with family...Struggle: My emotions have been all over the place. I have no desire to numb myself in any way but it's still scary to feel so much sometimes. ..General chat: I can't think of anything else so here's a [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7JQvz_tacA).
