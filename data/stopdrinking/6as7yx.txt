One year today my husband nearly died from alcohol induced pancreatitis that over the next 3 weeks of hospital admission saw him admitted to icu for a week. One year since he last had any alcohol...He's still struggling psychologically even if he won't admit it I can see it. I keep trying to nudge him over here but he's not having it. Oh well. ..Well done to those of you who are sober and good luck to those about to start down the road of sobriety. I just needed to get this out as he doesn't want me mentioning that it's a year today but in the vain hope he reads this I want him to know I'm proud of him and hope he can keep his sobriety going.

Thank you --- a great post.
One year is wonderful!  That is something to be proud of.
Thank you for celebrating your spouse's sobriety. That's awesome. I hope he sees this post too. 
So he had stopped drinking for a year before pancreatitis had hit? That's my biggest fear. I almost lost my father to the same thing so sadly I have seen this hit hard myself. I was checked up recently and had no signs of anything from a gastroenterologist but this worries me all the time. ..If your husband reads this I hope he sees that we are all struggling but we can struggle together. It's amazing the kind of support you get here and he should be really proud to have met someone who would stick with him through the worst. Together you two can do this!
