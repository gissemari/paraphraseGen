As a frequent relapser and lurker - I am trying some different things this go around. ..After IOP last year - I managed to string together 87 days before I went  out ...since then I hover between 20 and 30 days off and a week or so back on...for over a year. Ugh. Annoying and a bit defeating.....I have been doing AA for about 4 years on and off. I now have a sponsor (who is really great with solid sobriety and knowledge of 12 steps). I am going to 3 - 4 meetings a week. I am building my network - it takes a long freakin time for that. It is really uncomfortable. But it is happening. Slowly but surely. I hated the saying  get there early and stay late  but it is TRUE!!! And I did have a coffee commitment 1x a week for 3 months. That was at the suggestion of my sponsor and although it did not keep me sober that whole time - it certainly kept me coming back....and I will sign up again for one in new year!..Because I keep relapsing - I decided to go back on naltrexone which was prescribed for me at IOP - I want to get some traction and get through these holidays without the roller coaster of drinking and regret. And I want to keep doing everything else....sponsor steps meetings commitments...  ..I saw a speaker tonite who had 30+ years. He was a 70 something year old guy who I absolutely loved - he was chill. Comfortable in his own skin. Funny smart. Cool as heck! I want what he has - and he did the work. it is a lot and it's not easy...but I am feeling determined. ..Thanks for reading - just some thoughts by this bozo on the bus who is gonna keep trying!

Awesome!  Keep coming back!
Right there with you bozo on the bus  . I hugely admire you for keeping on getting back up and persisting in your quest for a better sober life. You are no bozo and I think that you are great. Happily not drinking with you today.
