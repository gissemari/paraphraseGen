This was a good day. My moods are lifting since instead of wondering why I still have to struggle with my drinking when I've been working so much with my personal growth I now understand that this revelation is a result of the personal growth and increased self love. ..Today I went for a long walk with my friend. After the walk we stopped for a cake at a cafeteria. The rest of the evening I enjoyed listening Jimi Hendrix on my brand new (used) hifi speakers. I'm sad and happy at the same time.

Just checking if my badge works by now. 5th week sober!
