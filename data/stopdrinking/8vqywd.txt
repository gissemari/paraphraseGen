Getting back in the mindset again after a month or two relapse. It wasn't severe as it could have been and no one found out... but it was so easy and so horrible at the same time. Anyway. I'm back to coming here every day and reading. Despite that made a trip for a half pint ahead of the July 4th holiday so I could "relax". Took one drink before bed last night. Woke up multiple times (because that thing that "helps" you sleep does NOT help you sleep) but I resisted borrowing more happiness from today. Woke up this morning and dumped the rest out before work. I mean I definitely considered taking a sip just...for no reason. Just because. But I decided against feeling awful today and tomorrow both physically and about myself in general. I dont believe I have ever dumptled out vodka without doing something truly regrettable and loathsome first. So I'm feeling great. Feeling strong. Taking the little victory. IWNDWYT
