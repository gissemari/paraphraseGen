Im sick. Ive made the decision after 20 years drinking enough to pass out im 37. I drink 7-10 knig cans a night an 3 packs of smokes not good i know. I can feel fluid in my lungs chest pains endless arguments a dui broken relationships ive got it all and the t-shirt. I'm hon4stly scared and alone till at least next week when my girl comes back from work. Im doing this not just for me but the people I love and I know ive caused alot of pain to because of my addiction. Never been more than a couple days sober in 20 years yup 20 years i started young. When I realized today how bad of shape im in it scared me. Its a good time i think to withdrawl before she comes home I might not reply today im struggling already and goin for a walk time to get my life in order. Thanks for letting me vent.

Maybe it would be a good idea to see a doctor about quitting. Alcohol withdrawal is serious. Be honest about how much you drink so an accurate assessment of your detox needs can be made. Medication can prevent seizures lessen symptoms and make you more comfortable. Please think about it. The medication is inexpensive. If you start having severe symptoms go to urgent care.
Is it normal to be twitching and sweating ? I usually dont drink till 8 or 9 at night usually and this isnt normal. Im not even hungover anymore today.
This is hell please be better tomorroww
