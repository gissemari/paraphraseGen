I'm approaching eight months sober and just made myself a drink for the first time in over eight months and it's one i know i like. I can't remember the last time I wanted to drink this badly. My girlfriend is struggling and I can't help her and I'm housesitting at a friends that is filled with my unhealthy coping mechanisms i.e. alcohol sharps etc. So I poured myself this drink and can't leave their house because I made this commitment and can't breathe or think straight. Help? Maybe? I don't know if i want it

I'd dump that one down the drain real quick to give yourself some thinking time. I'm going to write more in an edit. BRB.
I would step outside. Take a couple of deep cleansing breaths and calm down. Then I would go in and dump that shit down sink.
Ultimately it is a choice you need to make. If you are like me you know it won't stop at one and it won't do any good anyway. ..IWNDWYT 
Flush it down the toilet...and picture your head down the toilet vomiting because when we 'slip up' we think we can drink the same quantity as before ...and we cant...our body vomits everything up.... 8 months is such an achievement  pass this test ....i know you can... 
I'd kill to be at 8 months sober.   Please consider dumping it down the sink.
Please play the tape forward. 8 Months is such a big achievement. IWNDWYT.
Don't do it unless you love day one!
If you are asking yourself if you want it deep down you know it will not be good.  Stay strong!  Sending you positive thoughts.
