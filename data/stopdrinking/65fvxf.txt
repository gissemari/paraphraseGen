I'm closing in on 60 days and only realized the other day when I signed into SD and saw my badge. I've slid back into being sober pretty easily but I'm much more protective about my sobriety. I'm also much more comfortable in it. ..I'm not pretending that the relapse didn't happen don't get me wrong. It humbled the fuck outta me and I think that's why this feels more natural and genuine. Also drinking again just didn't *feel* right--like it wasn't who I was anymore. I didn't have any REALLY awful moments (thankfully) other than awful hangovers and a lot of vomiting which was fucking enough for me. I was straight up self-medicating for some mental health shit and when you fall that low you don't give a fuck about anything. I was desperate to not feel how I did anymore which weirdly is also how I felt WHILE drinking the last time I quit because it was making me so miserable. ..I realized that the pain was embedded inside me. It wasn't just something I could drink or drug or wish away. I had to/have to do work and it's a continually thing--it's the journey not the destination deal. Maybe that's why I haven't been fervently counting days like I did before. I'm way more focused on living mindfully and not worrying so much about everything. I still have a lot of work but I feel like I'm making progress. ..Stoked to see the Oilers lose to the Sharks tonight while I drink coffee and do work. I won't drink with you today! ....

Personally very humbling to me. I love your spirit. I wont drink with you tonight.
The last relapse I had was an amazing learning experience...also very humbling. It taught me a lot and actually made my resolve much stronger. Keep up the good work!..Go Sharks!
