So I have an Aunt that struggled with alcoholism and talked but we didn't see each other a lot. I let her know that I was in the same boat as she was and we chatted on messenger often. The rest of the family pretty much gave up on her even though she asked for help but was a chronic relapser. Well no one had heard from her since Friday so one of my cousins had gone to check on her. He found her on a rock outside her home decomposed and most of her body eaten by animals. I will be a pall bearer at her funeral Thursday. Not enough left of her to do an autopsy or have a viewing. Alcoholism does not discriminate. Be vigilant my friends.
