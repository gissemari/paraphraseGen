Realized today I can't remember what I was doing a year ago and that I have to look back almost 6 or 7 years to find vivid memories that I can place on a timeline. It's been 10 years since the abuse began. Blackouts early on then slowly but surely fell onto the trap of "casual daily drinking." didn't feel the physical strain I was putting on my body until probably a year ago - that's what started this line of thinking... I can't remember the last time I woke up without headaches or this constant pain in my abdomen. It feels like I've lost at least 50% of my mental capacity and struggle to grasp concepts at work that would have been trivial a few years ago. I take pills to fall asleep - without them I would just drink until I pass out and would have been fired a long time ago....This is probably the hundredth time I've told myself I won't drink after work. I sobbed on the toilet through lunch when I realized I've lost almost all memory of my adult life thus far. Maybe I can make it without a drink tonight then we'll see how things look tomorrow.

I suggest you look up the local Alcoholics Anonymous meetings...There's probably one near you this evening...AA is full of people who felt just like you do who found a way out...If nothing else it will give you a concrete action to take...Good luck!
Best of luck you can do it. Hang in there. 
I'm committing to not drinking tonight with you. Seems to be a lot of support on here. Wishing you the best. 
This place has definitely helped me with accountability. And it sounds kind of silly but seeing my badge continue to grow has gotten me through more than a few rough days...Wishing you strength but don't hesitate to see a doctor to help you get through (especially the first few days and to maybe check out that abdomen pain).  ..
