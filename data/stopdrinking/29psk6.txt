I don't know many of you are WWE fans but right now not even Brock Lesnar can break this streak.  Yes there has been some near pitfalls but I have kicked out of everyone and came back stronger.  Thanks to all the stories I read here about people quitting I know I don't post much but the stories here inspire to keep going even though I feel like giving up.  Also the support I have found through family and friends has been amazing.  I feel this streak has no end in sight and I could not be happier.  Thanks and everyone and yes it is worth the struggle!!!!!

That is great! I'm so glad your family is being supportive I don't know what I would do without it I wish I had grasped onto it sooner. It really crushes me when folks here share how difficult it is without the support of family the thought of not being there for my son in his time of need and support is just un- fathomable. ..Glad things are going so well!
It's worth it I guarantee it.
Good for you! and yes it is worth the struggle! you got it!
