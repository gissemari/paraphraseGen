I was 45 days sober this last time when I threw it all away. I found out my wife had been sleeping with a friend of mine and I just went over the edge. I don't remember much of last week. I do remember losing my job and some very close friends disowning me. ..In the past year I went to rehab after drinking every day for 4 years. After that came Intensive Outpatient Therapy then 90 days of sobriety before a relapse. Then an overdose on sleeping pills that cause me to hallucinate and leap off a two story balcony. They put me in a psyche ward for 24 hours and after that I thought I had it licked. Went back to IOP and I said they're is nothing that would make me go back. I was wrong. ..I'm writing this because it's been 3 days since I've had a drink I'm alone in my apartment and the DT's are pretty bad. Mainly nausea and anxiety but for the past few hours the auditory hallucinations are back. Lots of whispering. I'm rationing the small bit of lorazapam I have. Trying not to use it. ..These whispers are getting to me and I know the liquor store across the street will make them stop. I'm scared.

You need to contact medical help. Call 911 or go to Urgent Care. ..The purpose of lorazapam is to prevent the DT's. The liquor store is not the answer. ..Please get medical assistance. 
Took the lorazapam. It helped. Thanks for at least letting me vent.
