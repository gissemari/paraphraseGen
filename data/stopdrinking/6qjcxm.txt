I missed my meeting today and the next one isn't for another 2 days I just need some support I'm sort of thinking I'm gonna relapse at some point so  it might as well just be tomorrow. Help me. 
----------immediate responses--------

I'm here not drinking and enjoying it. Can you try the same?
Congratulations on 15 days! I'm hoping to be there in 14 days. Can you do something enjoyable to distract yourself? 
Don't think about tomorrow. Think about today and right now
Relive your memories of why you decided to stop drinking in the first place. Those reasons are still valid but get pushed back after some non-drinking time. Play the tape forward. I don't want to go back to panic attacks over not being able to do my job because I'd been drinking since 10AM or waking up feeling like death warmed over. Whatever leverage you can get will help. Scream to yourself about the bad memories over the top of that voice that thinks it wasn't so bad. Not drinking today.
What town are you in?

Don't drink that first one. I have come to see that for most of us we cannot moderate so not starting in the first place makes it much easier. Can you go for a walk and clear your mind some?
Jump in the IRC chat tomorrow and just hang out. Is there not another meeting in your area?
