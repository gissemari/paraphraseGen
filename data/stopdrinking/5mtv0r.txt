I've been really great lately. I struggle a lot - but overall I think I'm doing okay. That is until last week when I decided to have a woman's themed "toy" party.... if you know what I mean. The kind where you have a consultant come in with stuff show it off - your friends and you laugh and it's super fun. My problem and what has been giving me anxiety is that I haven't been to a party or hosted one - since I stopped drinking. I was known as a great hostess - the vodka etc. was always flowing - I had loads of "friends" over and things would be so fun because I would get smashed - and be hysterically funny.... or at least that was my perception of how it went... it was probably really not like that at all - anyway I digress... basically since I have decided to have this party my inner demons have been trying to make me lie to myself... saying "you can totally drink at this... you've come so far"... bla bla bla all the normal stuff. ..On one hand I could just not have a party and be done with it but on the other I feel that I need to do this in order to prove to myself that I can overcome this. I have really strong emotions to HAVE the party so I can know I can do even this sober. It feels like a challenge I need to meet. I have been finding my inner voice saying things like "well if you're going to have a party and possibly break sobriety... why not just do it now then?". I haven't yet - but for some reason this event has kicked off a massive craving curve I can't really beat. I've been thinking about it almost non stop. Prior to this I had a few hard days here and there but it wasn't anything like this...I am also EXTREMELY paranoid that my friends won't think I'm as great a hostess or as much fun as I was before sobriety. That's probably my biggest fear. I think my humor and charisma is one of my greatest qualities - but what if I'm no fun anymore? What if this party totally sucks? I am nervous THAT would send me into a relapse as well as if the party was great.....I need suggestions as to if I should have the party and what would help me since it's been so long being sober (long for me 500 days woo!)... Does it get easier or harder? I think it's getting harder... the further away from my last day being drunk you forget how bad it was. I feel like I might completely forget some day and then not realize why I stopped at all... I'm just a mess... I'm not in danger of breaking sobriety in the immediate future but this anxiety is getting the best of me. Looking for feedback and positive vibes anything anecdotal - just something to help me choose the right path here... about this party and if it's supposed to get easier (when?)

What if I am fun and the party goes well?..These days I am just going for it. I have planned a few parties since I got sober and they've been fun. I think it's all about just having confidence and setting the tone...That being said are you planning to break sobriety over this party?
I agree with Victoria the party could go great. I definitely would have fun sober being silly with my girlfriends... I don't need alcohol to be inappropriate ha ha ha. I would feel comfortable telling my friends to BYOB or serving it myself but be sure to have my own bubbly soda for me!..The fact that the idea of the party is affecting you so much is concerning though and my initial reaction is to recommend you DON'T have it if it's going to trigger you so much. BUT maybe there's actually a different trigger working on you right now. If I was having cravings for any reason at all I would take a deep hard look at what the root cause is and do some work on it before having a party where I might be serving alcohol to others or having it around.
