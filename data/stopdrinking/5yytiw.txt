Had a stressful 'trigger' yesterday and could have very easily stopped by a store...Tempting thoughts I did have (...ok thanks Yoda)...What was different this time is it was easier. I allowed myself to recognize - even say out loud (yes I was alone) that I feel like a drink might be pretty damn nice right now. Ok... So there's that part. Then I walked through the whole starting from square one feeling shitty the next day one would *guaranteed* lead to more... all that stuff. There was almost an air of humor to it. Not that having these periodic struggles is 'funny' but that I was feeling a sense of joy it was actually NOT such a battle this time to walk over the coals and not stop. A big FU to the guilt and feeling of failure wrapped like a gift ready for me to open if I chose. No thanks.  ..My take-away... always have faith in my 'process' each and every time. It doesn't really matter what triggers me to be tempted. What matters is not taking shortcuts - checking all the boxes visualizing the alternative and walk away. The next hour the next morning - NOW - is the reward!..Hopefully there's a nugget here you might find useful. Have a great day of not drinking with me! :) .
