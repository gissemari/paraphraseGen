My husband [28] and I [28] have been nightly drinkers for id say the past 4-5 years now.  I never considered myself having a problem until recently when I found myself lying to my doctor about my weekly alcohol consumption. At my most recent doctors appointment my blood pressure was 145/95. I've always eaten healthy and run 5-6 days per week. I sort of chalked it up to a hereditary issue and decided to cut out any after-dinner snacks to avoid salt. .  .Two months later my husband had his annual exam and his blood pressure was also high! This is abnormal for him as well we both very active people and eat fairly healthy. So we decided to cut out drinking at home. It hasn't been easy by any means. Every. Single. Night. I crave a glass of wine or a mixed drink. We still drink when we go out or if we have people over but I'm estimating that we're down 10+ drinks (each) per week now. .  .We're starting now on our 4th week of this and my blood pressure has dropped dramatically! I check my BP at work a couple times per day (I work in a doctors office) and it's been averaging around 110/70 this past week. It has literally blown my mind how much alcohol has been affecting my health. I now wake up with more energy instead of hitting snooze from a mild hangover each morning. .  .Going to sleep was very difficult the first several nights but I've been using melatonin and it's worked pretty well. I've also been remembering my dreams almost every night! Something I never knew I had been missing. .  .This has been such an eye opener for me because i never thought I had a problem before. I guess since wine was my drink of choice it seemed more  normal  to me to have 2 glasses at night.  ..Anyhow just wanted to share. Maybe someone else here is like me and needs a reminder that 14+ drinks a week is in fact not healthy for you. It's still a struggle but it does feel good to be able to see some positive changes so quickly after reducing my alcohol intake.

You find you can moderate? 
Great news! I wish that I was as wise as you are when I was 28 back in 1984. I didn't get it until I was 61. IWNDWYT
