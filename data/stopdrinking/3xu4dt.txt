With the holidays crashing down I've been thinking of the upcoming (or current) challenges. I've been grouping them into Struggles. For each I have to come up with one or more Strategies to help me deal. I was stumped with a couple strategies but got help from friends and folks at my meeting. Can we do something similar here? Toss out your struggles and worries how you plan to deal with them and ask for help or feedback if you're stumped...**Struggle:** In-laws are staying with us for at least a week.  .**Strategy:** This is a multi-faceted struggle but my strategy is fairly simple. Stay busy get out of the house a lot with the kids and on runs morning meditation and be happy as possible. Easier said than done...**Struggle:** I'm not that fond of Christmas and have struggled with the holiday in the past.  .**Strategy:** I worked hard to get gifts purchased early. I used Amazon a lot to eliminate shopping hassles. I made impulsive purchases too.

Alright! Another strategy post from /u/embryonic_journey! Love it!..As you may know I can really suffer from anxiety brought on by upcoming events... planning preparing worrying etc. Aargh!..I have to find my happy place and know that it'll all be fine. Christmas is going to come and go. Visitors are going to come and go. Meals served and eaten neighbours met gifts exchanged laughs had etc...And none of it hinges on whether I'm ready for it or not. It's just going to happen. And it'll be fine.....P.S. Online shopping is the pinnacle of human achievement! Bricks mortar crowds and hurly-burly be damned!
My biggest struggle is that this Christmas is going to be the first one in several years that I spend sober. Usually I try to help around the house as much as I can(I spend Christmas at my parents' house) and I am stressed out and tired in the evening and have been drinking to treat those feelings. My strategy this year is to do stuff like cooking and cleaning but listening to my limits and not tire myself too much so I don't even feel like drinking. I hope this works...Other thing that worries me is food and eating - Christmas is quite challenging for someone with an eating disorder. And those difficult feelings and thoughts are perhaps a bigger reason why I used to drink on Christmas. But I really don't know how to deal with them now. Luckily I can take all my medication now that I don't have to worry about their effect with alcohol.
What a great effort!  Good work here /u/embryonic_journey!
Thanks for this post ej...Struggle: Christmas time does not change my extended family into different people despite what the advertisers tell me. ..Strategies: I will put effort into looking for commonality being kind in my thoughts and actions and withdrawing to the outdoors to play with my children niece and nephews as often as possible!..
Struggle: Spending the holidays in a new town without friends or family to celebrate it with..Strategy: Don't know how healthy this is but I signed on to work a bunch of extra shifts to fill the time make some extra money and exhaust myself so I sleep better. I'm also continuing to work on building healthy habits like doing physical therapy exercises daily going to at least one meeting a week and doing three self-actualization Pomodoros every day. ..edit: formatting
This is awesome!
Good job! My Christmas is pretty low-key this year but I am spending it with my alcoholic dad whom I suspect is back to his drinking ways. So strategy is to have sparkling water on hand go for runs and read. I will remember that he's just trying to do the best he can like me. Commonalities and compassion so I can enjoy the fact that he's still in my life. 
Struggle:  Going to see some old buddies of mine -- we are going to a go cart track and then they are going to a bar most likely  (yes we still do shit like this in our 30's)..Strategy:  Go have fun at the track.. say my goodbyes for the evening and leave when they go drinking.  ..Struggle: Most of my family will be consuming alcohol over the holidays..Strategy: Take a lot of walks.. read my book.. help out in the kitchen .. play with my nephew who i rarely get to see
I like it /u/embryonic_journey! ..**Struggle:** The removal of my not-sober brother from my life after Christmas. .   .**Strategy:** I do not support anyone's self-destruction even if it's family.   ..---..**Struggle:** Migrating into my vehicle for Spring college semester in a major city of Minnesota.   ..**Strategy:** Insulation blankets and plenty more blankets. However I at least am close to various Secular / Non-Secular alcoholism meetings and can see a psychotherapist with my insurance. ..---..**Struggle:** Possibility of getting my ass kicked in various card games when my Opa/Oma come down.  ..**Strategy:** Learning from my mistakes and accepting loss.
Struggle: The whole family's together and me and my sister *really* don't get along. I haven't talked to her in years. ..Strategy: When I start feeling stressed/combative towards her I'll go into another room and distract myself with something else (internet tv cooking...).

I LOVE this to bits THANK YOU /u/embryonic_journey ! ..I feel like I've just picked up a valuable life tool I am going to use this!..**Struggle**: Usually visit family for Chistmas but with a break-up it's being hosted at the new girlfriend's place this year. She seems nice I just wouldn't feel comfortable there. Difficult conversation has been had...**Strategy**: We're just visiting for Christmas eve won't be staying over so that I can escape when desired/needed. I've made my dietary requirements especially NO ALCOHOL crystal clear. I'll be packing some 'emergency' nibbles and sparkling water just in case. It'll be a quiet and cosy Christmas day at home perfect! I'm hoping to get out on a long walk rather than lazing around all day...
Struggle: dealing with bossy grumpy family member... They get less grumpy once they start drinking... I used to deal with them by drinking myself...Strategy: deep breathing taking walks remembering that I am only responsible for sweeping my side of the street remembering that the holidays are temporary and I love my difficult family and to enjoy what I can....any other suggestions welcome!
Struggle: first sober Christmas season in many a year. Afraid I will cave to temptation. .Strategy: Have plenty of my non alcoholic bevrrages on hand and keep a small colorize picture of a cirrhosis liver in my pocket to reference in weak moments
Thanks for posting this. I've been been struggling with a few (non-holiday) situations lately. And by struggling I really mean stalling and playing too much solitaire. I've got lots of struggle and very little strategy. This has gotten me motivated to break it down into manageable chunks and start planning. I think I might go old school and write an outline.
**Struggle:** Going to visit parents for Christmas they are going to have drinks around...**Strategy:** Said to Mom I have a drinking problem and decide to go clean so I'd appreciate if they didn't offer me drinks there. She said there will be no drinks there for anyone. She rocks.
