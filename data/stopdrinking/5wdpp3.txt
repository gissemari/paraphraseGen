Well I drank yesterday. I managed to talk myself into thinking that I needed to know what it would make me feel like as far as withdrawals to just drink one day (I know stupid.) A couple beers turned into 18 beers. The one thing that makes me hopeful though is that each relapse has been shorter with longer periods in between. I'm not happy about this but every time it happens it reinforces my belief that one of these times will be the very last one...Sorry I let you guys down but I won't drink with you tonight.

You didn't let me down! It took me over 6 months and around 30 resets to get past 17 days. At some point I stopped beating myself up for falling and started being proud that I kept standing back up...Keep getting back up and keep fighting!
I relapsed yesterday as well but I try not to be to upset when it happens. This isn't a problem that's going to be solved overnight and it certainly isn't easy. Don't give up and keep on not drinking. 
Wow 18 beers is a lot after almost 2 weeks.  How did it make you feel in regards to withdrawal?  .I've done some trial periods too and have really been paying attention to how I feel after drinking again that first time after deliberate abstaining.  Like you 1 or 2 drinks turns to too many and I've thrown up in my indulging again after periods of abstaining not good..Keep at it!
I won't drink with you today.  It's ok.  You are back on the bath hopefully wiser for the wear:)
For years I talked myself into drinking when I shouldn't have...While my alcoholic brain has come up with some pretty creative arguments this is a new one..."Hey Joe lets drink today just to see what the withdrawals are like tomorrow". ..Just goes to show how tricky this addiction is.  
I drank yesterday as well and getting my badge reset after a full month...I stand with you! We can carry on together!
