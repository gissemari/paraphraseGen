Last year and a half drinking hasn't crossed my mind. My lady is sober too but she's always had a little trouble not thinking about it. The other night she told me how she thinks about it and misses it. Now I can't stop thinking about it and how miserable I am. ..I always had friends and was always doing things. Now I'm stuck in a relationship where we only have each other and we don't do anything. She has been living in so much fear and I can't stop thinking I can save her that I've neglected my needs. ...I just want to drink tonight and I can't even go to the fucking dog park without their being alcohol.

Help a fellow alcoholic? Go to a meeting? ..I believe in you op!!!
Time to reevaluate the relationship perhaps?
