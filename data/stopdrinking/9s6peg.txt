I have such a hard time having a normal social life without it. I so badly want close relationships. I am really craving alcohol today...I just can't envision a very likable version of myself that drinks heavily. I am trying to envision who I could be without it. My visions are probably a bit fantastical and any improvements take so so long. But I am trying to hang on to that on a day where I am feeling so hopeless...Thank you all for being here and sharing your struggles.

When I was torn between drinking being good or bad the answer was simple.  My brain lied and said drinking was good for me.  Reality showed me drinking was bad for me...Alcohol got its hooks in my and consumed my world.  So I had a hard time seeing a vision for a sober life. That is where a sober community like this one or AA is helpful.  When you listen to sober folks stories you start to build a vision for what sobriety might be for you...So I'm short drinking was the worst thing ever. Sobriety one day at a time turned out to be the best thing...Best wishes! IWNDWYT 
I liked alcohol because it masked my social anxiety. ..For this reason I very swiftly became addicted to alcohol. ..After eight years I've found I function much better dealing with my social anxiety and not being drunk. ..Best of wishes portner.
There are healthier ways to deal with social anxiety. Seek counseling for your core issue. Alcohol doesn't make anything better and can damage your ability to have close relationships. ..Many of us have learned that no one really wants to be close to a drunk.
Is an alcohol fueled social life a normal one?
