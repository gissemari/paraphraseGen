I've had a huge problem with alcohol for a while now to the point where I'm now drinking a full bottle of Wray and Nephew overproof rum from morning to night. I get nasty withdrawals when I don't drink enough...Two days ago I took a step to seek medical help. I called my GP and got an appointment the same day. It was a struggle to go outside but I had to do it. She was very helpful and gave me a prescription for thiamine and a referral to an addiction service...I want to say if you're suffering from alcoholism no matter what stage you're in please seek help as soon as possible so you don't progress to this point. It makes life a living hell. Good luck my friends.

Welcome.  That's awesome that you took the first step...It shows how strong you are.  I will not drink with you today.
I'm happy you're here! I'd gotten to drinking all day every day... it was not fun. Glad to hear you went to the doctor I was an idiot and withdrawal got scary for me. ..This place is amazing. It's helped me so much in my journey. I suggest checking out [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) of books. I started with [*This Naked Mind*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27202127-this-naked-mind) by Annie Grace. It helped change my attitude about booze in a way I did not expect. ..Early sobriety is uncomfortable but it's temporary. Stay strong. I won't drink with you today. 
Welcome! Glad you've joined our family :). Perhaps this may be helpful: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3xckfo/how_did_you_get_through_the_first_few_days/.
Great great great.  I've been there. Your body will heal and it will feel better and stronger.  It takes about 3 months to adjust to your not drinking every day so give it time.  Congratulations on stepping out of your house and getting help.  I have a feeling that you are tired of all this and need a well deserved change.
