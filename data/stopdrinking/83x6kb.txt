OMG I finally had my first drinking dream.   I had them before when I was in periods of quitting but none this time around. Thought I was done or had 'moved past it' in my psyche but nope. ..The worst part is that in my dream I said to myself the 'morning after': "It's fine I only had two drinks that doesn't count as a relapse. I'm not hungover today! I'm at work! I won't reset my badge that's stupid."..That's some classic alcoholic thinking dream-Adhitthana_ had right there. I guess I'm posting to say to my self and to the Internet that I promise y'all if I ever slip up I will reset my badge. The threat of badge-reset is totally what holds me together sometimes.

&gt;The threat of badge-reset is totally what holds me together sometimes..Same! Isn't it funny how a little collection of pixels on a screen can be such a powerful motivator?..Sober on!..IWNDWT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congrats on not having to reset your badge!! 
There is a fake badge reset function on here - it simulates resetting your badge. I did it the other day - holy shit!
