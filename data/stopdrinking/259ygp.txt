Didn't have long under my belt but was sure I had this. Ended up drinking on Friday night and feel hella shitty now. Let's try this again.

Tip going forward never listen to that voice in your mind that convince you that "I got this". What are you going to do differently this time? Are you getting support? Dust off get back on the horse and remind yourself if that horse has blinders on its tough to carve out a new and lasting path.
"It's not who falls down but who can get back up.".Don't beat yourself up. It's just a waste of time. And very self-centered. .I like what Sarah said. What can we do different this time? Not think. But DO.
Where did you drink and with whom?  What triggers did you respond to?  Mistakes are inevitable a lapse in judgement will happen a relapse does not have to follow.  What tools are you using and what new tools are you considering to better support your efforts today?
&gt;Let's try this again...That's the spirit!  Mistakes happen.  Focus on the positive changes you have made and will continue to make. 
Let's try this again.
One of the best quotes I have ever heard in recovery is:.."The shame is not in falling down. The shame is in staying down."..Don't beat yourself up. Figure out what you need to do and keep at it.
