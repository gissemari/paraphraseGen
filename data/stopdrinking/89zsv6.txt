Hey all..First and foremost--please disregard my badge it's a crock of hooey I haven't been sober for a few months now. Reset request is pending...So here's the deal: I just can't do it anymore. Sobriety that is. I've struggled with various addictive behaviors since my late teens (drinking drugging binge eating sex addiction etc.). Despite massive obstacles and periods of life-draining hopelessness I usually carry with me a sense that I'm still working toward freedom from addiction that I'm still moving toward recovery and will inevitably make it there one day...Fast forward to a few months ago and something feels like it just clicked off. At that time I ended a pretty serious relationship when it just got to be too much and started slipping into the same old self-destructive behaviors. And for those past few months the message that keeps churning inside is "I just don't care." It feels impossible to muster the desire to even **want** to be sober from anything let along rally and abstain one agonizing moment at a time...So I ask fellow aspiring non-drinkers: what the hell do you do when you just can't do it anymore when all hope seems lost and you can't even be bothered to make the effort?..Any help feedback consolation kind words dad jokes free Applebee's giftcards and other gestures are wildly appreciated. Thanks much all.

Going to ask since you didn't mention have you pursued therapy? Sounds like there are larger issues weighing on you. 
It's as simple and as hard as just saying NO to that first drink. I have had very challenging cravings and it is then that i take it one hour one minute at a time. I also go to AA and that seems to help too.
I got support.  Connection is the antidote to addiction...I went to a meeting and just listened.
