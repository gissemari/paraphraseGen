I got sober on August 25th 2017. I've never felt a craving stronger than I did today. I went to work like normal but an opportunity came up to leave at lunch. A coworker asked if I was going to go home but I said "No I'll just end up on the couch drunk watching TV." ..He knows I'm sober and I was joking but it triggered me. About half an hour later I was trying HARD to talk myself out of getting vodka on the way home. I got a DUI last summer but Deferred Prosecution and I have my first meeting with my probation officer tomorrow and I'm guessing I'll have a UA. I knew I couldn't risk it but it almost made it worse. I couldn't not drink. I had to hold myself back from running through the store to get home as fast as possible...I drank a pint of vodka and now I feel relieved and terrified at the same time. I don't know what the consequences will be. I could lose my deferred prosecution which I'm lucky to have. I could go to jail. Best case scenario is I get sent back to intensive outpatient which might not be a bad idea anyway but it's going to break my wife's heart and it means 3 days a week I don't get to see my kids because of my work schedule...What have I done? Almost 8 months down the drain.

If it was me I'd be drinking water and water....and I'd go to as many meetings between now and the probation officer session.
