For a big chunk of my 20s I was in AA. I kinda walked away in 2016 when I had medical issues and moved back in with my parents. I then relapsed on Christmas of 2016. Tried to go back to AA in early 2018 but it just wasnt the same as when i first was in and my old group meetings I went to down where i used to live before I moved back home. I eventually relapsed  in the summer of 2018. But that was just the beginning of this new journey..But as of January 1 2019 I have been in a loving relationship with a girl I have been with since August 18 2016. Which is 2 months before my sobriety date. She knows my story of addiction and mental health. She has been a great source of encouragement for this  journey. Today I have 75 days. And I am proud to say I survived the second hardest part of the holidays which is New Years Eve. Thank you all in r/stopdrinking for sharing your strength and hope with all of us. I love how when I get a craving I come on here and read your testimonies and it gives me strength to carry me through another day. May 2019 bring you many positive things. One Day At A Time. IWNDWYT!!!

For me first in twenty. Be happy you are cutting this evil out early.
