~~.Sorry for the wall of text just seen some people struggling over the last few days and felt this needed to be said...for you and for me~~..N**ow that I have your attention :)**..Before I quit I thought I could moderate.  I thought I had control over my addiction.  It was all a lie wrapped in an enigma surrounded by guilt and shame...But the thing is when I was at my worst I didn't care.  I didn't care who I hurt what I did It was all...about...me.  **My** hurt.  **My** pain.  I spent so much time wallowing in my own self imposed nightmare that I just stopped giving a shit.  I used to joke that my GAFF button was broken...*Error 404:  Emotions not found.*..I realized this week in CR that my enemy is apathy.  I have always been a loner rather be in a quiet room playing a video game or reading than being with people.  Call me an introvert but i didn't like people.  Still really don't.  But my way of dealing with the world was trying to disappear from it....After I got my DUI I spent the next few months in a hell of my own making.  And then after I got out of jail I spiraled SO fast I didn't know which way was up...but to be truthful?  I didn't care if I was going up down or sideways...as long as I could numb out this bullshit world and feel no pain. .. But the thing is...it still hurt when I woke up.  You can't heal with your head in the sand.  Trust me I tried...So I am 310 days sober.  And I still stuggle somedays cause now that I am fully awake and aware I sometimes see / hear too much.  And sometimes it makes me want to close up escape run to a quiet place and just LALALALALALALALALA away the world.  ..It was easier to be emotional cold than aware.  ..But now I know that path leads to nothing but darkness.  And if I drink it only makes it worse because then I start believing the lies that if I take the easy way and numb out the world I'll be ok.  But in reality that path me drinking alone in my room leads to jail an insane asylum or death.  That's it.  and none of those sound great.  You can only chance fate / death enough times before it catches you.  Gd only knows I've chanced it enough times in my life...If I take one more drink it'll lead to my last.  Cause eventually my luck will run out.  Directly or indirectly physically or mentally  it'll kill me.  So I aint gonna roll the dice.  I ain't gonna let Pedro whisper in my ear that I can control my addiction.  Cause that leads to the Reaper's Door...So I took my last drink 310 days ago.  I will wake up tomorrow and say the same thing...I will not drink today no matter what. Fuck Pedro.  And especially FUCK the zero.  Cause I don't want to go back to that person I was I don't want to go to jail again I don't want to end up in a padded room and I am just to gosh darn pretty to die...It was only after I stopped white knuckling it reached out for help (Celebrate Recovery) and got people in my life that helped me stay accountable (including all you lovely people here in SD!) that I started to heal.  To become a better husband father and general good person to be around.  Sure I have my days.  but it's just a day as long as I don't drink.  It'll get better as long as I don't drink.  ..I can avoid the Reaper's Door as long as I can as long as I don't drink...And you can too.  Stay strong fellow sobernauts.  Don't White Knuckle it.  Seek the light seek help if need be and just don't have that first drink.  Cause it may be your last.  F-T-0. **EDIT:  FTZ does sound cooler thanks for that :)**..TL:DR:  Fuck Pedro.  Fuck the Zero.  Don't drink today. :)..Edit:  LOVE the comments.  Thanks all.  Writing is therapy for me so it helps me get my thoughts outta my f'd up head.  ..BTW FTZ didn't come from me.  Great scene from House of Cards called Fuck the Zero.  it's on youtube.  worth watching..

You and me both.  ..Thanks for this
Great post my friend.  I am so proud of you.
Great Post!  Thank you for your clear and unfiltered honesty...I hope everyone wondering about sobriety reads it...You're an inspiration.
I love this. It's reality. "You can only chance fate / death enough times before it catches you". I realize how lucky I am to be here after so many brushes with this. I ain't gonna roll the dice either. FTZ. And fuck Pedro. Just STFU :).
Fuck the Zero!!! Keep on counting! One Day at a Time.  ..Everything else can be what it is- if I'm not drinking I know I can handle it.
Well said. Thanks
I don't know who Pedro is but this is a great post. And try as you might you are never alone. We are always with you even us raging introverts. Stay strong.
Fuck Pedro!!  
Good to see another CR'er on here. I needed AA and CR. Yes indeed F-T-0!
You are awesome.
  FTZ!
Hurrah guy! What a great post! 310 days is epic!!
Fuck Pedro; fuck his friend Skipper.  I won't drink with you dammit.
&gt;I am just to gosh darn pretty to die...Love it!! Fantastic post FTZ ..
Fantastic post (made me cry) and well done to have got to this place of 310 days and counting. Fuck Pedro!!!
What a great post for me to read on my first day back after a relapse.  Big choices ... to lead a full life with confidence or to choose loneliness and insanity!  I will not drink today.
Ugh. I've been in that padded jail cell too. Never want to be there again! With that being said today I will not take a drink.
&gt;But the thing is...it still hurt when I woke up. You can't heal with your head in the sand. Trust me I tried...This is so true.  Great share thanks.  Not drinking with you today fo sho.
