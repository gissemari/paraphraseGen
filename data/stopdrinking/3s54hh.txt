I do not visit this sub as often as I did. At first I was reading it a couple times a day and checking in each day. Then it was once a day then a couple times a week and now it is about once a week. ..Why did it drop? The booze isn't on my mind. Life is far from perfect and every now and then I am presented with temptation but it has not swayed me. I think the better I'm doing and the less I'm feeling tempted the less I need the reminders. ..That said - I did check in today. I read about struggles people are having and I understand them. I feel them. I'm reminded that I'm an alcoholic and that I cannot control my drinking. I'm reminded of why I'm sober now.

Everyone has different needs that change over time. I took a break off this sub for about a year and just recently came back. The thing is that you have to do what works for you so that you can stay sober. ..I've found that for me at least keeping my patterns rote doesn't work. I have to be innovating and changing things up to keep myself dry. If I fall into patterns I get bored. Boredom leads to stupid things for me... Know what I mean?
I'm concerned that left to my own devices I would eventually decide to start drinking again.  It's what has happened every time I've quit drinking alone.  So I come here every day (and there are definitely mornings when I think "I don't want to think about not drinking first thing in the morning today") and remind myself that my not drinking is very important to me and that I have some very basic tools at my disposal to keep me from going back to it.
