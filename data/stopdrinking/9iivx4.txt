Never posted on here before but I feel if I'm ever going to kick this terrible Habit of mine i could use some guidance. I'll be turning 21 in a couple of weeks and I'm going to try and quit drinking from this point on. This is something that I've been thinking about the last couple of years a my relationship with alcohol has gotten worse and worse...I started drinking when I was 16 years old as somebody who struggles slightly with anxiety I loved how it made me feel free and able to communicate with people easier. I kept pushing the boundaries and drinking more and more as I got older. Started getting blackout drunk here and there but didn't think much of it thought I was just being a normal teenager. ..As I got a bit older I'd start drinking on my own most days to relieve stress in my life and I'd binge drink every weekend to the point where I'd be completely incoherent unable to walk talk and I've put myself in some extremely dangerous situations doing this I become loud and obnoxious I've lost so many friends over the last few years from my actions when I'm drunk. The feeling of guilt and depression alcohol gives me the days following a blackout doesn't seem worth it. ..The last year and a half has been strange I find myself taking frequent  breaks' from drinking and coming back when I think I can control myself better. This never works for every good night out with friends I have there will always be a bad night where I blackout and cause myself terrible problems...This came to a boiling point at the weekend I've recently got into a new relationship I hadn't drank heavily for a few weeks and we were going on a night out for our friends birthday. I got myself into a state of blacking out later into the night waking up the morning after with my girlfriend to find her crying because I had taken a blade and slashed up my left wrist for reasons I do not know. I don't know why I would do this I'm not depressed I've got no history of self harm and I've got no memory of doing this. I've had friends tell me in the past that when I'm blackout drunk I become really cynical and depressing...It's kind of a wake up call for me as I don't want to ruin this relationship and I feel absolutely horrible for making her worry about me like that. That's the last straw and I've got to quit drinking I don't want to take any risks anymore. ..Sorry I've never written anything like this before I'm not too sure what I'm doing here really I just had to talk about this. I want to leave this part of me in the past. I know I'm only 20 but I've got nothing to gain from alcohol anymore. I'm not going to risk destroying this relationship as I feel it's one of the only things that can keep me on the rails. ..It's gonna be tough not drinking but I'm going to try my absolute hardest. I don't want another break I wanna be done with this once and for all...Sorry didn't realise how long that was if anybody's bothered to read all of this thank you.

You are wise beyond your years. I wish I had realized my problem before I did..you have support here and if you want to stop drinking be sure to post here as often as possible and keep yourself accountable. You've got this..I believe in you!
Sounds like you've got a pretty good head on your shoulders.   Every time I drank I never had a crazy regrettable episode.  But when I did.. I hear you no one ever gets thrown in the drunk tank for being sober.  I would like to assure you that it's fun out here it is what we make it.  IWNDWYT
