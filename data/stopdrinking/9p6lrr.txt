I have been struggling with some of my other addictions. So now am adding my total days sober together. Hope this may help others with multiple addictions...Alcohol     10526.Gambling         44.Sex                       2.Total          10572..Once I add coffee my beloved sugar and food each day will be 6 added. Total grows fast. Gives me a greater number to loose and a bigger number if I hang in 1 day...Your Friend John

Thank you for sharing I appreciate it! Have you found that what you learned from dealing with one addiction has helped you with dealing with others? (Asking for a friend with a cigarette smoking Diet Coke drinking monkey on her back.)
