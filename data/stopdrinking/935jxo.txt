I've got to detox again. This last relapse got really bad. I don't know what else to say. It's embarrassing but I need to be here. Not trying to pull anyone down just trying to climb back on.

We're happy to have you back. :) ..Stay strong you can do this! We are here for you!..IWNDWYT!  
They do tend to be bad (and progressively worse). Welcome back!
I'm with you u/OmishButter ... got to do it again also.  No time like the present.  I will admit it was a mistake to try to drink again after 2 weeks clean no question about it.  
We are here with you! 
It's good to see you.  Let's do this!
