the more times I relapse the harder it gets each time to quit drinking again. Today is day one. I purposely drank a lot last night because I knew it was my last night drinking and still didn't feel drunk (3 IPAs and a shot of fireball). I can't picture my life without alcohol but I know I hate what my life is like with alcohol in it. I'm overweight depressed crappy mom lazy forgetful always hung over yet I keep going back to the bottle. ..Iwndwyt

You sound a lot like me. I'm having a really hard time quitting this time. Only getting 4 day breaks in between binging. I said I wouldn't bring it in the house then I did. I feel like I have to drink it all as fast as possible so there won't be any in the house again. Anyway I'm trying to build up the courage to go to my doctor and get on medication to help me quit. Maybe that would help you as well?
Being sober is a daily relief not a daily struggle. I am very like you and everyone else on here...I read your post (read it again). You are too hard on yourself. Leave that to others. Mindset is vital when trying to get sober. Words like cant won't etc set us up for failure. Be positive I will do this I can do this. Have you ever heard the phrase fake it til you make it! Keep going !
**"I'm overweight..."** ..You will be less so...&amp;#x200B;..**"I'm depressed..."** ..You know darn well that will change...&amp;#x200B;..**"I'm a crappy mom..."** ..No you aren't...you're a sick mom. If it was a tumor causing your issues would you be so hard on yourself? Of course not. A crappy mom wouldn't be so desperate to change for her children. ..&amp;#x200B;..Your post made me want to cry and give you a hug. I know what it means to feel like you're letting your children down. It's one of the most terrible soul-crushing feelings in the world. I managed to change almost everything about myself to become a good dad. I'm still struggling with alcohol but I won't stop fighting until I've beaten it. When I truly made the decision that I would do WHATEVER it takes to stop and never give up no matter how many times I failed I felt this strange sense of peace. I guess because I know that eventually it will stick for me. You too...I sincerely believe that. You have the desire the motivation and even though you are hungover and feel like absolute shit you are here owning up to it. That takes courage...&amp;#x200B;..Dust yourself off and ride with us again  
Best of luck to you. At least your making a decision. What is your longest streak going without alcohol?
