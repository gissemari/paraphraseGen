Hey everyone! Hope you all have a great Friday!   ..Quote : "The worst thing that can happen in a democracy - as well as in an individual's life - is to become cynical about the future and lose hope."-  Hillary Clinton  ..This struck me I think because it was Hillary who said it. She's faced a life time of struggles to overcome obstacles to negotiate hatred and cynicism to sway and God alone knows what else. And all this and in the end she lost anyway.   ..It must be agony and it must feel like what's the point in going through any of it? It's worth it because of hope. Because of the chance things may be better. If she can square her shoulders pick herself up and carry on after such a massive and public failure than surely I or you can do the same.  ..Don't for a second think that failure is fatal or final. It's only final if you decide then and there to quit trying. Don't ever stop trying to improve yourself and your life. There'll be set backs and failures. You'll let yourself and others down. But keep going because it is worth it. You're worth it.   ..Goodnight everyone :)

Hope + Inaction = Fantasy..Hope + Action = Results..Failure is fatal or final when *I accept it as such*..*Fall down seven times*..*Get up Eight*      ..-----Japanese Proverb (shared in another "Quote)..We're all in it together and we're all Worth It !!
