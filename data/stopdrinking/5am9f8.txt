Hi guys! Right off the bat I want to say that my attitude with this post is open and not combative! I legitimately feel like I don't have any reason to quit drinking and I'm looking for external perspectives. ..A bit about me: I'm a man in my mid twenties. I have a good full-time job in the tech industry and I get great performance reviews. In fact I'm for a promotion at the end of the year. I live alone and I'm not super social but usually hang out with friends a couple of nights a week. I also teach martial arts on Monday nights and compete (and sometimes win! woohoo!) at big events 5-6 times throughout the year. I have a couple FWBs and I'm not really looking for a relationship more than that for now. ..Here's the thing though. I get blackout drunk 3-5 nights a week...It's pretty standard for me to by a bottle of wine on my way home from work and pass out drunk by 8 wake up at 3am to rehydrate then rinse and repeat...They say that the first step is admitting that you have a problem and I know that getting drunk alone in your room 5 days a week is generally considered not good but I honestly can't convince myself that it's actually a problem. I have energy throughout the day. I'm in pretty good shape. I have a healthy social life. It's not effecting my work at all. I have other hobbies and things that do for fun (martial arts Hearthstone piano etc). I never ever drive drunk and my drunk self is by all accounts somewhere in the spectrum between hilarious and adorable. Sure this is probably not sustainable as I get up into my 30s but why would I worry about that now?..I really admire people who are able to self-analyze and who have a willingness to work on personality flaws but I just can't really see this as a flaw? Any outside perspective would be really really awesome!..((Also I understand that there are people here who are struggling with alcoholism and fighting to quit drinking. Mods if you think this conversation would be damaging to members of your community please feel free to take this post down!))

If it's not a problem it's not a problem. I lived many years like this (probably a decade or so) and it was never more than a passing "hey this probably isn't the healthiest or sanest." But never more than that...Now that I'm on the other side and see how great living sober is damn do I wish I had that time back. But hey it is what it is. I can't rewrite that time and yeah at the time it didn't really keep me up at night or anything.
No one quits drinking who doesn't want to. Nothing I say will make you change your mind if you reall want to drink. Something brought you here though likely the same voice I ignored in my twenties. Exactly as you speculated it is hard to maintain the pace into the thirties and forties. Alcohol is toxic and the toll it takes increases with time. I can only wish that I put the brakes on at your age but alas I did not. I rode the party bus until time booted me off broke broken and sick in my forties. I can't say my experience will be yours but my story is pretty fucking common sround here. Take good care of yourself.
This is a fine conversation.  An "appropriate" conversation...There's a full spectrum of "Alcohol Use Disorder" (AUD)...If you're happy don't do anything different.  Keep drinking.  It's always *your* choice.  Drink don't drink moderate.....it's *all* your choice...I can tell you what I figured out for *myself*...I learned simply :  *Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..At some point I decided that I wanted to eliminate alcohol-related Undesired Consequences...When people 'ask' me for suggestions.  This is what I tell them:  "If you don't have any *Undesired Consequences* why change anything?"..You write:..&gt; I honestly can't convince myself that it's actually a problem..I have two questions for you:..(1) If **you** can't convince yourself that you have a problem do you think that anyone else can?..(2) What would you *need to hear from someone* so that you'd say "Oh!  I see!  I **DO** have a problem and I should do something about it"?..Let's see what your responses are to the two questions and then we may have somewhere to go!..Look forward eagerly to your responses!..Again Glad you're here exploring your life!..Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One..
getting blackout drunk 3-5 nights a week is definitely bad for your organs. it might take years and years to see even a slight bit of damage depending on the body but the damage will happen. while you may have all of your life in order it'll start to wear your health down for sure. ..now it's totally your decision how important that is to you! if it were me i'd at least attempt cutting back the frequency/volume with which you drink but the steps you take are totally up to you. definitely here to support you along with the rest of the community if you want to stop drinking! 
When I was in my mid 20s I drank a lot too and had good energy very successful at work and life too.  I realize now part of that was being in my 20s.  That pattern will become just that...a pattern...and then the 30s come and a few pounds and a little mental fog...then a few more in your 40s but hey I have always drunk like this it's no problem...until I woke up one day realizing it is not normal to be overweight depressed and blackout drunk every night of the week.  I mistook youth for invulnerability and developed a problem that is proving hard to shake.  My 3-5 became 5-7 became 7 became 365 a year...for 20+ years...
&gt; I honestly can't convince myself that it's actually a problem. I have energy throughout the day. I'm in pretty good shape. I have a healthy social life. It's not effecting my work at all. I have other hobbies and things that do for fun (martial arts Hearthstone piano etc). I never ever drive drunk and my drunk self is by all accounts somewhere in the spectrum between hilarious and adorable...You are me 10 years ago to a tee.  And it's not like I was deluding myself to justify my drinking all of those things about me were very true at the time.  I don't want to play the "Ghost of Christmas Future" card because everyone is on a different path and there's no certainty that your relationship with alcohol will gradually deteriorate like mine did... but I would give anything to go back and stop drinking in my mid-20s preventing the problems (and even just the overall inertia) it led to down the line...Maybe you don't feel the need to quit right now (though I can't imagine many doctors would endorse drinking to blackout most nights) but just keep an awareness about your drinking habits and if they've changed over time.  It can be a slippery slope especially for those of us that don't want to stop drinking once we start.  On the plus side at least you're here and questioning it!  So you may already have that awareness but be vigilant.
Just echoing what other people have said. ..1.) Getting black out drunk is a sign the body/brain isn't tolerating alcohol for any number of reasons and is causing damage...2.) You won't stop drinking unless you want to/care about the damage..
Something I said to myself long ago but didn't listen then: "if I'm looking on the Internet for answers to my drinking behavior it's probably a problem"
&gt; I just can't really see this as a flaw..If it's not broke.....As a thought experiment -- What if you had those hours every night to pursue your passion to make memories with those you love to get rich to help another in need to push you body to new feats of strength and endurance to earn a black belt? What if you by investing in your health (not drinking) wealth (not spending money on alcohol) and happiness (let's be honest hangovers are miserable) could be the someone you've only dared to dream about being? What if it only took 365 days one trip around the sun to transform any and all of the parts of your life you want *just* by reclaiming those 3-5 evenings a week and putting that time towards achieving a goal?..What's the worst that could happen if you stopped drinking alcohol for say 100 days?..Just because something isn't broken doesn't mean it doesn't need repair or cannot be improved. 
It's super unhealthy to be getting that drunk that often. I'm 22 and after about 3-4 years of doing that I had gained a lot of weight my skin was crap and i fucked up a lot of things in my career education and my relationships (not just romantic relationships). When I first quit I thought after about 2-3 months things would be completely better for me but my body/life is still recovering and I'm still running into new problems that were caused by my drinking. You may not realize the damage you're doing right now but it adds up over time and some things you won't even notice until you stop. ..I'm not going to try to convince you that you have a problem maybe you should try stopping for 30/60/90 days and take it as a chance to examine your relationship with alcohol. If you keep drinking there are apps out there that you can use to keep track of your drinking and they'll tell you what risks your specific level of drinking can carry 
For starters I still drink but not like I used to or for the same reasons. ..Pretty much everyone here was in your shoes at some point. There's a time for many sometimes long sometimes short where drinking is just a way to relax or have fun which is how it's supposed to be. For a lot of people eventually it catches up to them if they don't nip it in the bud. Coworkers or boss notice you smell like a booze or you prioritize drinking over other even small things. Missed romantic career or personal opportunities because you're home drunk. You never want it to become a habit or a crutch because that's how you get screwed. Got that promotion? Drink. Rough day at work? Drink. Bored? Drink. Having a get together? Drink. It's like playing with fire if you're not careful you'll get burned...I could go on and on but listen to one thing: No one in history has drank to develop a problem. It never happens over night. It happens slowly too slow to even realize things have changed. ..You don't have to be an alcoholic to have a drinking problem. You don't even have to have a drinking problem to have negative consequences from alcohol. For a lot of people alcohol never becomes a problem but practically everyone assumes they're too special to be a statistic. ..Personally I'm interested in why you now drink so much. Things like loneliness boredom sleep issues underlying depression etc are pretty common. You can be doing great in one aspect of your life but if another area isn't fulfilled it can consciously or subconsciously have a huge impact on you. ..Drinking is fun otherwise no one would ever have issues with it. Just take it from me: The fact you're asking means you need to take a step back cut it back and refocus your evenings doing something or someone else. Doesn't mean you have a problem but it is a bad habit start forming at your age and once it's learned it's a bitch to kick. ........
Hey I totally see where you're coming from here. You're young and seem to be doing well otherwise or at least you perceive it that way. Like others have said alcohol abuse is a spectrum that ranges from the homeless man slugging back 40's outside your 7/11 to the C-level exec with the multiple DUIs- neither is a better person and both have an alcohol use disorder. It looks different on everyone and I'm happy you feel like you're doing well but try not to get too caught up comparing yourself to others. Try your best to think about your ideal self and living life on your terms and to your true potential. ..Blacking out sucks and I hate it. If you don't feel you have consequences right now then it's fine to keep drinking or try and moderate. Hell- do whatever makes you happy. I eventually just got tired as hell of blacking out and feeling completely ashamed and humiliated constantly worrying about my emotional and physical health and damaging relationships some of which were very valuable and I really beat myself up for it. ..I don't want to sound preachy because I know that's not good in this sub but I've said it before a couple times here- anyone who drinks to the point of blackout multiple times a week is living on borrowed time. Eventually the shit is going to hit the fan. The liver is amazing but can only handle so much abuse. The brain can only rebalance neurotransmitters so much. Eventually the body and mind will crap out. It may be very insidious and not even noticeable. That's all aside from DUIs damaged relationships financial trouble missing work etc. ..Eventually drinking will catch up with you. I've tried moderating I can't even say how many times. Sure I can moderate for a week maybe even two maybe 10 sometimes but eventually the shit hits the fan and I'm right back to where I didn't want to be. ..I hope this helps and good luck! All I can do is share my experience and tell you to do whatever you think is the right thing to do. 
I think you may get some very interesting answers to your own questions if you try an experiment: try not drinking for a length of time. Could be a week or a month. Physical withdrawal can be 3-10 days so a week or two should prove illuminating. ..I think a successful high-achieving person like yourself may well discover a lot of unsettling things about alcohol dependency. You may find that you're not in control of your own life. And then you'll have to decide how you feel about it and what you want to do about it. 
Even if you feel fine now when you are still young you will regret that destructive lifestyle later on when health problems start catching up on you. Damage from alcohol isnt instant but accumulates over time. And binging several times a week is by all standards a damaging consumption
