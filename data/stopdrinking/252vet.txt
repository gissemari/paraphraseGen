Also I guess I need my flair changed. I not craving alcohol as much as I am the benzos. Seen many posts about people struggling with both..I feel like I am going to drink just to tolerate the anxiety.  Losing my determination today.T.I.A.

Exercise helps me a ton with anxiety.  I like running.
Meditation relieved me.
According to my counseling anxiety is generally a combination of overestimating likelihood of something bad happening overestimating the harm of something bad happening and underestimating your ability to cope. It helps me to look straight on at what I'm afraid of amd to thinl which of those three things ia the most true. ..I hope that helps you. Anxiety blows. 
Exercise sleep and nutrition are huge when it comes to my anxiety issues.  Especially rhythmic exercise like bicycling hiking or running.  Meditation and breathing exercises help quite a bit too.
Perhaps you should talk with your doctor. Getting off both benzos and alcohol at the same time can be risky. Benzos usually need a taper. Better to get medical help than start drinking again.
