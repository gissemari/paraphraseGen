For the past like 4-6 months I've really wanted to go to a bar/club and DANCE.  I've been getting more fit I've been appreciating my body a bunch of other life events I wont devolve into and I've had this urge to go to a club and dance like I used to like 10-15 years ago.  ..I was invited to a BBQ for one of the local pride/queer groups and so I went.  I knew 2 of the ladies but upon arrival found I knew 1 or 2 others.  But I don't know any of them very well just have met them once or twice at prior meetups.  Anyways ended up talking about programming and software all night because I guess I talk good about it (in laymans terms) and people kept asking questions.  ..Anyways the 2 gals I knew were talking about going to a local club (the only gay club) because there was a comedy night.  And the thought -- I COULD DANCE ! -- came immediately to mind.  So we went there was a commedian when we got there but within 30 minutes she was off the stage and it turned into more of a club.  My one friend was up on the dance floor all by herself and as soon as I saw that I was up there with her.  It wasn't club type music more like the older music that they play when they know nobody's dancing.  But we were!  I tore up that floor! DANCE DANCE DANCE!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!O!@  Oh my god it felt sO good.  I had this thought "I miss having fun!" and I was having so much fun dancing..COMPLETELY SOBER! I don't think I'd _ever_ danced sober outside of my kitchen y'know?  In fact the last clubbing experience I'd had was mired in meth addiction with the friends I used to hang around.  I was asking my other friend to come dancing and she said "oh I haven't had enough to drink yet."   I didn't respond...i ordered a cranbery and soda when I first got in there.  And after the first dancing session a few cigarettes ordered another.  i looked at the glass... "uhh... is that a cranberry and soda?"  "Oh! sorry! I thought you said crown and soda."  He quickly fixed me the proper drink...I didn't have any desire to drink.  When there was an alcohol drink in front of me my first thought was fear.  I was aware of how "holy shit I'm at a bar not drinking" but I was not even remotely tempted.  about 3/4 of the way through the night I was like "I gotta tell reddit!"..The club music had started and I got up onthe dance floor with my friend again.  this time the floor was packed and I was having fun dancing and checking out the other dancers (omg there was this one woman that was SO striking I almost worked up the nerve to tell her how much I liked to watch her dance but I chickened out)...I think it helped that my friends knew I was sober.  I've shared with them previously about some of my struggles.  I watched someone else from the BBQ who was having wine get more and more slurred throughout the evening.  the smell of her wine was so strong and off-putting.  Not that I smelled much better with my copious cigarette habit but still.. I could drive home without issue at the end of the night - at 1.30am!  ..omg so much fun..and not something I could've even _imagined_ a year ago or even six months ago.  I still have temptations and such but last night there was no way I was going to let anything fuck up my ability to have fun.  That's what drinking would've done - ruined a fabulous evening...I drove home and got mcdonalds fries on the way because it jsut seemed like the thing to do after a night at the club.  Came home and was just so jacked up it I didn't go to sleep until I woke up at 4am on the couch turned off youtube and crawled into bed.  Today I went house hunting with my mom thanks to my impending divorce I need a new home.  Life is pretty tough all over and the thing I'm not going to do is make my life harder my letting that demon inside of me.  I handle my alcohol great these days - by keeping it outside my body...This is so amazing.  I couldn't have done it (a) without stopdrinking (b) without  time passing - time is healing the wounds (c) me believing and caring and trusting in myself enough to listen to the voice that was like "be healthier"... "a healthier 2017" was what I said to myself on new years eve.. and it took me some 6-7 months of trying and failing and trying and failing before I hit my current streak (going to be a year pretty soon).  ..My day 1s were not like my day 10s and those weren't like my day 30s but I've only had one day 60 so far.  I hope to keep it that way...Thank you reddit..and you better believe that I am not drinking with y'all fabulous fellow sobernaughts today!!!!  stay strong change is possible and you don't have to do it alone because we're all here for you.  one day at a time works miracles over the long term.  literal miracles.  I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!!!!!..DANCE! DANCE! DANCE!!

This brings a huge smile to my face.  Dancing is fun for sure.  Caught myself in my pjs on the patio dancing to Paul Simon a few days ago and I thought:  who IS this person?  I didn't know you could dance without alcohol.  ..Very happy for you!
Super. All good then.  And since perfect does not exist no sense even worrying about it.  Lots going on in your life and your keeping your wits about you.  Enjoy!
