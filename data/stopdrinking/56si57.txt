It's day 6.  I'm starting to feel better physically at this point.  Mentally is a different story.  I don't necessarily feel depressed or upset... I just have so much anxiety about facing the things that I wasn't facing when I was drinking...I am enrolled full time in school and have three terms left.  I haven't gone in about a week and a half but my teacher normally covers for me because I work in the industry and I work full time.  I didn't register for next term (I didn't have enough money because well drinking and I was really sick with withdrawals during enrollment). This term is over tomorrow.  ..I want to tell my teacher that I'm sorry but I can't tell him the truth.  He belittles me for missing classes when I go in which makes me want to drink.  I don't think that this is a safe place in my recovery for me to deal with something like that.  But I feel guilty.  This is my teacher's last term before he retires.   He really helped me along including getting me a scholarship for student of the year.  Here I am dropping out.  I'm not actually dropping out I am just taking this term off but I still feel so guilty that I had a panic attack when I woke up this morning.  My SO told me it wasn't worth it and to stay home so I stayed home...I got another notice from a collections agency about my recent hospital visit when I didn't have insurance.  It's funny because I went for chest pains and dizziness which was actually the beginning of the daily withdrawal symptoms I began to have. The doctors there didn't do anything for me or even give me a diagnosis just sent me away with a prescription for dramamine and $5000 in debt.  I have 5 bills in collections because of that visit but I really just can't afford to pay them.  I tried to work out payment plans but they want me to pay upwards of $300 a month total and I don't make enough to cover that even without drinking. It's terrifying.  I get collection calls every day that I just can't answer...I feel like every aspect of my life has been affected by my drinking and I just ignored it because I was getting along alright.  ..I can't ignore these things anymore if I want sobriety to be *great* and not just *alright*.  ..Yeah I was a functional drinking alcoholic.  But so far as a non-drinking alcoholic I do not feel functional.  I won't drink today but I want to.  I want to start ignoring all this stuff again so things feel *alright*.  I don't want to be afraid all of the time.  This is the hardest day so far even though I am physically feeling better...But I'll fight through.  Maybe tomorrow or the day after or the day after I won't be paralyzed by fear and I can actually work my way through this.  Maybe with a little work things can be *great*.  So I won't drink today.

I'm thinking you might be American like me since you mention your medical bills. I can't afford insurance either and most of my debt is medical. we thought obamacare would help but it hasn't yet. ..I'm just trying to tackle my bills as I can. I really think we can pay what we can and they will leave us alone. I was sent to collections and I was able to explain that I'd pay 25 bucks a month but that's all I could do. I basically asked if they were saying that my health wasn't important because I make less money...But you're right we can't ignore what we do. This is the hardest part of being sober. Dealing with what we've done. But we can and will deal with it. And I will be happy to stay sober with you today!
