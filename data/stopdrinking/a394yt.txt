I found SD (and Reddit for that matter) November 2017. Lurked for awhile did lots of reading (and crying at the time). Ultimately I made the jump my Day 1 on Dec 4th...I relapsed 17 days later. But those were an incredible 17 days. It was a needed respite from months and years of drinking every night. It was a peek through a window into another life. My relapse lasted about 59 days. It wasn't even enjoyable drinking at that point now that I knew how peaceful going to bed and waking up sober could feel. Some nights I even reached for a seltzer instead of the 9th or 10th beer because I was so drunkenly disgusted with myself. I was miserable. ..It sucked to relapse but I have appreciated it for the things I learned about sober living from it. Relapses are setbacks but they can also be valuable learning lessons. Don't let those lessons be wasted by viewing the relapse as a failure. In my case the primary reason was not being upfront with my wife about my drinking and desire to stop...IWNDWYT

My one year first attempt is coming up...major wake up call for me. Thank you for sharing I feel like a lot of people don't talk about the first attempts usually it's marked by the last drink
