Today is day 30. I actually doubted myself quite a bit but I did it. And I'm sticking with it--I haven't been sober this long in about 10 years and it feels great. I haven't had that gut wrenching feeling of self-defeat and helplessness in 30 days. I set a goal and I reached it. ..I've lost 10lbs despite eating Ben and Jerry's by the pint and large pizzas whenever I want. I feel good. My mood and outlook has improved. I still get lonely I still get stressed out I still have annoying every day drama and internal struggles but I'm handling it all much better...I will not drink with you today. And a sincere thank you to all of you for your stories encouragement and support!.

Love your star! So shiny! Great to hear that you're feeling good. Well done. 
Congrats you're a **STAR**!!..I was a huge Ben and Jerry's Half-Baked Froyo fan during the first few months. Amazing how comforting it was! I've since become even a bigger fan of Halo Top (Cookies and Cream OMG!)...So proud and happy for you - keep goin'! :)
That's terrific - and that star looks brilliant on you :) It's wonderful how you are seeing upsides that encourage you to keep going. I will keep going with you! :).
