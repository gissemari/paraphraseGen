A totally new twist on the old subconscious favorite...dreamt that I was getting together with some old college chums big drinkers all of them who I had some wild and crazy times with back in the day (IRL none of them are alcoholics just me and they don't know about  my struggles). We were at a bar and I refused the offer of a drink. I had that sinking sensation in my stomach that I was going to have to explain why...but I stayed strong even though they were all ribbing me about it. I felt really good in the dream. Just thought this was an interesting development maybe I'm finally evolving on the deepest level..edit: now I just have to work on Dry Places Dry People on the subconscious level haha.
