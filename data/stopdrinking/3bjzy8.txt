I'd convinced myself that I'd be okay. I mean I'm a college student with exam results to celebrate right? I've made it through thirty whole days more than once right? I know how addiction works - I get that after a period of sobriety people who drink like me aren't suddenly able to moderate that traffic on this street only travels in one direction. I know that ingesting alcohol provides a mirage of and not actually a shortcut to the things I want from my life and from myself - but maybe I was different right? ..Maybe the confidence and success I'd found over multiple (relatively short) periods of sobriety would only be compounded by the elixir! And surely the incredible people who I've found over the last year love me just for me! They don't care whether or not I'm drinking right?..So "I'm not quitting forever but I'm definitely not imbibing during this semester" became "I got halfway through! These amazing new friends are going for a drink! I could have just one too!" .I did have just one. And a week later I had several more. A few months later I tallied up the number of drinks I had last week. This was a quiet week the kinda week I use to tell myself I don't have a problem. No blackouts! No embarrassing conversations! I didn't skip work! I had 35-40 drinks last week over 5 days - so I mean I didn't even drink every day! ..On the other hand I'm a small female. That's a lot of poison for a "quiet week". There are other things resting on this hand too. It's hard to keep believing I'm here to be social when I'm not following the conversation 'cause I'm busy with the familiar arithmetic: how much booze is here/how much can I afford to buy/how tired does everyone look - am I likely to make it to my sweet point before they expect me to leave with them? ..My favourite new hangover symptom is the one where my heart's racing past tachycardia into "dear god I think I'm beginning to experience mild withdrawal on my mornings-after" territory. Yesterday morning the nausea was crippling the dehydration such that I swear my brain felt crispy. Thankfully this relapse is several months old so I'm practised at telling myself that the ability to throw my bar-soaked clothing into the washer means I'm functioning - that's all I achieved all day? And what? I'm on holiday! What am I supposed to be achieving?! ..I didn't drink yesterday and I've no intention of drinking today. But I can't tell you what'll happen tomorrow and guys that's what I mourn most dearly from my last string of good days - knowing that drinking wasn't something I even wanted to do (which evidently wasn't enough!)..It's not the nausea the money the concerned looks from my family. It's not the fear I'll lose everything I've worked so hard for nor the pounds I'm piling back on it's not the self-disgust and shame. The reason I'm not going to drink any alcohol today is that I know with startling certainty that the more times I do this the further I get and will continue to get from the peace I know comes with the quiet mornings. I'm moving further from being able to even believe that I can achieve that again - and it was only a quiet week guys.

The reason I don't drink TODAY is because I stayed sober long enough to begin to see and value my alcohol-free life.  Life  on life's terms.  
I have a friend that's relapsing right now I sure don't envy him.  Seems like you're looking at it the right way congrats on quitting.
You're gaining weight from not drinking??
**Chowdah!!!!** &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I'm glad you checked in!!!! Yeah relapse is a bitch to claw back from. Do you have any IRL sobriety support?
