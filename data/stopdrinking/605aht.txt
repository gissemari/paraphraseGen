I'm sorry you're struggling but congrats on so much time sober! ..I too struggle with my regimented routine and sobriety. What helps is remembering/recognizing that while my alcoholic days were far more interesting they were also selfish and depressing. If you were to fall off the wagon and stay off you'd miss out on your son. If I were to fall off the wagon and stay off I'd lose everything I've worked to rebuild. ..There are dire consequences to drinking. From adverse health conditions to poverty to losing important people in your life we all walk a very fine line when we begin to consider drinking. I was also given an ultimatum and was resentful for a long time. Along the way however I discovered reasons to stay sober for me and that made all the difference.
