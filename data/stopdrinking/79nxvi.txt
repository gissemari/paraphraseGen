So over the weekend I had a relapse and really let go. I started Thursday with a small bottle and that turned into a few. ..I will start by saying nothing bad happened other than a hangover and drinking but it did serve as a solid reminder that I need to start building more healthy coping mechanisms and proper structure for when things are going wrong. ..I have taken steps with work to outline what needs to be done to prevent high stress and failures which pushed me to break but aside from pushing me to break identified where I was weakest. ..I am going to be reading and trying to develop other coping mechanisms for when everything goes wrong and when I say everything wow do I mean everything. I will be working on a way around this to make sure that I do not relapse like this again. For input from you folks I would love to hear what you do when you reach your breaking point or when you see all the stress hits you. I am going to be talking to a few friends to setup a support network that I can reach out to when shit hits the fan but I realize that I may need to build something internal a skill set or habits that allow ME to handle it not to simply depend on others.  ..If the issues at work persist I may end up leaving the role as I recognize that stress may not reduce for the next period of time and being clean is more important to me than money and I can always go back to freelance work.

I think you point to a crucial difference between a stressful event and high levels of ongoing stress with no relief--I can move through one stressful event almost no matter how intense but I can't sustain that over time; I can't "move through" a nebulous relentless pressure with no edges. At least not at the moment. I'd have to change that phenomenon of endless pressure. So I would think seriously about the job if indeed you have another option--your priorities are entirely in order regarding that.  ..I don't think the body is even supposed to know how to bear up under  daily plodding raw-nerve exhausting pressure without a clear end. I really don't. It mimics survival mode and blows our your adrenals and nervous system. People do it but they always suffer in one way or another. ..So I'm not sure you were "supposed" to know how to deal. If you could step away you could instead build up your internal resources by practicing with small finite stresses that you actually have a chance at resolving. Just ideas. Glad you're back. &lt;3
