Hi all..I'll try my best to keep it brief but I've been really struggling with my drinking the past 6-7 months. I've lost 3 jobs in the last year due to it and have tried several times for a month or two at a time to go to meetings but have just never gotten down with the program. Brief context I had 2.5 years of sobriety about 2 years ago and was going to meetings pretty regularly (albeit very begrudgingly) for the first year because it was a requirement for my sober living program. Anyways I feel so isolated and alone living a double-life at work and not being able to be honest with a single person about my past and my inability to control my drinking. There just isn't any other program in my area like SMART which has only 2 weekly meetings that are both an hour away and at 5:30 p.m. (seriously who schedules meetings that early?! I want THAT job) LifeRing is not a thing here etc. Seems like to get the support I need I'm going to have to go back to AA. Have never had good experiences with the people or program despite having gone to probably well over 1000x meetings in four different states over the last 7 years. ..My question to y'all is if like me you left AA for similar reasons but are now back in the program what did it take to do so? I'm sure the most common responses will be akin to "I decided to stop digging" or "the pain exceeded the reward" etc. but I'd appreciate a bit more tangible non-sloganeering responses just for the sake of gaining additional context. I really really want it to work for me but have a ton of prior baggage keeping me from being open to it. Thanks!

I didn't fully get the AA program until I was honestly share with another person my baggage. I didn't even do it in AA. It was suggested I go to confession and honestly confess what I had done. I never had gone to confession before nor was I part of the church but being able to tell another human being was truly trans-formative. I then found out that my baggage is what helped me to connect with other people in AA. Many of whom had done the same things as I. I hope this helps you. Be honest with somebody else doesn't matter who it is just needs to be another person. Best of luck bud.
