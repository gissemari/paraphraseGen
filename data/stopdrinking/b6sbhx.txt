My time has come to finally quit alcohol once and for all. I just want to take this opportunity to maybe detail some things I wish I had read when I was first looking into quitting...I just want to say before hand that I never had a major event or anything that made me quit I've been lucky enough to nip it in the bud before it became serious problem. I want to write a little about my drinking experiences to show how easy it is to fall into a certain pattern. I want to detail how I kind of knew I was an alcoholic but avoided facing it also some of the opporunities that should have given it away but somehow didn't. I think a post like this would have helped me so I feel like I should share it..**My Drinking History**..14 - 16 - As a bit of background I started drinking young. My family are very into drinking like most people where I'm from. We would go round a certain member of the family's house now and again for people to drink and have a good time they had a big stash of various type of alcohol and would be very generous. My excuse to get very drunk I also remember at a young age thinking that it was weird people would turn drink down if they thought they'd had 'too much'. That was the first sign warning sign..16 - 18: So I got a little older and started going out with friends.  I became a master at working out the best possibly amount of alcohol/ %abv for the least amount of money. I was involved with coming up with elaborate ways of sneaking alcohol into certain events and became very skilled at it. Because we were young at the time these things seemed funny. My memories of this time are very good I had no worries about my drinking and could have a great time with little consequences the next day. However in hindsight the signs were already starting to show. I remember at this time thinking that drinking made me more likable and more attractive to girls looking back it was a depedence on alcohol. I remember once thinking around this time 'how good would it be if everyone was drunk all the time?'...18 - 20: In this time I had a kind of traumatic event which meant I experienced severe anxiety and as a result depression too. I didn't have the emotional maturity to deal with those feelings and I was basically drinking to numb that and forget it for a little while it was my only way to escape how I felt. I was up at the pub every weekend with my friends like every 18 year old. I would typically drink about 5 or 6 pints every weekend. I really struggled with my mental health during this period but now I really do believe that I would have recovered a lot more quickly had I not drank. During this period I would drink very nasty alcohol that wasn't nice but was cheap and would get me very drunk quickly. During this time I was that friend who called everyone up after closing time looking for somewhere to get even more fucked. Drinking was still fun during this time for me however I did not realise I was drinking to fight off mental health issues that were likely made worse by drinking. I was creating a cycle without realising...20 - 23 - I had a period of recovery in my early 20s. Felt absolutely amazing I had bounced back from my mental health problems (later than I could have) and was really on track I felt like. During the early period it was just 'low' level functioning alcoholic stuff staying up all night drinking but only with friends after nights out and so on. I can't remember when exactly but I experienced another lapse in my mental health. I was drinking at pretty much every opportunity to forget my problems this was worse than last time. About this time I stopped really getting a buzz from alcohol I could get intoxicated but I didn't really feel 'drunk'. Where drinking had made me feel so self confident it now made me self concious somehow. I had days where the night before I had got really drunk walking about listening to music at night the night before then come into college next day. If I was ever left on my own in the house I would get fucked alone and just end up sad then wake up the next day guilty. Typing this out now it's so obvious a problem was becoming more pressing but I didn't see it. Around this time I damaged my stomach from drinking and it has never been 100% since...Quitting - I read a lot of music books. The thing that inspired me was one of these a bookvcalled Cured by Lol Tolhurst from The Cure. He was in the band in the 80s and ended up getting fired due to alcoholism making him impossible to work with or be around socially. I didn't realise when I picked the book up that instead of being about the band it was about his decent into addiction and recovery (even if you're not especially into the band I would still reccomend it). I related to it so much it really scared me because I could see so much of myself reflected in his early years when he was around my age. It made me really think about my drinking which I previous had romantacised and thought was funny. Reading that book could very well have saved my life who knows. ..I tried a month and a half off the drink to see what would happen. Honestly the difference was night and day. I had assumed as you got older you just didn't get the same buzz from life for whatever reason I assumed over familiarity or something like that I wasn't sure. I was wrong. I assume it was because some time was given for my brain to rebalance I felt the best I'd felt in years. Little things made me really happy and I was a lot more accepting of things. I was also super motivated to get something life changing finished by working hard from 5am every day which I doubt I could have done while drinking. It's kind of hard to get across really. I did drink again as an experiment but it just confirmed to me that I'm making the right decision. ..A long post but I myself used to look at this board not 100% sure if I was an alcoholic. Then I kind of accepted I was a functioning alcoholic which ended up being a slippery slope. If you're a lurker like I was to start with this is how it can happen- and I am a mild case relatively speaking. If this helps at least one person then I'm happy.

This is exactly how it happens. You're not alone and thank you for taking the time to write this it is appreciated and valued. I think anyone can become an alcoholic if the conditions are right. Good for you to realize sooner rather than later because it usually only gets worse sometimes much much worse. Keep on going wishing all the best to you!
 I didn't realise when I picked the book up that instead of being about the band it was about his decent into addiction and recovery (even if you're not especially into the band I would still reccomend it). ..Ha. ..I was looking for a book on tape to do for a long drive. I found something called Dry by Augusten Burroughs. The synopsis was something like about a young guy in the advertising agency who loves to drink and has madcap adventures...and that was all I as a youngish guy in advertising who likes to drink needed to hear. It was hilarious for the first few chapters. Then it got real. Then too real. ..I arrived at my destination and sat in the car for another 20 minutes to hear the end. It touched me to the core and I cried. I could sit in my car because I knew the girl I'd traveled 8 hours to see was already drunk and passed out in her house. Anyhow I'll check it out. Thanks for the recco.
