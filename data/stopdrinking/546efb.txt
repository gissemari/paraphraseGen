I haven't done anything social since I stopped drinking. Last night I got super triggered thinking about the event I'm going to this afternoon and would have drunk if there was any alcohol around. This afternoon I am going to a friends place who the people there I always drink with. Honestly I am not sure if I will get through this sober. I have already tried to get out of going and unfortunately that is not an option. I feel a little bit scared. I like my healthy life & I don't want to be swinging back and forth struggling with sobriety my whole life. Thanks for reading.

I avoided people places and things that I associated with drinking for the first few months of sobriety...Some of these things included a family picnic (first one I had missed in 35 years) and my favorite cousins wedding...Even with 6 years sober I don't attend **any** functions where drinking is the main event and I leave early **any** event where people are drinking to excess...
Hey Don't go.  Nothing is worth your sobriety.  I had to spend my first week at home no work no friends no triggers.  If they are true friends they'd make no demands
I have made a commitment to myself that my sobriety must come first. Everything is missable to me if my sobriety is at risk no matter what the event. I lay low for the first few months of my sobriety. When I did start going out occasionally I went with a sober strategy and support and an escape plan.
If you can't get out of it can you bring your own drink?  Something yummy that feels like a treat?  Don't be afraid to make an appearance and then leave if you feel triggered. Hang in there. You can do this!!
Sorry that sucks.  I would not have gone to a function with drinking early in my recovery.  I avoided them like the plague.  I got into playing video games again..a lot.  Watching movies...a lot.  I started going to the gym a lot...  Being social is a big deal when people like us quit because sometimes our whole social circle is a group of big drinkers.  I used to have a lot of "friends" but when I quit drinking that changed and I had to learn to make my own new entertaining days.  You have to learn to deal with loneliness or it will just drive you to drink.  Hope you make it through.  If I just had to go and make an appearance I would just take coffee.  The words "not today" are easy to spout if asked why you aren't drinking at the party.  People 99.9% of the time will leave it at that and continue on their merry way.  Take care.
