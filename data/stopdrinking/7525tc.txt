Lizardd here alcoholic and chronic relapser. Jumping on to share some thoughts following my reset. Those of you who know me (mostly in IRC) know that relapse is not something uncommon for me. I make it a week maybe 9 days maybe 2 before I'm back on the bottle and then back in chat the next day fessing up and trying to piece together where I went wrong. There's no mystery here anymore. I'm not honest. I haven't let go completely. All the things I've learned in AA I don't apply to myself. I tell myself things will be different and they never ever are. Yesterday I gave myself *permission* one last "hurrah" before I finally take this seriously. A true mistake and a horrible idea I have no denial that that was in fact just another form of denial. A way to continue to feed my addiction. I know in recovery there is no 'tomorrow' there is only today. You can't start your journey 'tomorrow' because that day may never come and before you know it a years gone by and you are worse. I recognize this. However as foolish as it was to give myself 'one last time' the silver lining is that decision was wrapped in the true honest realization I NEED to stop. I NEED to finally once and for all be fully honest with myself and with others. The last few months I slowly undid the work I had done towards changing (not without many slips but at least I recognized them as such). I told myself I 'got this' and the ones I told I was quitting I told I that I'm not anymore and that I 'have this under control'. This ends here. I don't expect people to believe me hell I haven't earned that yet but I haven't this far been so honest with myself. There are no half-measures no excuses no alternatives. I can't drink. Not even just one. Today I will have that conversation with those close to me I'll be going to AA (my favourite meeting) making it my home group and begin looking for a sponsor. If need be I've looked in to rehab. Anyways I just had to get this out there.. thanks as always for listening SD. I may not have been successful (yet) but I'd be in a hell of a lot worse shape without you. I won't drink with you today.

Try a ketogenic diet.  After 3 weeks on keto I lost my alcohol craving.  It doesn't work for everyone but it worked for me.  I've been keto since May 1st and sober since before June 1st.  I don't remember the day I had my last drink because I never intended to stop drinking.  I just gradually noticed that I didn't want it anymore...It might help.  I think it has something to do with how the liver processes alcohol and glucose but I'm no expert.
