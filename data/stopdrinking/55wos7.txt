I've been following /r/stopdrinking for a while. ..Three days ago I decided to stop drinking and requested a badge from /r/stopdrinking. ..Whenever I encounter stressors in my life I want to have a drink. Lately I had been using alcohol heavily as a way to cope because the past month and a half had been a rollercoaster. I moved to a large city on short notice by myself. I left behind my family friends and long-term partner just so I could pursue my dream of studying and living outside of my hometown. ..I've been under an extreme amount of stress and have been struggling. I don't know very many people where I currently live. Even though I'm in school I'm struggling with meeting people. I have never felt so alone in my life. ..This past Friday I went to a party and drank an entire bottle of wine all by myself within a really short time frame. I got so drunk to a point where I blacked out. I can't remember anything between after arriving at the pub and then standing in the lobby of the condominium I live in and realizing that I had lost my jacket and keys. I apparently had disappeared for a bit and no one could find me - this is especially disconcerting to me because I have no idea where I went and can't recall anything... Furthermore I ended up destroying a relationship and made a fool of myself to people I was becoming acquainted with. ..I need to stop drinking. I don't want to black out ever again. I don't want to destroy any more relationships because of poor decisions. I'm tired of feeling bad and need to find better ways to cope with the difficulties in my life. I want to feel and get better ASAP. There were times during these past three days when I wanted to drink but managed to not cave. I hope that /r/stopdrinking will help me stay sober and that I will get better.
