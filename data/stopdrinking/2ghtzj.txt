I do not have the time or money to take off work for what would be like my double digit now hospital visit for alcohol detox I know it sounds stupid I use to think it when I'd see people ask it but it's also stupid I relapsed after the WORST WITHDRAWAL EVER knowing it would lead to this I just want to know is it possible? Have any of you do it? I drink about a fifth of vodka a day could it be possible for me to "taper" with 42 proof 21% Vodka? and just stop without the d.t.s tremors and massive anxiety I'm prescribed Klonopin for anxiety does this help withdrawal symptoms? Please don't reply if you have something negative on the subject I only took the time to post for HELP.... (Alcoholic (liquor only) for 8 years) 24 years of age. - God bless

If you need to taper you probably need to see a doctor there are clinics that may be able to help - check your local health department...In my opinion tapering is uncontrolled and only prolongs things if in fact you don't convince yourself to keep drinking just because...Once you quit you will need to do things to keep from taking up drinking again  IOP AA Smart and other resources should be tried and tried again.
Detoxing in many cases can be done with medication at home. See your doctor for an office visit and get an evaluation. ..Tapering is risky and difficult. It needs to be done methodically over time. I hope you don't interpret this as negative; it is just the truth. If you don't get this under control it s going to seriously affect your job anyway so take time for a doctor appointment. ..Yes Klonopin can help with alcohol withdrawal. It's important to be honest with your doctor about how much you are drinking so the dosage can be adjusted accordingly. Do NOT stop cold turkey. 
42 proof? you're not in Ohio are you?..&gt;I do not have the time or money to take off work..do you have the time/money/health to keep drinking?.....Listen I'm not giving you advice or telling you what to do... but the vast majority of people here have tried tapering and failed....G-d bless you and best of luck man. ...ps..&gt;Please don't reply if you have something negative on the subject I only took the time to post for HELP..I can't take your inventory but when I've heard this before it's always been  code for "I'm only looking for people to cosign my bullshit" it's a huge red flag.
Read over your own post history.  See any patterns?

Talk with your physician about how you can detox without going to an inpatient facility.
Hello /u/JaWillis1718 I've looked through your post history as others have and see a pattern of relapse(s) that seems to indicate that tapering might not be the most successful strategy for you to use.  It looks as though you know what the [DTs] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_tremens) are and with your repeated binges and withdrawals you are a perfect candidate for [Kindling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_\(sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal\))...&gt;I do not have the time or money to take off work for what would be like my double digit now hospital visit for alcohol detox..At this point in your drinking career I would highly suggest you seek some sort of medical help (again) for detoxing and also get some help for those underlying issues that keep dragging you back to drinking...My question for you is:  DO YOU WANT TO STOP DRINKING?
