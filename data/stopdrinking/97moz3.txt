That I can remember anyway. I think it's important to have secondary goals set out while I walk this path of sobriety...Up to now the goal has been simply to not drink which has been really at times but I'm still here!..Now I want to push on...Cut down my sugar / chocolate.Begin exercising (gym x2 per week).Less Soda (been hammering the Coke Zero too)..Losing weight was a good incentive for me to get sober. (not the other way round I didn't want to get sober to lose weight) so I will try to push myself to this goal. ..If I find myself struggling it's back to just not drinking as my only goal...Makes me realise that we have to be so vigilant about what we do all the time to avoid relapse. .

I relate so hard to the sugar thing. The first time i had a stretch of sobriety i instantly pounded la croix and sweets. Stuff like doughnuts and pie. It really did help curb the desire to drink but it also helped me cut myself some much needed slack. ..Anyway i wish you well on your journey and good job! Keep going! 
Mini Reese's PB Cups!! I reward myself with a couple each night. I also don't restrict myself during the day like if something is offered or I just get a strong craving.  Not drinking has been the only goal so far but like you I feel like I'm ready to start dialing back the sweets...Be strong and keep up the great work!
Yes I agreechocolate has helped me enormously (also cakes buiscuits and assorted other Sugar and Carbs!) I'm going to continue to eat these until I have made 30 daysand then curb them.Well done on your 38 days dosent sobriety feel great??    IWNDWYT but may have a cake or two if you wish to join me!
