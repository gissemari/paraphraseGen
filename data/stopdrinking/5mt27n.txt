I've got a day coming up soon where I'll be surrounded by drinkers and it's unavoidable. 100%. The thing is it's not the alcohol that bothers me I don't have any desire to drink through this event. ..I do however suffer from social anxiety around this group of people (for no reason whatsoever) and my old go-to was to buy a gram of coke and use this to self-medicate. I've told myself I wouldn't go there again and have been fine for a few months now but I can feel myself slipping into old thought patterns...I don't have the money at all to buy any I probably won't be able to get any I don't ACTUALLY WANT THE DAMN STUFF but I've still caught these little half-thoughts in the back of my head wondering if I should get some. It feels a lot like the half-thoughts I'd get when I was steadily heading back to booze-town! ..I guess I'm posting this here to make myself acknowledge what's happening and be more mindful of these thoughts writing it down has helped. Thank god I'm not drinking so I don't have to worry about drunkenly making any stupid mistakes :)

Hey man it sounds like your head is in the right place...I started drinking heavily to cope with social anxiety too. Now that I'm not drinking I have a tendency to gravitate towards the bowl of Doritos at a party and nervously eat those when I don't know what to do...You say you have no reason for anxiety around that group of people?.If that's true is there any way to focus on enjoying their company without coke &amp; booze?
I think the world of you!..Enjoy yourself tonight!
