Last night I got brown drunk. I do not want this anymore. I have tried to stop before but I relapsed after several months and the cycle began again. I am so tired of it. So tired of hurting those who love me through my behavior. I attended my first AA meeting today in a very long time. I am 29 and I do not want to drink anymore. I spoke to my dad who had beaten his alcoholism 20 years ago and asked him for his help. I am done. This time I will actually try. I do not want to drink anymore.
