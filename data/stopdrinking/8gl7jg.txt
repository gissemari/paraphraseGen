yesterday was tough. so many problems kept popping up in my way and each problem i just kept trying my hardest to solve. struggling walking through windy rain with no umbrella because the weatherman is a sadist i persevered with my commute to work tackled discrepancies as they arose dealt with the usual assholes in management who love playing "i'm bored who's day can i fuck up?" and 50 other things I shouldn't have dealt with. after finishing my day a moment of calmness overcomes me and i log in to check on my days. 400. good shit. then i realized throughout the entire fucked up day i had experienced not once was there a moment where i thought "fuck this shit i'm going home and drinking". life is good now that i live it. thumbs up SD.
