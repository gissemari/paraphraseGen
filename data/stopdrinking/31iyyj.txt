I'm watching Bounce for the umpteenth time. I know it's a mediocre movie but I saw it the day before I hit bottom. Seeing Ben Affleck struggle with early sobriety just added to the overall sense of inevitability that my life was falling completely apart and I was going to have to get sober too. I'm not sure but I think maybe that was when my constant sense of impending doom turned into a glimmer of hope.

I've never seen that movie but I can identify with being able to see myself clearly through the experience of others.  Hearing people's stories here and in meetings really has helped open my eyes and reminds me what it was like and what it could have been like had I not stopped.
Have you seen When A Man Loves A Woman? I think it has some really powerful scenes mostly after rehab when Alice has to learn to stay sober. ..I have to check out Bounce again I forgot that Ben played an alcoholic.
