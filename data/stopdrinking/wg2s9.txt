Battling personal problems in the past I would just go out and drink now I just find different methods that help out a little. Like last night my brother beat me at chess... That's a big fucking no no. So I've decided that every time I desire a drink I'm gonna go get drunk off chess playing knowledge. Guys it's hard as hell but for those of you struggling we gotta keep strong and finally destroy our desire for that poison.

Oh man if my brother beat me at chess... relapse city. ..I kid haha. ;P Picking up a new hobby is an excellent way to manage sobriety and chess is a fascinating game. I'm glad you're finding something challenging and rewarding to supplement your time. Great job. =).
Thanks
