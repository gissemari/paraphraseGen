I've managed 22 days without drink. I'm very happy with this and to anyone struggling I have to say it definitely gets easier. Just keep at it you can do it.

Congratulations! And it definitely does get easier!
Congratulations! I've noticed lately it's much easier than those first 2 weeks! 
I'm at 22 days as well :) you're right each day it gets easier. 
Yes my confidence in the simplicity of stopping drinking grows daily.  I won't drink with you today.
