Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Had my first sober Christmas this year!  It was filled with ups and a few downs but that's life.  I'm very grateful to be sober today...Struggle: Someone in my family broke my trust and shared that I'm in recovery and going to meetings.  I got a lecture Xmas eve about one family member's opinion of AA that I don't agree with.  I'm struggling with whether to bring up with this family member that they broke my trust...General chat: I got quite a few books this Xmas looks like I won't be bored for the next few months :D..Have another great 24 hours folks!

**Reply to NMBP**: sorry about your struggle.  That sucks when you learn you can't trust someone.  And why anyone would try to make your recovery **more** difficult for you is beyond me.  To me I would only bring it up if you think that they unknowingly broke your trust.  If you think they did it on purpose (whether to cause harm or not) it probably won't change their behavior... then again: what do I know?..**Triumph**: Like you this was my first sober Christmas in many years.  It wasn't that hard for me though.  I didn't have the urge to drink and nobody asked me if I wanted anything.  My wife has been extremely supportive.  As has my family...**Struggle**: The only hard part for me (only a little hard) was how the few people in my family that did drink handled it... awkwardly.  But I guess that's to be expected...**General Chat**: I got a tablet for Christmas and will be loading it up with Kindle books to read.  I'm partway through *Blind Man's Bluff* at the moment..
Triumph: my first sober xmas too!  I had a great time at a sober party on xmas eve...Struggle: I messed up my Achilles tendon somehow at the party.  It hurts like a mofo and I can only kind of shamble around.  At least I can't blame it on being drunk this time!  Just getting old I guess.  I'm home from work hoping it mends soon and knowing that picking up a drink isn't going to help one iota...
Triumph: Found it very easy to say no thank you to any drinks that have been offered...Struggle: I have a cold and I used to use that as an excuse to drink and have something else to blame on how I feel. Won't be able to do that anymore. All good though probably won't last as long now that I'm healthier and not loaded down with liquor. ..General: I was 181lb when I stopped 187.5 now but I think a huge amount is water and actually having my bowels hold on to food longer. Going to the washroom #2 easily only once a day rather than 5+ struggling to feel normal.
T: 18th sober X-Mas.  It was exhausting with all the travel and various celebrations but awesome!  My wife and kids and all the various other family members enjoyed it lots.  Got more coming up this weekend with a flight halfway across the company for days of more fun!..S: I did notice myself being a bit of an ass verbally X-Mas eve but that happens when I'm tired and was forcing conversation with family members I hadn't seen in a year.  Nobody else noticed but I'm hardest on myself.  I expect something closer to perfection rather then progress out of myself at this point...Gc: I don't enjoy having to work the day after X-Mas.  Been many years since I've had to and I'm just plain tired lol!..OP should definitely have a chat with the ol' trust breaker if what they were told was supposed to be kept confidential.
Triumph: Celebrated my 27th sober Christmas..Struggle: Can't think of any..General Chat: Lovin life sober never look back except to remember where I've been so I don't go back there.
Triumph: My first Sober Season in about 30 to 35 years.  ..Struggle: I want a fucking drink! I mean I REALLY want a fucking drink. Last night I was the last one awake and the whisper was "Go ahead nobody will ever know." Well I didn't and I won't and nothing is going to take my sobriety from me. But yeah it's a struggle.  ..Chat: Things are going just great in most aspects of my life and I'm looking forward to 2013 being even better.

T: also sober through the holidays first ever as a grown up any how :/ mum came to  my home group Saturday. Best and calmest holiday in a long long long time...S: getting to enough meetings but resentment cranks high when I get to more than four a week(?) and the loup that I'm gonna bust in two years came back today lord the crap my brain can feed me ~~can be~~ is *loud* on the bad days... Nearly enough to have a cigarette and I've been free of those suckers for 46 days..GC: so so so nice to have some days off.... Dexter marathon and gardening with the pot plants (strawberries and tomatoes) and catching up on chores and folks...*edit random capitalisation
