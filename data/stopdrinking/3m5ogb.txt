Feeling weak but acting strong...Sitting at McCarran airport waiting for my ride. Airports are a pretty strong trigger for me I used to show up for flights super early so that I could get shitfaced at the airport bars before them...I feel like I've been stagnating for the last month or so like I haven't been able to make forward progress because I've been preoccupied with intense cravings. Not only have I been craving alcohol in the moment but I've felt a sort of slow-burning nostalgia for booze and the way it used to make me feel. ..Ugh sorry to dump my shit on you all like this it's just been a struggle lately.

The nostalgic thoughts are lies. These cravings will pass...Recognizing that you've been stagnating lately is important. It lets you know that something needs changing or shaking up a bit. Got ideas? Some actions you could take soon?..Hang in there. I believe in you!
For me trying to fix my sick mind with my broken brain is doomed to failure. I rely on outside help to correct my thinking in order to deal with cravings and amnesia about the past carnage caused by my disease.
The trouble is that all this stuff seems enticing - airport people bars excitement.  But you know the flipside.  I still find it hard to watch TV where there's alcohol and a fireplace - but you don't see them 3 bottles later looking haggard and fighting!
Yeah I feel weak a lot too.  But it sounds like you are making forward progress because dealing with intensive cravings and not giving into them is really challenging.  Just dealing with them and staying sober seems like progress to me.
