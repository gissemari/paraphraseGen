For a long time my two vices were porn and alcohol.  And like you I could not figure out why I kept relapsing and going back to them both.  ..Therapy man.  A good therapist will unwind your backstory and help you out.  It saved me.
Therapy and AA helped me. A lot of times when this alcoholic gets the urge to drink I find talking to another recovering alcoholic helps the urge pass.
It's a dependency dude. It's not logical. It's subconscious. You have to identify your triggers and figure out how to get past them.
I used to hear in AA the saying "We drink because that's what alcoholics do" The thing is to keep coming back and to keep trying even if you drink. That is what I did I hated it when I drank but I kept believing that it would work when I was ready. It will happen don't give up. I thought I would never have long term but here I am today still sober. I know it sucks to keep drinking and not know why I've been there believe me. Anyways I just wanted to offer you some hope and support peace and good vibes..
