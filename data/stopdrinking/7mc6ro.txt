Battling a craving tonight. I want to make a post about a few things I've noticed so far and that I remember enjoying in my last brief period of sobriety so I can read back on them in my post history when I feel tempted to drink. I realize there have probably been a lot of posts like this but feel free to add your own simple things you enjoy about being sober...First and foremost my dog is noticeably happier and more playful when I'm sober. I spoil her regardless she's my baby but I'm sure she can sense that when I drink alcohol I'm not nearly as present and don't give her as much attention because my main focus is consuming enough booze in a short enough time span to get drunk. I'm sure dogs don't appreciate the smell of alcohol either. She also seems more cuddly when I haven't been drinking so that might have something to do with it as well...Cooking. I love to cook. Lately my drinking has progressed to sipping on glasses of wine or beers to downing strong shots of liquor as I said before in order to get a quick powerful buzz. I wasn't cooking at home nearly as much aside from frozen pizzas and crap and when I did cook real food I basically just threw everything together not really caring about how it tasted just that it would be something to have on my stomach before I crashed for the night. I live alone so I don't really have to worry about pleasing anyone else's tastebuds. Also--When I'm drunk I never feel like doing the dishes or cleaning up after my sloppy self. Waking up with a hangover and a messy kitchen that I never have time to clean before I have to leave for work is for the birds...Cleaning. Being sober makes me such a tidier person. When I'm drinking I could care less if I have dirty laundry piles everywhere or cups on my nightstand. Sober me hates excess clutter and is in the moment enough to pick up after myself as I go throughout my evening plus I keep my car a lot cleaner. I used to think I was just a messy person but then again I've been drinking heavily most of my adult life so maybe that's the main reason for my slobbish habits...A few others: I can actually pay attention to and remember what I watch on TV. Working out is a million times easier. My mood is much better without a hangover and my mindfog is slowly but surely lifting. I can indulge in yummy foods every now and then thanks to more workouts and skipping the empty alcohol calories. I actually enjoy coffee instead of just chugging it to try to stave off fatigue from a hangover. My anxiety is already getting better. I don't feel guilty for spending money on poisoning myself. I don't worry about embarrassing myself by getting drunk and texting potential dating partners or friends way too personal/generally cringey shit. ..These are things that are happening in the past 4 days. The last time I was sober for more than this long was over a year and a half ago. I think I got 30 days and I remember feeling great. I started drinking again after a bad breakup and never quite managed to stop. But since then I've always had the nagging thought in the back of my mind that I HAVE to stop drinking it's just a matter of when. I don't want to hit rock bottom. I'm lucky nothing more serious has happened than feeling crappy physically and mentally and some minor embarrassing behaviors. No DUIs lost jobs missed days of work significant damage to relationships or friendships etc. The only serious consequence I've had is getting a D in a course last semester because I couldn't focus on my schoolwork getting hammered every night. I'm super lucky to have gotten good grades in my other classes but it was definitely a struggle. I can't imagine how well I'll do if i can make sobriety stick next semester. ..Nobody knows how much I was drinking before. I had gotten to the point where a half pint of 100 proof liquor was an easy night for me. I would still be craving more after I even finished that. On a heavier night it was a bottle of wine and a half pint. Sometimes more. But I always drank alone. If I was with someone else I would keep it in check or take shots in secret and they would just think I was buzzed off of a few beers or whatever. Ugh. Just typing that out makes me feel ashamed. I never want to go back to that...Sorry/not sorry for the rant it helps to get it all out of my head. Like I said after typing out all of that there's still part of me that WANTS to drink. A little voice in my head that says "a half pint won't hurt you can just start again tomorrow." It's a little quieter than it was when I started typing this but it's still there and it's scary to think that it may not ever completely go away. Fuck this addiction and fuck alcohol. I'm going to finish cleaning up my kitchen from the DELICIOUS homecooked dinner I spoiled myself with get ready to hit the gym for a good workout and hopefully wear myself out enough to fall asleep at a decent time. Evenings are hard but I find that I enjoy mornings without a hangover. and those can't happen if I give in..I. Will. Not. Drink. Today.

Hang in there you're doing great!..I call that little voice the Booze Goblin.... when I stopped giving him what he wanted he had a few tantrums but eventually quietened right down and these days I barely hear from him at all.....My brain serves me up all sorts of 'thoughts' on a daily basis but there is nothing compelling me to *act* on them.... I can observe thoughts without engaging with them until they just float away... that's a little tip I learned from mindfulness meditation which has been very helpful!..I won't drink with you today keep up the good work!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
