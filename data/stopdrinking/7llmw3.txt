Nearly ninety days feels pretty good right now. I'm heading to a Christmas party and I'm kind of excited to have the energy to dress up to remember everything I do and say and to wash my face before bed. Looking forward to being able to run tomorrow morning with a clear head and strong body. And if I start to struggle I'll check in here. Happy weekend!!

Have a good time      Merry Xmas 
I like to bring my own supply of sparkling water to parties so I never go thirsty...Nice work on 83!
You will probably notice some things at the party while being sober that you might have otherwise missed...Have fun!
