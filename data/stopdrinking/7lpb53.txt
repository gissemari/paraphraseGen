I flipped my car a few days ago with a bac of .267. I've been struggling off and on for years. Since the accident though everything about my psyche has changed. ..The last couple of days since the accident have been very surreal but very clear at the same time. It's hard to explain but it's kind of comforting. I'm not just talking about being sober either I've been sober for periods of time this time it's different. The world feels different people seem warmer (maybe just because they're glad I'm not dead. But even strangers have been making a point of saying kind things or God bless...I've played with the idea of quantum immortality. Maybe I did die in that crash and my soul just jumped to a parallel world where I did not. Makes me wonder how many times I might have killed myself because of drinking and doing dumb shit and "jumped." ..Maybe I'm just more receptive now to the good of the world after having stared death in the face. Crawling out of an upside down car with only minor bruising makes you think. I truly want to believe that it's because some higher power decided that I still had something to offer the world.

Your theory is tempting but maybe you are just having a delayed shock reaction? I don't know. I've been noticing strange patterns recently but think it is just tricks of the mind.
