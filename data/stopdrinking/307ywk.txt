Backstory: My heavily addicted partner wants to quit drinking. He's tried to cut down before unsuccessfully. He is a recovered meth and cocaine addict currently smokes cigarettes and a lot of pot...I've never struggled with addiction at all and can't relate any. I'm totally clueless! Met him after he became clean from drugs. Any advice for ways I can support him?

I think /r/AlAnon would be better suited to help you with that. Good luck!
