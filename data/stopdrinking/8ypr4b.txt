I recently returned from my annual guys golf trip to Myrtle Beach. I went with 5 married men who are normal drinkers.  I just celebrated 2 years of sobriety in June. Even with my clean time it is still difficult at times. While my friends were enjoying beers on the course or wine with dinner I stuck with my tonic and lime. They are very respectful of my sobriety but it is still tough at times to realize I can't be a  normal drinker .  However I know that drinking caused a lot of damage in my life and sobriety is the only way I am capable of moving forward. Even though I am now sober...thoughts creep into my head. But I find things to keep me busy and my mind clear.  Even when I'm struggling for a for holes on the golf course!  Stay sober my friends!!

Nice work staying sober! That's an inspiration for me and a testament to your strength. Thanks for sharing
Good job staying strong! It's not easy! 
Great job! I feel you! Watching other people drink  normal  will always baffle me. Wish I could but after several relapses I know it's not an option. 
Bet your golf game has improved too!
Not your fault at all you are doing great IMO. IWNDWYT
