Well here goes...I've been progressively drinking more over the last six months and it's become a problem. I'm thirty-six this year married and father to three amazing children. I've always been a casual social drinker but lately I've been struggling with depression and anxiety and booze has become my crutch. My wife (thirty-two) was always the heavier drinker out us and it was always left to me to be the responsible one. It actually lead to us splitting up for a year under very ugly conditions. Since getting back together I've become the one that doesn't control his drinking and she has been gradually slowing down. It's like the roles have reversed with her putting up with my shitty behavior. I've started smoking again after quitting for six years and I know it's beginning to affect my health. I don't want to do this anymore. Time to get it together. Any thoughts or support is hugely appreciated.

Welcome!  Sorry you're going through that but I found a ton of support here.  I think it's awesome that you're trying to improve yourself; though I didn't do it just for my own family I'd like to think it makes my time with them a lot better (and a lot longer since I'm a lot healthier).  I won't drink with you today!
I wonder if you deal with the underlying problem (anxiety &amp; depression) maybe the urge to drink will subside... i've done the same thing in the past few months and found that getting on a proper dose of meds is making me more motivated to take care of myself. If you are self-medicating you need to look for some answers elsewhere...
