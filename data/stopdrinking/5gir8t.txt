Hey guys. Just need to vent. ..I'm not a super-heavy (or even heavy) drinker. Just consistent enough to feel like I have to have it many times...Yesterday I drank the remnants of a full bottle of wine from Friday night. I drank it as soon as I woke up and it seemed to provide little to nothing in regards to enjoyment. I fought the urge all day to go back out and start again. ..All today too I've felt like that urge is still there despite the fact that my body feels better. I have a bit more energy and not as sluggish. I have been down in the dumps a bit and binge watching Netflix just to try to keep my mind off of it. ..Next weekend I will starting a long move and I'll be on the road for 9 days (starting a new job). I told myself I would stop before I leave but want to summon the willpower to do it even before that. ..Fighting the cravings though just makes me want to breakdown and cry though. Knowing that it's not just today I have to power through but many in the future as well...To anyone else struggling with cravings I just want to say I know the feeling and can sympathize to some extent. I don't have that many people in my personal life so nobody really knows about this except myself (and reddit). ..I keep telling myself not to open the doors to begin rationalizing why I should drink. If I do then I always give in. I doubt the cravings will ever go away either. I just don't want to be this person who constantly gives in and can't say no.       ..Stay strong everybody.
