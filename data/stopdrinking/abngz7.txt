This morning I went to an AA meeting. I've been in and out of those rooms for 5 years but when I first tried to get sober in 2013 I got 9 months by going to meetings every day. I did the steps as well as I could got a sponsor tried to pray to a higher power. Eventually because my job took me to remote parts of northern Canada for long stretches I fell away from the meetings and no amount of praying could keep me from picking up a drink...I drank every single day to the point of being black out with occasional "weekends" where I would make a half hearted attempt at getting sober. In mid December something finally clicked for me I had a particularly bad fight with my SO and I was feeling suicidal (or maybe just too worthless to live is a better way to describe it) and I knew I had to do something. I finally felt ready to leave alcohol behind...Anyway I started going back to meetings downloaded some apps that I feel are a good reminder of what I can gain and how far I've come and I started following this and some other sub reddits about recovery...Today at that meeting I mentioned while sharing that some online communities and apps were helping me and some woman shared after me that "everyone who uses these things just ends up drinking again and that without God and Jesus and the Gospel alcoholics all relapse". I was enraged that she would try and discourage my methods but I bit my tongue finished with the meeting and came home and read some more of your stories...I just want to say that each one of us has our own sobriety to protect and nurture and grow and however you stay sober is your own business and I'm proud of you for doing it and I'm proud of myself for what I've got as well. You help me stay sober by sharing your experience and what works for you and I hope that as I get some more sobriety under my belt I can help you stay sober too...C
