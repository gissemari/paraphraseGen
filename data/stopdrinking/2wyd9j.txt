I'm fresh out of inpatient treatment and I've only been home for a few weeks. The struggle began right away when my dog died the day I came home that shit was hard. Old me would've gone straight to the liquor store to get numb but I didn't even think about it. Going to meetings and keeping up with my outpatient has been keeping me strong and motivated to stay sober. The comradery is a feeling that I didn't feel when I was drinking myself into oblivion...Just wanted to share that peace.
