[Guess what day it is...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwrstxuicZk)...Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below! ..**Triumph:** Making progress on the backyard! Shrubs have been cleared and need to pick up a bunch more stuff now to finish up before the end of summer hah! I'm enjoying the work and it's nice to be outside on my days off. ..**Struggle:** Not really a struggle this week but I had picked out a sweet new lawn chair monday and when I went to pick it up found that I have to put it all together. So I get to do that next weekend. ..**General:** Summer movie season coming up! I'm excited to see the new X men what's everyone looking forward to?
----------immediate responses--------

I'm starting day 6 of sobriety. I also will be attending my first AA meeting later today....
**Triumph:** Today is 3 years. My life has changed so much for the better it's incredible!..**Struggle:** I'm getting sick :(..**General Chat:** I'm not a huge movie person so I have no idea what's coming out.
Triumph: getting back on the sobriety bandwagon after a huge slip up. ..Struggle: getting motivated to clean my house and get groceries today/tonight. ..General chat: i haven't kept up with anything new coming out actually! That's what happens when I am on a bender I ignore the world. Blah. Gonna have to look into it love going to the movies! 
Triumph: Today is day 22! Almost at the one month mark! I can't believe it. Saw my primary physician today and he was impressed and said we'll give it about 30 days to see how your body is affected. Hopefully those labs will come back better than before. ..Struggle: As the days continue to pass I find myself finding things to do clean up the yard get the pool ready for summer etc. I have however picked up smoking cigarettes again. This is something I really don't want to do as I feel I'm trading one addiction for another. I was actually outside earlier (work at a hotel) and a guest coming in for the night stopped and asked me if he could ask me a question. I said sure and he proceeded to show me a scar from ear to ear. He's 43 and had been smoking since 15 (same as me and i'm 32). He developed Squamous cell carcinoma. He had a scar from ear to ear. I know it's early and smoking seems to ease the boredom sometimes but it's a struggle. Maybe he was put there to tell me his story who knows. ..General: Work work and more work. School is about to start so preparing for that and making a few YouTube videos here and there. (Gaming) Cheers to another sober day folks! Have a great hump day SD! 
I'm looking forward to going back to the beach! I've lost 30lbs since I first stopped drinking back in January (had to reset my badge twice since my 90 day point). It will be nice to enjoy a hangover free summer!!! I will not drink with all of you today!
Well today is (or tomorrow will be honestly don't know which it is) the longest I've gone without a drink since I was 18 or something.  So that makes me feel somewhat triumphant!..But the struggle is exactly that.  I feel quite weird but don't want to believe that's an effect of stopping drinking.  Hard to explain like pressure / mild head aches behind the eyes twitchy left eye lid going a bit nuts I'm quite shakey and can't concentrate well on my studies (in yesterday's class I really couldn't get my head around a simple grammar rule and it took me donkey's years but I just couldn't get it...).  Also fluxuate a bit between restlessness and fatigue.  Never had these things before but in reality it could just be me coming down with a cold or something...?..But in general yeah - I feel quite positive.  I get a lot from reading this subreddit.  And I feel quite positive.
**Triump:** Practiced a lot for the exam I had last Monday and did my best. Going to celebrate with pizza and friends later today. Hoping to get the results later today!..**Struggle:** Only 1 week left of this semester. The future is scary...**General nonsense:** Saw the Last Airbender last night and it was SO BAD! Haha no surprise there...EDIT: Got a B! SO HAPPY! :D
I got put on naltrexone and it's like night and day. I really feel like I can stop drinking now. I'm bipolar and drinking made me REALLY REALLY happy. I drank yesterday and just felt tired. I didn't feel like I was exploding with joy. I actually didn't even finish my 40oz and don't want to. It was getting in the way of watching the hotel hell season premiere lol
Triumph I'm practicing better self-care...Struggle financial difficulties and anxiety...General just happy to be here around all of you supportive folks!
What's up?  Won't drink today. That's whats up 
**Triumph** Yesterday my boss called me out in front of other people to let me know she's impressed by the way I interact with customers. She said I put them at ease by being organic. It was nice to hear and I (think I) graciously accepted the compliment. It's not always easy for me to accept compliments...**Struggle** I've been debating whether I should attend a meeting because despite feeling like a million bucks rn I know there will probably be a time when casually drinking will seem like something I could possibly try even though deep down I am convinced moderation will never be an option for myself. BUT any religious stuff would send me right out the door I'm also trying to kick coffee and I'd rather not attend anything too local. I also checked out SMART but the closest meeting is somewhat of a schlep...**General** Still obsessed with the new Radiohead album. Can't wait to watch The Americans tonight. My husband got home late last night from a business trip and I'm looking forward to spending a relaxing holiday weekend with him and the kids.
Triumph: 6 weeks and 3 days sober. Reconnected with 2 of my best friends today by phone and said they were proud of me for my sobriety. Almost finished writing my Itinerary for myself and my fianc s trip to Japan next Wednesday.  ..Challenge: wasn't feeling a 100% today and had a sleep during the day woke up late and was unable to make it to my SMART meeting...General: Started watching a TV series called "Mr Robot" and am really enjoying it.
I will not drink today!
Triumph: Jumped out of an airplane last weekend! Need to figure out what my next adventure is going to be...Struggle: I may not get to go with my husband to visit his family up in Canada and won't know until the day we leave. The plane ticket has already been bought. :/ The stress has been incredible and I have been having to manage the chronically suicidal thoughts I get with extreme stress on top of work. And stress. Ugh. Stress...General: Not big into summer movies but I am looking forward to a few games plus the Witcher 3 expansion.
**Triumph:** Only a few days into my new job and I'm starting to feel more competent...like I could really do this and not just be in the way...**Struggle:** No big struggles this week - just time management and fitting everything in along with the new job!..**General:** I'm not a big blockbuster movie person I am looking forward to *Suicide Squad* and the new Star Trek movie. Lately I've been digging all the great dramas out on DVD now *Spotlight* *Trumbo* and *The Big Short* were all fantastic!  
Triumph: today is day 3 and I am not hungover at work today!.Struggle: I have a presentation to give at work this morning and I have a major public speaking fear. .General: The only move I know that is coming out this summer is X men my boyfriend won't stop talking about it. We plan to go see it the day it comes out. 
Triumph: Hit my two week mark especially exciting since it included two weekends!..Struggle: My stepdaughter's graduation is tomorrow which means I'll have to deal with my husband's ex-wife. Long story there which I'll probably post about...General: I've binge watched the first season of Dexter and started the second since I've been holed up in the house. Fun to have a new show to distract me from drinking!
I'm going to a concert on Friday for a new band that I really love [Shakey Graves](http://www.shakeygraves.com/). They are playing in Jackson Hole Wyoming which is one of the prettiest places in the world. Can't wait!
9 days sober.  Feeling good.   I haven't had any real struggles since day 3 or 4.  Last night I walked through the liquor aisle on the way to the freezer section of my grocery store and didn't even think about getting a bottle. I know every day won't be as easy as I'm having it right now  but it's nice to have that confirmation that I can do this. 
Triumph: 41 days with no alcohol...Struggle: Controlling my insatiable sweet tooth!!!..General Chat: I am hosting a Memorial weekend BBQ at my house. Will be my first really big test. I always associate drinking with holidays but all my kids know my issue and very supportive of me so I think it will be fine but there is always the fear of failure that likes to surface in my head every now and again.. One day at a time though. That is my mantra!
Triumph: 185 days making headway in my endless discussion of "Free Will Morality and Ethicism in a Global Oligarchy" Just got back from The Overnight Walk to support the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention..Struggle: Same shamefest but it feels less lonely.  Partly from support here but a big part because of a friend who actually sympathized with what I am going through...General: Garden is up Won at chess (but it was sort of a mulligan) found a restaurant that has a flowcharted menu and that is just plain brilliant.
**Triumph**: Made it through the weekend with friends that are historically pushers - I feared I wouldn't be able to dance without drinking but I big fat did it anyway and my friends weren't as pushy as I expected because I was out on the dance floor with them...**Struggle**: My husband and dad are not getting along and my parents will be visiting soon.  And I hate confrontation...**General**: I still haven't even seen deadpool yet that's how far behind I am!
*Triumph*: I managed to sign up my child and I for new health insurance and it went more smoothly and cost less than I thought it would...*Struggle:* Tomorrow my ex-ish spouse and I head into our second divorce mediation session hopefully to finalize our agreement. Also our kid is having significant behavior issues in school. And my ex-ish spouse's job is ending Friday. And work is ridiculous. And the dog has kennel cough. Seriously...*General:* Tremendous amounts of challenge major life decisions but I am making progress. No way out but through. All of these things would've been used as a justification to drink just a few short months ago but none of these things would be manageable if I was currently drinking. .
**Triumph:**  son graduates preschool today and I'll be there for him. And I took rest of day off work. Last time I had a personal day was a year ago and I squandered it in a bottle. Not today! Possibilities endless.     ..**Struggle:** i don't know what all I want to do today! Movie? Installing baseboard? Exercise early? Plant some flowers on front walkway?     ..**General:** SOBER TUBING! With all our rain the rivers are high and i want a saturday in a tube on a river la Croix in hand
Triumph: getting to go back to hawaii..Struggle: sleep but no other complaints..General: suicide squad! for movie
Triumph - I beat my cravings last night on day 2.Struggle - lots of laundry already with these night sweats .General - Loving the warm weather and excited to go biking and all that good stuff! 
**Triumph:** I declined a happy hour with my old coworkers at our usual bar. the invitation brought back a lot of unpleasant memories of my drinking days. while I miss the individual people I don't miss the group dynamic or that environment and I didn't feel guilty about saying no thanks. instead I played cornhole and sipped lavender soda with some new coworkers who are very supportive of my sobriety. ..**Struggle:** how to create space for myself when everyone demands a piece of me? ..**General:** I have no idea what movies are out! but my husband just bought a smoker so we'll be spending a lot of time cooking ribs for friends. we also bought an outdoor heater because San Francisco summers are more like foggy winters.... let's hope we don't burn the apartment down.
Triumph: this week I brought myself back to AA again...Struggle: graduate school pressures to finish on time..General: going to see Alice with my gf on Friday she wants to see and it she deserves to go!
**Triumph:**  Nine Months today!!  It blows my mind how much my life has changed and gives me so much hope for the future!  .**Struggle:**  With the weather getting nicer I can't hide under a coat for much longer; I must commit to losing some LBs.  .**General:**  I Love [My Dog](http://imgur.com/UfG44Mf).  She's my bestest buddy!..edit: link
Triumph:  Nice longish run yesterday and wonderful dinner with the family...Struggle:  Still apprehensive about navigating the warmer months and sunshine without beer...General:  Will probably take at least one of the kids to see "Finding Dory" when it comes out.  
Triumph: First time in years been feeling rather energetic today even though sleep is an issue still..Struggle: Having trouble unwinding myself both physically and mentally..General / random: climbing sure would be easier if I lost an extra 5 - 10 kilograms :D getting there though just by not drinking.
Triumph: Yesterday I resisted very strong urges to drink - see below...Struggle: I was very angry yesterday afternoon into early evening. Mostly angry that I wanted to drink so bad. While I've accepted that I can't drink normally I'm still mad about it. Plus - fuck driving in Dallas traffic!..General: Taking the family on a camping trip next weekend (my kid's first). Really looking forward to it.
Triumph: I feel alive for the first time in a really long time! I no longer think to myself a beer sure sounds good right now. And I am almost at my 30 days! ..Struggle: I think my husband may be dabbling in pills again. His is not drinking which is good but sneaking off doing pills all the while claiming sobriety? Shitty situation at best. I am not OK with this. We shall see how this plays out...General: Owning a 90 y/o home is full of expensive repairs. Got a summer full of repairs heading my way. Good thing I don't mind hard work. hopefully that money tree I planted produces this year. :-)
**Triumph** I told my BF and a good plan about quitting.  It was really scary but they were so supportive. ..**Struggle** My emotions are freaking all over the place.  Sad - excited - scared - irritable - hopeful ... literally I'm feeling everything...**General** Starting my day three! I had to be to work early but let me tell you getting five hours of sleep is nothing compared to being sick and hungover.  This is my third morning not hungover (my last drink was lunchtime Sunday) and it is so nice.  
**Triumph:** I'm past the 2 week mark! And I made it back to my Wednesday morning workout after skipping the past 2 weeks because I woke up feeling way too groggy...**Struggle:** I'm still exhausted when I wake up some mornings. I'm going to bed on time and not waking up in the middle of the night but I wake up groggy. I hope this passes soon!..**General:** I'm not a big movie person either but I'm on the waitlist to borrow both The Revenant and The Force Awakens from our library so I have those to look forward to :)
T: 45 days sober! Treating myself to a new tattoo in honor of my new life. It's Grad season so I'm spending a lot of time with my family. ..S: My wife is having second thoughts about the divorce and it has me torn. One minute I'm working on the papers the next she's telling me she misses me. ..G: Looking forward to the Suicide Squad movie!
*Triumph*  learnt German everyday so far this week even though I wasn't always motivated...*Struggle*  been pretty emotional and cried a lot recently...*General*  I can't wait to see Suicide Squad it looks amazing.
**Triumph:** Picked up 3 new clients this week business is on the up...**Struggle** Still getting occasional 'I wasn't that bad' thoughts. I think it's because my bad knee is preventing me from exercising and leaving me with more spare time...**General** Never really been a movie goer just get chance to watch the odd thriller on Netflix.
**Triumph**:  11 months babay!!..**Struggle**:  damn you front yard thistles!!..**General**:  YES on the X-men movie!  And looking forward to a lot more time in the mountains and on the bike.
**Triumph**: Halfway through day 4. I was early to work so although it's a pretty busy day for me I'm gonna be off early and I'm *actually* excited to mow the grass when I get home and to hit the gym tonight....**Struggle**: Sleep has still been a bit rough last night was better but still a lot of tossing and turning and waking up a lot......**General**: Haven't been into movies much lately the drunk me has a short attention span. Sober me is looking foreword to getting back into it though! I've missed so many good ones!
**Triumph:** Things are good...**Struggle:** Feeling a bit stressed. Family and friends visiting for the holiday work projects are looming house projects I would rather do... But "bit" is the key word. I can and will deal with this...**Movies:** I don't get out to see movies in a theater very often. Can't think of anything new that I'm dying to see.
**Triumph:** 9 days without drinking and I've also started working out everyday...**Struggle:** This week I haven't been very productive at work. I'll change that starting tomorrow...**General:** Going back home next week. It should be fun but I'll have to be strong -- my friends back home drink a lot and I'm sure they will be pushy but I won't budge....And of course I'm not drinking today!
Triumph: a little over four months in and I think I'm doing pretty well. I've gotten much better at practicing patience and kindness and that is definitely correlated with my sobriety...Struggle: going overboard with my fitness. I'm worrying that I'm going overboard and have had a couple people mention my weight loss. Not necessarily in a bad way but.....General: gosh I don't even know what movies are out! I finally watched the revenant the other day because it finally hit the rentals! :)
Triumph: Hit my 100 days today..Struggle: Having major issues with my job; they are slowly moving operations across the country and it's not looking good for me..General: I haven't seen any movies recently and don't know what's out but I'm thinking of doing a couple other things (e.g. beach taking in a symphony or opera and finally dining on the water for the first time without a s***load of wine and acting like a fool. I'm so excited about this Summer :)
Triumph: My boyfriend had a nice birthday yesterday.  4 years ago when we first started dating he invited me to his birthday party at a bar and I tried to start a physical fight over billiards. Greatful for two years of sobriety where I'm drinking club soda and eating tacos at his birthday and we are having a real nice time. I have two commitments at two different AA meetings which is keeping me going to at least two a week. I want to get one more so that I can't go to less than 3 cause that's what I need right now. ..Struggle: having trouble accepting that I may not be promoted at my job even though I was told I had a promotion. My income isn't sufficient for my living expenses at the moment and I'm coming up against having to find a new job or reduce my expenses. I've been applying for jobs but in the mean time my expenses still aren't going down. Scarcity is a real stressor for me but I keep reminding myself that it will be okay. ..General: even though things are going OK I feel like I should be doing my meditation more regularly. 
Triumph: I did my first 6:30 am boot camp class today. I met with my physical trainer and set some goals...Struggle:  I am in the middle of doing my inventory and it's tough.  I can't seem to get a good momentum and I feel like I'll never finish. ..General:  started watching a series Catastrophe which seems to be growing on me. That's what's up! 
Another day without alcohol! Whoohoo!!!!
