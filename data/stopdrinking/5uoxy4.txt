I had about two months and I felt the craving to drink.  Last night I went to the store to get beer . Anyways I felt so bad today because I relapsed I regret drinking so much.  I guess I'm just venting here.

Sorry to hear that. At least it was just a blip and not a couple of years lost like so many others here (including me) ..Starting over? 
Sorry to hear that. I wish you the best stay strong.
Welcome back. Last year I celebrated 90 days sober with a drink. Since then I've only gone 2 full days without drinking and that was three months ago. I'm back you're back let's do this. I won't drink with you today.
I'm right here with you buddy. ..This was a minor setback. It was a reminder why we quit. It will fuel our coming days and give us the strength to do and be better. Here's to the next 67 and beyond!
I had a very similar case 6 months ago. Had 60 days didn't do the work that is necessary to stay sober bought alcohol and drank. Felt really shitty about it and regretted it so much. But regret doesn't help.
