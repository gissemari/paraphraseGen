    I am 26 years old and I have been drinking for 13 years on and off. I could always drink more than everybody else and I didn't really care to know why until I got my 2nd DUI in 2007. After that I was forced into recovery programs that I didn't want to be in. I met some incredible people but i already knew that my drinking wasn't over yet at that point bc thats what i had in my head. This is also the time I lived in a halfway house and met my friend Ali who was charged with a DUI homicide (her passenger who was an alcoholic passed). She helped me out so much back in 2007 and within the first week I knew I was going to be friends with her for the rest of my life. ..    After I got out of jail she was sentenced and went away for awhile. For the next 6 and a half years I took drinking head on and went through a journey that showed me why I am an alcoholic. I can't even tell you how many times I tried to quit drinking by myself over that time period but it was so many times. I met my current GF back in 2009 and told her right away that I had a serious alcohol problem and she said we can figure it out. Most of my attempts to stop have been while I have been with her. I've also learned that you cannot stay sober for somebody else. It sounds stupid but it just doesn't work your alcoholism will convince you that the person you love is trying to ruin your life. Its disgusting. I put that girl through a world of pain with my alcoholism (emotional and mental pain not physical). She drinks sometimes and we have drank together but I always take it to the next level. I always end up "transforming into the monster" as she calls me. We enjoyed drinking together at first but as time passed she began to hate me when i drank and eventually she just wouldn't drink anymore because she didn't want to encourage my drinking but that wouldn't stop me. I got so drunk on new years of 2011 that when we came home that night and got into a fight i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and handed it over to her and said "why don't you go ahead and kill yourself because nobody cares about you not me not your parents not anyone." She was incredibly upset the next day and I didn't know why until she told me I didn't have any recollection of that happening and I still do not. ..    This is the point where I started to fear my drinking or I should say fear myself when I drank. Was I becoming dangerous or was I just completely selling my soul to alcohol? This is the time that I started to experience longer and heightened periods of anxiety and depression after drinking. By this time I stopped going to see my friend Ali and had surrounded myself by people who were alcoholics but had worse situations than myself which allowed me to justify my own drinking. ..    I took care of my grandfather during this time because he was starting to have problems staying home alone at home and what not. My drinking still came first but I did my best to take care of my papa but even in his last days of being able to talk clearly he still told me that my alcoholism was bad. He told me that he was happy my grandma died when she did back in 2005 because if she saw me today it would kill her because I was her favorite grandson with so much potential and I was throwing it all away with alcohol. Eventually he needed more care than I could provide...    I had been struggling with school because of my alcoholism and it had almost cost me my relationship countless times. The one thing I can say though is that I have never cheated on my gf while intoxicated or ever i have never wanted to bc i knew what it took for her to put up with my shit. My family has helped me out through my troubled times and have hoped for me to figure out my own plan for sobriety but it hasn't happened up until recently. I went to detox after begging my dad to send me there because it came to a point that I physically couldn't stop drinking otherwise I would withdrawal. After I went through detox I kept myself sober by not drinking at all. That lasted for about 5 months until I decided to drink again. I didn't go to meetings or anything and told myself that all it took was my willpower. Eventually I gave into the screaming voice in my head to drink again. I remember that drink too it was a Pacifico on tap with a lime at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Vegas. As I drank the beer I remember how satisfied I felt to finally soothe that voice and how defeated and helpless I felt at the same time...    As it had before after my periods of brief sobriety my drinking picked up right where it left off. I tried to control myself as much as I could my girlfriend and I even had a few times drinking together where we got along this had not happened in years. This reinforced the thought that I was in complete control and that I was finally a normal drinker again but sadly I was only fooling myself. For all the times I kept myself reserved around my girlfriend while drinking I just hit it that much harder when she wasn't around. I began to lie again hide my drinking and fall into an endless pit of anxiety and depression. In the weeks leading up to my DUI I finally saw my alcoholism for what it was. I wasn't able to function normally before that but I had finally progressed to the point where I was able to maintain going to school excelling at my internship and maintain a normal sleeping schedule. ..    I had become a fully functional alcoholic and my sickness was exponentially degrading me as a human being finally taking the bigger piece of myself away from me and leaving me more and more empty everyday. Relief finally came when I received my DUI. Finally I am forced to stay sober by having a monitoring bracelet going to AA meetings and going to counseling. Im facing harsh penalties but thats okay. I've committed a crime and I accept that. I will go to jail and pay hefty fines but I accept that. Today I can look at myself in the mirror and feel some control again. I can tell people that I am an alcoholic and I know and believe it with everything in me. I know now that I cannot do this on my own and the people at AA are going to help me stay sober so long as I continue to go and want it bad enough. ..    Drinking is no longer an option for me because it is more than just a DUI next time. It will cost me everything my family my girlfriend my friends my job my future and most of all I will loose myself entirely. My demon haunts me everyday but I am not longer willing to give into its demands. I am going to fight for my sobriety and everybody is helping me now and I am finally willing to accept it. My friend Ali has been sober for 6.5 years and she took me to my first AA meeting since my dui and i have never felt better. I am lucky to have the support of everybody around me and I now realize my sobriety depends on who I surround myself with how I live my life and most importantly the maintenance and preventative measures I take (AA) to prevent a relapse. I realize that it essentially comes down to the point where I have the choice to take that first drink and today I am doing everything I can to prepare myself to say no when and where that situation arises. ..    If your an alcoholic you can do it too. Living in active alcoholism is the equivalent to living in hell on earth. I don't believe there is a God I believe in myself and everyone around me. If you think AA is just about God your sadly mistaken. I am finally free from alcohols strong grasp for the first time in years and I cannot wait to continue on my journey. Theres nothing wrong with admitting to being weak and meaning it because only then you can begin to heal. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to all the people that are in recovery may everyday be better than the last. To those of you that are still stuck in the midst of your addiction just remember that help is always out there weather it be AA rehab or whatever else. Never give up because it is 100% possible for you to beat this it all depends on what you want if you can accept it and what your going to do to free yourself.
