I'm coming up on 2 months and I haven't gone to an AA or SMART meeting. I haven't really had the urge to relapse yet but it strikes me that I'm a little late to the game in going to a meeting. When do most people start attending meetings?..I don't think it's urgent for me to go but I would like to check one out eventually. I feel pretty comfortable with my sobriety for the time being. There have been times that I've gone for way longer than this without drinking (3 months 6 months 10 months at different points in my life) but this is the first time I have truly committed to staying sober for life. In the past I would say "I'm going to stop drinking for the time being" and inevitably go overboard the very first time I tried to drink again. This time I finally recognize that I will never be able to drink in moderation and I never plan to drink again...In general when I decide to do something I'm pretty good about sticking to it. I went vegetarian 15 years ago and never "relapsed" by eating meat intentionally. I've done intermittent fasting before and I have no trouble going for days without food when that's what I've committed to. I don't really see abstaining from alcohol as being much different from those things...But clearly I have some level of interest in meetings or I wouldn't be posting here asking about it. There are a couple of issues for me though. I don't really want to give AA a go. I consider atheism to be a pretty important part of my identity and I know that all are welcome at AA meetings but I think the references to God would be hard for me to listen to. I grew up in a conservative Catholic family who took issue with my sexual orientation so religion is somewhat of a sore subject for me. I would definitely be interested in attending a SMART meeting but I live in the middle of nowhere and the closest one is about 80 miles away from me. I could make the trip once in a while I guess but I'm on a pretty tight budget so I'd probably only be able to go every two weeks or so. Is it worth going that infrequently?..I think the biggest thing I'm missing out on by not going to meetings is the sense of community. I haven't really gotten to share stories with other people who understand what I'm going through. This sub is quite helpful but it would be nice to have some face-to-face interaction with people who live near me.

Pop your AA cherry! No on there cares if you have 24 hours or 24 weeks. The worst thing that could happen is a free hour you aren't drinking. Who knows? You might make a sober friend. A note on relapse for me I never saw them coming. I would walk into a store with no intention of drinking and leave with a bottle of whiskey.
