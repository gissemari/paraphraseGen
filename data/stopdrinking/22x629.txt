I just wanted to post a brief thanks to /r/StopDrinking. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't this place and the people here. That is the truth. I hope this can be of some inspiration to some of you who are struggling. Fuck it was hard at the beginning I tried and failed many times. Just never give up and it will get easier so much easier. Don't let alcohol rule your life...Peace! :)
