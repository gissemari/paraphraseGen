Today is the start of the full moon festival and it's all about bbqing. I had a bbq today and..what goes with bbq...beer. I struggled but did not cave. But it was hard. I did not drink. .The joy of not drinking is wearing off a little bit. It's losing its shine.. if that makes sense. Having a drink would be the equivalent of stopping drinking. .On the good side my mood my inner peace my sleep have been good. My sleep is deeper and I wake more relaxed..Bad side my memory has gone to shit. Maybe it's the stress. Who knows. .Anyways I didn't drink today. How did everyone else go?

So far so good.  The memory thing will get better.  It takes the body and mind to recover.  .I'd rather be sober on my worst day than drunk on my best day..IWNDWYT 
I'm just over 50 days. Know what you mean about the shine kind of wearing of. Keep on keepin' on  ..PS- RC Cola goes damn well with BBQ too 
I've found that I'm more forgetful too!  My short-term memory is shot right now but to be honest it's still probably better than when I was drinking I'm just more aware of how much I'm forgetting.  No matter what IWNDWYT
