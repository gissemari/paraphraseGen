I have struggled with addiction - primarily alcohol but also to cocaine - since my mid 20's...Every time I've checked myself the explanation has always been  I'm not an addict or an alcoholic but I drink more than I'd like to ...Having pretty much cut cocaine out of my life I convinced myself that drinking was something I had under control. My wife has been supportive and I had been clean of cocaine for a few months while at the same time drinking quite heavily on the regular...Last night we had a lovely dinner at a friends house and I stumbled across his drug stash in his washroom cabinet. Despite my wife being asleep on the couch on the other side of the wall I started using cocaine...I woke up this morning and for the first time in my life truly realized I have a drinking and drug problem - I am addicted to alcohol and cocaine and this is a real disease I need to treat seriously. ..It's funny how in hindsight I was clearly in denial about it even while going to occasional NA or AA meetings and confidently thinking  I don't have a problem like these guys ...My addiction is going to try and convince me otherwise again and again and that's why I'm writing this to remind others and my future self that I am sick and that's okay for me to admit...I am no better or worse than any other human addict or not. As such I deserve the same happiness as others. I am going to begin to long walk towards that goal today...Thanks for listening.

I am going through the same thing right now. I actually recently made a post on here about finally admitting to myself that I am an alcoholic. I'm four days sober and haven't done cocaine ina month. The hardest part is admitting it to yourself but after I did that I was able to see a little clearer and realize why I did some of the things I did. Good for you for making the decision to quit. I'm right there with ya. IWNDWYT
I was the same way. Your addiction is like a body builder. Always working out so it can take you down. I was wrapped up in the blow for a while too. I did both AA and NA meetings. They were a godsend. It took me to hit rock bottom to realize I needed to get clean. Thing about rock bottom is when you realize you are there it's pretty much only one direction you can go. That direction is up. Make the changes. Start the new life. Go up! I will not drink or drug with you today!!!
