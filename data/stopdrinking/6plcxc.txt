----------immediate responses--------

I forgot about What's Up Wednesdays! ..**Triumph:** Was given the responsibility of taking the meeting minutes at my home group which is 90% old-timers and feeling like they trust/respect me more to give me "important" duties. Felt good man. ..**Struggle:** Went to my aunts 60th birthday party last night. Felt really disconnected from everyone. Struggled to make conversation. Felt awkward and uncomfortable all night. Had no fun. Should have driven myself so I could have left way earlier. ..**General**: I've missed this place! Really want to make an effort to post here more. This was my biggest support system a few years ago and it feels good to be "back".  
**Triumph**: nine miles on my bike today. I couldn't have sniffed that 65 days ago. I would have been drunk by 7pm. ..**Struggle**: my work culture is so boozy. SO boozy. I've just started telling people I'm in recovery when they ask why I'm not drinking. It works every time!..**General**: God my mood is so good. So much better. I feel like a million bucks these days. 
Triumph: My mood is so much better without booze. Its incredible that we drink to pick ourselves up yet in the end it drags us down..Struggle: The people around me have no idea that I am/was a closet alcoholic. Also I live overseas so its hard to find others who to identify with..General: Thanks SD. Simply lurking for a month is what encouraged me that I could stop!
&gt; This is my choice today for Laughter...That was so cute. :) ..Happy Wednesday everybody.
Triumph: Back in school in a month. Scared!..Struggle: Find it hard to create boundaries and take care of myself in general. Self abuse is in my blood - I might eat healthy but I'll neglect exercise. Or if I exercise I will exercise too much and burn out in no time. ..General: Conflicted about where to go and who to be.
**Triumph:** I had a great week of camping followed by my first sober concert this weekend. I had a few temptations along the way but I'm very happy to have worked through them and had some awesome "living in the moment" times...**Struggle:** I have the back to work blues. Why can't I just live on a mountain by a lake and kayak every day? It's a pretty dream but it doesn't pay the bills...**General:** I've never seen the acronym for SELF before I like it! 
**Triumph:** I'm traveling for work. Monday evening I was driving to a park to run. Waiting at a long stoplight I watched a guy fail a field sobriety test. 6 pm and he could barely stand but chose to get behind the wheel. I felt sorrow anger and immense waves of graditude. I can choose to never put myself in that position again. I can choose to have an excellent run...**Struggle:** I had thought I would spend all my extra time quiet and alone in a hotel room cranking on projects. No progress on that front but serious amounts of SELF care. Not the progress I planned but clearly the progress I needed...[Monday's Exercise](http://i.imgur.com/gRIl0MH.jpg)
Hey Mary - I'm so glad that you're feeling better :)...Triumph:     K and I went to Boston and visited his sister and BIL. I absolutely love this family - I've never been treated so well before...Struggle:     Mom's surgery is on Tuesday. I spent 5 hours with her in pre-op with her after just being diagnosed with pneumonia. Hoping the Biaxin kicks in real quick...General:     Getting sober helped me to realize what self-care is all about. Now I've really got to take good care of my health to be able to take care of everyone else!    
Triumph: Clean mouth mornings. No film no boozy breath no aftertaste. Man waking up and not feeling like you need to drink every ounce of everything in your fridge to start your day feels amazing. .Struggle: While I feel amazing physically my mind continues to space into 'when I go back to drinking' scenarios. Like this is just a temporary choice. I struggle with the permanence of sobriety. I'm starting to realize it really is 24 hours at a time and many times less than that. .General: I have been eating like a horse. Not eating poorly just eating. I have gone from 2-3 meals per day to more like 4-5. And ice cream. I've started allowing myself a scoop or two 2-3 times a week. Better than 2-3 vodkas 2-3 times a week!.
Triumph: My Mom said she's proud of me. I know she has been my whole life but she never said it much. She says it a lot now...Struggle: I'm a school teacher going back to work. My job makes me really like to get drunk on Fridays to let off steam. I will have to pay extra attention to this and be careful to not let my guard down...General: I'm currently babysitting my niece and oh-my-God do I love her. It makes me want a baby really badly!
What's up!
**Triumph:** I've been seeing this girl the past few weeks and it's been great! I don't even feel obligated to drink around her and we click pretty well. I'm new to dating and it's kind of nice that I met someone after actively trying just over a month ago. Who knows what'll happen?..**Struggle:** I've started calorie counting and forcing myself to move more during the day. It's not much of a struggle but it's just a big change of pace for me...**General:** There's something nice about being well rested and healthy for the day's work.
It's nice to read the other comments here. It reminds me that life isn't perfect but you can make it better...Triumph: I made it 80 days sober for the first time in maybe 20 years just recently. Reset 10 days ago but it wasn't a failure it was a test. I drank beers with my flatmates and had a so-so night. Had the worst hangover all through Sunday that headache that just doesn't go away. I'm 10 days sober now and just enjoying having a more stable mood...Struggle: I still feel really ashamed when I remember embarrassing things I've done in the past even if it was years ago and i don't know any of those people anymore.  I sometimes wish I could dull it all and put myself to sleep again...General: I'm setting goals again. Just trying to see my future in a more positive light. Thinking of what i can achieve and not dwelling on my failures so much.
Triumph: On Day 10 of sobriety and feeling wonderful. I feel like I'm sleeping all the time and I'm eating more candy than Augustus Gloop but I'm sure both of those will taper off as I practice self care...Struggle: More of a scary moment. Out for dinner with friends for a birthday yesterday. I got there after my friend and ordered a non-alcoholic drink. The waiter asked "Keg size?" (ie: a double). I thought he was joking but I did confirm I was ordering a non-alcoholic drink. Turns out he was new and my friend has accidentally been given the alcoholic version of the drink she had ordered. Oops. Not a big deal for her but I'm glad I confirmed my drink was booze free. ..General: Having a rough summer. Usually summer is downtime at work but we're busier than usual are revamping the store and I've been given new responsibilities that are eating into my time to get other work down. (The blessing in disguise is this has pushed me to sobriety. I couldn't handle all this while drinking.) 
**Triumph** I have been sober nearly a week. This time around has been *waaaaay* easier so far. I have relied on n/a beer and lots of snacks...**Struggles** I have been sad this week. I feel alone and abandoned as I lost a friendship to someone who supported me a lot. I have been really apathetic to my school work and everythng is due in..like a week. ..**General** I just knew it was time to quit. One plus side of being alone is there's no one to pressure you to drink. 
I like your SELF-care!!  I'm lacking some laughter in my world.  Maybe I need to go seek it in stead of waiting for it to come to me...**Triumph:**  I recently really *got* that despite being sober my reactionary "life is so hard" attitude lately is still coming from a victim mentality.  And no one is going to change that except for me!  So I decided to change my outlook and stop getting so wound up over small things and instead come at life from a more confident patient state of mind.  I'm sure it will ebb and flow but I'm working on taking back my happiness from old mental patterns of defeat...**Struggle:** See above.  This shit is hard!  Life seems to go faster and faster and I wonder at the point of it all.  Not worth drinking over but I haven't been truly happy for a long time...**General:**  My self-care consists of enough sleep time with a community I love alone time to recharge quiet time for reflection and/or meditation exercise for feel-good hormones and getting deep into nature since my animal self REALLY needs that connection on a regular basis.  I am missing quite a few of those important qualities in my life right now which probably explains some of my morose behavior lately.
**T:**  Starting to feel a little bit better.  I haven't been feeling to well...**S:**  I feel uncomfortable around alcohol.  Sober people sober places...**G:**   I need a lot of sleep.  I can function on very little sleep but it's wears me out.
Triumph - I have made it to day 3 with no drinking...Struggle - An old drinking buddy is showing up tomorrow and I need to make a plan on how to handle the pressure to drink.  My friend won't pressure me to drink but I do worry about the urge to drink...General - Overall I am feeling pretty good.
Triumph: Deciding to reach out to listen to open myself up for change. ..Struggle: Self medicating is what I know it's what I do. Trying to break the 20 year cycle of addiction...General: Depressed. Ashamed. 
**Triumph:** I sat around yesterday thinking "oh yeah I should check in on /r/stopdrinking to see how many days it's been. It's been a little while and I forgot about drinking." ..Turns out after today it's three weeks. I saw an old friend the other day and he saw how alive and skinny I was and he was like "maybe I should cut back on the drinking."
Fun! I'll play! ..**Triumph:** I cleaned my entire filthy apartment--fresh start! ..**Struggle:** I keep going back and forth over whether I should tell my boyfriend about my new sobriety. Pros: He would be super supportive I would feel more accountable I wouldn't be doing this alone it would make it feel more real; Cons: We don't live together so he doesn't really know how much I drink. He's made comments plenty of times about my wine drinking--always playful but I could tell he wasn't super into it. I would retort with "Just because you've seen me relax with a glass a few times doesn't mean I'm doing it every night!" Of course I was doing it every night. He might also treat it as a passing whimsy--I often make big declarations about changing my habits and they rarely last a week. For this reason I think I might wait until I have some weeks under my belt as proof. ..**General:** I feel really good about this. It feels different this time. Or it feels like *I'm* different this time! I don't know yet. 
**bold** Triumph: Played a house show with my band last night. Lots of alcohol around. Although extremely tempted I didn't drink last night. Also didn't go to the bar for lunch to day at work... **bold** Struggle: The thought that my drunk is so cheap so I might as well drink up...**bold**General: Enjoying how I feel without drinking.
Triumph: I never thought I would make it this far. I have more energy then I've ever had. I feel amazing despite the mess I'm still cleaning up. ..Struggle: Post divorce logistics. Figuring out how to get back home and share custody. Bank balance continues to fluctuate because of child support/car repairs...Random: Realizing working at Mcdonalds is actually kind of fun. 
Triumph: Took all alcohol out of my favorites for online grocery shopping and was happy about it! ..Struggle: Balancing domestic work income generating work and spending time with my family. ..General: I finished one marathon knitting project on Saturday and started another last night whie binge watching netflix!
**Triumph:** Finally got a couple of decent length bike rides in this last week. The endorphins from them lasted a while!..**Struggle:** I've got an overnighter with the band I'm in at the moment. They're all gearing up to make it a boozy one. It's in a country renowned for great beer. I won't drink and hopefully I won't feel too much like the odd one out.....**General:** I love the SELF care idea.
Triumph: Had a physical exam today and it went great. It's awesome to circle "none" in the alcohol consumption questionnaire. Talked about quitting smoking and was prescribed Cantix. I'm so ready to tackle this addiction as well...Struggle: My dad's mental health. Bipolar and off on a manic episode. Hiding up north in the mountains because of a criminal charge. I just want him to get help and come home...General: Going on a well deserved vacation next week with an emphasis on self-care. Watch out Portlanders(?) I'm coming to drink all your precious organic coffee! Muahahaha!
triumph: day 18! keeping a positive outlook and enjoying life. learning things about myself that are helping me understand why i drink and how to combat this...struggle: some friends were in town last night and the thoughts were creeping around my head at 9:00 "maybe i can just have a few drinks i feel like i can't not drink with these people" but thankfully went home instead of hanging out with them to be safe. had nightmares that i drank with them...general: i really love being sober but i'm frightened how easy it is to lose it. :|
