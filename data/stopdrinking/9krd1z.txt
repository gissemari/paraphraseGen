I haven't really posted much lately.  I guess because Ive been doing pretty good.  Ive just been trying to give others who may be struggling in their first couple days some positive words.  Not drinking has become a habit now which makes things a bit easier.  Im looking forward to getting to a month soon!  Have a great day everyone.  IWNDWYT

I'm about the same. I don't think about it much anymore but the first 10 days were really hard. IWNDWYT 
I swung by thinking we'd be sober-date buddies but looks like we're off by one :-(..I'm feeling much the same as you.  Now that I stopped drinking I feel hardly any urge to start back up...And I'm doing much the same as you...just cruising around the subreddit trying to sprinkle a bit of sunshine where I feel I can.  ..I can't wait to see us both hit a month!
