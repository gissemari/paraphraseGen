This is more to satisfy my general curiosity but does anyone know of any studies indicating the likelihood of relapse in recovering alcoholics?  I'd imagine that the longer someone stays sober the likelihood of relapse gets lower but would like to see some studies to this effect.

I saw a graph on here once that I can't find now but it was number of days at badge reset not super accurate at all but it did gradually go down with number of days but peaked on anniversary dates. (One year 18 months 2 years etc)
First you can see the [2014 Survey Results.](https://www.reddit.com/2oxmxi)  Then if you are extremely interested in the subject why don't you look at [the Natural History of Alcoholism Revisited by Vaillant](http://www.amazon.com/The-Natural-History-Alcoholism-Revisited/dp/0674603788)
In general the likelihood of relapse is the same as it is for other chronic diseases such as heart disease asthma arthritis diabetes and cancer--50%. Following medical recommendation to the "T" for these diseases lessens the probability of relapse. However we as human beings find it difficult to do this hence recovery is compromised half the time. [I'm looking for the source where I saw this statistic.]
Try searching for the Rand Corporation study "The Course of Alcoholism." It followed 900+ alcoholics for 4 years tracking recovery and relapse. The numbers aren't pretty so don't get too stuck on them. It's difficult to take 900 individuals and draw any single conclusion from them but it's downright crazy to then take that conclusion and try to extrapolate it back to one individual's chances. So take it with a big old salt crystal.
