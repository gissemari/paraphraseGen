I [22 F] have quiet bpd and I'm able to control my urges and behaviour most of the times but my fav (haha) coping mechanism is alcohol. It's sooo awesome because when I'm drunk my bpd really shows it's colours and hangover anxiety isn't helping either...I've ruined everything for million timed this week. I've said myself I need to stop drinking so many times but this time I need to write it. I never told anyone because i didn't want them to see me fail. Maybe I didn't really meant it. This time must be different...2nd day and I met a boy I awkwardly tried to hit on (totally drunk depressed crazy manic mode on) last week with his girlfriend. Then I went to see my grandpa who's struggling with depression and my father - alcoholic. He offered me wine. I refused. Went to the shop to buy cigarettes (I often bought wine there) and they asked me if it's really everything I want. Yes that's all. ..I'm proud. Today wasn't a good day and in the past I would  allow  myself to get blackout drunk. But not today. Not tomorrow.

Hang in there. I am on day 6 and last night I had the best sleep I have had in a long time. There is a lot of support here so when you feel the urges - read a few posts encourage others and give them hope. That's my plan. IWNDWYT.
Well done making it this far. I find the first three days hardest then I'm rolling. I hope you find your way. ..Peace &amp; Love.Paul
Hey I was diagnosed with bpd at 23 and was using alcohol as a coping mechanism. Totally relate to being the crazy drunk girl doing crazy stuff that pushes people away. ..You got this. It gets easier with time and each day is a victory. IWNDWYT!

In my lowest phase I needed low dosed quetiapin and prozac to stop the anxiety drinking cycle.
