Proud of my first night in I while without drinking.  Need to keep it up!  Know I will be tempted at dinner tonight.  And tomorrow night we'll be at a party of course.  Appreciate just being able to share my struggle here.  Thanks.

Good for you! You made it through one night so now you have proof you can do it and can make it through another. It gets easier :)
