.Today is Dec. 1st and I did not have a drink during the month of November. This month was a bit harder to stay sober as I had more temptations and a few cravings. I stayed strong though and a large part of the credit goes to the community here in this sub.  I come here everyday to check in and read stories about how others are doing.  Some of the most informative yet heartbreaking are the relapse stories. They instantly bring me back to where I was when I quit and they are a stark reminder of how far I have come. I was addicted to a nasty controlling life sucking drug. It hurts so much to write yet it couldn't be more true. I have broken the addiction and couldn't be happier. I will never go back to the the old way the way of alcohol controlling me.  I am in control of what I put in my body and alcohol has no place in my body. There isn't any scenario where drinking would be a good idea for me. I am in a great place now with a strong will and desire to stay off the bottle.  ..I used to think that alcohol enhanced certain activities but in reality that was just the addiction of the alcohol tricking me into drinking more.  You know what really enhances activities? Being sharp and clear so that you can focus analyze and perform at peak level. If it takes beer to make an activity fun sounds like a boring activity to me. Drinking is a poor substitute for the thing we call life...Quitting drinking was a long time coming and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I wish I hadn't gotten into it in the first place and I wish there was more information about the evils of drinking and less glamorizing the ingestion of this evil drug. Well no more of the evil shit for me.  I am strong I am in control I love my new life and I will never go back to the old way.  It was my decision to quit drinking and it was a great one. .

Good work my friend.
As someone who is in the very beginning stages of trying to quit (still haven't made it past two weeks in a while) with many relapses it's helpful to hear from people who are 30 60 90 days and years away from their last drink and how much more fun events and life are as whole is. It's the light at the end of the tunnel type feeling that is driving my desire to quit and helping overcome the scary-ness of the thought of life without alcohol that life will be boring when in actuality it's way better.
