I'm new here and just checking in. I figure some extra support could never hurt. This is the first time I've put my self in others hands and wow what a difference. I've been hitting meetings and got myself into an IOP program. Like the title says 25 days for the first time in probably 8 years (Wow writing that makes me feel shame and pride at the same time)and my head is clearing some finally. After giving in and admitting that I was powerless along with trying to participate in meetings that lonesome hopelessness is clearing up. Things are definitely not all better and this is not easy by any means but I think I can say I'm off to a good start. Having a few shreds of pride pop up after such a long time feels good.  To anyone struggling out there just keep coming back it really gets better. Can't wait to see how I feel in another month. ..Anyone out there in the Cleveland Ohio area?

Not in Cleveland but I wish you the best. I'm feeling a lot of the same emotions right now. It feels good. 
Congratulations on your progress Smasher!..I remember when my head began to clear.  I was out on my morning walk sun was shining and I sat on a bench down by the water.  Saw families playing wild life and there was a sailing competition going on...I remember how great it felt small wave of emotions came over me...Great news on 25!
Thanks for the support. Even writing this post has made me feel slightly better. Just gonna keep truckin through these small victories and eventually the war will be won.
