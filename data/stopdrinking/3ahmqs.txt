Hey there eyeryone so it's been months since I've posted. Since then I've gone through multiple abstinence and relapse. I've relived I hate alcohol since but it keeps drawing me in. I don't drink because I'm depressed or sad but because of boredom. The only way I can relax and play video games or watch movies at night is because of vodka. It's become so rutine that it's constantly pis sing me off weather sober or drunk. As I said I can get over withdrawl but it end up in me thinking internaly tha T I'll be fine to drink this night since I haven't drank in a few days. It always ends in me drinking for the next week. I think that if I can get some coercion by becoming super sick for a few months that would break my cycle of bullshit. Is it confidential enough to just go to a family clinic and ask for a couple months of antibuse. I feel like I can't go any other routes since AA's criteria wouldn't fit me. Thank you immensity for any advice.
