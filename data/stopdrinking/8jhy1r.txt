I had a year and a half sobriety under my belt when I blew it up a few months ago for reasons that don't make sense to me. Since then I've been back to the old struggle of telling myself I can control my drinking only to spin into a binge within a few days swear booze off and start the cycle of self compromising all over again...Last week I really thought I had it figured out. As long as I went for a long run every day I could have two beers with dinner to finish out the day. As always this ended in a weekend bender. I woke up this morning - not necessarily with a hangover - but this overwhelming sense of dread and darkness. I couldn't get out of my apartment. I called in sick and just sort of rode through hours of really horrible anxiety...It's 10:00PM now and even though I'm still a little wobbly I'm not going to drink today and know that tomorrow will be easier but that the need for self vigilance will begin all over again...I've said it before but I can't keep going on this way. It's going to fuck up my life. My year and a half of sobriety was incredible but getting back into that rhythm has proven very difficult...I need to rethink how I'm going to stay sober. I need to take proactive steps if I'm going to make it for the long haul. ..What I really want to do is go to an AA meeting but for the next two days I have some really hectic travel coming up. In the short term I'm going to check in here. This is an incredible resource that I've only occasionally and passively taken advantage of. Come Thursday I should be able to start hitting the rooms but I need to have some sort of plan to get through the next few days...Sorry this post was a bit of a ramble. Any tips you might have would be appreciated. At least I got through today. Thanks.

Yeah man I am happy you are getting to a meeting.  The first few days suck no matter what of course a meeting would be great but whatever if it was me I just would be drinking water and reminding myself that my brain is lying to me and even though things are bad in a few days they will be much better then they seem...I drank after 8 months sobriety then I drank for about 8 months and honestly I don't think I had fun even one time with it.  They say sobriety takes all the fun away from drinking.  It sure was defeating though seemed hopeless almost cause I had no clue what the future was gonna be.  But the good news is my sobriety this time around has been incredibly easy.  I already knew what worked for me and what was working it was simply a matter of putting those things back in place for a couple months.  That period where i drank I now consider as the biggest waist of time in my entire life.
