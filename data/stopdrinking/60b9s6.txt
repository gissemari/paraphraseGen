Hey SD. Long time since my last check-in. I wanted to pop in quickly and give a heartfelt thank you to this sub and a few words of encouragement to those in need. Last August I decided to make a lifestyle change. Alcohol was the root of a prolonged period of stagnation and complacency in my life. It was also my solution to the resulting cognitive dissonance and depression. ..I'm happy to report I've broken the cycle. I spent months getting my shit together. The clarity of sobriety gave me the courage to take risks I would never have when drinking and racked with insecurities. I'm typing this from a new home on a new coast with a new job that challenges me everyday. That challenge reinforces my lifestyle change. I must show up clear-headed and ready to crush it daily. This is a period of rapid growth. I'm scared shitless a lot but one thing is absolutely certain. I couldn't do this drunk. ..I relate this positive story for two reasons. One I still lurk here and will resume a more active role once I settle it at my new job. I want to keep myself on a positive path and understand that requires vigilance. Comfort is my enemy. ..Secondly. The early weeks and months were hard. I had to skip events make sacrifices and was bitter about my brain and my situation. If you are just starting now I empathize with your struggle. It's real and it sucks. I'm with you today. Keep going. I will. ..Lastly. An admission. My badge count is inaccurate. Progress isn't always linear. My path was filled with errors and lapses in judgement. But my commitment to change was unwavering. I continued showing up here and never gave up on myself. I'm thankful for it today.
