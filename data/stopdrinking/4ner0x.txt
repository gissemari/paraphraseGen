Good morning / afternoon / evening..Theme: Beginnings..**"You know that the beginning is the most important part of any work..."   [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)**..What I get from it: Getting sober was not easy for me initially. For a lot of years I wrestled with moderation and I tried to do it before I posted here... really tried. When I posted here and asked for help I got a lot of the right kind of support that helped me get [more days than I had ever got before on my own (see my post on day 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ezhmn/today_is_day_7/) the 17 years prior. It was an achievement I never thought I would reach but I still had my doubts. I hear people talk about feeling like a child in early sobriety and in a lot of ways I still feel I am. Getting sober I had to learn to do a lot of things I had never attempted wanted to try or tolerate. Feeling uneasy pissed off without release and just miserable in general! Continuing to read here helped. It does take what it takes and sometimes it takes time to grow. If you are struggling today [coolcrosby has posted the baby steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and though I didn't follow them to the letter to start I eventually found a way to work them all. ..Have a happy Friday!

It is early days for me. Thank you for your insight into early sobriety and your positive message to persevere. It is my intention to stay sober today. 
I agree about "the beginning".  Done well things proceed more smoothly with a higher probability of success and unanticipated obstacles are more easily handled...Since this week was the 72nd anniversary of D-Day I reflected on some of those aspects including the sacrifices and tragedy. I thought about the planning the preparation the practice the considerations for ' unforeseen' events.  "The Beginning' of the largest scale amphibious and air assault hinged on a "successful" beginning.  If they didn't claim a beachhead and broach an inroad past the heavily fortified positions everyone would be vulnerable and trapped on the sands.  ..Similarly I see many posters here 'set off on a course of sobriety' and not make it past the beachhead.  Only to be pushed back...What made the difference for me was "The Beginning".  In my beginning I was desperate.  I worried if I didn't make it past the initial wall of resistance I might never be successful.  That's why I 'took direction' from those that had successfully done so previously.  They said 'do 90 meetings in 90 days.'  I was so desperate I did 147 in 90 days.  I got past the beachhead.  The rest of the journey has been successful up to Today.  ..As u/coolcrosby suggests I made a conscious decision not to drink today...Just for Today I don't drink...If Today proceeds like Yesterday Tomorrow I'll do the same thing...But it's just one day -Today...Peace be with you.
