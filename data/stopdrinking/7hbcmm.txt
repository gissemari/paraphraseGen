This year has been incredibly tough. My parents kicked me out for finding copious amounts of weed in my car and I moved to another city at a moments notice and later realized life is one big crazy roller coaster. I have crippling depression and anxiety most days and sometimes drinking in all that makes sense to do because I no longer smoke weed and hardly do any other drugs. My toughest issue is finding better coping mechanisms to deal with life's struggles and I found this subreddit by accident but it intrigued me and seemed like a great place besides the group I go to to find some help and other people who are going through similar situations like my own. I'm not exactly a pro redditor so I'm open to criticism as well. ..Your friend FG3

I find Reddit in general to be a very forgiving social media spot on the internet.  As soon as I discovered it I stopped looking at almost anything else and I stopped feeling angry about people quite as much.  (Is there anything that can be as annoying as people being wrong on the internet?! ;)  This sub is very compassionate and kind and generous.  Stay.  I think it will help.
