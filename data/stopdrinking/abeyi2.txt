Almost 2 months sober. 2019 will be the year I do not pick up a drink. Everything else comes second. ..The cycle of relapse and getting sober and relapsing every few months is boring. I am done spinning my wheels. This is the year I don't drink no matter what one day at a time. ..IWNDWYT

Here's to a sober 2019! IWNDWYT 
I'm with you.. no more cycle of futility 
Great new year resolution! IWNDWYT 
I too have had a number of relapses! Then I heard the truest words I have ever heard from a sober alcoholic.  We are alcoholics we are not stupid . That's when I realized taking the first drink is gambling with my life. It not always happy but a least I am still breathing and means hope. ..I will be there with you.
That's a great quote. Thank you. 
Great job on 2 months! I am hanging on to just 2 days but am right here with you. I will not drink with you tonight!
