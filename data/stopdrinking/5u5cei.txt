My body hurts and mind is foggy. Been wanting to stop for sometime. Did download an app have had 20 resets since December.  Whilst grateful for sobriety in the day at night I struggle.  So ill say it for the first time  I won't drink with you today.  Peace all.

You're doing a brave hard thing. Keep going!
