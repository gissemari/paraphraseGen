Thought I outta finally post as I actually joined Reddit purely for this sub (buddy told me about it months and months ago).  As of tomorrow (1/12) it will be 4 full weeks without the drink.  It's taken me about a year or so of "trying" to actually do something about it.  While I have been drinking the last 5 years or so it was one year ago that I actually realized I was an A word.  Even then it took nearly a year for me to become actually proactive.  I would on occasion swear off booze and be sober for a day (likely due to being severely hung over) but it never lasted because I never admitted it was a true problem.  I'd pick up the bottle the next day to drawn it all out.  Rinse and repeat.  Relationships damaged stupid decisions made health deteriorated...you all know the drill.....In any event before the holiday season I went and saw my primary care physician admitted out loud that I had a problem (for the very first time in my life) and have taken a bunch of steps including:  1) speaking openly about it with my (non-drinking) and she was so supportive! 2) attending therapy/out patient rehab [tried AA and it was great but may not be for me - thus trying something else because I think I need to be around others that have/are going through this 3) not drinking [importantly!] and 4) finally feeling like I have something to live for.....I want to thank you guys/gals for the stories and inspiration.  It has been amazing to read about the experiences of everyone - it seems like so many of us have common experiences and I saw a lot of myself in many stories about struggling with alcohol.

Good job on the 4 weeks.  Keep up the good work stay strong stay positive! :)
Thanks for sharing. I'm at the very beginning and probably need to see my doctor to assess the damage I've done to myself. I'm going to schedule a trip to my doctor tomorrow if possible. Was that helpful to you in assessing a plan for rehabilitation? Obviously not drinking but in terms of repairing damage to your body. Congratulations on 4 weeks I will see you there in 3 weeks and 6 days.
