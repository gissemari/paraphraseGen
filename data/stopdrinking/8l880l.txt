Ignore my current badge if it's still there because that one failed I'm now sober from 31st March 18 when I found out I was pregnant...Since being sober I have sort of fallen into a routine I'm keeping on top of housework everyday I'm waking up early and refreshed I'm going outside more with my kid I'm getting dressed everyday...I do miss drinking I won't lie. That was my adult fun thing to do in town but seeing how much of a better mum I have become just shows me that I can and will sacrifice that bit of fun til my kids are fully grown adults even then that's a long time sober so I may not even bother going back...I am struggling with finding other things to do because my whole life currently revolves around playgroup and playdates at the moment I really need that fun outlet...I don't miss the hangovers or waking up the next morning and avoiding looking at my messages for the next 24 - 48hrs because I've sent embarrasing messages to an ex or something...My anxiety is up but my depression has been long gone which is great just need to sort that first one out...I think overall I'm feeling much more responsible reliable for my kid and productive..

Heck yeah I applaud you! You're making steps in the right direction. I just hope I can do the same. Stay strong!
Well first of all congratulations on the baby and the sobriety!  I've started painting and drawing again something I previously loved. Do you have any old hobbies you can resurrect?
