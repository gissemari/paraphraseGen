I'm 57. I quit drinking once before with the help of AA. I was sober for 7 years. I live in a small town now where there is no AA. I've been reading this sub and trying to get the courage from the stories I read. I recently went 10 days with out a drink. But relapsed bad. I'm about to lose an amazing woman. I have to stop now or just drink myself to death.
