I have been drinking since 12 or 13 went to an all boys catholic high school and ramped up my drinking on the weekends. I'm 26 now and  the drinking turned into a problem and here I sit after another weekend of arguments with the girlfriend about how ridiculous I act when I'm drunk...I need to regain my articulation and begin the road to recovery. My plan is to quit alcohol the same way I quit cocaine cigarettes and weed: with strong will and determination. I once had a therapist tell me that I woud relapse very hard considering the amount of cocaine I was doing but it has been nearly three years with only three mistakes...I'm not really afraid to quit but booze has been the only vice I haven't put down since I started. I have a good support system in place and I think I can handle it just putting some feelers out because this community seems to be a great place for help and advice. ..Thank you all for sharing your stories they have given me a good start on what I need to be doing to keep away from the demons.

Welcome. There are a lot of components that seem to go into recovery. Your determination is a good start. Support is important and finding a way to make the path one of enrichment and growth seems key. Stay in touch. 
Good luck its easier with the help of others if you hit a dodgy patch!
