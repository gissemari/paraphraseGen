I've now been sober longer than I drank as an adult. Four years ago I got a public intoxication and trespassing. I had to spend the summer after graduating college going to 50 AA meetings and doing something like 100 hours of community service. You can read my post from that time [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/28np3z/realized_i_am_a_problem_drinkeralcoholic_now_what/)...I am glad I am sober. If I hadn't been arrested that night I'd probably be arrested another time. My anxiety levels have gone down. I am actually forced to deal with my social anxiety instead of hiding it by drinking it away. I feel healthier. Drinking even a moderate amount fucked up my anxiety levels for the next few days. I am more stable. The highs and lows of life have evened out. ..I can see how my brain works now and I struggle with it still. My brain clearly wants to have more of whatever it does that makes it feel good. Whether that is caffeine sex cannabis or nicotine. I just instinctively want more. Luckily I am not impulsive so I can keep my desires at bay (since drinking lowered those barriers it was the perfect drug for me to abuse). ..But I feel flat. I don't feel pleasure or joy in the same degree as when I drank. I don't have the lows either. But I miss those highs. Now my life has become a stable and safe. I can recognize the desires that I used to have. After a tough work week I'll be excited for the weekend and an energy will be running through me a desire to escape from everything to  feel at ease. This is the feeling that I would get before I would have a really disastrous night of "getting fucked up" now it just dissipates. Life feels boring...I know I am never going to drink again. I have nightmares of drinking. While my emotional brain sometimes thinks fondly of drinking the horrendous experiences I have had with it is enough for my rational brain to break those urges. ..But I still feel flat. I miss those highs. ..

I have a very different reason for feeling flat but I'd like to share anyway. I am an emotional abuse survivor who was trapped for 10 years. Before that I was a passionate (if a bit abrasive) creative strong willed person. It took a really long time for the last bits of that personality to crumble but all the gaslighting and walking on eggshells and minor physical abuse eventually got there. ..It's been three years and I'm just finally feeling like I might know who I am again. I feel able to laugh and I sometimes enjoy my hobbies. It's been a real slog. Sometimes I feel like I'll just be this two dimensional thing forever. But I finally made some friends last year and they've told me that I seem like a different person than the one they met. I seem alive and sometimes I seem happy and I don't seem afraid as often. ..My situation is very different because my personality was crushed under the weight of long term abuse and I'm having to rebuild a person out of what's left of me. But the takeaway here is that you can make new joy in your life. You can cultivate excitement and adventure until they're just a part of you! You can learn to feel truly excited to run a 5k or drive go karts or go to a sporting event or whatever else you want... and thankfully you don't have to be broken to want to have a richer life. ..IWNDWYT... and I'll also do something just for the fun of it. :)
Congratulations on 4 years and all the significant life changes you have achieve. Much respect for all that hard work. ..I hear you about missing the highs. My highs were borderline manic - no one laughed harder or  felt joy  more powerfully than me at the peak of my drinking. ..There are two things I've found helpful. ..The first is that - the joy laughter and  connection' I felt to other people when I was drinking was all chemically induced in my brain. I was chasing a temporary serotonin boost. This boost felt even more powerful because my day-to-day serotonin was so low (for me depression and alcohol were intertwined). ..The second is that - alcohol tries to tell us that we can or  should  have it all. That it's  not fair  we have to make trade offs. How I balance that is tracking the way my joy and contentment which is less dramatic is also fulfilling meaningful and sustaining. It counts just as much. ..While I may have lost the peaks of serotonin joy I have found meaningful relationships experienced long term quiet contentment and no longer have the same level of alcohol-induced anxiety about the future. Those also matter and they grow every year. ..
