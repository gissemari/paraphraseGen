I was doing swell too. I relapsed last night. I've written often about my fear of flying. Last night the fear won the battle but I'm in it to win the war.  I have requested a badge reset and I am writing to you guys on the plane instead of drinking. ..Four hours thirty minutes of sober flying to go.....

You got this friend  
Well its not like there is a *good* time to relapse.  When you are facing a fear it is easy to slip back into a habit that numbs the brain and seems to shrink the fear...but it doesn't change anything about you being on the plane.  Kudos to you facing that fear sober and getting on that flight.  ..&amp;#x200B;..My dad was a pilot for a commercial airlines so I grew up flying a lot.  I was fortunate that I was inoculated against the fear of flying from a young age but I still would get a drink or three even last year when I flew.  There isn't much pleasant about the whole experience being packed in with strangers the stale air and food etc. But I can tell you this its much safer than the car ride you are going to take once you land...&amp;#x200B;..On to the next battle in this war.  I will not drink with you today!
