And I gotta be honest the conversations were way more interesting and enjoyable.  Typically when I go to these I'm not thinking clearly and just taking advantage of the "happy feeling". Then it gets to the point where I'm with co workers I don't know that well and I want to drink harder to make me feel more social. I also hate goodbyes (makes me uncomfortable puts attention on me) so end up staying out all night with the stragglers and get wasted causing for a struggling morning. This time around I hung out for a solid hour enjoyed the time spent then got out to head to the gym. Walked out with a clear head no money spent and honestly would be okay doing this again. Will be waking up with no regrets or feel like I missed out at all...IWNDWYT

I've been avoiding our work happy hours but your post gives me a positive perspective! Thank you. I know I will have to go back eventually but I will use my drink ticket on a fun fuzzy drink. Cheers!
