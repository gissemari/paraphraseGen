I had been drinking Kombucha tea fairly regularly but it was escalating to 3-4 bottles a night. Now this stuff has trace amounts of alcohol due to the fermentation but I wasn't getting a buzz of of them so I didn't worry. When I looked at my behavior something was familiar...I realized that I had become complacent at nearly 3 months. That and I secretly wanted a big relapse before I got too far in. I stopped doing my daily readings and started skipping meetings. I also stopped doing the reading that my sponsor has me doing. All of this set up a dangerous situation.....I think the alcohol in the Kombucha (however minute it is) probably triggered my allergy/obsession subconsciously. Combine that with getting lazy about my program and add a few stressful situations: BOOM. I was off to the races...And it sucked. Every minute of it. I thought I'd have a fun relapse and "make this one count". Nope. It was horrible and worse than ever. I've pulled myself out saw the doctor and am going to put my recovery first from now on.

You da man.
The first time I attempted to get sober I did the NA beer thing and was completely baffled when I got drunk. ..I'm an alcoholic. If I consume alcohol there is no telling when I'll be able to stop. I avoid it. Doesn't matter the percentage or how it's packaged. That shit is dangerous and all hell will break lose.
