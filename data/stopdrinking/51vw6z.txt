but it was only a dream. Not a premonition of things to come or a warning of a relapse...just a dream and that's all. I am not my dreams or thoughts...I woke up sober and in my bed...Another day dawns. Life is good.

Oh man thanks for writing this I needed to read it. I just dreamed I drank a pint of Guinness the relief on waking is extraordinary! Have a good one mate.
&gt;but it was only a dream. Not a premonition of things to come..I hope not because I just had the weirdest dream ever.  Something about adderrall sex an ex and a trip to France. I was just at the airport waiting for my luggage when I woke up. Weird. 
I had one the other night and when I woke up I thought I had wine in my mouth. Geez that scared the hell out of me!!
 I had a similar dream last night- I  distinctly remember saying "f**k it" and then downing some whiskey. I woke up glad that it was just a dream.
