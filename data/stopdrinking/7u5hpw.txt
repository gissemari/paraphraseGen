Can you get to a doctor? 
First up stop drinking. Blood isn't a good sign and with the antibiotics in the equation that's not great either...Regroup. Refocus. We're all sending you positive thoughts. Stop drinking get some sleep and start tomorrow as Day 1. You can do this if you put your mind to it. One day at a time.
2nd the doctor recommendation.   Those are concerning symptoms your talking about.  
I can relate. The more my body told me I was on the verge of dying the more afraid I became. The more I feared the more I drank to chase the fear away. At some point I was more afraid of dying than I was of facing what was happening to me. After just a few days off alcohol my liver and kidneys stopped hurting. I am so relieved that I didn't wait until things got any worse. There is lots of good advice around here to help you if you want to stop. 
You're not alone on the bender. Most of us have been there. But since you're having immediate symptoms you may need to take some quick action.  Maybe when you see the doctor talk to him/her about getting some campral or naloxone. And continue to reach out for support either here meetings friends and/or a therapist. No one is an island and it takes a village to stay sober
As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post.
