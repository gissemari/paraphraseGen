I have been struggling with depression alcoholism and drug use for years..I binged last night and am hurting today. I have so much anxiety right now.  Feel like I am having a heart attack...I really could use some SOBER friends...I am going to AA tomorrow and scheduled another appt with my therapist. Tomorrow my new life starts

As folks tell me be glad you made it back. A lot of people dont... Have you tried AA before?
We can't change what's happened in the past we can only learn from it while we focus on the future. Drinking really doesn't help anxiety; give yourself and your body time to recover and take it one day at a time. You got this mate. ;pew
I am in the same boat depression anxieties and an alcohol addiction that increased heavily over the last years...The first month after I quit drinking I suddenly was confronted with all the feelings and problems that I had not dealt with for years. I felt (and still mostly do feel) unprepared to handle them and I just realized the other day that I actually am. I think I have to learn to actually deal with stuff find coping mechanisms beyond the booze. And here's the big surprise: Only one month after my last drink more often than not I feel much more resilient and capable of tackling life. Some of it comes from being much better rested but it turns out if I handle one day after another and don't get caught up in the "bigger picture" I can survive and it (very) slowly keeps getting better. On some days there are periods of time where I just feel in a good mood. It's been a while since that was the case :)..I think what I actually want to say is how surprised I am about how much alcohol increased my anxieties and my depression. ..Good that you have a plan in place I wish you all the best and I will not drink with you tonight!
