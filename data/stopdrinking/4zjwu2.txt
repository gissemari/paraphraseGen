Well I'm back again and my last drink was last sunday night at 11:00 PM.  Before this I was 2/12 months sober.  Attending AA meetings got a grew new job that I almost lost because of my relapse.  My relapse I drank heavily for about a week and a half stayed in hotel rooms and pushed everyone away.  I wasn't ready to face what I knew I had done.  But I'm back have my support group including my parents my boyfriend and my friends.  Everyone is rooting for me and this time I am too.  I'm still feeling fuzzy but its good to be back and just needed to get that out.  I had a good look at what losing everything would look like and I couldn't flee this time.  I had to stay and fight.  I sincerely hope all is well with everyone here.  This is such a great community.

Glad you're back here! Sounds like you went into isolation..I used to do that (hotels and all) just to be alone which in hindsight was probably the worst thing I could have done. But now you've got a great support system and we'll be here for you as well! So please keep posting let us know how you're doing :).
