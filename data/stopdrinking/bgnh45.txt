It's way more than 50 but this has to stop. I'm tired to feeling like crap the dry heaving every morning the struggle to get going. I had a week off in February and I barely remember any of it. I lost 30 lbs last year and gained all of it back since Christmas. Sports used to be my life and now I barely walk around the neighbourhood. ..I have a lot going for me a fantastic career great friends and colleagues decent income live in a beautiful area and every day I go home and pour a drink. On weekends I get out socialize go hiking but all I can think about is getting home asap so I can crack the wine open. I live alone so I am accountable to no one and no one knows how bad it really is. ..Because of my work I usually spend up to 6 months a year away from home and during that time I barely drink but that's mostly because we have no access to alcohol. Since my week off I have tried 4 times to quit making it 4 days 5 days 4 days and 3 days always starting on a Monday. That is the longest I have been able to stay away from drinking on my own will power since 2005. ..This has to end.

I noticed a while back that each time I relapse after practising sobriety it gets a little worse each time but once I get on the sober train it gets a bit easier. I don't know if you see a progression like that at all but for me the disease is progressive: It's to a every day black out and drive blasted to the liquor store because it isn't enough level. Practising sobriety has gotten better though too (maybe because it's really a dire situation now?) Like all my previous attempts taught me tricks and coping mechanisms and gave me insights into my behaviour and so on. It's hard to describe. I guess what I am saying is that those successes you had in the past aren't lost. I guess I am also just trying to warn you of my own experience of how each time I fell off it's been more and more dangerous. I don't know what I am saying. I won't drink with you today. We can do this.
.I am glad you posted but concerned about your history of arm-wrestling with alcohol. I saw a doctor and was honest about my drinking unless of course you are not ready to stop. There is help if you want it. I saw a professional addiction counselor who nudged me onto the road to recovery. AA meetings put me in touch with people who understood. ..I learned all I could about alcoholism and once I accepted that I had this deadly condition I decided to get well. Not to mention that I risked losing custody of my children and a professional career. ..Will power doesn't work but having a support system does. Sobriety is easier and more fun with help. I hope you find what you need instead of going it alone.
