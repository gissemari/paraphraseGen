I don't really know what it is. Usually I'm elated that I've made it this far when I've done this in the past. The fourth/fifth days are the days I finally start feeling like myself again and it just fills me with excitement because I get to start doing the things I enjoy again. Actually every time I've done this I've felt that way.. So why is this time different? I've been getting sleep finally have my appetite back (sort of) but I'm so lethargic...I think it might have to do with the fact that the last few times I was convinced it was over I wasn't going to ever touch alcohol again and so once I started feeling better I was elated to just jump right back into life. Maybe this time is different because my setting hasn't changed all that much. I cleaned up my room and hung some decorations and did a bunch of laundry and have been taking the steps of self care to change my environment for positive change but it just feels like I'm closer to slipping than I was the times before...Like---yeah sobriety is great and all---and is what I want but why don't I feel like it's not possible for me this time? Like this last slip was the final slip and now I'm just doomed to a cycle of trying to stay sober failing getting up trying again failing etc.. ..Just having a hard time staying positive about it. Just a day a moment at a time. It'd just be nice to wake up knowing I didn't drink before and feel that pride again. That happiness that I'd done what I thought was impossible. Again. Maybe it's just that I'm sure it's possible now for me because I've done it a few times so I'm not super pumped about my road to sobriety as I usually am in the beginning...That just sucks. Meh. ..Thanks.

It's the same for me. Also fighting this feeling that I kind of could drink because my sticking to my sobriety hasn't stopped me from quitting drinking before if that makes sense...What I was hoping this means though is that we may not be as excited but we are more aware. ..
I'm right here with you on day 6.  I am glad you shared.  I am just taking it for today and really trying to look at the bright side and all the benefits I'm getting and all the money I'm saving.  Already $105.  I won't drink with you today.
