I had the absolute worst night terror last night. Lucid dream that someone was breaking into my place and they were over me + out in my patio space. A double hitter because 1 terror wouldn't be enough. ..I know that I struggled in my waking life to be vocal and could not. This has only happened to me once in the last 8 years. Tonight was the second night...They  are all the same. I struggle to use my voice..This must be common. I have been drinking for so long- and have never not had a drink  for 60 days since I was a teen...Others have experienced this I'm sure....I was shaken up all day at work unable to do work. ..How do you all cope with this?... these hard parts?

I had the same thing happen not too long ago! I even posted here about it I think. For me it was also absolutely terrifying I was so scared of it happening again but it has not happened to me since that night. I hope it was a one time deal for you too!
