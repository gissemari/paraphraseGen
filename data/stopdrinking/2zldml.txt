there's really no excuse or anything i was very silly and embarrassing and keep having cringe filled flashbacks of me thinking that I'm awesome and hilarious however I'm pretty sure that i didn't actually do anything really bad or upset anyone so at least that's something although it could have easily have gone in a very dark direction fast. here's do another first day... i will not drink today

Welcome back..D you know what made you decide to drink?  Plan on doing anything different this time?
Glad you made it back; some don't. There's more to getting well than simply not drinking. I gained insight and perspective as well as learning sober living skills by having a therapist and going to AA. 
Thank you for your honesty and good job getting back up....You helped me not drink today thank you.
And then wake up tomorrow and say you won't drink that day too :) You got this. ..Last time my mom's partner relapsed she drove and didn't remember doing it. She could have killed someone. She could have even caused an accident and left the scene without a clue that it happened. That hit home for her. She hasn't had a drink since. If not for you for others you know? Also nice username.
