I guess this is gonna be the first post of many here constantly checking in. Planning to go to an AA meeting this Friday but I've put it off so many times because I'm deathly terrified...But my nose and cheeks might end up being permanently red now so I can't keep lying to myself that I can keep myself in check with no support net. What are the meetings like? Do I have to talk or can I just lurk for the first couple?..Planning on going to the doctor for a checkup on things like liver damage on Friday as well and to see if I can get a prescription of Naltrexone for if/when I continue to relapse over weekends...Do you guys have any special advice for the beginning?

Here's a couple of links that might help:..[What to expect at my first AA meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/)..[Your first AA meeting: An Unofficial Guide](http://www.bma-wellness.com/papers/First_AA_Meeting.html)..Both nabbed from the sidebar of r/alcoholism.....Good on ya for taking the bull by the horns and especially for seeing a doctor!..Don't worry about being scared it's [quite normal!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=scared&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)..Just take things One Day At A Time you'll be fine!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Remember every single person in an AA meeting once went to their first meeting and they were all terrified just like you.  I was definitely terrified.  Took me months....years to work up the courage to go in.  I used to walk by the meeting just to "check it out" in case the mood should strike and I'd actually want to go in. ..Also it helped me to know that not a single person went into their first meeting because their lives were good and they were happy....no one goes to AA cause they're on a winning streak.  Everyone there will understand why you're there because they were there once too...You can do it.  My life literally started getting better from the day I went into my first meeting....and I didn't stop drinking for several months after either.  Just going to meetings and listening helped me even if I wasn't ready to stop drinking yet.  That's totally okay.
I was scared too I can't tell you the number of times I looked up meetings in my area and just couldn't work up the courage to go. I went to my first on Sunday and I've gone every day since. They don't make you talk too much. They'll ask if there are people who are attending their 1st 2nd or 3rd meeting or if there are people who are in the first 30 days of their sobriety you raise your hand and say your first name. They then ask folks who are willing to provide their phone numbers for new folks to write them down and you get those and a packet of intro/welcome materials. Depending on the meeting you might read a chapter from the 12 steps or other AA literature or someone might be the sort of guest speaker (there might be other themes/structures but I haven't been to them yet). There is always a chance for people to share or talk about what was discussed but it isn't required...My first meeting everyone was really happy to have me there and very supportive. I've found it's helped with my feelings of isolation around my drinking and other issues. ..If AA doesn't end up being the right fit for you for whatever reason I know there are other recovery groups like SMART that could resonate with you more. ..In terms of advice for beginning simply go. Shake hands with the people that introduce themselves. Be open to what is there take what you need leave the rest. Remember everyone there has been where you are now. ..IWNDWYT
Being scared is completely normal but don't worry it is not that big a deal. I'll guarantee you'll chuckle once you've gone and you realize that there was nothing to be scared about. The important thing is that you are getting help and taking steps to better yourself. The people there only want to help you let them. IWDWYT.
