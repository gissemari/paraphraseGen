...and I just feel so down and alone. It's very grey where I live and the seasonal depression has been a struggle each year. I wear goofy looking light goggles to help but I'm finding it hard to stay on top of my moods. I had an appointment with my counsellor today and she canceled because she was sick. Until that moment I didn't realize how badly I had been relying on that hour of support. I'm trying to finish my last term paper but I feel heavy and foggy and just a lump in my throat and ache in my heart. I think I'm being haunted by the ghosts of Christmas past and they are a troupe of depressed and drunken fools. I'm posting in attempts to turn this day around.I know I can do it but it just feels like an impossible labour. How do you guys deal with winter blues?

Today I went for a run. I saw an owl. I have never seen an owl before. I am glad I spent some time in nature today it always makes me feel grounded.
Honestly I have no idea- my seasonal depression right now is kicking my ass. Just wanted to say that you're very much not alone and that I related to every word of this post. Keep hanging in there!
I like the bike riding when its not too windy the Christmas lights the movies and my AA fellowship.  That's how I do gray winter days.
