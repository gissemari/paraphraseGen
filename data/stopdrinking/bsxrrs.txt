I haven't posted here for a while because I've been off and on. But something has been bothering me all the way from seemingly harmless alcohol placement in comedies to extreme  Ale  drinking in Game Of Thrones...Here's the thing nearly all my favorite celebrities or comedians have quit drinking or had before they died...My point is this is a lie. No athlete drinks a lot if they want to perform well. Every comedian that has had jokes about drinking in their act has stopped and continue to be funny (Dave Attell was eye opening). Yet the media and just about every platform of entertainment I am aware of act as though drinking a lot equals success or strength or a good sense of humor...I want you all to know who struggle like I do that's simply not true. There is no science that equates being able to hold your liquor with success or strength. You aren't funnier with alcohol. You aren't! You aren't smarter with it. You don't need it and you sure as shit don't want it...I will not drink with you today!

I'm a runner. Drinking stopped me from being able to run.  I'm sobriety I was able to run again.
i recently started paying attention to the huge role that alcohol plays in the media from news to comedy drama tv movies ads magazines everything and it was eye-opening. good luck and IWNDWYT!
In order for me to continue to play team sports (soccer) into my 40's at a level that I expect of myself I had to remove alcohol from the equation.
I've done stereotypically 'manly' stuff- team sports college frat army infantry criminal law. Alcohol was part of the culture. It was terrible and destructive but part and parcel to it. I wish I'd known better.
