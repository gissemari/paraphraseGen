I was the only one not drinking and though a couple people asked about it they weren't jerks about it. One person I'm sure only noticed because by the time a toast was made I had a soda can and everyone else partook in some bottle of booze that tasted bad to me even when I drank. .  I love these people but by the end of the night I was bored and wanting to talk to friends that weren't there. I guess I still need to work on trying to be present but I'm happy to know I can be around drinking without having a relapse. For now anyway ... I'll make some plans for stressful times to come. ..  Thank you to everyone here and a shoutout to those who reminds us to  play the tape forward' that was a helpful reminder I pulled up for myself plus I know my kids didn't need two hungover parents today.     ..  Have Monday to kick Tuesdays ass people. .IWNDWYT

IWNDWYT!
It feels so good to wake up the next morning and know that you successfully dodged a bullet. Love that. Well done!
Thank you!  Honestly I think I'm more relieved to know that the people I surround myself with are indeed not assholes since they didn't bat an eyelash at my abstaining. I'm sure it helps that I'm not a party pooper.
