Dog gone it. Relapsed last night. A beer in the car listening to the news as I did not want to go inside and deal with my toddlers (long day exhausted daughter was in hospital last night with a high fever... just exhaustion)...So I found another trigger- being tired not yawn tired- overtired. ..So I shall just get some rest -- BETTER rest when I can. ..I am determined to beat this bastard (drinking alcohol)...7 days it was- reset the counter. ..IWNDWYT

Keep at it. I have stopped and started and stopped again....i just keep using this site and getting through 1 day at a time! 
I was just texting with a friend about how weird and counter-intuitive it is that tired can be such a trigger.   Like why don't we just crave sleep?  Or maybe we do and they are connected.   Anyhoo back at it.  iwndwyt
And now you know about that trigger so forewarned is forearmed! You'll do it this time ! IWNDWYT
