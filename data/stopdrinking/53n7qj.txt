When I was drinking I used to think my dramas were serious and how could anyone have a life as hard as mine. What a fuckwit I can be...I met a homeless guy today and had a quick chat. It's cold where I am and this guy has to endure that on his own. He can't sleep at night because there is violence around him. He should be receiving money from the government but they make him wait so he has to beg on the streets. THAT is drama. ..My problems are nothing to the problems some people have to endure. And all the while I treat myself like I'm the center of the universe. Not good enough not anymore. ..So tonight I want to send a big warm hug to those who are really struggling. I hope you're safe and I hope you remember that you can come here for support. ....

yeah nothing like actual problems to drag us out of self-pity!
