I'm having trouble taking the first step and am reaching out to this subreddit for some inspiration and motivation. Whenever I make the decision to stop drinking it always ends up being "I'll start next week" or "I'll just drink what I have left in the fridge and not buy any more". I'm struggling to put my foot down and actually start doing this thing for real despite a couple of short-lived spontaneous dry spells that never last. ..If you guys would be willing to share personal stories of how you took the first step to sobriety I would really like to read about it. Also if you have any advice for someone in my position I feel like I really need it. Thanks.

I read this sub recognize myself in too many stories. The one that struck me was a guy having a round of convenience store so that clerks didn't think he was an alcoholic. Later I realize that I lot of people did that...I could even recognize myself in the worst stories because the minding behind the drinking was the same...Don't hesitate to share your own story you will be amazed of the amount of people who did just as you did. The support here is incredible.
I told everyone I was quitting because I was doing an elimination diet to see if something I was eating/drinking was causing eczema. But I wanted to quit because I felt like shit all the time. I was tired my stomach was a mess I was staying up too late to have that one (really 4 or 5) last glass of wine. My depression was getting worse - although it hasn't improved one iota since quitting so.... I just couldn't deal with drinking any more. I didn't like how I felt I didn't like who I was becoming so I stopped. I found this sub and it's been fantastic. I didn't have some awful rock-bottom story. I just decided enough was enough. 
I was always going to quit tomorrow. I could always do a few days but that would be it. ..One day I woke up hungover at like 5:45am and felt really sick so I called off of work for the third time that month or something and went to get a cider. I was laying in bed watching something on TV drinking cider while feeling crushing shame and guilt. ..I finished the cider and got up to get another one but then I just looked at the empty can and thought "I need to stop this shit" and fell back asleep. ..I counted the next as my day one and wrote this in my journal:.."Called off work on Tuesday. I have to stop doing that. Didn't drink on Tuesday except one in the morning then fell asleep. Reset my badge on Reddit going to try and take this seriously again and get some serious days together. It only gets better from here."..I had no plan and essentially just decided that I was done and I haven't drank since.
I got to the point of really having no other choice. It became fairly obvious that most of my problems in life were caused by me + alcohol. I only ever drank in excess I drank alone constantly I isolated from people I care about. I began to heave negative consequences to my health from drinking and I came to the realization that my drinking would eventually kill me. ..It became fairly obvious that drinking was going to continue fucking my life up until I died alone miserable and drunk. Along the way it was going to make a lot of people I cared about really sad and hurt. I saw the way this story was going to end and I just didn't care. I thought I had no other choice. I couldn't even imagine what life would be like without alcohol...I have no illusions about life being completely wonderful without drinking. I think about drinking a lot and even on my best days sober I wish that I could drink without consequences. I wish that there was some pill to take to make me not an alcoholic that I could just drink normally. Unfortunately there isn't so I'm left with two choices; be an active alcoholic and spend the rest of my days miserable and alone until I inevitably drink myself into an early grave or live life sober and make the best I can out of the time I have left. ..I got to the point where the costs of continuing drinking massively outweighed any perceived benefits.
I decided to moderate my drinking in 2012. 5 years later I had proved to myself without a shadow of a doubt that I could not do it...I decided to stop drinking 2 weeks ago. I want to change my life and I am the only person that can do it. But I know I need support and that I cannot do it alone. This sub is my lifeline.
Oh ***later***... it was always "I'll deal with it *later*." ..Well "later" happened when I turned yellow with jaundice and was incredibly sick from alcoholic hepatitis. I thought I had a few decades left before my health would be compromised but (at 34) my liver said "NOPE!" ..There's always a reason to drink if you keep looking for one. I could turn any Tuesday morning into a fantastic reason to have mimosas. It takes a long time to break those habits and change your thinking. Find different "rewards" for when you'd normally justify a drink. I chose Red Vines instead of shots of vodka. ..*This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace is the book that gets the most recommendation around here. It's a quick read and it did help me change my views on alcohol. It's free in the side bar -----&gt; There is a list of other good books over there too. I've been using my library card so much since I went dry. :) ..The most important piece of advice I can give is: **give it time**. It's totally cliche but "one day a time" is a saying for a very real reason. ..It gets better *way* better. I've found happiness for the first time in my adult life. It wasn't my marriage my son or any of my things that brought happiness into my life... it was sobriety. I could not be more grateful. I hope you can feel this good as well. Stay strong! I will not drink with you. 
I dont drink on a regular basis but when i do drink i overdo it lose my memory spend a day wasted being hungover and feel ashamed of what i may have done or said. The amount of times I've blacked out in the last year made me realize that its time to stop. I quit buying alcohol for home and reserved for social events only. The problem i still over did it but in public with friends co-workers etc. I decided 12 days ago i need to give it up 100%. I miss going out for drinks trying new beers and that feeling when the alcohol kicks in but i hope that with time it gets easier. I hope there comes a day where i no longer need to reward myself for not drinking. Good luck. 
I didn't really make the decision..I had decided that I was going to either end my life or die drunk somehow...I missed thanksgiving with my family and for *some unknown reason* didn't stop to grab a bottle before driving down..The withdrawals got really ugly..I hallucinated and freaked after not sleeping for a couple of days. Was taken to the ER nothing they could really do besides IV fluids. ..Came to literally in a padded room wearing a straight jacket..I finally admitted to my Dad I had a drinking problem when faced with staying in the mental ward...I was 31. Am now approaching 50 have not gone back.
I'm on Day One but for me it is having constant gastritis.  I just can't do this any more.  I hate to think what I've done to my digestive tract.
