**EDIT:  Some pretty awesome comments on here folks!  Part of me wants to respond to every single comment here.  I hope you realize how much your comments probably mean to so so many people who are just lurking and reading!  All of you people who are taking the time to post something here should be very proud of yourselves.  This is the kind of stuff that makes /r/stopdrinking the best place on the internet.**..I want a big thread.  One that will be talked about in the annals of Reddit for years to come.  The kind of thread that one day when your grandchild talks about it you can proudly say you were one of the original posters.......I also want to see the power of support and grattitude.  Therefore here is what I am challenging **all of /r/stopdrinking to do:**.. - take a minute and think about a post or comment that you have seen today this week this month or this year;.. - take another minute and type a quick shout out to that poster to let him or her know they touched you in a positive way and helped you... - When you thank them type their complete user name so maybe just maybe they will see it and it will be a little something that makes their day... - **Here is the twist - We can all thank the Coolcrosbys VictoriaElaines Ketojams Offtherocks (well maybe not OTR :) ).  But lets not do that.  Lets thank the folks who have been on here and may not always post a lot.  The ones who may have just posted once or twice and figured "well no one really cares about me or hears my voice."  Or maybe the poster that was important to you for a while but seems to have dropped off the face of the earth.  Maybe he or she is struggling lurking and afraid to come back.**..I am going to go first below because well It's my thread dammit!  :)
----------immediate responses--------

/u/silverpound for encouraging me to stay sober on vacation with the immortal words  " sober as fuck"! I repeat that phrase to myself when I am tempted and it has become my mantra! Hugs to you!
/u/shaking-and-scared posted about a week ago.  She was just in her first few days and her husband was drinking around her.  Her openness and honesty in her early posts were very powerful to me.  I haven't seen her in the last several days I truly hope she is ok.  If she isn't I hope she knows she has friends here.
/u/pretendingtobenormal posted this a while agolove it to bits and so well put:.."I was terrified when I first stopped drinking. I was a high functioning alcoholic (whatever that means) but I had no idea how was I going to survive without my indispensable crutch/best friend. Still it was obvious that I would die if I didn't get sober so I really had no choice. So I went to AA forced myself to make some sober friends and avoided drinking events and other triggers that whole first year. I busied myself with work meetings exercise and movies. Over time I began to notice something - life was profoundly more nuanced and colorful than I ever imagined. I missed out on so many subtle miracles while I was out there chasing the perfect buzz. My former best friend had been lying to me all along. Now the crude rush of any chemical euphoria is laughably inadequate compared to the infinite flavors swirling all around me."..Edit: Read your post wrong Nika anyways still love this comment so wth.
/u/SoberApok I wanted to thank you for giving me the idea to quit immediately instead of waiting until the 26th. If I did not stop on December 15th I probably just would have kept drinking. Thank you for opening up my eyes and giving me the determination to start NOW.
Hey /u/Islipped91 its time to run another 5k!
Shout out to /u/jmelina for going to her second meeting yesterday!  Recognizing that there is more to recovery than just not drinking is vital!
I am going to do a 2nd one (no rules on the amount you can post here) and add a shout out to /u/inextremus who is struggling today.  I really admired his approach of getting through this rough challenge to him one minute at a time and also heading out to a support group.  Thanks!
/u/tractorguy and /u/Slipacre..A week ago these guys posted in a thread here in this sub. I glanced at their posts and they really resonated with me. Why? Because they have been sober for 28 years. That's longer than I have lived here on this pale blue dot...28 years and still they feel the need to be an active member in this community helping others and remembering themselves how fragile the ice is where they're walking on. Being sober is not something you do once and that's it - it's a lifelong mission...Being sober for one month has been one of the greatest things I've done in the past ten years so I can only imagine how good these guys must feel. Rock on and thank you for being with us!
I want to send a huge shout out to /u/Batman_2099 for the Daily Tao posts and insights.  His effort has become a huge part of my morning routine.
/u/_Kasha_ welcomed me warmly when I first come round these parts back in August. She was just a few weeks sober at that point and much of what she said (on my posts on others') really resonated with me. Thank you /u/_Kasha_ for helping make me feel welcome and among friends!
I feel kind of bad singling people out because everyone in this community is amazing but I can't give up a chance to shout of two of the people in the SD universe who have helped me the most. ../u/saltwatermonkey I've told you (and all of SD) this 1000 times already but [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/37nitn/hey_numbnuts_the_advice_that_makes_you_angry_and/) was defining in my early days of sobriety and I thank you so much! Calling people magnificent humans makes me laugh every single time. ../u/ninjilla you are so freaking awesome. Your thoughtful responses to people (and me of course) don't go unnoticed. You are a superstar. Meeting you IRL was one of the highlights of my trip! You are amazing!..I love this idea!.
/u/boggles.*"I didn't stop drinking to stop drinking. I stopped drinking to start doing."*..This has really helped me out this last week. Thanks. .
Shoutout to u/Nika65 for the [Holiday Offer for YOU...](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3vo2ck/a_holiday_offer_for_you/). Imagining such a small action making such a huge difference to someone who is isolated alone and struggling is awe-inspiring.    ..I give credit to u/mare_nectaris for her [three things mindfulness comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wsf8w/i_need_new_mindfulness_exercises_and_new_means_of/cxysplr). I sort of did it anyway but seeing it structured as a philosophical exercise was very powerful. It takes you out of your brain. And try to do this at random times.      ..u/SoberApok is awesome on his own but his rum cake saga. It's provided me some chuckles on long evenings waiting for the day to end so as to provide another tick mark. 
The ones that really resonate with me are by [deleted]..they are the ones I say "oh shit"  and remember the times I just wanted to curl up and if not die - just have the world tiptoe away from me...Hey folks - we've seen just about everything - we are not shocked - and probably did the same or worse - and some were along the way we learned **feelings are not facts**  and **that by not drinking today we didn't makes things worse than they already were**..so fuck shame keep on posting....
/u/Kilayo for always providing input and support to /r/SDBookClub. /u/bigndfan175 for revving up support for the bookclub as well. Also /u/notgonnabemydad for letting me bake them cookies! 
I've been looking up to /u/McLensky since I got here. Not like a stalker but a familiar name in a big crowd.
/u/ZenosTarget We seem like we have a lot in common and we started this at about the same time every comment you made on my post and every post you made I was able to relate to and learn from. ../u/MrBenzito You were also new here when I first hopped on board the sobriety train I learned from the posts you made and still hope you're doing well. If you're out there I am struggling at times too but always here if you want to chat. ../u/ninjilla and /u/shineonme4ever you have both helped me tremendously and I am so thankful you are here and such amazing people. I really can not thank you both enough for all the help encouragement advice and kind words. You are both 10/10 in my book. 
This is funny  /u/themonkeyguy because your next post where you came back and said you were stopping NOW instead of waiting till the 26th is one of my favorites.  You read something here listened and changed your mind.  This is huge!  A lot of people looking for recovery ask "what can I do to make it stop" but are not necessarily willing to do things differently.  You did and that is inspiring!  "Sobriety is not for those who want it or those who need it.  It's for those who do it".  -some old hippy dude in a meeting.
/u/Cutty_McStabby Thank you for commenting on my very first post 237 days ago.  Your comment really stuck with me if only for the fact that it gave me tremendous comfort to know that I wasn't any sort of special snowflake and that other people had experiences that mirrored mine pretty spot on.  And that they came through those experiences alive well and sober.../u/cake_or_radish Thank you for hosting WuW from the time I joined until I took it over.  It was a great tool to sit down and analyze my actions/feelings as I was working on becoming sober.  And the extra care they gave in telling me to check back in next week if I was particularly struggling was really appreciated.../u/embryonic_journey You are such a positive and active poster on /r/stopdrinking.  I see you cheering people on all the friggin time and I have been one of those people you have cheered.  It makes me glad to see you happily participate in so many of the threads here.
I want to add to this but I love you all so much! I hope this doesn't get deleted for not following the rules but you guys have saved me more than words can say! Oh and Nika65 I got a 30 day coin yesterday at my new AA group! 
/u/coolcrosby shout out to the baby steps. It has helped me stay focused in these early days. I don't post much but always appreciate the effort coolcrosby puts in making newcomers feel welcome.
/u/introitus recent relapse story really had an effect sounds really awful thanks for posting it I've read it a few times.   Hope you feel better.../u/msdrinkynomore Thanks for replying to my first post and suggesting I do the check-ins I think that the checkin helps me the most.  I try to suggest it to new people when they arrive now.  
/u/_LB_ when we were both newly sober and I was struggling with relapse you were struggling with depression. I felt so bad for you and realized how lucky I was that my main problem was that I was a drunk. You would always stop to help me and give me encouragement even though you were in a bad spot. Your loving kindness helped me immeasurably in staying sober. What a special gal you are!
/u/kissinthebottle always has honest and often funny accounts of her journey. I look forward to seeing them. /u/deedeethecat is always supportive and welcoming.
2 people stand out from my first couple of posts (other than the ones Nika65 mentioned in the writeup who amazingly seem to have touched damn near everyone here): /u/Barnaby_Fuckin_Jones and /u/pat2469.  ../u/Barnaby_Fuckin_Jones gently and thoughtfully put me in my place a bit in my first post (long since deleted unfortunately) where I was more or less wishing whiskey was a person so that I could stab it in the neck. He helped to redirect my anger to where it belonged (inwards namely). ..And /u/pat2469 was a big jerk who made me tear up a bit by generously offering to drive me to my first meeting.  ..Edit: apparently I don't remember pat2469's username correctly but even if I don't remember his/her name I certainly remember the kind offer that was extended to me.  
A few months ago I started on a fun exercise.  I didn't finish it and I don't think I told anyone about it but maybe I did...I started with a list of about 2 dozen usernames. My goal: write down one nice thing about each person. "I've always admired the way this person..."  Things like that. ..I was gonna post the list here &amp; encourage others to create a similar list. Then I didn't.  
[deleted]
I don't know how to tag people's names sorry!  But I want to thank deedeecat for her honesty and friendliness.

My answer is going to be long....********************************************.Almost a year ago /u/offtherocks posted https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2q98vq/what_would_you_do_with_365_give_future_you_a/..I did this.  Initially I genuinely put a paper dollar in my piggy bank every day but that became problematic overtime so I set up a savings account and transferred $14 biweekly every payday..and I spent the money just a little early and bought myself a new (and much needed) phone replacement and a protective case for it.  Merry Christmas to me.  Thanks Rocks!..***************************************./u/SarahSiddonscooks - My sister-by-another-mister posted this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3s8pje/they_have_no_understanding_you_all_do/  ..This recent post was a telling of hope of reconciliation with family even if it takes a few years...there is still hope that eventually others may see how hard we work to improve ourselves and help others to make amends for the past.  Not only have I been SO blessed to have met Sarah in person which was amazing..but she has been a source of inspiration throughout the past 573 days I've been on /r/stopdrinking.  She commented on my very first post here...and so much has happened since.  Much love...***************************************./u/pollyannapusher posted this 3 months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3jmoxe/you_knows_what_still_blows_my_mind/..Pollyannapusher has been an encouragement a comfort and has made me laugh on many occasions...but this post rang true in many ways.  FEELINGS.  SO MANY FEELINGS in sobriety...and we feel them all the way.  While her post talks about the overwhelming feelings of freedom and joy this is also true for other negative feelings as well...but I'd rather be alive aware and able to feel than to hide in the numbness of drunkenness I used to live in.  This spoke to me.  ..************************************************./u/coolcrosby  - (Ptttb :-P  /u/Nika65...I'm going to mention him anyway)  ..I gave Crobby a real life hug and thanked him face to face for everything after all this time.  He (and Sarah) have become real friends...and our once-in-a-lifetime Meetup will be a memory for a lifetime.  Another person who posted on my first post...and has helped change my world. ..As for noteworthy (and sometimes funny) posts...  /r/stuffcrosbysays has plenty.  Too many to name.  ..*****************************../u/silverbiddy posted this Saturday Share: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3iutpy/one_year_sober_today_all_doors_flung_wide_open/..Biddy has been through some MAJOR crap...and I've watched her growth since joining this subreddit...and always enjoyed her posts.  Keep up the hard work you are amazing!..*************************************../u/md4606 posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3vlida/fate/..MD4606 has been chasing at my heels 20 days before my sobriety date all this time and posts frequently on my milestones...and this "Fate" post spoke to me.  A person dealing with a difficult situation...ready to become a caregiver...and staying sober.  I've done it..it is hard..but it can be done.  Proud of you..keep fighting and health and healing to your father.  ..**********************************************./u/gardenofthoughts posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3slaes/sometimes_my_sobriety_hits_me_right_in_the_feels/..GoT got sober the same week I did and is a beautiful person inside and out.

That is all))
/u/smutsmutsmut for the lovely vacation post. Reminding us all that even when youre offered alcohol  3x+ times doesn't mean you have to give in. Staying in a hotel with the minibar has always been hard for me. So it was so great to see someone working through it all positively. 
I have always loved the post by /u/orangecushion on [People kept saying it would happen...](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/21clkx/people_kept_saying_it_would_happen/). Maybe it was the day I originally read it but it is just loaded with great stuff. 
I just read a post by u/FuckDrinking about The Little Prince. Read that book about 15 years ago and while I loved the sentiment I didn't think that was me. It was and I'm glad I quit!..Edit: great username too!
u/kitteninyournoodle for awesome sharing and honesty and encouragement...u/Soberonce for terrific insight on feeling our feelings sober!..u/opheliakitty for sharing about drinking on the job. This is one I haven't mentioned due to great shame. Its hiding in my head and I need to do something about it someday. Today I was reminded that I am NOT the only person who has done this and that I am a redeemable person. u/opheliakitty helped me realize that there is lots of work to be done. I'm doing well but I'm not there yet...u/BarleyBreakfast for honest sharing about wanting to relapse breaking it down so it was inspiring and accurate. This was a while back. Hope you're still doing well!
I'd like to thank you /u/Nika65 for your post in my thread today. I was talking about how my life felt like it was falling apart and your post gave me hope made me realize I wasn't alone and made me look at things with a different perspective. It really reinforced *why* staying sober during hard times is important. ..Also /u/KetoJam for posting in my first thread and saying you were very glad I was here. Being immediately welcomed with open arms when I'd felt so alone for so long touched me more profoundly than almost anything else in my entire life...Thank you both and this entire sub. From the bottom of my heart.
I would like to recognize /u/wennnichtjetztwann. The post titled How I pictured myself drinking vs. how things actually were really made me think about how I viewed myself whilst consuming. The reality of my alcoholism was in stark contrast to the glamorized way it is usually portrayed in the movies. I would like that 30 pack of Hamms Special Light shaken not stirred please... lol! Secret Agent Stout thanks you kindly for the insight on my behavior!
I want to give a shout out to /u/MamaToFive1971. She posted a few days ago about not being strong enough and I cried when I read it. It brought me back to that struggle and feelings of never being able to go on. I see she is back and I can't help but smile knowing that same fight of never giving up is alive and well of her previous posts and it inspires me.
/u/ladyjane317 .You responded to my first post. I really appreciate it. I was having a pretty bad night; You gave me some hope and peace.  Thank you. :)
/u/NonnyMouse69..&gt; Here is your challenge Sobernauts: Bring a little cheer to someone today. You have blessings in your life...and November is NOT the only time to be thankful. So buy a cup of coffee for the guy in the line behind you. Smile at the woman dealing with her toddler or offer to help someone carry their groceries. You have no idea what is going on in those person's lives...and while you may be struggling with your desire to drink by spending a few minutes brightening the day and improving the life of another human being you make yourself a better person. It is worth it...This is some of the best advice I have received since joining SD. Thank you for this Mouse. The simplest act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life. Any time I get down in the dumps now I try to do something nice for someone else. It is hard not to feel better when you make someone else smile.
/u/sunjim gave me a nice pep talk recently which I really appreciated!
I started seeing /u/Ecalifornica 's posts right when I was coming more active on this thread. I saw her start off very frustrated but wanting to change and seen her grow in strength and momentum over the past month. It has given me strength and determination on my own journey. ..But it is hard to just single out one! This community is so supportive in general!
Along with chiming in on thanking /u/coolcrosby (starting Daily Tao was *his* idea btw) /u/Ketojam and /u/bigndfan there is one person I'd like to single out: /u/-babygiraffe-.  Early in my sobriety I saw her post up one of the first "accountability posts" I'd ever seen.  That's when you give the folks in this sub a heads up on a risky situation you're going to be in.  That inspired me to use that tool as well and it worked like a charm!  Very helpful when I was still very new to sobriety. Haven't seen her around in a while.  Hope all is well with her...I'd also like to give a shout out to /u/offtherocks.  Sometimes you really need some one to be blunt and call a spade a spade.
/u/bigndfan175 for The Daily Buddha which I always love and for some great support not so long ago when I was having Mum trouble.../u/parallelplay this sober mama rules! ../u/HumaneResource for creating the Daily Check-In as we now know it.../u/CoolCrosby for being the first person to answer my 1st post and so many other peoples 1st posts!!..This sub would be a very quiet place without /u/offtherocks outstanding contribution to music and memes!! Speech speech!!../u/kitteninyournoodle I feel like your next door neighbour chatting over the fence with your honest 'this is what it's like for me' posts they always resonate with me!../u/McLensky posted a while back about losing her mojo it was a really thought provoking honest post..For me some other fantastic contributors are ../u/SDstrawburry /u/chinstrap /u/embryonic_journey /u/Flow_Morpheus_Flow /u/gelastic_farceur and too many more to mention. :)..
Everyone here deserves my thanks. There was one time early on I had full intenttion on breaking my sobriety. I was away for the weekend in the city and my husband and I were going to head out for lunch. I was going to have wine. I was definitely going to have wine. I checked in to SD  I thought "talk me out of it". There was a solemn post from /u/standsure about the loss if a friend. It resonated and set me straight. Thank you.
A shoutout to /u/brokennoodle that posted this morning with an apology for posting while drinking yesterday. Taking responsibility for your actions is a huge step forward. You can do this.
I know that we all appreciate /u/slipacre here but I needed to personally call him out for all that he's done for me. For one his prison posts are a highlight of my week that I always look forward to. I know that I will always finish reading with some nugget of wisdom or perspective that I hadn't had before. But I've actually been lucky enough to meet Slip in person as a result of  a strange "coincidence" from his posts- I was telling my mom about one of his posts and she said that she heard the same story in her AA meeting that morning. And the story was told by... Slips partner! ..So anyway he's taken me to one of the best meetings I've been to thus far and PMed me with support and encouragement. Every time he reaches out has been at a point where I desperately needed it and it's made a huge difference in my life so THANK YOU SLIP!!!
I don't always have a lot to contribute on here but there are so many posts and stories that have made me feel less ashamed of not being able to drink...I'll start with /u/jmelina; thank you so so much. On Thanksgiving day I was home alone and very sad. You kept me company and for that I am forever grateful. I keep an eye out for you on here to see if you are still well. ../u/Nika65 the holiday offer was a wonderful gesture. I was surprised not only to find a coin as promised but a very lovely typed note that made me feel more cared for by you and SD than the majority of those in my "real" life have lately. ../u/Eeeelleleee commented with a suggestion in reply to my What's Up Wednesday contribution about a natural aide for depression. I took his advice and have been feeling a bit better. Your advice has given me a break from constantly feeling like I'd rather be dead than get up and face another day...And of course I can't write a gratitude post without mentioning /u/MeinFakeLife! It's been so helpful to make a new friend to discuss not only sobriety but eating better/personal goals/etc. I appreciate your honesty with me the other day. I would be bummed if you disappeared so hang in there! 
/u/FreeFromMorgan reached out to me in the midst of a relapse. That really meant a lot!
For the life of me I can't remember who made this post but "Be the gift" has really stuck with me on my journey. I want to be the best version of me that's what recovery is all about. 
/u/razmataz_90 I hope you are doing well! ..I haven't seen /u/-babygiraffe- around for a while. If you see this you are missed!..
I especially appreciate /u/Slipacre for his way with words. He both entertains and enlightens. 
I want to thank ninjilla for making me feel so special by mentioning me in a comment. Made me all warm and fuzzy!
Just a quick shoutout to /u/SOmuch2learn /u/coolcrosby &amp; yes it may be your thread but you're still getting one /u/Nika65...Everyone on the sub deserves a shoutout but these three are the names which I'm always seeing and offering great advice. If i were wearing a hat id tip it to you guys/gals. 
A shout out to the previous quoter of the day: /u/i_noticed_you !!..I've always liked stuff from these folks too and would like to see more: /u/notthistimedave /u/MoonlightOnVermont /u/urbanrunnner and /u/thatholidayhero...And that's just scratching the surface.
There were several folks who started into sobriety a few months ahead of me. It really helped to have folks whose comments resonated with me.   ./u/roseneath_and_park thanks for everything buddy.  ./u/greatmainewoods hope you're doing well../u/urbanrunner hope you're still plugging along.
Thank you /u/ThreeBlurryDecades for your ["Some helpful tips for newly moderating drinkers."] (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdo62/some_helpful_tips_for_newly_moderating_drinkers). ..A few days before that I posted on here asking if moderation was possible and the overwhelming response was that it wasn't or wasn't worth it. ..Then I saw your post and of course I fell into its trap thinking I found something that I could use to justify having drinks in the future. At first I thought you were mocking me for the post I made a few days before. Then as I finished reading it I realized that I did most of the things you mentioned. Moderation would just become another excuse for me to binge drink. ..Who knows moderation may still be in my future... but not today.  If it ever happens I know to be very careful and cautious. ..Also its only been two weeks without drinking (I pledged to do a month at least) but as I continue feel like more and more I want to make it for good.
