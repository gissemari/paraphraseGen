Good Morning/Afternoon    .Theme: tenacity    ..**"Those who wish to sing always find a song." -Swedish Proverb**    .What I get from it: I reminds me to stay committed to my goals whatever they may be. Also reminds me of my struggle of sobriety in the beginning but I found my sober song and now I'm singing sobriety so to speak.  ..

Ahh I love this! Gonna be reminding myself of this all day especially with your interpretation. Thanks! :)
I bike commuted to work from my house in a inner ring suburb to my office downtown this morning.  It was 30 degrees f.  I froze my butt off but--it was AWESOME.  And it's Spring and it will warm up throughout the day.  That's what the Monday quote means to me.  There is almost always something poet and crazy you can do that is a song of your life--when you're sober.
