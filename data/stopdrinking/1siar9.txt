I tried for the first time to stop drinking last week and made it until Saturday 5 days. I ended up going to a birthday party on Saturday night and although I went in trying not to drink I ended up having several beers. I didn't get black out drunk I let myself and my girlfriend down. ..My girlfriend has backed me 100% but has had too much and she needs some time. We are taking the week off. If I cant do this not only will I end up ruining my life but also will destroy my relationship of 3 years...I don't have a lot of hobbies and am looking for good things to do instead of drink especially on the weekends. Friends and family all drink a lot so I don't even know who I can talk to or spend time with. Also looking for some advice and personal stories to hopefully help the second time the charm...tl;dr Tried to stop drinking for 30 days made it 5 days and relapsed. Looking for help before I ruin relationship and life.

I and many others could not do it alone. AA did it for me. Gave me support people who had been through what I had been through activities etc. Otherwise any kind of physical activity like walking. Build something. Jigsaws. Keep your mind and body active. Stay away from parties and people who drink until you are sure you can handle it (and maybe not then). Just don't drink for the next hour and they will accumulate. 
day 2 going strong! Just read [this post](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/articles/healthy-habits-reduce-dementia-risk-12191.html) on r/science. Feeling good!
