----------immediate responses--------

My dream is to get back into the railroad industry after losing my job to my drinking.
Lose weight so that I am 172 lbs get better at guitar playing not so stressed and overwhelmed at work so I can actually enjoy it again and be the fun dad to my daughter again. Getting there I would not say they are dreams more goals I dream to achieve..
Havent been around much and I am sorry...Still sober. Survived christmas but I am still a scrooge. Met my girlfriends family drank some La Croixs (all hail!). No one said a word to me. I guess it helps that my girl rarely drinks and didnt have anything either.
TRIUMPH: Made it through the XMAS holiday sober for the first time in .... 12 years? ..STRUGGLE: I've been isolating myself lately but have taken small steps into getting myself out more. ..GENERAL: Just signed up at a gym a few days ago and look to lose weight/get healthy. I'm ready to start focusing on my mental/physical health with the same motivation/determination I put into drinking. 
Triumph: When my wife used to go out of town I'd use it as an excuse to get blind drink every night no matter what kind of responsibilities I had the next day(s). For the last 9 months I've been able to be sober by myself and for myself. I don't miss the hangovers or the anxiety (where did I put all the empties???) one bit...Struggle: I'm still failing on the human connection front. I need to reach out to my old friends more and make some new friends. Having young kids shouldn't be my excuse...General: I think I'm going to prioritize daily nature observations in 2017. Doesn't have to be a 3-hour hike but just some small time spent appreciating the natural world as opposed to staring at screens and the manmade world all day.
Triumph: I've accepted that alcohol was ruining my personhood and have for the first time in my life actively chosen to abstain altogether..Struggle: I'm struggling to find community where I live..General: I will transition my career into the field of computer sciences through continued practice and persistent application submissions.
I've only just looked this group up a couple weeks ago mostly just lurked until now. This seems like a decent venue to jump in.    ..When I was a kid my dad drank a lot my mom not so much. They were divorced. I guess my dad drank 6-12 beers a night. When I was in 3rd grade had a little health lesson about drugs and alcohol and were instructed that if we had a parent who smoked or drank we should go home and say "[parent] I wish you would quit [drug]." And I guess it was the only time I ever took homework seriously. I didn't even mean it at the time I just knew I was supposed to say it so socks on the linoleum of my dad's kitchenette as he pulled a Busch Lite out of the fridge I said "dad I wish you wouldn't drink anymore." And then I went back to mom's for the week not knowing that my dad quit cold turkey. For me and the mantra the school gave me. And I was too young to appreciate what that meant.    ..My dad had depression anger issues and had been drinking his entire young adult life. And he stopped just for me. He asked me a few months later as we ate Dairy Queen together if I noticed any difference in him. I hadn't because I was pretty self-absorbed and like 10 years old tops and I just fibbed saying he seemed "nicer". He smiled and told me he'd regained his sweet tooth and ate his ice cream.    ..He died when I was 15 about to start my sophomore year of high school. He went to the hospital under the assumption he'd had a heart attack. I didn't really appreciate the lead-up about three months where he gradually lost his energy losing his breath from making the walk from the front door to the car to go get McDonald's (he'd also lost the energy to cook for the two of us). We will never know what exactly killed him but he died in a weekend.    ..Fast forward to the age of 19 20...I was always a good little boy. Despite having a lesbian mother in my father's memory I started watching Fox News during high school and became a big old church-fan conservative type. Didn't want to have sex until I was married rolled that rule back to "not before I'm 18 anyway"...I was not a partier not a rule breaker ever. But when the girl I lost my virginity to broke up with me six months or so later I was looking for a way to show my devastation to the world. All my friends were smoking and so I bought a pack of Black &amp; Milds and lit up. I got so high off the first hit without even inhaling that I nearly swerved my car off the road.    ..After a year or so of smoking and without the authoritative shadow of my dad hanging over me I went and tried pot which I initially hated and quickly grew to love. And I still love. And I'd like to keep in my life if I can shed my other addictions. But that's not really the issue here.    ..Just before turning 21 I really drank for the first time with a friend. As I smoked tons of pot and went to young-twenty-somethings parties I would drink the occasional beer always bragging to my friends that I didn't drink much because I knew between my father and all four of my grandparents I had a genetic gun pointed at my head. I knew to keep it to one or two. No problem. I like pot better anyway I would say.    ..And one day I ran out of pot. My suppliers were all dry. I scraped for resin trying to stay high--I'd grown attached to not being entirely lucid. Gifted in school and inheriting my dad's depression pot had given me a way to stay operational while still distancing myself from the acute feeling of ya know feelings. And now I was out. Several days out. Scraping resin wasn't working for I was running out and there in the garage where we would get high and watch shows and play Magic the Gathering was a bottle of 151. Well I thought it's not pot but it's something. And I started mixing it with coke.    ..After a couple days I went through the whole bottle. At that age 23 24 whatever it was I was proud of myself. Look at me I'm drinking just like a regular adult! Eventually I got my weed supply reconnected and eased back off the alcohol...but now alcohol was a new part of my diet a new option at the ready.    ..Then in 2011 I took a retail job at a gas station. Four Loko was a popular talking point as the caffeine had recently been removed but it was still the most potent tallboy on the market. When I ran out of weed Loko was always there as I was clocking out of work. I would drink one one and a half of them...I'd never make it to the end of two. Then at some point weed or not I was working third shifts coming home when all my friends and family were going to work and so I would pick up a couple Lokos and drink myself to sleep after work. I'd be out by 9am usually.  Then wake up at 10p and get to work 5 minutes late.    ..And it gets kinda blurry after that. Me my depression and my addictions to nicotine alcohol and cannabis were with my girlfriend for several years. She left. Not really because of any one element like the alcohol. She had an eating disorder and a history of trauma and in her recovery my depression and self-destructive tendencies were not a good influence...plus she wanted to move and I didn't and...anyway she left.    ..I've been drinking every day for about seven years I guess maybe six and change and of course the smoking cigarettes has been with me even longer. There was a 3-month-or-so period when I was on Wellbutrin and I stopped drinking out of a legitimate fear that it could kill me and I was really healthier and happier during that time refusing drinks committing to it...but eventually I would drink up to two beers per day again which was enough not to fuck with the medicine. When I went off Wellbutrin for lots of boring reasons the floodgates were opened and I got back to it.    ..After my girlfriend left I had a year of drinking less losing weight going to the gym...but my attempts to date with modern dating apps and stuff bred into me an anxiety about dating. And an anxiety about dating led to being lonely which led to a serious uptick in drinking back up to at least a 6-pack per day. Then of course drinking every night and having a hard time taking care of myself I never went out never socialized which compounded the loneliness further and the cycle continued.    ..And I guess that's where I'm at. At least a six pack per evening. I'm wasting money putting on needless abdominal mass forgetting half my waking days shutting myself in and failing to keep my house and hygiene clean. I know on a logical level everything that's wrong how much better it would be if I could quit and that quitting is on a technical level as easy as stopping and not doing it again.    ..I don't really want to quit. Not entirely. Everyone wants to fit that model of a socially acceptable drink-friendly person. That person who doesn't drink alone or maybe even at home but can enjoy a beverage at a bar or restaurant with friends or family. That's what I want. But every day the habit is so ingrained. Heading home after work? Don't forget to get that beer or else you won't have beer.    ..I just want to be healthy and lucid (enough). I want to be like I was when I was a big stoner at least...able to say no to alcohol or enjoy it in moderation. Where the worst vice in my life was cigarettes. Instead cigarettes make me want to drink drinking makes me want to smoke and I can feel my youth slipping away my aging body less able to fend off all this abuse as I approach 30.    ..I don't expect a simple solution in these comments. I'd be happy just to know that anyone read my long blurb. If anyone has any support or advice they'd like to share if anyone can relate to my situation I'd appreciate it.    ..I'm sure there may be some typographical problems in my comment. It was too long for me to go back and proofread. 
**Triumph:** A sober Christmas...**Struggle:** I took my kids swimming yesterday. My ears are playing up today as a result...**General:** 2017 is going to be the year where I sort my finances out. 
Triumph:  Accepting the fact that I am not capable of being a social drinker or a "moderate drinker. Being honest with myself and reaching out to resources to get the help I need.  Settling into my new city finding decent employment..Struggles: currently dealing with medical issues that are making me incredibly lethargic.  Hard to do anything besides get out of bed to go to work and even that is a struggle right now.  .Dreams for 2017:  go back to school and get myself into a career that pays better.  I am capable I just need to put the time in.  I would also like to focus more on getting involved in activities that don't involve alcohol and maybe get me back to my pre drinking weight! 
Triumph: everyday is a new record for me...I have been accomplishing more at work and at home. ..Challenge: I am learning to accept I am occasionally having bad days emotionally that I need to just accept as a bad day and ride it out. Not easy though. ..General: feeling optimistic and energized.  And wheezy...been kicking up a lot of dust in the basement organizing and cleaning lol
My triump is getting back into my workouts. I know only drank heavily on weekends but I didn't realize that it was taking me the whole next week to recover; my energy was zapped that bloat stuck around for days. And now after just a week skipping the weekend booze I feel so much better! So I will not drink today and will keep not drinking. It just feels too good to go back!
**Triumph:** I didn't have a single drink at Christmas and am staying resolute about my new years plans which are just staying in to avoid any temptation.  ..**Struggle:** My SO and I are forced into a long distance relationship at the moment. It's never easy but recently my anxiety about it is getting worse :( ..**General:** I'm finally getting back on track with my studying and will soon be getting a gym membership so I can get on a good fitness schedule too! 
Triumph-New sponsor started working steps from begining again...survived the crash and didn't drink or kill myself.Struggle-not regretting the past...not shutting the door on it.General-suit up and show up do todays work now let tomorrows worry about itself and yesterdays be a page in the ledger.
Triumph: Every time I move my body and change a thought and DON'T pour a glass of wine is a triumph..Struggle: I know I have to work hard every day to "move my body change my thought" when I think "Well I don't think I can finish this task without wine.".In 2017 I want to be sober sugar-free and fully present. And I want to have fun.
**Triumph:** I made it through yesterday ..**Struggle:** I'm worried about Friday night I'm planning now..**General:** I'm going to be a nicer person today 
Triumph: I had a sober Christmas for the first time in forever! And made it through the additional past two days off...Struggle: Preparing for the new year makes me reflect on this past year. I can't believe I spent the first half of the year so drunk. So many ridiculous cringe inducing things happened because of my drinking. I wish I could just erase most of the first 6 months of 2016 from my memory...General: My dream for 2017 is to finally get into shape and kick my bad eating habits. I have never in my life been fit I was a chubby kid who became an obese teenager who became an overweight adult. I've lost some weight by not drinking and it's a good start. I want to feel what it's like to be really healthy and lean for once in my life. 
Triumph: going skiing with my dad today completely sober. This time last year my spouse parents and friends all watched from the sidelines as I went of the rails. Now we both get to genuinely enjoy this time together and I'm free from that tortured existence...Struggle: getting my ski boots on...General: remembering a Viktor Frankl quote that was something like "Between every stimulus and response there's a space. In that space you have a choice. In that choice one finds freedom and opportunity in this world."..I won't drink with you today!
3 weeks woo! I won't drink today.
Triumph:  Made it through the holidays without drinking.  Had a bit of temptation on Xmas eve as the family was doing shots after dinner but I just had me some iced tea and enjoyed myself. ..Struggle: Saving money the wife and I want to get a house so we need to start saving money problem is it's the wife's 30th bday this year and we've been talking about doing universal studios for it.  The more I think about it the more I realize it's going to cost a lot.  hotels airfare ticket prices food all that stuff adds up too damn quick. ..General:  My dream for 2017 is to find a nice little house for the wife and I to settle into.  I want to move up the ranks at my job (which hopefully will happen in the next couple of months).
Triumph: I have been sober for 8 days and got through Christmas..Struggle: I struggle with anxiety issues but being sober will definitely help with that..General:I want to stop drinking and get in shape.
Triumph: 4 days sober.Struggle: some dark depression and high anxiety..General: get out of a dead end job and into something I like.
**Triumph:** My mom visited over the holidays for the first time in many years. We had a great time...**Struggle:** SUGAR. I'll eat sweets and candy almost compulsively obsessively. There are times I'll search for the perfect treat that will change my mood and make me happy. I'm still searching...**Dream for '17:** Somehow I will find another 8 hours in the day. I'll still take care of myself still be there for my family still do a good job at work but suddenly I'll get all the other things taken care of and my to-do list will shrink faster than it grows.
Triumph: I made it 365 days with a out a drink. I feel better about myself as a person most days...Struggle: I still don't completely trust myself. I know I will be sober but I still need time to find out who I am again...General: As long as the next few days go ok 2016 has been the best year in a long time for me. Not amazing but a major step up.   
Triumph: Stopping drinking again. Soon 2 months...Struggle: I still struggle on a regular basis but so far I seem to be hanging on. This includes the worst possible season (Christmas in Denmark has alcohol everywhere. Also lots of people enquiring about me not drinking) and making it through that felt damn good...General: Hitting the gym with a vengeance again in 2017. I quit drinking and smoking and am working o living healthier (and picking up cooking). Might as well take the next step onto being healthier. 
Triumph: I made it to day four. I started listening to the 30 Day Sobriety Solution (after feeling like all that stuff was nonsense) and I'm giving it my 100% this time. Drinking is not an option...Struggle: I am eating EVERYTHING in sight. I mean things I don't even like I'm consuming. I was hoping to lose weight after cutting out the 800+ calories of wine every night but I make up for it in the weirdest shit!..General: My dream for 2017 is to watch more movies write more spend more time with my kids and start the podcast I have been planning for years now but was always so drunk to actually do it. 
Triumph: Enjoying a sober vacation with my family for the holidays..Struggle: The thought of alcohol popped into my head this morning before I'd even finished my coffee.  I could almost smell liquor &amp; it made me want to throw up.  I look forward to more days where alcohol doesn't invade my thoughts..General:  When vacation is over I'll complete my move into a new office at work.  I recently received a raise and a promotion and I am excited to throw myself into work and focus on continuing to grow my career.  I know that I need to find a balance between work family &amp; taking care of myself so I am going to go about things differently this time around.
**Triumph:** Today is day 8 and I made it through a concert at a cafe Christmas Eve Christmas day and multiple family dinners and offers of formerly enjoyed drinks (like mimosas) without drinking. Additionally I've been tired the past few days and finally realized a head cold was setting in yesterday. Had I been drinking through Christmas I'm not sure I would have recognized the symptoms of a head cold (tired feeling slower than usual) as quickly because I may have attributed them to drinking. Or I might have just gotten sick a lot faster thanks to a compromised immune system...**Struggle:** I'm more concerned about staying vigilant about not drinking in the long term than I am about getting through a huge drinking holiday like New Years Eve. I've been reading and re-reading the liminal points from This Naked Mind ([nicely outlined here](https://thisnakedmind.com/category/liminal-points/)) to help me reshape my thinking for the long-term...**General:** My dream for 2017 is to finally achieve the status of "non-drinker." It aligns so well with my other goals of living a healthier life getting stronger/more fit living more peacefully and contributing more to my community.
Triumph: I had a great night with my husband last night. The kids were out of the house. A nice dinner browsing at a bookstore and romantic times without me trying to stay up late drinking instead...Struggle: I feel like I'm catching another cold! It's so frustrating to get sick all the time. ..General: I'm getting goal overload for 2017. I want it all. But I'm pretty sure that a sober year will be my best year ever. So that's my highest priority goal right there. And then seriously dental work. All that wine did a number on my teeth! I wonder how many people call the dentist on January 2?
**Triumph:** 5 days sober.  Have finally stopped bursting into tears at random times..**Struggle:**  The wife is out of town to see her family 6 hours away.  I remember getting so excited when she would leave for days.  This meant I could get totally shit faced and call out of work the entire time.  .**General:**  I am going to keep myself busy with work and hobbies while she is gone to help with urges to drink.
Struggle: Realized that as soon as I have 1 drink I want to get black out drunk. Finished a bottle of Maker's Mark with my cube mate yesterday at work and then proceeded to drive home. Wrecked my new car and lost my car keys. If I'm not drinking I just want to sleep my life away. Today is going to be my day 1 and I'm hoping I can get through New Years. I look forward to meeting you all :)
**Triumph:** Two family Christmases and I didn't drink. Seriously. So proud...**Struggle:** Wedding planning. Need I say more? Navigating all of the family politics of it all (who will be invited? who's paying for what? how can I make sure everyone who wants to be involved feels involved?) and now finding a photographer who's still available when I didn't expect to need to. It's all a big ball of stress but I'm not feeling the need to drink it away...**General:** So excited for so many things in 2017! Will it be my first sober year since I was 18? We'll see!
**Triump:**Six months woo! My kiddo is coming home from rehab and he sounds so much better. Now transition into an IOP and support. ..**Struggle:**I'm pondering SSRI's again. Should I wait a year then if I don't feel like I'm struggling then? If someone could step into my brain and tell me that would be awesome. ..**General:**For 2017 I want to see my daughter get into a four year college. 
[deleted]
Checking in! I will not drink today and my dream for this year is to lose 20lbs and start cycling again. 
**Triumph** .It has become so clear to me that I want to change. Drinking every night was not okay. Even if I didn't drink a lot...**Struggle** .I have to learn to feel my feelings again. I have to make sure quitting alcohol doesn't translate to eating my feelings or over exercising. I need to be healthy. I need to lose the 20 lbs I threw on in mere months due to alcohol consumption. ..**Dream** .My dream for 2017 is to find myself again. I want to get my self respect back. Make new friends and form better relationships. I want to graduate after 8 years of struggling through my undergrad. I want to find some form of serenity and peace....May we all not drink together and find our dreams :).
I would love to see an example of your artwork /u/sfgirlmary!  I suspect you may have shown some when folks were sharing their art on here a while back but please do show again!..**Triumph:**  I'm getting better at not letting my fear/anxiety make my decisions for me.  I am doing the daily things that feel like work with the knowledge that doing them now will make my LIFE feel less like work with more time for play.  I am slowly coming into my adult emotional maturity!  It really is what the drinking had retarded keeping me a big bundle of reactions and avoidance.  And while my relationship has been a struggle it is truly teaching me how to handle my reactions and strong feelings with poise and articulation.  This feeds into this new emotional maturity...**Struggle:**  Appreciating WHO my partner is and not always wishing she were different.  While she is very different from me and that can be a struggle this is my issue well before her.  I am working hard on ceasing my criticism and judgment and accepting the person I am choosing to be with as they are.  This is childhood stuff that I really want to get over so I can be a healthier and more loving human...**General:**  My dream for 2017 is to pay off my car so my mortgage payments are more manageable and I am less beholden to others for my living situation.  It's not sexy but it will be SO satisfying to reach this goal.  And I WILL reach it!!  Other more fun dreams are 3 backpacking trips one long one in Rocky Mt Nat'l Park.
Triumph:  went 9 days a couple weeks ago (ashamed to say couldn't tell you last time I'd been that close to double digits)..Struggle:  extremely high functioning - keeps me from typical serious consequences (so far) but also enables me to avoid committing to dealing w/it (or at least perpetually postpone it)..General:  hate to say this but at this point dream is to have a dream again...  reasonably successful/financially secure (despite subject) but 2016 has felt like a waste of a year on many fronts.....my dream for 2017 would be to look back on 2016 &amp; say:  "_W_ _T_ _F_ was that about?!?"  guess admission is at least 1st step no?
My day dream is to head back into the new University term with a fresh mind sans fog and anxiety and to be the best basketball Mom there is.  .Triumph: I made it through Christmas 18 days sober and I feel more freedom everyday.  I am gaining back trust from those I love.  I may have also convinced my sister to stop drinking too. At the very least I've given her love acceptance and shared the tools that have worked for me in these 18 days (including this amazing community)!  .I will not drink with you lovely people today :)
Day 2 still sober so far. It's 5.25 pm just about to cook dinner. 
Triumph: Recognizing my problem with drinking and doing something about it. ..Struggle: caring for an elderly parent who has a very difficult personality (always has) and seeing my empty nest filled again. I'm smack in the middle of the "Sandwich Generation" and it stresses me out. Thankfully for 12 days now I've been dealing with it sober. A drink won't change the situation it would make it worse. ..General: getting my health back is priority. So many projects needing completion hikes to be hiked putting in more volunteer time into local issues I feel strongly about. ..Dreams? That's a hard one. I'm so used to care taking for others I'm hard pressed to think of my own dreams. I may have to pass on that for now but it gives me something to think about today. I do have dreams but they are in the fog. I need to find them again. 
Checking in. Today is a good day. I will not ruin it by drinking. 
Triumph: I'm less than a week away from 2 years sober. I can't believe how fast it's gone by. ..Struggle: I still am very lazy. It's hard to get out and do the things that I need to do. I don't drive so that doesn't help but I'm getting ready to take the test soon and get the ball rolling on buying a car soon. That'll make things way easier. ..General: New years has become an extra special holiday for me as it is also my soberversary. I'm really starting to love new years resolutions and this last year I swore to focus on my body through exercise stretching and diet. For the most part I feel like I succeeded however I certainly neglected my mental side. I haven't read at all this last year and hardly studied anything and I feel the dust collecting on my mind. So for 2017 it's gonna be all about reading studying and learning new things. Whats a good number of books to read in a year just to have a goal? Also what are some good books? I just bought a Kindle and I need some stuff on it. 
T:  I survived Xmas without alcohol!..S:  I've been sleeping a lot!   Not sure what's up with that...  And I have been having really wierd dreams/nightmares.  They are actually kind of cool.   ..G:  A lot of people have been saying how bad 2016 has been but it could have been worse.  For me we are going with a 10 because that's the number of days that I drank in 2016.  (And the Cubs won the world series.)
T:  This is my first 15th day sober in 3.5 years.  Since my last relapse was my rock bottom the last two weeks have been really easy actually.  Which is pretty cool.  Definitely something completely new to me...S:  My neighbor who's been threatening suicide because of her Stage 4 cancer for the last 8 weeks is FINALLY (AGAIN) FINALLY REALLY NO REALLY I MEAN IT THIS TIME ready to do it.  Again.  Sigh.  I'm finding this all very exhausting and it's also puppeting my life which is actually starting to really piss me off.  Fucking cry wolf for so long don't expect me to have a huge reaction when you finally fucking mean it...G:  I have way too much stuff to process right now that I can't even think of a random fact for you like I usually like to do about squirrels and koalas and what-not.  Sorry...EDIT:  Ok fine here's a snapshot of [Kissyface] (https://1drv.ms/i/s!AvfaCaklFbSIgg8hwciquijSoLiN)  She was my best :-)
/u/sfgirlmary I always appreciate your hosting this!!  I too would love to hear what kind of artwork you do and see any images you might like to share :-)  I finished [my dolphin] (https://1drv.ms/i/s!AvfaCaklFbSIgV49nQP-k7N6uyP_) this year 
Triumph: Sober Xmas!..Struggle: Too many days with both my own and my bf's parents. Just want the house to myself! Tomorrow all will be calm...General: My 2017 dream is get fit. Really fit. I want to have fun climb mountains keep boxing running and more. 
I will not have a drink today
**Triumph:** I went on a beautiful hike today. It was nice to get outside for a little while...**Struggle:** I am trying to moderate the amount of sugar I eat. For most of the year I have let it slide because chocolate helped with the cravings. But I've woken up with a "sugar hangover" (Did anyone else know that such a thing exists? I didn't until last week!) on two separate occasions. Super unpleasant but a wake up call that I need to get my nutrition in check again...**Dream:** I would like to continue my recovery and make it even more exciting than it has been this past year.
Triumph: I now have $700 in savings and a budget/plan to get that up to $3000 by my first anniversary of sobriety! I have an appointment tomorrow with a counselor that I'm really looking forward to because I think she can help me sort some stuff out and help me with coping skills...Struggle: It took me SIX weeks of calorie counting in September/October to lose my last 5 lbs and I put on 6 pounds in November/December. &gt;:( Buuuut I'll be on a set schedule so meal-planning and exercise should be easier...General: Working on New Year's Resolutions.. 1) Meet with counselor  4x in January and at least twice a month in February and March. Figure out a plan from there...2) Do yoga at my gym once a week...3) Drink 80 oz of water per day. ..4) Get 7-8 hours of sleep every night. ..5) Floss every night and take off my dang makeup! ..6) Log calories every day and meet macro goals until I'm back down to goal weight...7) Run 3-5 times a week...8) Get all As again this semester!..9) After getting 3k in savings open a second fund to pay for school once I transfer to a 4-year university in 2018 or 2019.
Triumph: Went to a yoga class today for the first time in months..Struggle: I'm having a really hard time figuring out how I feel about AA. I've been attending somewhat regularly for the past month and a half and to be honest the whole culture of it sometimes makes sobriety look bleaker than drunkenness. Many members are people who have been sober for like thirteen years and are STILL attending daily meetings and generally obsessing over staying away from the bottle. To me this kind of defeats the purpose of quitting drinking which I believe is to move on and live a happy productive life without having to be ruled by the thought of alcohol. Not to mention that the mood is always very somber and none of these people seem to be particularly enjoying sobriety. Many will tell you that they've never been happier or had more fun than since they stopped drinking but they always say it as if they were confessing to a crime or something..General: Glad I've been getting a lot more exercise in than I usually do.
