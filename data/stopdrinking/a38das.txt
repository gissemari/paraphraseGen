Hey guys. I'm on my 27 or something. I'm not even sure which day specifically doesn't matter too much right now. What matters is that I'm struggling to void my mind of any thoughts of alcohol. I'm not fixing to get a drink. Right now and the past five days or so I've been fixating on how much I don't want to be thinking about it. I just want it to be something I'm indifferent to. And I have an interview for a new position at work tomorrow and I want to be on my game and not have my mind stuck elsewhere. Anyone got any tips to put I out of my mind at least for an hour?
