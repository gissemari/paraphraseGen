I've relapsed too many times and today I've realized how much I really don't like being drunk. I mostly do it as a social activity and honestly I would just like to stop at this point. I can socialize better without alcohol for sure. ..My question is how do I stop myself from making drinking plans or going out with friends when I know alcohol will be involved because moderation does not work for me but it's also really hard to stop myself and say "I don't feel like drinking" to be honest...Have any of you tried things that work? Please share!

&gt; My question is how do I stop myself from making drinking plans or going out with friends when I know alcohol will be involved..My answer to this is probably not what you want to hear but I just stopped being friends with my drinking friends. About a year ago I stopped talking to 95% of my friends. Stopped going out stopped hanging out around alcohol and other drinkers. That change made things a lot easier for me. Not easy mind you but easier.
I avoided those situations for a few months.  I had an AF house and I didn't even go out to dinner so I wasn't around the stuff to be tempted while I learned a new way to live.  And then when I did go around it again I had a plan.  I don't consider saying no thanks a plan.  That is just trying to resist.  So I made a plan of what I would do what I would order how I hoped the event would go so I could have expectations to meet and focus on.
&gt;How do I stop myself from making drinking plans..I make **other** plans...Seriously.  ..A plan is a conscious cognitive process.  I get better at planning by practicing planning...I'd take a piece of paper and pencil.  I'd make some plans that **don't** involve alcohol.  I practice it.  Then I get better at it...I make plans to socialize that don't involve alcohol...Meet at coffee shops; go biking hiking kayaking; go to a museum the theater; work on a Habitat for Humanity Home; help in my community; take a class; go to the gym; go to the beach; go to the mountains.....   ..Tried that?
I make sober plans. At first it was a slog because nothing gave me pleasure but the longer I stayed sober the better life got (I'm having fun and being productive). I also stick to the dry people dry places rule to avoid getting "accidentally" drunk. If my friends want to spend time with me we can do everything but drink. If they just want to drink and don't care about my welfare they're not my friends but drinking buddies.
My biggest fear of stopping drinking was the possibility of never ending loneliness.  At least that is what my buddy alcohol kept telling me.  Turns out that he/she/it was wrong.  The non-drinking world is much bigger than the drinking world...I got involved with a number of "outdoor activities" type groups.  When I quit smoking 34 yrs and 6 days ago I started to run with a woman from my apartment complex and that took up 4 1hr periods a week.  The point was to sort out stuff that I wanted to do and then to do it.  We get to do things in sobriety that we never imagined we could do when drinking...And if you still want insanity in your life that too can also be found sober...Here is something I did at about 16 yrs sober.  Not me in the vid I did it before GoPro existed but I am sure my dialog was similar.  Not for the vertigo challenged.  FWIW those snow patches at 1:25 are about 1400 ft down.  And those pussies even had fixed protection!..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYXOCER-d1M
Thank you so much everyone for your motivational comments!..Honestly while making this post I thought I'd get a lot of shit for it! How difficult can it be to say just no right? But this disease is sickening. I'm glad I've realized that I have a problem and I'm so happy to have found a community where I don't feel like shit for not being able to say no but am greeted with better alternatives :) my heart is heavy with happiness...I will not drink today and have faith that you don't too!
