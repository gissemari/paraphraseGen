Outside of this community I don't have many people to talk to about my struggles and successes in sobriety. So I just had to post!..I found this sub a few days before I quit drinking. I will never forget the feeling of hope and determination I felt after pouring over everyone's posts that first day. I was stunned to find such a warm community full of people fighting for a better life and was emboldened by all of the amazing success stories. More importantly the stories of struggle and relapse helped me see that others like me were out there. I cannot tell you how comforting and important it was for me to realize that I was not alone stuck in my drunken cycle of denial and shame. Finally it was ok for me to admit that I had a problem because you guys showed me where taking that first scary step could lead. ..I still have a lot of work to do and I worry about what the future looks like but I am so happy to be where I am today. Thank you guys. Keep fighting. IWNDWYT.

I was in the same boat.  In my real life I felt really really alone.  This was the first place where it seemed like people understood.  Great job on your shiny new 3 star and IWNDWYT!
I was exactly the same   felt so alone and like there was something unique wrong with me!  I also had no idea that it would be possible to stop drinking and lead a far happier life!..Finding these lovely people online   not only struggling like me but also those demonstrating that life sober could be something wonderful and to aspire to was life-changing...Thank you for your lovely post and congrats on three months!  I'm so happy things are going good for you   if there's anyone out there struggling like we did stick with it and keep trying.  It gets better doesn't it?  :)
