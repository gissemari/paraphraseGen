I rediscovered this quotation in my notebook today and thought I'd share. ..I first came across it when I had suffered a relapse some time ago and thought "Oh f**k it. I'm so ashamed. I'm a failure. I'm such a loser. I'll just keep drinking since that's all I'm 'good' at." Sound familiar to anyone?..Reading this quotation then gave me just the kick in the pants I needed. I didn't throw in the towel. I'm sober today. ..Rereading it has worked for me on several occasions when I have been struggling with some particularly difficult issue that seemed to thwart my every effort. It gives the stubborn "me" the pat on the back to "Never never never give up." (Winston Churchill)..(By the way if anyone knows the quotation's origins I'd love to know!)

This was the closest I could find (from http://www.winstonchurchill.org).."Never Give In"..       "This is the lesson: never give in never give in never never never never in nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy."..        HarrowSchool 29 October 1941. It is commonly believed that Churchill stood up gave the three-word speech "Never give in!" and sat down. This is incorrect as is the suggestion variously reported that the speech occurred at Oxfordor Cambridge. It was on his first visit to his old school Harrow where he would continue to return for the annual "Songs" making his last appearance in 1961.
