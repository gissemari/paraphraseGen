These 'trigger' [relapse] situations ain't gonna send a you an email notifying you of their attack mostly. Most will AMBUSH you from behind or be cunning in willing you to drink. I've been on-N-off the wagon more times than John Wayne got off his horse. It took me over 15+ years of trying: to build a whole years' sobriety. My most recent relapses have 'broken' a 2.5 yr....2 yr...& 10 m abstinence. All times I thought I was 'going strong' and these three relapses all involved what I call "AMBUSH trigger situations". I call it this; because it's not like: preparing to be strong for a works' drink on the 10th a birthday Christmas for example. These AMBUSH triggers could be:  a bust-up with your partner (fuelled with temper overriding willpower) ... being abruptly laid-off from work ... a passing of someone close ... an accident ... finding out your partner is cheating ... etc etc. Basically things OUT of our control. There is also one other AMBUSH trigger: the self-ambush trigger; where [amazingly and foolishly] someone just walks in a store buys a bottle completely spontaneously out of impulse without thinking! ... I've done it more than several times as well as other Redditors' posts on here. In conclusion: I find staying sober fairly easy when put on 'autopilot' mode: and knowing WHEN a works' drink is/when someone's birthday gathering is etc. But it's been the trigger AMBUSHES that have always KO'd me. I'm still trying to learn how to avoid these. So far the only semi-remedy for this has been to try "slow myself down" and snap-out of any temper that overrides my rational thoughts and lets the [stronger] 'alcoholic brain' have control. Any of you guys got any tips for these AMBUSH situations?? This site has helped me greatly; I wish I had of discovered it back in my dark days of alcoholism as love the convenience of chatting to like-minded people from home.

I protected myself from alcohol and these "ambush" triggers by having a therapist and going to AA meetings. Working the steps taught me a great deal about myself and provided sober living tools. I learned to always remember what happens when I drink and to not take the first one. 
[HALTS and DEADS](https://redd.it/40fdyz) are my general frameworks for both ambushes and anticipated attacks. They're sort of my tool box that I use to organize more specialized tools.
