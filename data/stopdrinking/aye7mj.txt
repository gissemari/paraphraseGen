What I can't do alone we can do together. If you're in doubt or struggling I'm here for you. Message any time. I will get back to you ASAP.  .YOU help keep ME sober today. The guy with time needs the new guy to stay sober. It's in the 12th step. Nothing so much ensures one's sobriety as intensive work with another alcoholic.  .We can do this.
