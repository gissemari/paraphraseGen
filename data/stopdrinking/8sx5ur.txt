Today is my first day back at work. I have a free lance job so am very fortunate to have the past 2 weeks off randomly...I'm a bit afraid of being triggered by stress at work. I find I tense up and can't control my shoulders heart rate etc. Once I get in in my head that I could have a drink after work to relax I start obsessing and find it hard not to grab a drink for the commute home. ..I've prepared some healthy food for lunch and am going for a swim before work as "insurance". Also I have some benzos on me if I feel really anxious. The good thing is that I know I can do this as I had a good run of 4 months earlier this year before I relapsed...Best of all I have the SD community now. I had no idea what a difference that would make to how supported I feel. I won't drink with you today homies!..xx

Ah yes the relaxing drink :) I know what you mean...&gt;  You could say that being completely relaxed means having nothing to worry irk or annoy you either physically or mentally. How can alcohol do this for you? It does not fix the annoyances and stressors but temporarily dulls the symptoms. And guess what? As you build a tolerance the actual effect of alcohol decreases and your need for it increases. Soon the things that are making you upset are barely muted by alcohol and you are addicted. Of course addiction is a much bigger stressor than the stressors you drank to remove. You've created a mental craving for alcohol that did not exist before one that you now have to either feed (with more alcohol) or deprive. Wanting something you shouldn't have does nothing to relax you; it creates a mental divide inside your mind which is the very definition of frustration and agitation. It's the opposite of relaxation  .      &lt;This Naked Mind: Control Alcohol: Find Freedom Discover Happiness &amp; Change Your Life&gt;(Grace Annie;Grace Annie) page 123
