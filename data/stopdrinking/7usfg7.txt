In the 1.5 years I've been struggling with alcohol I've managed to completely alienate my husband to the point he is probably going to divorce me. We got into 1 too many fights where I drunkenly said mean things I can't take back. He's incredibly hurt and I'm  filled with guilt and shame for failing him so miserably. I found my perfect partner and managed to completely sabotage our future. At least I think I have. I haven't had a drink since he told me he wanted out and he's agreed to go to counseling but I'm afraid it's too little too late. Even tho i know i dont mean the things i say when Im drunk he thinks the opposite: the alcohol reveals my true feelings. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I was sexually abused as a child and in the past year all those repressed feelings came bubbling up from their burial place deep within and I am filled with so much anger and shame. I know he has been the target of a lot of misplaced anger. It kills me that I can see everything so clearly now. My mind is on a constant reel of every mistake Ive made due to alcohol and it's almost too much to handle. I know I need to do this for me and I am but I'm a relationship person and having a healthy stable relationship with my soulmate is what I want more than anything. I know in my heart that I have no chance of repairing my relationship without first repairing my relationship with myself but fuck it's hard when you're filled with so much remorse. I'm in therapy finally but all I can seem to focus on is my marriage. How can I fix this? And if it's too broken how can I forgive myself and find happiness again? I know people do it all the time I just can't seem to get it together. Even tho I'm eating healthy exercising daily reading self-help books I just can't seem to find the motivation to push further. I want to paint again I want to be productive and helpful I want to feel joy like i did before alcohol hijacked my life. I would apologize for the long ramble but i know my friends here understand. .Thanks for listening. I appreciate all of you and am proud not to drink with you today.

I had pretty badly bruised my marriage by the time I stopped.  Both in the short term and just from years of drinking.  And so for the first few days not only was I quitting but I was walking on eggshells in my house.  All I could do was focus on not drinking that one day and push any 'long term' thoughts out of my head.  Because if I thought about tomorrow I would've failed.  I got no support because she wasn't speaking to me so promises meant nothing.  I had to do it for myself...It sucked.  It sucked bad.  But it beat those valuable lessons -- one day at a time; quitting for yourself and for no other reason -- into my head.  My promises were worthless my wife thought all of my failures were me lying to her but really I was lying to myself.  But having to prove it left me no shorthands in my mind either...Good luck I know how difficult what you're facing can be.  It made me who I am now but that's not to say I'd necessarily want to go through it again.  Congratulations on getting to 25 days and I won't drink with you today.
Congrats on the 25 days. I know relationship pain caused by drinking and I feel for you. I also know the pangs of regret about not stopping sooner. For the former I know that the best chance for me to help get and keep things on track is staying sober. For the latter well nothing I can do about that so I just acknowledge the thought and try not to dwell. .IWNDWYT
