At work I was offered to sample some new wine and I felt bad for turning it down. I felt bad because I normally would get excited to try new products at work but I held off. Also because by not choosing to drink I think people are starting to figure out that I am an alcoholic and in the liquor business it's generally something that garners more negative attention than positive. I was told that my company will send you to rehab and front the bill if you are a serious abuser. That's pretty cool. It was the first time since I stopped drinking that I really thought I needed to have a drink but I was smart to abstain. I know that my coworkers are keeping me accountable though which is also good because there was no pressure for me to try anything this time. You win some you lose some. But today I will not drink.
