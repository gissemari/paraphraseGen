Hey guys..I'm torn. I got to work today and my (kinda) mate/workmate who is about the same number of days sober as me is drunk at work. Very noticeably. .What should I Do?

Get him an Uber or something out of there and tell your boss he's sick. After getting him out of there and he sobers up try having a talk with him. 
My thought is your workmate should tell or have someone tell his manager that he is sick safely get home and then deal with his problem.
I'd not say anything to them at work or while they are drunk.  If at all possible try and meet up with them after work maybe grab a bite and express your concern for their wellbeing.  Many of us relapse and they need to be reassured that this is something that happens to us while we are attempting recovery. 
It's rough when you're faced with witnessing a relapse especially when it's someone who is in a very similar situation as you...Focus yourself on what you know keeps you sober. I like to "play the tape" of what will eventually happen if I start drinking again. It may not be daily blackout drinking right away but that's where I will end up. And I already know all the fallout that happens around my drinking...If you're sure enough in your sobriety reach out to help your work mate. If not ask them if you can call someone for them.
hey sober twin - good on you for caring and wanting to be there for your mate. You're not just looking out for them you are also protecting all the other people at your workplace and the business you work for. being pissed on the job is a major OHS risk and doing something to help them get offsite as /u/notimebetterthannow suggested is extremely wise and also decent. The world needs more folk like you! xx.
