Sorry I never really post on here I read all of your struggles and inspiring stories daily. Today marks my 1000 days sober. I honestly can not believe it my life used to revolve around partying and  getting fucked up  I couldn't really imagine a life without it.  I was so scared to live a life on the straight and narrow. ..Fast forward a few years and 1000 days sober under  my belt and now I can't imagine my life with drinking.  ..Keep it up everyone you are my daily check in and inspiration for another day :)
