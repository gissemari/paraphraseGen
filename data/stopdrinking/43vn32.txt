It's been a little while since I have posted and felt the need to brag a little.  I've moved again and I think I've found my sober living home.  After living with alcoholic parents 2 alcoholic brothers(one in a hotel room full of whiskey) living in a mostly sober home makes this No drinking thing so much easier.  ..I've moved in with my cousin and although there has been a few people drinking here I have had almost no desires to drink.  The few I have had were easily ignored.  I am starting a job today and am excited to get back to rebuilding my life...The only issues I have had are dealing with free time.  I have gone from raising three kids under 5 with almost no free time to nothing to do.  The boredom is driving me mad.  I've been spending lots of time playing cards and board games with my cousins and my grandma.  Other than that it's been just watching tv.  But I haven't had a drink in over a month and that is a good feeling...To those struggling just know that the more you try the better chances you have at success.  It took several attempts to find the right place for me but I am very thankful I didn't give up.

I am so proud of you and all you have accomplished and are striving for! You are awesome. I also had a problem with going from GOGOGO to (for me personally) feeling purposeless. I realized that my purpose was to be a bit selfish and focus on myself/health/recovery and rebuild my life back and better than it was. I am happy you found a sober living home and support.
