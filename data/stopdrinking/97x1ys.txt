After a nightmare of a relapse and a HELL of a detox the first few days I'm finally feeling better in just about all ways I can think of.  My counselor for addiction group(required for probation) complimented me for standing up to and calling out a dude being really negative to the lesson and group in general that day likes that I've been active in putting in plenty of good job applications and reduced my number of required classes! I'm so relieved and happy I could cry but I did a ton of that over the last few weeks and months and years so I will just say:  and of course IWNDWYT!

Nice work!
Good job!
Great to hear. A good beginning will make a good ending!
Sounds like a good counselor and a great analogy for how each day sober just makes life better! 
Way to go... you're well over the hump! It'll get better every day.
