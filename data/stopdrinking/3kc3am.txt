hey all i haven't been sober for that long but one of the most daunting things for me right now is trying to figure out how to forgive myself. i never did anything that bad... oh except maybe completely neglect myself my health my well-being and my future. and those of all the people around me. has anyone else struggled with this and how did you accept what you did and learn to love yourself again? is this a 12-step thing?

I think it's a human thing but a lot of people come to forgiveness through the 12 step process. Day four (early days mate!)was still guilt-ridden and shamey for me. Still sometimes it hits me and I know I have more work to do in the area of self-esteem. But I think it's important in the beginning to be as kind to one's self as possible so as not to derail the forward motion of recovery. Hearing that it takes time is not very satisfying I know but nurture that spark of yours. Surrounding yourself with people who understand might just be the ticket.
I've definitely felt like crap about myself for my drinking particularly for relapsing as often as I have. I've found that doling on these feelings was unproductive for me. I acknowledge them and use them as another mark on the long list of reasons to quit. Every day sober under my belt is what has slowly been making me feel better about myself.
