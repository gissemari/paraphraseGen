Sorry for any grammatical issues-I'm crying as I type this. ..I relapsed this weekend and had a terrible time. Towards the end of a 3 day binge I was stumbling around lost downtown left my friend voicemails talking about suicide..I haven't drank in 48 hrs I have the shakes and am feeling extremely depressed. Can't take benzos because I was previously addicted. I  honestly too embarrassed to ask my parents for help or to go to Aa. Drinking has caused me to lose my job and all of my money and I don't know where to go from here.

Go to a meeting.  Sitting around feeling sorry for yourself is not going to help you or make you feel better.  AA doesn't cost anything and you can call intergroup and get a ride if you need one.  By now the pain should outweigh your feelings of embarrassment.  You can do this and the people in AA can show you how.  
In addition to what the others have said is there anyone you are close to that may be able to help get you in to see a doctor?  They may be able to help as well.  ..Try and let go of the guilt you are feeling.  It happens...it happened to me after 14 years sobriety.  So there is nothing to be ashamed of here.  48 hours is good so just take it a step at a time.  Go see a doc if you can.
[Smart Recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org) is a self-help recovery based on a science and pyschology called [Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Emotive_Behavioral_Therapy) [Wikipedia] and also [here for more info](http://www.rebtnetwork.org/whatis.html). There are [self-help materials](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/index.htm) that you can download for free. ..They have meetings in major cities worldside but there are also online meetings and an online forum that's active 24/7. ..The forum is an excellent place to begin and perhaps move on to the online meetings. Since there is complete anonymity in the forum and online meetings you might find this easier to get started with with less embarresment.
