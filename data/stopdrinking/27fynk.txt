I've been sober for ~6 months (cumulative) out of the past year and I think that's pretty cool. ..What's different this time is that I finally understood that I had a fundamental problem with alcohol; whereas before I thought that maybe I was just lacking self control. That's not the case. I still have the occasional craving but I just think about how much better I am mentally and physically without it. How it's so worth all of the work it takes to stay sober. I feel like I am getting a good handle on life and what makes me feel fulfilled/drives me to be better without alcohol. Thinking about who I was months and years ago is hard. Memories...well more like unsettling realizations of how an event actually played out will come to me throughout the day (mostly on days when I have too much time to anxiously ruminate). They make me want to run until I feel like I'm farther away from the person that did those things. I mean physically run. Get so sweaty that my headphones won't stay in my ears...I struggle most with having an alcoholic father and brother. It weighs on me every day and I really need to find a way to get in a better space with that. ..Thanks for being here guys. Sorry for the poor layout of this post. I'm writing this on my phone. So it's all disjointed..

I don't know if you use AA but that is a great way of dealing with your past.  Also another option for you is to go to Alanon to deal with your fathers and brothers alcoholism.  Many problem drinkers go to alanon as well as aa if there is a history of Alcohol abuse in their family. Any how I am glad you are doing well.  Keep it up.../r/AlAnon have a sub as well if you want to post there.  Good luck.
