I'm finding it quite difficult to accept help and guidance from people around me at the moment.im getting to meetings most nights but find afterwards some members can be to forthcoming with opinions leftright and centre.it can be overwhelming for a newbie! I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible....

I find it useful to accept what the person is giving me even if I'm not going to use it or maybe even do the exact opposite. I'm finding with 12-step programs there is so much room for personal interpretation (outside of the core ideas) that on any given question two old-timers may point you in opposite directions. As a newcomer I find it best when in doubt just to work step one. Even when I've moved on to another step it's useful to check back in at "powerless over alcohol" and take stock from there.
Everyone's an expert but nobody's an expert in you and your experience. This is why we have sponsors. I've received tons of advice in the rooms and only a small slice of it relates to me...The best advice comes from those who don't really share that much. Most people who throw advice around all day are just trying too hard...
I'm finding forgiveness meditations to be helpful with resentments.
