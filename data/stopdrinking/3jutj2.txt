I don't want to quit. I want to quit. I don't want to quit. I want to quit...I want the calmness of sobriety the clarity. I want the ability to focus on what I am doing patience breath...I want the next drink before I am even done with the one I am having...Right now I'm 46 and I've struggled with alcohol for most of my life. Wouldn't it be amazing if I replaced alcohol with meditation for the next chapter of my life?..Sober me? Sober me...I want to quit..........

You sound very much like me inkycow. I am (almost) 45. I have been sober 97 days and I'm discovering that I like myself sober. We can do this! I won't drink with you today let's just start with today.
&gt;I'm 46 and I've struggled with alcohol for most of my life. Wouldn't it be amazing if I replaced alcohol with meditation for the next chapter of my life?..Are you me? :)..I quit drinking at 46 and took up meditation. Spoiler alert: the next chapter is pretty amazing indeed.
I did not quit drinking--I stopped.  I stopped and got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
Those are good goals and you seem to have some good motivation...It would be good to write down with pen and paper what new habits you will do everyday...Like maybe it would be 1) I will not drink today 2) I will practice meditating today for X minutes ..Motivation and thinking is great but it doesn't get anything done. Its forming strong habits and committing and doing them everyday that will get you to where you want to go....Good luck in your journey..
I struggled with alcohol for 30 years and am also a big fan of meditation.  I was first introduced to it over 40 years ago in a dingy martial arts studio run by a 75 year old Chinese guy...Here is a link to download "Mindfulness In Plain English By Ven. Henepola Gunaratana"..https://www.ucl.ac.uk/personal-development-workshops/mindfworkshop_resources/Mindfulness_in_plain_english..&gt;I want to quit...Why?..Good Luck....
51 years struggled with alcohol for decades.  *Finally* have 21 days sober...I think I finally was able to be honest with myself:  Was I really ready to quit.  21 days ago I finally answered "yes".  I had enough...Before that I always wanted to go back to the bottle.  Now I am ready to live without it...I'm taking Antabuse and it is helping me.  Why didn't I take it before?  I wasn't ready to stop drinking.
