I'm almost 3 months sober now. I'm starting to see the positive effects remembering things people tell me feeling and looking healthier holding down a job paying my bills thinking about others' wellbeing and my future.... that's 3 months after hitting a new rock bottom. 3 months since my relapse being broken up with by someone I loved and being THIS close to committing suicide. I was on my way to my hometown to drop my dog off at my parents and tell the few family members and friends left in my life goodbye... I couldn't go on living with or without alcohol and drugs... but my sister held an intervention and literally talked me out of the end and invited me to come live with her to start over. I finally feel the sense of gratitude you hear about in aa meetings. I'm so glad to be alive and moving forward. It's not easy but the stupid things I did while drinking and the mistakes I've made in the past no longer define me. I am FREE. iwdwyt
