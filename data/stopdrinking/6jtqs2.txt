I haven't really felt the temptation to drink really until last night on my porch. In fact I felt like sobriety was pretty easy. I'm starting to work on my fiction writing again after a long hiatus because I was focusing on my job. For me not speaking for all writers it can be painful to write about certain characters that are suffering but I felt like I had to exhume it up. I kept getting nostalgic about beer playing a video in my head of the cold taste of beer. I remembered how refreshing it felt. Good lord I wanted to cave. I started scribbling down how moderation would be more work and that if I went back I would be that guy again. Yesterday I admitted I was toxic to an ex on that same porch earlier where I was now battling the urge. She even told me that day that I seemed different now. Surprise Surprise alcohol makes people different. ..So I just decided to go to sleep haha. I feel like sleep is like a great healer of sorts. I had a relapse dream last night that sucked. But hell it's better than doing it in reality. I woke up with the magnetic tug gone and went to work like nothing happened. Halleljuah...I really want to be like a sober dinosuar with a geological amount of days between being myself and being that miserable self serving guy. Oh yeah drunk me that was from the late prehistoric 'I don't know how to be good to myself' period it was a bad time but I'm here now...TLDR: really wanted to drink late at night just went to sleep instead. .

Just think of how much more productive you are.  Do you commit to writing a certain # of pages a day?  I won't drink with you today.
Congrats on not having chest pressure killing anxiety and a hangover today!
Sleep is amazing.  I have found that it works wonders for overeating as well.
