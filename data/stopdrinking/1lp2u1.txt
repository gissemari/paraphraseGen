Just thought I would say hello. I haven't posted much lately but I am sober still.  If anyone ever looked at my posting history they would see two years of struggling to get more than a week and now I am coming up on six months...Not too long ago I heard someone say that alcoholics want to be congratulated for things normal people just do and that's true we are a self centered lot so don't congratulate me...To those that have just set out to sea in their makeshift raft: The surf is pretty rough at first but It does settle down a little further out.

&gt; so don't congratulate me...###Congrats!..(/r/firstworldanarchists was here)
Good for you! ..I don't need to congratulate *myself* anymore (the daily ice cream as a reward for not drinking has tapered off to one once a week or so) but I still like hearing that I'm doing well and looking better. What we're doing ought not to seem like much but it still is to me at least.
&gt; alcoholics want to be congratulated for things normal people just do..We aren't normal people...And yes it does get easier.  You've still got a lot of firsts in sobriety to experience so make sure to enjoy them.
I'm still struggling like you did for two years.  How did you finally gain momentum?  I'm really discouraged at the moment.
Good of you to check in.  Well done on your six months.  You should be proud and you deserve it!  I know it ain't easy.
