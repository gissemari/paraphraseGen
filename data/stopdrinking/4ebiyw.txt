To start off I want to say thank you to everyone that post on here. I could have written just about every post I read here about how alcohol was effecting my life. I would read what was happening to peoples mind body and spirit from day to day as one struggles to quit drinking.  The positive feedback and support that this group gave to everyone posting helped me quit drinking. Yes I was a lurker but am now proud to say that I am 107 days sober.

Congrats on 107 days! I'm looking forward to double digits-- but every day is a new personal record now.
Wow I'm so glad you posted out of "lurk."
Awesome! What has been working for you (aside from the lurking)?
You are awesome. Welcome out of lurkdom!
welcome to posting!
Oh man that's huge!!..Thanks for sharing.  
I was so excited and proud when I cracked 100 days :) I was still totally crazy and white knuckling my way through it but it still felt like the biggest achievement to me. I think I felt that if I could do 100 days without alcohol I could do forever. 
Good job rockme! Glad you checked in.
