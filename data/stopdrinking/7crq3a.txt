I remember 3 months ago posting on here with only 7 days. Worrying and wandering how the hell id make it another week hell abother day. This time around i beat my previous record of 60 days. Ive done more in this past 3 months than ive done in 10 years. Life is looking up. I still have alot of work to do. The good thing is that nagging voice begging me to drink has started to quiet down a bit. Thanks to all of you for posting up here daily. Your struggles and stories help give me strength to carry on

Congrats!!!  Any tips for us still working on Week 1?
Congrats! The big 90 days is a huge milestone! It'll only keep getting better...
Good going ! Congrats on 90! 
Congrats! Hopefully I can accomplish the same thing 
CONGRATS!! I'll hit 90 myself pretty soon as well.   I call that voice the "devil voice" and he keeps chattering on - he runs a movie of a nice cold martini fixed my favorite way and adds the taste sense of how great that first sip (actually gulp) would be etc.....He stops there and doesn't play the rest of the movie - the part where I drink 3 or 4 or 5 more and I turn into my alter ego "rageaholic asshole man" and wake up wishing for someone to drive a spike through my head. ..that 'devil voice' is definitely a little f**ker..Good Luck!! 100 days is outstanding!
