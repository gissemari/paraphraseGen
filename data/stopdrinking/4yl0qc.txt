What's to add?  You pretty much have said it all.  For me it all came to a screeching halt when major life consequences began to happen right before my eyes which I could not deny--were related to my drinking.  Then and only then did I want to STOP. Of course knowing I wanted to stop didn't mean I remembered how--but with a little forward action I found my way. ..We'll be here when you are ready willing and able to commit.
You say you never seek help. That was always my mistake. I sought help and things are turning around like I'd never dreamed. I'm free after years of slavery to drink and the emotional morass in which I suddenly learned I'd been all my life. Help is out there.

It seems like you've tried all the recovery methods.  ...I'm curious.  You've been to many meetings.  Did you ever complete the step work?...
I have a drinking problem. Now there are two ways that I can use this statement of truth. One way is as an explanation. Oh I relapsed guess it's because I have a drinking problem. Another way of using it is as a warning. I have a drinking problem so I won't drink alcohol no matter what. ..If there was a bottle of rat poison on the table and it was clearly labeled rat poison  I would not drink it
