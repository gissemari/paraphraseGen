My best friend died a little over a year ago after a terrible struggle with drugs. It triggered a lot of deep thinking on my part and I decided that a way to honor her memory -- and give her life significance -- would be to let her death inspire me to quit drinking. It took a little while to get my head around the idea but a year ago today I took a deep breath and dove into a sober lifestyle...It hasn't been perfect. I broke down once and had a couple of glasses of wine after the house I was staying in caught fire during a hurricane (long story). But I've been otherwise sober -- happily so -- for a year. It's been relatively easy to keep on the straight and narrow and I feel like a better person for it...Just thought I'd share.
