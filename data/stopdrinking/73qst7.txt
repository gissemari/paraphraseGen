I couldnt stop. I was self destructive. I lost someone I truly love. Diagnosed Severe depression. Diagnosed anxiety. Attempted suicide 3 times. Psyche Wards wouldnt take me. Called my parents. They found me a detox clinic. Got out 2 days ago. Today is day 8 of sobriety. Mentally I am still not well. But I dont crave alcohol. I can walk past a store and not go in. I feel great in that sense. Havent been sober in 12 years. And dont plan on relapsing. Pray for me. Pray that my mind gets right. I beat the addiction. And will remain that way.

Welcome Aboard!..Sorry to hear what you've been through that must be tough.....I found that having the right support is vital - daily connection with other addicts in various stages of recovery and something like a 12-step program can help get your mind right to *stay* stopped much better than hoping and wishing.....I find this connection via this sub others find it IRL via AA and other recovery networks... is this something you'd consider trying?..It's working well for me where previous attempts to Not Drink unsupported or on my own always failed eventually.....Hope you'll stick around and let us know how you're doing?..I won't drink with you today!..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I'm not religious but I'll send you good cosmic vibes. I'm very concerned about your three suicide attempts. I hope you are finding additional help for that. Maybe a behavioral health urgent care facility? Maybe put the suicide hotline on speed dial? Really glad you've decided to get sober. And congrats on day 8!
Welcome. I hope that you can find some support soon. Thinking of you today.
