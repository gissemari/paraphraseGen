Hey everyone. ..I'm excited to say that I have finally made the firm decision to do something about my drinking. As I have seen many other people post I have been a long time lurker. I have been joined to this subreddit for 18 months in the last month I have started having a read at other peoples posts from time to time and then in the last fortnight I have looked at it several times a day. Twice in the last fortnight I have made the hungover decision to do something even calling AA one day (albeit with a drink in hand) but it is only now that I have the determination and strength to say that I am going to stick to this and do it. Again like others this came from a particular night which forced me to reckon with the truth...To give some history both of my parents were/are alcoholics. My mothers alcoholism was extreme affected my entire childhood and I have a lot of memories associated with it that would terrify most people. She died a few years ago of a brain haemorrhage whilst home alone with my dad finding her after being there for 2 days. The coroners report found that she had already suffered brain damage from her drinking and had a severly damaged liver. This actually gave me some relief as she emotionally and cognitively seemed to have been checked out in her last few years and as a result said and did incredibly nasty things towards my sister and I. ..My dad is still an alcoholic has been to rehab twice and has concerned us many times over the years especially after mums death. One of my biggest regrets is drinking with him over the last few months when visiting whilst not regularly I knew the last thing I should be doing is partaking in the very activity we are trying to get him to stop doing. One of the main reasons I do it is because he opens up to me once he has had a few drinks. Another result of my parents alcoholism is that my sister struggled for years with depression and anxiety and was in and out of mental hospital for years with the psychologists confirming that a lot of her behavioural and cognitive problems were from years of being the victim of particularly mums alcoholism...I believe I didn't struggle with these same problems at the time as I had a lot of great friends and was constantly out of the house partying with them whilst she was often left at home to deal with it all. I also had a great school psychologist who helped me temporarily stay with another family while times were tough. The trouble was that all my friends and I did on the weekends was drink and take drugs. This escalated through my early adulthood especially living out of home and having no responsibility. Throughout the last decade I have had many periods of alcohol abuse that I knew were inappropriate. I have been spoken to by friends and my sister a few times over the year and always thought that I had a hold of it and I could just cut down or stop. My alcoholism seemed to come in waves of severity so if after drinking every day for 2 months I was  just getting drunk twice a week' I assumed that I had control...These days whilst I don't drink every day every aspect of my drinking is problematic. I no longer socialise very often so most of my drinking I do by myself at home. I hide it from my partner who on many occasions has brought up the issue with me and voiced concern about my drinking. Going from working full-time to studying externally I now have a lot of time to myself at home and it has become a daily struggle. If I'm not drinking that day I'm battling with the urges or I'm already hungover from the day before. I'm fed up with myself. Particularly the secrecy with which I was drinking and the time of day it would start. Whilst drinking I would hate myself for it but couldn't stop. The more worried I would become about study the worse it would get. I have failed to follow through with study in the past and it is such an important goal of mine I just cant believe how much I am self-sabotaging...I finally opened up to my partner and admitted that yes I was an alcoholic and yes I was ready to do something about it. Whilst this always frightened me doing so honestly and with clarity for the first time gave me a sense of relief. The niggling aspects of sobriety that scared me in the past (like the idea of forever the shame etc) now no longer bothered me. We went to our first meeting this morning and he has also opened up about his problematic drinking. Whilst we drank in different ways it was very cathartic to have a discussion about how despite the differences in our own personal drinking it was problematic for both of us...I was floored by the sense of community and outreach that the people who attended the meeting showed. Both my partner and I had a lot of discussions with all different kinds of people and I am really proud of myself for starting this journey. I would not have been able to start by myself without being honest to myself and others and without their support...To help me be accountable and take stock of how I am feeling I will post every week about an aspect of my alcoholism and early days of my recovery as I already have so much to say. Thank you so much for reading..

Glad you've joined us here. I too started attending some meetings very recently and had much the same reaction. The sense of community was very strong. ..I look forward to reading more of your posts here and hope your first week of sobriety goes well.
Proud of you for going!
