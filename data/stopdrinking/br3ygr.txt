I know this sub is for people set on quitting forever but a good start for many people is to at least break the habit and see how they feel without it for a bit. The best way to do this in my opinion is have an accountability buddy. Right now my brother and I each put $100 on the table for a 30 day challenge if one of us relapses we just forfeit our money.  What else  could you incorporate into a challenge either by yourself with a partner or with a group to make it fun?

Joe Rogan and his friends do a sober October and one of their things is doing a fitness challenge as well. You and the other sober people could count steps or something along those lines and whoever wins can get part of money?
