hi just sharing the fact that I WAS a heavy drinker mainly on my own for 15 years...I was drinking initially through low self esteem and social anxiety - caring more about what others were thinking and doing more than what I feel and what actions I take and how I talk to myself...It became habitual to binge at least once a week - my favourite being a litre of Smirnoff and 2-4 litres of coke/coke zero...I wanted to get out of my own head. Escapism. Addiction. ..Now I've been sober for two months I feel and think very differently. I still struggle with a positive self image and encouragement of myself but I don't lean on escapism any more...Through a toolkit meditation and 'sitting with' uncomfortable thoughts and beginning to understand and disect them...My toolkit includes ice cream and sugar if needed calling a free helpline for addiction (ADIS in Australia) and a very important book for me and my escape from escapism - Allan Carr's Control Your Drinking...Giving up alcohol was impossible for me for years. I didn't know I could or how to start. I kept trying and failing. Making myself feel like I was permanently trapped and feeling like even more of a failure. ..I still struggle with feeling worthless and rejection of myself sometimes but I am confident in my sobriety. ..This forum has helped...Good luck to people out there who want to and who are trying to be sober. It's worth it and is possible...Peace xx
