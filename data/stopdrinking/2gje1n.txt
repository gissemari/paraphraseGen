So tonight will be my seventh night in a row to go to sleep sober this is a first for the past 9 years. But for the past hour I've been trying to convince myself to celebrate my week of sobriety by having a beer or two. Today is my Friday I have the next two days off. What could it hurt right? I keep trying to tell myself that ill just drink responsibly and in moderation from now on I've proven that I can quit drinking if I want and now I'm all good to have a few. The only thing that has stopped me is that I want to get tonight under my belt and have a week sober. It's tough... I miss it. Anyways I'm not drinking tonight tomorrow is a new day... Day 8. This is my rant.

Thanks for posting. It's tough right now. Just getting through those thoughts and urges are wins...Anything you can do to get your ya-ya's out without drinking? Go for a run punch a pillow hit the gym? A meeting?
I can't guess how it will be for you but for me it got much better after that first week. Hang in there!
Hello! Congratulations on your 6 days so far! I had to comment because this sounds exactly like what I was thinking: [check it out](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2g39d6/what_to_do_when_your_mind_starts_bargaining/)...And [this reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2g39d6/what_to_do_when_your_mind_starts_bargaining/ckf7zcb) was really really helpful for me. I hope you find it useful as well! I'm 6 nights through and still have that thought that it's not been that long so why not drink and start again next week? But then I remember what an achievement it is for me and I don't want to throw it away! All the best. :)
Day 7 is huge! Nicely done!..For me getting that first week outta the way was a major achievement and then... things started to get a helluva lot better. ..Hopefully it'll be the same for you. Good job and keep up the good work!...
Good for you on being honest /u/chikensdontclap -- that part of you that wants to drink to celebrate your 7 days sober is the dying embers of your alkie brain.  Don't give in and it will get easier.
I can promise you that it will get better and better the farther behind you that last drink gets.  ..The compulsion to drink will leave you...The smooth persuasive voice telling you that  one is OK that you earned it that you have proven to all the doubters that alcohol isn't an issue that NOW you have your shit together that moderation is the key just show a little restraint drink like an adult enjoy it like on the beer commercials...that it will be different this time.  That is the voice of addiction/relapse/alcoholism and it will lead you right back to where you were a week ago.
Very useful tip for me at least in the first 60-90 days schedule those weekends! Anything going to a museum I never went to went to a Friday night football game at the high school 1/2 a mile from my house I wasn't alum and got odd looks from parents being there as a single woman taking in a high school game....anything I could do to schedule my time. On Monday when I made it to work sober I started scheduling my up coming weekend and had a rule to have it full by EOB Friday. Basically took my anal retentive nature and put it to use for good.
