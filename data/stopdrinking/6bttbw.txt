It's day 21 for me today. It's been a ride so far and it's so few days into the journey. ..I've felt like people should praise me. Should feel in awe at my magical ability to stop something that had so much control over me--that they are able to consume in moderation. Look everyone! I'm no longer toying with my lithium pushing it to toxic levels in my body. My skin is starting to glow! I feel good in the morning! Notice! Notice! ..21 days is like a newborn child to the seasoned veterans who have known the struggles and sorrows and most importantly the days filled with fresh air and memories and the feeling of some earned equilibrium. ..But we're all fighting

you da man!
We all have our demons.
Honestly it's the struggle that made finally quitting so rewarding to me in the early days. At this point I really don't even think about drinking and that feeling of success has sort of died down. I think this is why people relapse. Congratulations and enjoy this important foundation that you can refer to later on. 
Nice one on 21 days sober so great to hear!! I am grateful for the cheerleaders of my sobriety of which I am head cheerleader :D
It's always great to have someone notice hopefully all positive though. I had an awkward outing with a few coworkers where they expected me to drink. Doesn't help considering the last time I was with them I bought probably 3 rounds of shots if not more. It was hard to control myself when they offered me shots but it was better knowing after that I decided not to drink. They were also friendly about the whole situation as well but I just said it was for my weight loss. Looks like I'll never truly hit my goal weight when I'm with them.
