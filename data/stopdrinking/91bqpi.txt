To everyone in my life I didn't seem to have a problem. In my moments of weakness on my path to sobriety this thought makes me drink again. I tell myself I'm depriving myself unnecessarily...But it is easy to slip into the pattern of drinking daily. I don't want to depend on alcohol to be sociable to relieve stress to feel good about myself...I struggle with chronic mental illness and it gets sooooo hard. I am 23 and was diagnosed with severe PTSD at 6. I spend every day feeling defective ashamed of myself and uncomfortable. ..I hope that being sober will make me a happier more complete person. Sigh. Unfortunately I don't think it's that easy...I will not have a drink with you today.

&gt; I hope that being sober will make me a happier more complete person. ..For me not drinking has been a huge help. I didn't get happier simply by not drinking but I got the drinking-induced unhappiness out of the way and I could start to address the other things in my life that were in my way.
Yes. Don't let anyone else's perception of you prevent you from making good decisions for yourself. I know how this can be I'm in the same boat. None of my friends think there's anything wrong with my decision making but I know my drinking is a problem. It prevents me from paying bills on time it prevents me from taking care of my health (mental and physical) and these are not things immediately apparent to anyone but me. Stay strong you know yourself better than anyone else. You've got this!..IWNDWYT
