I've been sober for almost 6 months (nov 7 2017) and I just wanted to let you guys know how great life is finally becoming. I struggled to find a job due to 2 DUIs and I finally got a job I love after I was honest with them upfront. I get paid to take teens with substance issues into the woods to camp for weeks at a time. I'm finally getting self esteem back I have a great AA homegroup and sponsor and my relationship with my family is better than it's ever been. I still struggle but I am starting to see that when I don't drink I am capable of so much more and good things tend to happen as long as I'm doing the right thing. I'm just feeling content with life for the first time in a long time and it's hard to get used to. I still feel like the rug may be ripped from under me at any moment but things just keep getting better. If you are struggling don't give up and reach out to others because that is where my strength comes from: other sober people. Thanks for reading guys. ODAAT
