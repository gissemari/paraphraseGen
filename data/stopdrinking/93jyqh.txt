I'm having the worst craving I've had so far. It's to the point where it's literally causing an anxiety attack which I wasn't even aware would happen. My SO is at the store and if he comes back with alcohol (he said he wouldn't but he's an alcoholic too so) then I'm almost certain I will crack. I have a daughter I don't want to be like this for her. My own Mom was an addict I cannot be that for her. Why isn't that thought enough to kill the craving? Why is the need for alcohol overpowering the need to be a good Mom? Am I a bad Mom? I'm so scared. What is wrong with me?

Take a deep breath and have some cold water.  You are a good mom.  Change is scary.  You can do this!
I am a mom and an alcoholic. It would be very difficult for me if someone in the house was drinking. I will be 3 weeks sober tomorrow. How many days do you have? ..IWNDWYT. Hugs.  
Annnnd scrolling through reddit an ad for bulk wine at Winco pops up. Fuck fuck fuckity fuck why is alcohol everywhere? 
Stay strong! The craving will pass.  You can do this.  I believe in you!
Update: He totally fucking came home with alcohol and I don't think I can do this
Take it moment by moment. Take a shower or a bath. Make a cup of tea. You can do this. Our daughters deserve sober healthy moms. IWNDWYT

Go to bed.  Snuggle up with your kiddo and go to bed. ..IWNDWYT
