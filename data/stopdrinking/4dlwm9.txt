hit the month mark yesterday. again. i tried not to make a big deal out of it bc i am realizing time/days don't matter to me. my head hitting the pillow every night sober matters. doing the work and pledging each morning that i will not drink matters...after my relapse i got serious about AA. got a sponsor joined a home group. i went to my home group meeting last night. i was recently given the job to hand out chips and i was terrified. (not sure why my career has me speaking publicly all the time in much more intense situations than an AA meeting!) as i went through the durations of time i was psyching myself up -- got to one month and nervously laughed. "i actually have one month today" i said "and i really don't think i can give myself a chip. can someone come up to the podium please?"..sounds silly but i nearly had a panic attack uttering those words. the warmth of the room quickly calmed my racing heart and a woman came to my rescue handed me a one month chip and embraced me. i didn't really care about my time but i did care to SHARE my time with the people in that room no matter how difficult it was for me to do so. you know how some moments you can just feel yourself growing changing? that was one for sure...i went home happy and exhausted and was so content as my sober head hit the pillow. ..i won't drink today...
