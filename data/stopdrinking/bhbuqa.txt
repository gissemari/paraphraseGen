I posted this in a smaller group but wanted to post here for some feedback since there are a lot of members...For those of you who have kids I was wondering how much you talk with them about these topics or in what ways it has affected them?..Aside from a few boring sundays of me recovering from a hangover... alcohol has never had a huge impact on my daughters life. She's never seen me really drunk or anything. But I got a DWI... I had an interlock installed and due to violating my probabtion after relapsing.. I have lost my license for at least 6 months. We have a support system and ways to get to and from where we need to but I feel like a total shit mom and I dont know how to even talk with her about this...She knows about the DWI because I had to address the interlock and probabtion visits so she wouldn't worry about that. But now with me not being able to drive I have to address that...She is 9 years old almost 10. She's my only and she's a mature 9 for sure. I don't want her to worry to see me as a drunk or feel unstable in any way. But I do want to be honest and show her that - people mess up then clean up their messes move on and grow from their mistakes. I grew up in a family that swept everything under the rug and did not benefit from that method of coping.

When my kids were growing I did not drink.  I talked all the time about it.  They both drink and started in high school.  I started after they left home.  ..The society and media are a bigger influence then parents
I have a son your daughters age and they definitely know what is going on even if we don't drink or get drunk in front of them. I have told my son that I would like to drink less alcohol because it is not good for the body. When I have some decent sober time I plan to have talk with him more. .One year on a vacation we witnessed a young woman who was wasted coming back to the hotel from a bachelorette party. She could not walk fell and then puked all over herself (and me who was trying to help her). My son witnessed it and asked what was wrong and I told him she had too much alcohol. He said "woah I'm never going to drink alcohol!" I think when they see the consequences they might be more careful about their decisions.
