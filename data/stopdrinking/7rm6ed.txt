Well another day down and another day not drank. Positivity has been radiating today even though not much has happened and it's been relatively uninteresting listened to a couple of albums ate (important and achievement for me) went to work and now home in bed ready for a good nights sleep...A few weeks ago I would have laughed at myself if I said I would be in bed by half 10 every night as I never go to bed or can sleep until 2/3am normally. But no here I am tucked up and happy...Hope Friday has been treating you all well I know it's a struggle just being that day of the week but wishing you all the best and that tomorrow is another great day for all :).

Goodnight to you. IWNDWY tomorrow. 
The last two for me have been tough. Walking home past a crowd of early evening  drinkers. Being asked if I fancied a quick half at half four by a client (great excuse for a skive...). ..But I didn't drink and I found myself picking my daughter up at 9.00pm instead of my wife who always had to because I'd had too much to drink by then....And you know what? I found I liked being out in the car late. The amber glow of the street lamp the quiet backstreets the dog walkers out for one last time the cold darkness...IWNDWYT
