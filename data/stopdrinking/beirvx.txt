So I slept through the night last night only waking up to a coughing fit (just getting over a sinus infection which gave me a cough). It's been so long since I've slept through the night like I did last night. I never blamed alcohol for my irregular sleep although I'm seeing now that I should have. ..I have also lost a little weight in the past few days and I'm not eating as much (but still eating normally) So alcohol also messed with my appetite in crazy ways too. ..I'm struggling still but am thankful for the small progress I am making.

Well done - keep going! It's amazing when realise how poisonous alcohol is and frustrating that it is so glamorized!
Congrats! It's my day 6 as well. Glad you're sleeping through the night I'm not there yet.
