**TL;DR** You're most likely always going to be an addict so don't pretend otherwise...If any of you have seen the Passages Malibu commercial that advertises its Rehabilitation facility you have also heard the line that always manages to stick with me *"I was an addict for 10 years now I'm not"*..To me addiction isn't something that goes away; there is no special cure. For most you will struggle with addiction for most of your life and though it may get easier by no means does it mean that you are not still addicted. (Although of course there may be some that can go back to drinking in moderation without it *eventually* leading to binges). ..I feel like this line of thinking is what leads one of us thinking that it's okay to have that beer or glass of wine just because *we're not addicted anymore*. I really don't mean to be offensive this is just my perception of it. I'd love to hear opinions on it..

We are 'recovering' never 'was' in my mind.  I don't think we ever stop recovering. One slip and we go back to 'being' if that makes any sense.  
I've seen that commercial and I hate that line too. 
That commercial is awkward in general. It's like the jake from State Farm of addiction commercials.
Once you've been addicted to something in the long run from what I understand your brain had undergone neural remodeling so that the addictive substance activates your dopamine reward circuit (just as it does for biologically necessary behaviour like eating and sex). No matter how long you have gone without the substance that neural remodeling persists.

I totally agree with you......That said CA claims that once you have been through "recovery" you are "recovered" and no longer an addict..I personally think this is a very dangerous mindset.
