During the week it's relatively easy but man comes the weekend and it's like ultra resistance. Am I the only one?

this weekend is the first time in months that i've just hung out at home. i have a lot of friends but most of our social life revolves around alcohol. to say I'm struggling would be an understatement.
Its always going to be there. Every day i have urges. I just remember how i felt the last time i drank. But every day i stay sober it gets a little better. Dont let the urge snowball into a burning desire.
I have some pastry and I get outdoors a lot. It definitely took a while to break the mental association between alcohol and the weekend but now I no longer feel that. IWNDWYT
Nah. I'm struggling too. I finally FINALLY hit my day 7 and I'm feeling great except all I can think about is having *just* *one*. .In fact the reason I didn't slip today (besides y'all's support) is the fact I'm sitting in the ER (unrelated issues). I was totally planning on sneaking a frozen marg. .Stay strong. I won't drink with you today; will you not drink with me?
Yes and no. I've given up other things in my life that caused true fitful cravings and painful withdrawal. With alcohol I just have this beneath the surface dull ache. As in I dont feel like myself I feel restless and trapped and want to escape. ..I feel like this shouldn't be a struggle as I already feel better physically and I'm seeing the benefits of being more present with my family. Yet it is l and I find myself wrestling with my thoughts that are whispering "Just drink it wasn't that bad it's who you are"...Our addictions speak to us using our own voice.
