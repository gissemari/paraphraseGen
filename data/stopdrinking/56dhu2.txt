Today is officially the longest I have gone without alcohol since I first seriously attempted sobriety over a year ago. I have had a pretty rough time in both my personal and professional life the past few weeks and there have been many triggers. It's almost like a challenge to see how much I can take without running back to alcohol to help me cope. But here I am sober and grateful to be. I am so thankful for SD and all of you that share your real struggles and victories. You all inspire me to keep moving forward.  I will not drink today.

Watch out for a very special brand of confusion! ..First congrats on being stronger this time around! ..But now watch out that now you've passed your record and I presume you can make the juicy 50 day mark that you have this "expanse of numerical nothing" right after it! ..So maybe give some thought how to make new goals in between the numbers! ..
I have relapsed on the 45 day mark not once but twice! Today is day 45. I'm not going to drink especially today. I need to break the curse.
Congrats that's an achievement! I remember day 45 and going to a meeting all sour-faced and saying "I'm grumpy and depressed and I hate everything and sobriety sucks" lol! It's just a hard time to get through. But you can! I don't count the days much anymore I just let the badge do it for me. :)
