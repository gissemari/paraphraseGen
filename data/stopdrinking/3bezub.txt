I'm 29 and I think Thursday was the day I decided to stop drinking for good...I've been a binge drinker since late high school (stopped for 4 years because of anxiety/depression) and my tolerance is pretty absurd. I mainly just go out with friends on the weekend but I don't think it's normal at all for my age to still go 'hard in the paint' like this or as frequently as I do. My dad died 5 years ago and I definitely used drinking as a crutch. I got drunk as hell every weekend to avoid it and my ex-girlfriend left me because of it. My mom developed a problem with pills and drinking to cope with my dad's death to the point where my sister and I had to take her to the ER and put her into rehab. She has been sober for 4 years up until this past month.....Shes's relapsed horribly and my sister and I are still trying to piece together what happened. Seeing a parent like this is something I wouldn't wish on anyone and I never want to put someone through what we're dealing with...Up until Thursday I still binge drank. Not every day not really ever alone but I still went hard. I don't really enjoy having a few beers with dinner or whatever is normal I pretty much only enjoy binge drinking and again my tolerance is absurd. ..This February I drank enough to black out and get a concussion walking home from the bar. Two Fridays ago I missed my flight home from LA at 7:10am because after a work event and going out with coworkers instead of going to sleep I decided to drink beers from the hotel mini-fridge and 'just party until my flight' so I could sleep on both planes on the way home. Decided I could just 'rest my eyes' and slept through my alarms...After binge drinking the last think I want to do is drink again unless it's like a bachelor party or something and it's a whole weekend event but my hangovers are heavy...but I'll still want to do it again the next weekend...I don't know if I'm an alcoholic an alcohol abusing idiot or what but it needs to stop. ..From here should I got AA ANON or just go it alone? I'm definitely connecting with my therapist that I stopped seeing tomorrow bc I need to talk to someone about what's going on...TLDR- not sure if I qualify as an alcoholic but I've done enough stupid things while binge drinking that it needs to stop especially with it running in the family.

I struggled trying to figure out if I was an alcoholic as well. The truth is there really is no form fit mold for what constitutes an "alcoholic". What it boils down to is that you have a desire to make a change in your life for the positive. When it comes to sobriety there are many different avenues you can take advantage of to help you. The load of fully undertaking a sober lifestyle can be very difficult to manage alone which is when many people severely struggle. This sub is where I started and then moved on to attending weekly AA meetings as I became more comfortable and stable. I was coming off of a massive ten year drug induced and alcoholic path that had I remained on would have left me dead or in jail. I am now on track for a promotion at my work my liver is almost completely recovered and I have never been more content psychologically. Everyone has their own preferences but the key is to be open to use any tools at your disposal to remain sober one day at a day. I hope this helps you and good luck!
Congrats on your decision to stop!.I quit with the help of a prescription my psychiatrist gave me called Campral.  I took it for about 4 weeks and dropped it.  My insurance had issues covering it and it was expensive!  It cuts alcohol cravings a LOT though but it's 6 pills a day.  I didn't get any withdrawals from dropping Campral.  ..Other than that I can credit THIS SUB!!! and [The Easy Way To Stop Drinking](http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Way-Stop-Drinking/dp/1402736479/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435513145&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=allen+carr+stop+drinking) in helping me get sober and stay sober.  I checked the book out from my library 2x and read through the first half both times (I seem to do this with a lot of nonfic books regardless of the topic).  That was enough to get me thinking.  The book is kinda goofy lol but really it makes you think of things in a different way.  It's worth picking up and I didn't pay a penny for it.  I came here to SD multiple times a day in the beginning.  During the holiday season (my first sober holidays in 8 years!) I was on here almost all day long.  Reading posts replying trying to help encourage people to stay strong.  Posting if I felt like I needed to get some encouragement myself.  We all know what we're going through and we know it's fucking hard.
