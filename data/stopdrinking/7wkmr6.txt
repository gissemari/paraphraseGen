Off to a meditation AA meeting  tonight as struggling to stay mindfully sober. Have no idea what it will entail but I'm going! If it helps me to keep sober just for today I'm in

You've got this friend! Just deciding to go is huge!
One day at a time. Take what works for you and leave the rest. Plus I've heard rumours of free coffee and cookies.....?
I recently started as well after trying on an off for decades by myself (never got more than two years) and I'm going to do the 90 in 90 thing. I felt a good sense of hope after the first one and I was feeling very low when I walked in. I'd also been lonely for months and having human contact again and people coming up and really caring how you're doing was amazing. Tell me what meditation meeting is when you're get back! I have "ID Meeting" in the morning and don't know what that is either. I've been to open format big book study book study (living sober) and one step meeting so far. 
I'm going to my first this morning too. I've been on and off drinking for two years. This sub helps a lot along with my therapist but I want to stop and stay stopped for good. I am going whole hog this time.
Meditation yoga and health and fitness in general has been a massive sticking point for me. It's basically replaced the years of self abuse with self care and love. ..Enjoy! ..
Looking forward to hearing more about your journey!
