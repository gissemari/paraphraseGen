We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together! Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and I invite you to do the same...Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and having a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink *we make a conscious decision not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is**: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...*****************************.This post goes up at: ..* US - Night/Early .* Morning Europe - Morning .* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...******************************..** I'm thankful for my struggle because without it I wouldn't have stumbled upon my strength. ** ~Alex Elle

Heh it's 5am and I'm up cleaning the house. I have some people coming over this morning from work to go over a few things. Of course I've know about this meeting for a week now but I do things at the last minute (that seems to be my MO). Even though I have not been drinking I have not kept the place spotless. But it's great that other than being a little sleepy from getting up a little after 4am I am sober and getting food and coffee in me and the house will be clean. Good morning SD I will not be drinking today. Have a great day everyone.

I will not drink today no matter what.  I totally resonate with that quote.  I have gotten to know myself so much better and what I am capable of through the challenges over the last 5 years.  It hasn't been pretty but it has really given me greater respect and acceptance towards myself.
