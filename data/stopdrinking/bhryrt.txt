But realized I had to be honest with myself and admit that I'm not 100% sure about quitting ALL substances. I was a near daily drinker but drugs = more of a social  fun  thing than as an escape. I was a near daily drinker and could not control it. I posted earlier today about trying to be 100% sober (no alcohol + no drugs) but in reality I don't feel ready with that the way I do with alcohol alone...Will this change? I have no idea. But I feel like I need to meet myself where I'm at. That's what I'm doing with alcohol now and I feel more hopeful than I ever have rather than feeling like I'm fighting with myself. It's like I'm on my own team for once...I'm posting this in hopes that I can still be accepted here in my quest to stop alcohol - I know for sure I want to stop drinking. I want to be honest with myself meet myself where I truly am and work my way up from there...I'm sure I'm not the only one who struggles with this. If you are comfortable sharing your experience with me I think it would help me to gather others' viewpoints on this struggle...Day 3 without alcohol and want to keep counting. Thank you for your support so far SD it's been priceless.

It might be too much to quit everything at once. I think if you're using multiple substances (that always bugged me too how it's "drugs *and* alcohol" like alcohol isn't a drug) and alcohol is causing you the most trouble then I think it's just fine to start with alcohol. ..I would bet most people here are daily users of caffeine and probably a sizeable minority are daily users of nicotine as well. There are of course other subs for people wishing to get off caffeine/nicotine and other drugs as well. I myself have had repeated unsuccessful attempts to stop using caffeine (the most recent in March - I made it 5 days) and I would consider myself "sober" though I am currently addicted to caffeine and consumed some this morning. ..I loom at it like I am sober from alcohol (because I have not had a drop of alcohol in 352 days) but not caffeine. If I were on r/decaf I would have had several hundred badge resets these past 11 months. ..So I'd look at it the same way for other drugs. Welcome!
