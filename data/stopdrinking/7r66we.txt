im struggling to get signed in here. Not sure if I've got it right. Just let me me know... I've been trying to quit drinking for a long time. Many stops and starts... but I'll never give up trying.

Looks like you're here to me! Welcome :)
You're here. Welcome!..What have you tried for quitting drinking?..What's your why?
Wel!!
Welcome. I've found that posting here and reading other's posts really helps me. Also grabbing a badge (here https://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/) might help as you will see the days add up. The "symbols" you referred to may be people's badges. Try to be a friend to yourself and pat yourself on the back for continuing to try. You'll find like minded folks here who understand the struggles you experience. Best of luck.
