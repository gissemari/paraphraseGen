So I woke up this morning without a hangover - granted I did sleep in really late but I gave myself that. Went to work then went grocery shopping - and I was really tested. I passed by the beer aisle several times deciding whether I wanted to buy "just a couple" and I even ended up putting two (10%) beers in my cart. But I put them back! I circled around a few more times struggling with not picking them back up...but I didn't...Then I went bowling with my friends like I usually do on Thursdays which is usually a big trigger for me because everyone drinks in bowling alleys. However I asked my boyfriend to come with me to make sure I wouldn't drink. He told me how proud he was of me after and I was too. I feel really great about it and now I'm sipping on some tea watching TV and playing flash games. Tomorrow I'll wake up not worried that I said something stupid or hurtful and I'll remember everything about the shows I watched!..Side note: bowled better than usual!

Congrats. The first days are the hardest so hang in there. One thing that can be helpful in the early days is to figure out and avoid triggers. If bowling is a big trigger for you can you avoid bowling for a while? I avoided bars for a while. Now it's not an issue but early one it was risky. ..Last place I drank was at a bowling alley. I've been bowling since--but my game hasn't improved. 
I'm really glad your day ended well. I think it was very wise of you to reach out to your BF for support. We get sober for ourselves but we don't have to do it alone.
