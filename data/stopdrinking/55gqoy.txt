I had 72 days over this past summer. I felt better got back into good shape committed to a half marathon got myself in order academically started seeing an awesome girl saved money improved my cooking and was just enjoying life in general. I relapsed and got a DUI almost immediately and have yet to regain traction in sobriety. For anyone considering picking up take my word for it don't. I know I have to recommit or this will end with me losing everything. And probably sooner more so than later. For me that means going back to AA owning up to the relapse and going back to my therapist ASAP. If you're on the verge of relapse please don't. We all know it's not worth it or I doubt we would be here. Stay safe and vigilant out there folks. And for tonight I won't be drinking.

I'm glad you're back /u/champs5710. What did you forget? 
Glad you're back. We're here for you.
Welcome back that for reminding me. Been thinking a beer wouldn't hurt all weekend!
Some of my thoughts have been a bit alarming lately. This post helped. I'm sure you and many others will learn from your mistake.
So glad you are back.  Was going through some old posts and wondered how you were doing.  Keep me sober today!

Welcome back. I'm with ya.
Hey there  fall down nine times get up ten.  You got up don't be so hard in yourself. You're doing the right thing now.  Good luck!! 
Welcome back. I know from experience that relapsing and having "just one drink" does not work for me. It is admirable to see that you are picking yourself back up again. I will not drink with you today.
