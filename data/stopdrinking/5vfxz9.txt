I'd only made it one day but was feeling confident I wouldn't drink. I didn't make it through day 2. I caved on the way home from work and stopped at the liquor store and spent the evening drinking again. ..This is disappointing but there is some good news. Before when I've relapsed I end up drinking every day for a couple weeks before I try quitting again but this time I'm straight back to not drinking today. ..I'm here every day reading these SD posts and that's made all the difference. I will not drink today.

I won't drink with you today! 
Great job coming right back.  It takes a lot of strength to not give up.  That time right after work can sure be tough.  We're glad you're back and I won't drink with you today!
