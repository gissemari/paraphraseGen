At the end of 2017 I realized I needed to stop drinking after a particularly terrible bender. I managed to avoid booze for 24 days until I decided to resume my normal social activities (which is primarily hanging out with friends in bars). At first I thought I was able to moderate. I even managed to go out to bars and avoid booze altogether. The moderating behavior didn't last long and a little over two weeks ago I blacked out made a fool of myself and realized I was right back where I started. I swore off alcohol again and avoided drinking for a week. Then I went to hang out with friends and I immediately ended up drinking for two days straight. Now here I am 7 days in again and realizing I'm going to have to completely restructure my social life. My friends are good people and I love them like family. Unfortunately all of them struggle with substance abuse issues like myself and I can't be around the casual degeneracy like it's no big deal anymore. I know that I'm going to lose some of them going through this process but I've made peace with that. I'd rather be alone and sober than spend one more hungover day in bed with the covers over my head in shame. ..IWNDWYT

You're to be commended for recognizing the pattern. It's a hard slog I know.  ...Good luck with everything.  ...I might suggest talking to a doctor as well. He can help set you up with support. There's often more available than just AA but you need to go through a referral to access them.
If you currently have friends you love like family then surely you have the wit and personality that can help you find more friends. This time not in a bar setting. ..In the past I had drinking friends that I absolutely loved like family. But when I tried to not drink those friendships vanished in thin air. Not on my end but on theirs. It was disappointing but eye-opening too. I'm not saying it's the same for you but oftentimes I feel like drinking friends are built on well drunkenness and getting maudlin and sentimental together and at the same time enabling each other. It's a heady mix but not very healthy. You do what's right for you. IWNDWYT.
