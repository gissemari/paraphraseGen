I made it back to two weeks. Wow. This went fast...Although at the same time I need to stop lying to myself. There were some urges slight ones these last few days. But I've stayed strong despite my coworker still not letting up in asking me to go out and drink with him. I'm planning on moving out pretty sure into a better living situation (still another roommate that is aware of my no alcohol in the house rule and my problems with it) where I can get my cat back and be closer to work and school...I need to be wary and awake. Alcohol is awful. I'm scared if I move out from this thing I have going now I'll fall back into the binges but at the same time- I feel like I just can't drink like that anymore...I'm sure some of you know what I mean. I could sure. If I really wanted to. But I don't want to. I want other things. I want peace. I want good goals. I want to play a video game sober instead of passing out with throw up all over me...I feel like benders are part of my old life- it's weird to say that in it only being about 6 months since I really last was insane- but we can change dramatically in such short time. I remember hearing that at AA. Boy is it true...That's all I've got. Maybe my post can help someone who had a recent relapse too. You can get back on the wagon. I did. I threw 156 days away but now I have 14 back. What matters is determination in the right path and deciding each new day you won't drink...Cheers with this nice cup of coffee mates you rock

Glad to see you back man.
156 is pretty remarkable.  No reason you can't hit the mark and surpass it this time!  ..Peace.  That sounds nice.  Not drinking gives me hope.  ..Hang in there!
