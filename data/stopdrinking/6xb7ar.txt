Honestly it is still a struggle for me on some days and I often don't feel quite as cheery as everyone else on here seems to be. Sometimes it's hard to relate. But I thought I'd post and celebrate the milestone a little bit. I had some tasty Mexican food today. I've discovered that after a lifetime of agony from no sleep at some point in the last few years I must have lost my insomnia (will never know exactly when b/c I would just pass out drunk every night before going sober). This is great news because it was always a reason to keep drinking I'd never sleep otherwise. I am at my goal weight which is a result of stopping drinking and going to the gym regularly because it's fun and I'm not too hungover. ..My anxiety has lessened considerably from day to day. It's still there but I'm not 100% uncomfortable all the time. ..Unfortunately outside of the company of my husband and one close friend I don't really like being around people anymore. This I would say is my biggest hurdle. But I am getting to know myself who am I really? What do I like how do I feel? It was impossible to do so before over the din of alcohol.

Congrats on 100 Days of Sobriety! Some days are easy...other days not so much. But no matter how bad the day was as long as my head hits that pillow sober then I have reason to celebrate.
Congratulations on 100 days!  Having recently passed that milestone myself I think of three months or so as a real turning point.  As far as not being cheery I'm as tragicomically crabby and sarcastic as ever so don't worry if it's not all puppies fairies and unicorns for you.  Sobriety is not some magical panacea that transforms all of the many annoying bastards in the world into genial delightful companions on the journey of life.  In fact now that you can see hear and smell them more clearly they're possibly even more annoying:). But you're not drinking you're at your goal weight and life is otherwise going pretty well for you?  That's  fantastic.  Keep it up!   And as we say around these here parts "I will join you in not drinking today."  
Congrats!
I felt the same way at day 100.  I felt much better and more social around day 200.  Keep going.
Congrats! I was bursting with energy during the second month but my energy has fizzled lately. I blame the hot weather. We shall see. I'm right behind you daywise. 
Congrats on your 100! I also understand the not wanting to be around people. I too feel the same way. But the way I look at it is "anything is better than where I was so if being alone is where I need to be then so be it"... here's to another 24 hours.

Happy 100th day  
Happy 9.33 x 10^157th day
Congratulations! 100 days is so awesome! :) I don't like being around people much either. My wife is the same way and does not drink at all (I lucked out here lol)...I'm having all of your same developments. I have never known myself as an adult sober. The last time I was sober this long I was 18 years old. I'm  35 now. This is all now about me finding out who the hell I really am so I'm with you on that too...I've recently decided to do some workout trimming in the form of modedate weight training. I never would have considered that before as something other than a chore society would want me to do. But now it feels so interesting and exciting :)..Anyways got off track here. Just wanted to say "Congdats" and I will not drink with you today!
this was a really relatable post.  I don't know if I love being around people anymore either I was really into socializing before now it truly can be very meh and it depends more on who I'm with.  You're clearly ahead of me so I can't truly speak from experience but I think you just gotta stay the course and you/you're brain start getting more comfortable without the alcohol it got used to.  I think it just takes a decent amount of time.  congrats to you and don't lose faith.  I won't drink with you today.
Congratulations! 
I relate to this so much. Thank you for sharing.
Congratulations! That is great news. 100 days is my next goal I'm currently on day 60. I know own exactly what you mean about getting to know yourself. Sometimes it's like just waking up looking around and thinking wow so this is my life and this is where I live.
I'm only uncomfortable 70% of the time now  
Congratulations on 100 days! .I am not there yet but I have the same issues at the moment..I am not feeling all rainbows and unicorns..I too suffer from anxiety and while it has gone down it is still there but I am only at 30 days. When does it get better?.I used alcohol for my social anxiety and also stay away from people now. I have a very supportive husband who does not drink but otherwise don't have anybody to hang out with. But I really don't mind. I have a dog! Lol 2 actually...and a cat and a rabbit... They keep me company..well the rabbit not so much..lol..Anyway congratulations again!
Keep it up!  I feel you on a lot of what you said you are still at the early stages of sobriety.  It only gets better.
Congrats. And remember this is an internet forum for support things will seem a lot more cheery than they are. There are a lot of fighting to be strong and being brave. I imagine there are those still struggling daily with anxiety depression etc. - me included. What I'm trying to say is that you're not alone. And don't be afraid to reach out if you need it. 
Congratulations! I can relate it's strange that in the course of (drunk) time we kind of lose ourselves or the feeling of who we are. But now we have the chance to start a knew life and i'm very much looking forward to live a sober life  . I will not drink with you today!
Congrats! I'm not always cheery either 
congratulations. it may not seem like it - but your 100 days are a big inspiration to alot of us - me included.  
Happy 100!
Congrats on your 100 days! .
