I've been doing a lot of work travel lately. In the last 3 months I haven't had any real close calls with drinking but I fear I came close before I got lunch...I was trying to decide what to eat something quick or a sit-down. It's on the company dime so usually I'd maximize the value by going sit-down but that would've likely meant sitting at a bar I've drank at many many times...Thankfully I didn't give it much thought and the second I realized that might be a compromising situation I just grabbed a sandwich instead...If you see my last post I've also been struggling with vaping lately which has never been a major vice in my life. I quit on Wednesday last week after a couple of months and I have been feeling very cranky ever since...I think between attempting to give that up some mild stress about a big work meeting for the week and whatever else I'm pushing myself harder than I realize...Not all bad news though I've been reading "The Power of Habit" mostly as a way to get more into exercise but unsurprisingly it also is super relevant for addiction. One argument the book makes is habits can not go away only replaced. This seems like it could explain the addiction"whack-a-mole" I've been playing lately...I've actually taken up drinking coffee though never in the afternoon. I think next time I have a pang I might try having a cup of coffee. Even if it might make it a little harder to sleep at least I could have a way to give myself that "stimulation" I always seem to be searching for.

Oh and IWNDWYT!
Thank you for the book name drop. I will be checking that out tomorrow at the library as well as other I have written down from here. One of them has to catch my eye I am sure.
