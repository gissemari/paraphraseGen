I have 35 wasted years and 80 passing days and am also determined.  I don't see a comeback from a relapse. Depend on this site as I have no close access to AA which really works for some.  
I look back at the craving and urges that almost took me out and wonder "what the hell was I thinking?".  Alcoholism is complex and cunning.  Thanks for the encouragement and have a good day my friend!!!  Thank you!
It's like a plane taking off in bad weather. Once you start climbing through the clouds into the sunlight it becomes a lot easier. ..Keep going!!
