Gotta say it's been a struggle. I was incarcerated May 10th and somewhere in the beginning of October I drank some hooch. I shouldn't have but I let my environment and clouded head get to me. But since my release (October 14th) I've had a few close calls. I don't want to drink any more. Ive noticed a lot lf self growth. Even my supervisor looks out for me a true O.G. He's been to prison and motivates me to stay sober. Gotta say it feels great to be sober. Almost two months. (Imma go with my release date) Not today or any other day Satan. I will not drink with you.

So you got almost five months sober there? May - Oct? That sounds like a great start to build off of.  Welcome!

Great work! Keep on working it. It has made my life so much better. I used to have to fight for every success. Now I just do the next right thing and success is built in. IWNDWYT
