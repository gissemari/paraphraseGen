Not here right now to discuss my sobriety or why i'm choosing this pathway. ..Feel like my life is getting back where i want it. My finances are better in tow and i feel better energy wise and everything. ..I signed up for a job interview on monday but im kind of feeling eh about it right now. I lost my kushy job about 2 years ago and have struggled to get back to my comfort level career and financially wise. This is a position that would get me into a different industry but involves poor pay and shitty work. Its alcohol sales merchandising (I know sorry SD) but whats hitting me is the need for a drug test. I enjoy MJ and get frustrations in the work world beyond this bump in the road. Specificially i get frustrated at inefficiencies yet also am terrified of the situation of our world once we lose a large mass of jobs due to AI. I don't consider this career to be safe because retail is going to die. This interview is going to be with 4 hiring managers that probably arent going to have a job once that happens either because 1 person and a computer will be doing 10 of their jobs at once...I dont know. I'm frustrated at a lot of things and also at myself. I wasted college getting an 80k piece of paper in a competitive STEM. Didnt have the motivation to go to a professional school after. Kicking myself for not slaving away at being a software engineer but I'm not sure if those guys are happy either...Idk what to do about the interview. I feel like the deafest ears will be at that interview while I'm trying to explain why chronic alcohol users are less reliable then chronic mj users. I bought fake urine already but i'm feeling really meh about the whole thing. But I feel stuck in my shitty life. ..At least i've controlled my drinking? Idk.

They might not care about MJ. I've heard more and more stories of employers disregarding positive MJ tests.
