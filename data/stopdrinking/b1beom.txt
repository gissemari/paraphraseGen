I'm traveling on business and came back tonight to find my key wouldn't open the door. In fact I was doubting I was even at the right room. I kept tapping my card but I could have sworn I remembered sticking a card in to open it before. Maybe I had the wrong room?!  Maybe I was doing the lock wrong?..Went through my mind -- am I crazy? Do I remember the room correctly?  Am I opening the door wrong?? All things I struggle with when drunk. The irony -- I had just come from an AA meeting I looked up...Turns out the hotel had CHANGED ALL THE LOCKS during the day. Way to completely freak me out. They gave me a new key and I went back to my room to eat Goldfish...Here's to traveling sober renting a car (something I never felt ok to do when I was drinking) and new meetings :) got my 6 month chip today!  It's hard to believe. My cravings have been really really bad lately. I'm still really grateful I'm not drinking..
