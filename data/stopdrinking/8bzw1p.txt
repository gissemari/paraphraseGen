I never thought this could happen to me when I 1st started this journey it was all I could do to get 2 days back to back.  Then I could get 3 and then relapse then I'd get to a week or two weeks and relapse etc...  Last year I spent 2/3 of my year sober.  Now this year I've made it to a full 60 days in a row.  Every day counts keep going do. not. give. up!

Every day past 32 is a new record for me. Not giving up. :)
Congrats friend! I won't drink with you today!

Awesome congrats man!!!
Congrats!! This is awesome. 
Congrats!
I'll meet you at 60 tomorrow. Great job!
The coolest thing about beating your record is that every next consecutive day is beating your record!  Even if I screw off at work and eat bad food if I don't drink I'm still winning in that sense!
Nicely done!  I don't know exactly where my old record stands but I'm almost certain that I passed it sometime over the last couple of days... feels pretty good.  I'm getting pretty excited to hit 50 soon!
Every day counts. Good point. It's like gaining momentum. .
