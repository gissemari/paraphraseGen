It's Wednesday again. [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53VdglB9wwQ) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** My mother and her family are British and I lived outside London for several years as kid and again when I was in my early twenties. But I left and haven't gone back because I knew I couldn't travel while drinking the way I wanted to (meaning *all day every day)* and also because I had gotten so fat and bloated that I was ashamed to be seen by the people I knew when I lived there and I was young and slender. Well I now am no longer bloated and also am no longer a prisoner in my own home because of alcohol so I am planning a trip to England in the spring. Being able to go back is **huge** for me -- and it is a direct result of my sobriety...**Struggle:** My mother is constantly asking me  How did you ever manage to stop drinking? Considering the *huge amount* of liquor you used to drink and how *incredibly addicted* you were it's really quite remarkable that you were actually able to quit.  These comments feel like insults that are masquerading as compliments and it's hard to know how to respond to them...**General:** Apparently in England the word  pants  really means  underpants.  I once told a British man in a pub  I like your pants  and he reacted with astonishment. (My friends later explained my mistake. In my defense he was wearing a pair of wonderful black-and-white striped trousers.) ..
----------immediate responses--------

*Triumph*: I'm seeing Alanis Morissette tonight. She's meant so much to me for so long. ..*Struggle*: I'm going to the concert with a friend tonight...She's my main trigger for drinking and we've never spent a sober night together. I've been dreading this night all month despite the fact that I'm so looking forward to the concert. My other friends have been warning me not to let her lead me astray... This is the strongest I'll need to be yet. WISH ME LUCK! :3..*General*: I'm hoping for  Ironic' and  Thank U' these two songs have really been meaningful for me for years. 
Hello SD. Today is gonna be stressful and "dangerous" but no alcohol is going through my throat! IWndwyt!..PS  ask me tomorrow how injecting alcohol was!
Triumph: We had a snow day yesterday and I was so productive. I was able to read part of a book watch a few tv episodes sort recycling do dishes clean floors roll out homemade noodles bake some goodies scoop the driveway and sidewalk and get quality time in with the new puppers. Had I been drinking I would have accomplished the first two items listed. Maybe. ..Struggle: Went from a zero pet household to a two pet household in the same day. It takes some dedication to work on training two little balls of energy early. Also. I've been sober for 26 days and I am just so tired. All the time. And! I got emotional at work tonight at some random little comment that shouldn't have gotten to me. Yay for both of those things. ..General: Life is so good right now. I've had cravings but I've been using the HALT method to understand why. Aside from that I'm just so content and happy. Like ridiculously gracious for everything. It's   wonderful. 
Triumph: honestly can't remember the last time I was sober for this long. My thinking and talking to people is so much clearer I feel great in myself. So glad I did this. ..Struggle: not losing any fucking weight at all and the money I would have spent on drinking that I should be saving I've spent on a bunch of other random junk. Looks like I have more impulse control problems than I thought hooray...General: Rewatching The West Wing it's the fucking best I wish I could be mates with CJ Cregg in real life. 
**Triumph:** I've attended AA meetings a few nights in a row now and am working up the courage to find a sponsor. Both good things...**Struggle:** I found out I wasn't shortlisted for a job I'd applied for which stings. Feeling pretty low...**General:** No longer floating atop the pink cloud. Shit's getting real.
**Triumph:** I did a gig with a new to me orchestra at the weekend they asked me to do their remaining gigs this year...**Struggle:** A combination of work and poor weather has meant I've hardly been on my bike for a few weeks. I'm looking forward to the better weather that's coming.....**General:** According to my therapist I've got a preoccupation with vengeance...We'll see about that...
Triumph: I got out of bed at the time I was supposed to and was actually awake today!..Struggle: back to college since the christmas break due to illness now have lots to catch up on...General: I have a really long day today but I'm awake and really happy and motivated to have an excellent day possible...Have a great day guys :).
Triumph: not drinking last night despite crippling anxiety.Struggle. Anxiety and depression are hitting me very hard at the moment. Got a text from my boss saying she wants to see  me on friday. had an unannounced lesson observation on Monday.  this flipped me out completely..general: I have a lovely family who are the best reason to stay sober
Triumph: I made my company a little shy of a half a million dollars yesterday and I did not drink despite being tempted to at the end of the day..Struggle: work was really really rough for me yesterday because I'm the process of making that money I did a few operation things wrong. When I mess stuff up at work I tend to really beat myself up over it. I also haven't been sleeping well this week and had a chronic health issue flare up severely so I was super ill all day. Kind of worried about keeping my job. Got so overwhelmed/worn down I almost quit. And I still have 42 hours left to work this week! ..General: weirdly enough I had a dream I was dating my boss after all of that. It was odd kinda realizing that I am attracted to him. Not sure if it's Stockholm syndrome or what. Went to a meeting this week where we discussed our ideal partner and he fits some of the criteria so not sure if that was in my head still or what. I clearly need to take some time off work for my mental health. Grateful next week I'm only working 24 hours.
Usual names for underpants also include knickers kecks grundies boxers briefs undies... I usually use pants more to mean something is rubbish / useless / crappy ... eg drinking is pants .....Where in England will you visit? I'm up north :)
Triumph - doing all the activities I had promised kiddo we would get out and do today as part of this last week of her summer holidays - and being fully present and engaged with the activities and with her all afternoon/evening..Struggle - getting fully back into high-octane work mode while mentally prepping for upcoming legal wrangling with toxic ex-in laws..General: posted a very simple statement on my FB [only some family and some very trusted friends see my FB page posts] "no wine for three weeks now. Kinda liking the side-effects." My [really very special] relatives on Mom's side [where alcoholism is an acknowledged and open problem] knew exactly what I meant and gave it a thumbs up. No more really needed saying to them :) 
T: I have found contentment in just being. Just sitting at home with a cup of tea reading having a nice bath with candles in complete silence without a glass of wine. Content. It is a lovely feeling..S: I have just started with a chest infection so all of the food I am eating due to not drinking (sugary things mainly) will not be worked off until I am feeling better..never mind. I will get there. ..G: I spelt wine wrong (wind!) in my triumph above...am I forgetting what it is already :-).
Triumph: Signed up for my second 5k of the year. I'm trying to do one a month. ..Struggle: work is so stressful. I know it's the same everywhere and looking for a new job is like do I want to hate my life in a new building?  (Not my original joke but so true)..General: I learned opossums are immune to most poisons. Huh! Didn't know that.  
**Triumph**.Lost eight pounds since I stopped drinking (I'm ~80 pounds overweight. I'm out of my small overdraft and have a growing surplus at the end of each payment cycle. Repairing my relationship with my metamour that was previously riddled with resentment on my side and fear of rejection/upset on her side. I've continued to leave the flat every day...**Struggle**.These are more mental illness struggles than anything drink related though I did find it somewhat easier to cope when drinking. I'm Bipolar and have Borderline Personality Disorder. Struggling to start my day each morning. I've been waking with general dread for he last year sobriety hasn't changed that. I find it very hard to wash myself and sometimes to even use the toilet. I struggle to tidy up have piles of stuff in my bedroom...**General** I wanted to post to see where my sobriety ticker was!
Triumph: Got complimented today on a new coat I picked up cheap yesterday. It's my sobriety coat. My friend is flying over to stay for the weekend and I'll have the flat clean and not be a self-destructive mess. I might even be fun to be around...Struggle: Getting results back from last semester and realising sober me will be picking up the pieces of alcoholic me for some time...General: The snow has melted and that takes 3 or 4 minutes off my walk to uni. Handy. 
Triumph: Goddamn but being sober feels good doesn't it? I'm not bogged down all day my moods are more manageable my sleep patterns are more reliable I have energy in the gym. ..Struggle: Life is FULL right now-- I want to go to a meeting mediate play with my kids take care of work responsibilities take care of the house work out hang out with my wife. There aren't enough hours in the day and knowing I can't possibly do it all gives me anxiety. I used to say "fuck it let's do nothing and just drink"... At least now I'll get a few things ticked off my list...General: Be kind to each other today and be gentle with yourself. I will not drink with you today.
Triumph: I've been accepted on all 3 BA degree courses for September 2018 that I applied for (I may not get the student loans but that was a nice wehay moment!) I've also applied for 6 jobs as my plan A and may have an interview soon..Struggle: I'm reaching the 'blah' procrastinating stage of not drinking. The weather is totally crap / has been totally crap / and will be totally crap in London which does not inspire me to do anything. You sunshine peeps have it lucky!.General: Kingsman: The Golden Circle was total pants so save yourself 2 and half hours and forgo it. Shame as the first film was awesome. And now to Sainsbury's of doom! 
**Triumph:** I returned last night from a 10 day cruise completely sober. It was a lot of fun but there was also a lot of time with not much to do where drinking for the hell of it was starting to look good. I was able to work my brain through those times and am very glad to be back now with no regrets...**Struggle:** Trying to get back into work after time away is never fun. I'm thinking I should have just taken the rest of the week off right now haha. ..**General:** I drove in Manhattan! It was kind of something I always wanted to do and it really is kind of terrifying. I'll take dodging deer in upstate NY over that craziness any day!
**Triumph:** Both my little kids wanted to sit on my lap before falling asleep last night. That's moving when you're a  one song no bullshit  kind of dad. Aww of course I'll spend another ten minutes and three or four songs!!! Darn rascals got me round their fingers and they know it!..**Struggle:** Had to call the bank to skip this months mortgage payment. The added interest alone is half of what we  saved  only postponing the problem. We honestly don't know if any of us have a job in June/July. If not we'll have to sell our house. Cancelled annual vacation with friends. Skipping car repair etc...**General:** Love you guys. Proud of you all..
I will not drink with you today. 
**Triumph:** Today is day 14.  When I make it to the end of the day that's two weeks sober.  I'm pretty happy about that.  Also I'm doing everything humanly possible to repair damage to my business (self-employed) that I brought on myself through drunken negligence and there's a chance - a slim one - I may be able to recover it and maintain my income.  I don't deserve the second chance but I'm not going to waste it..**Struggle:** I'm having a tough time finding motivation and focus.  i know what I need to do but everything seems so BIG even when I break it down into tiny parts.  I'm half-energized and half-overwhelmed.  I think if I work hard and realistically I'll pull through..**General:**  Routines are amazing.  Meditation and journaling and coffee before 7am are a great start to the day.  I'm taking a new class and I'm kinda excited about that; it's for personal interest and not related to work in any way which is really nice.
Triumph: finally back on a good sleep cycle after holidays got me out of whack...Struggle: work project is kicking my ass. I just want it to be done but can't even see the end yet...
Triumph:.Not feeling like garbage every morning!  Spent time doing laundry (which would normally take a back seat to my vodka).General: Perhaps no one noticing me &amp; my effort....Struggle:  Staying focused on work and not reading &amp; consuming every sober story possible.  I fear that I will start to feel good not drinking and fall into temptation at a social event... "just one"... .IWNDWYT 
Not drinking with you today
*Triumph:* After being frazzled by some tedious work and family requirements in the past week I am feeling over the hump. Enjoying days again and I plan to get back to daily exercise today. (just changed "am hoping" to "plan" in that sentence) ..*Struggle:* _Earlier sober people take note:_ I am the opposite of bored. Sooooo many things I want to do spend time on. Many things that seemed dull while drinking and in early sobriety seem appealing now: reading tv series over-and-above work projects movies music work travel writing volunteer work and on and on. But I have neither the time nor the energy to do it all. Constantly appraising and re-appraising my schedule and routines to see how I can fit more in. And I worried that I would be bored / boring without drinking ... This is a good problem to have. ..*General*: My friend went to London for a two-year assignment recently and I hope to visit her sometime in the next year. 
  FTZ
**Triumph**: Last night I went out with a community running group. I ran 5k without stopping and slept through the night for the first time in weeks! I wouldn't have done that if I was still boozing. .**Struggle**: I have to get some paperwork done before school starts again next week. I get horrible anxiety about stuff like this (has to do with fearing being judged I think) and have been putting it off and the longer I leave it the more ridiculous I feel about it. I wish I didn't do this to myself. Feeling crappy about myself was easier when I was numbed-out and drinking I felt that I somehow deserved it because of what I was doing to myself with alcohol. Now I just hate that it is apparently my factory setting. .**General**: I was really sad to hear that Ursula Le Guin died but thankful for the way her books nurtured me as a young and impressionable reader!
**Triumph:** I'm over two weeks into quitting smoking which had been a little too much of a crutch for not drinking. ..**Struggle:** Have definitely put on a few pounds from increased snacking but I know that will balance back out over time...**General:** Waiting for a new microwave to be delivered and installed this morning. C'mon already -- I need to get to work!
Triumph: 100 days today!! Pretty proud of that. I'm feeling great and not even thinking about drinking again. Also right now I'm walking on the treadmill before work something I've been trying to do the last few months but it has not been happening. It's so hard to get out of bed when it's still dark out. So today is an accomplishment. .Struggle: I feel like I'm mourning a friendship. We're still friends but it isn't the same at all and it's really bringing me down. I used to see her every work day for over 3 years but then I chose to get a new job for other reasons. Now I see her once or twice a month and it just feels different. I'm sad about that and also feel like it's my own fault because I sought a new job. And I feel like I miss her more than she misses me. .General musings: progress not perfection. Today will be a good day!
Triumph: I'm actually happy. I forgot what this feeling was. I'm waking up without stress anger frustration guilt and physical pain. I'm seeing hope and thinking about tomorrow. I can actually think about and plan for tomorrow because I won't be incapacitated by a hangover or another binge. ..Struggle: I think I'm taking too much Kratom and I really don't want to trade addictions. So I'm going to start reducing my amount of Kratom. It's hard though because it makes me sooo upbeat happy and energetic. ..General: I started going to an adult gymnastics class twice a weak. At first I thought it might be a little lame for a 30yr old male to go to gymnastics....but I f'ing love it. It's fun exciting challenging and the girls are easy to look at. 
Triumph:  Today my flair reads 15 days...  I don't remember in the past few years that I've ever strung that many days together staying sober and without at least a drink.  It's interesting how my body is reacting in positive ways and (perceived) negative ways.  It's an adjustment but a good one at that...Struggle:  The first week I felt GREAT!  Getting more sleep eating better more exercise.  Closing my second week out I'm feeling lethargic and run down.  The weather is crappy and I'm having trouble staying on my workout schedule.  Last night I skipped yoga to watch LOTR on my couch.  Maybe I'm finally reading my body signals when they say calm down and chill out for a night?..General: I have a wonderful feeling that 2018 has already and will be a big year of change in my life.  It doesn't scare me as much as I thought it would and it's easier to plan ahead/mitigate surprises with a sober mind.  
**Triumph:** Doing pretty good with my moods and emotions despite the Struggle below. It's nice to feel like I have an even keel...**Struggle:** A nasty cold has been ripping through the family. I was unusually sick for me and lost three days to mostly sleeping. Today both kids are home sick and suddenly revived mid-morning...**General:** Traveling in Thailand long ago I had learned the slang for "check please" and was told in sounded well. Tried it in a fairly fancy restaurant and the waiter fell over in shock. Then literally was unable to catch his breathe from laughing. He never would tell me what I had said...
**Triumph:** I'm now down 20 lbs since I stopped drinking!..**Struggle:** I've been single since September and I'm craving affection and romance like you wouldn't believe. Dating apps are exhausting and there are real people out there who are wonderful. I just have to keep my head ..**General:** I wear glasses for when I'm working up-close now. The adjustment period isn't fun but I'm sure I'll get used to it within a couple weeks.
Triumph: I can't believe I have gone so long without alcohol. This is the first time I've ever attempted to quit. I don't miss it- except for some fleeting pangs...Struggle: I wish I'd lose some weight...Other: congratulations to everyone who chose another day of sobriety!
Triumph: I made it this far and thinking about drinking is not the first thing on my mind anymore!..Struggle: Both daughters away at uni and hubby's away for a week tomorrow- in the past that would mean a license to drink when I wanted without fear of being caught but i'm feeling optimistic this time...General: I can't wait for spring - this dark pissy London weather is crap but I won't drink the time away   
triumph: meditated three days in a row. ..struggle: my anger...general: you stop drinking you start growing. in all different directions.
I am so excited for you to go back to England!  What a NDV!..**Triumph:**  The longer I am sober the more focused and productive I become.  I presented a training today and I was solid and successful in conveying what I needed.  I would've been far more panicky and unprepared when I drank as I spent no time learning how to cope with anxiety and just let my emotions run the show...**Struggle:** How do I exercise daily meditate daily stretch daily be intimate with my partner cook good food daily stay on top of my budget get out in nature and work on a new career?!?  I don't even have kids.  How do people do this??..**General:** A mischief of crows a murder of ravens a congress of crabs a murmuration of starlings a flamboyance of flamingos.  What else??
[removed]
**Triumph:** I feel waaaay better on this Wednesday than I felt a week ago I think I'm starting to settle in with my lifestyle some struggles start to feel smaller and dumber and my sleep schedule is getting much better!..**Struggle:** I still have a lot of things to do and I'm still super lazy! I m realizing that I can't blame it all on the alcohol!..**General:** I'm already picking up some *side projects* like fixing things around my house and other things I never had time to do before because of booze
**Triumph:** I feel waaaay better on this Wednesday than I felt a week ago I think I'm starting to settle in with my lifestyle some struggles start to feel smaller and dumber and my sleep schedule is getting much better!..**Struggle:** I still have a lot of things to do and I'm still super lazy! I m realizing that I can't blame it all on the alcohol!..**General:** I'm already picking up some *side projects* like fixing things around my house and other things I never had time to do before because of booze
Triumph: I've been going to bed early and waking up early! So refreshing!..Struggle: Ummmmm..... I really want to drink? And the urge isn't going away.
Triumph: I went running three days in a row! I went from a Spartan Trifecta to being totally sedentary so this was a big win. I also managed to see a doctor for a physical finally and my new townhome is finally unpacked and looking great!..Struggle: Binge drank last night because there were leftovers from a housewarming party and then I went out and topped off with another six pack. I have learned that on some days I'm fine with it on the fridge. On other days completely unexpectedly I will break and drink it all. Solution is to keep none around. At all...General: I'm really enjoying watching the Overwatch League. Go Philadelphia Fusion! (And Eagles!) 
**Triumph:** I did it. After over 10 years since his retirement I *finally* took over the big boss's office.  Even though I am one of only 2 principle owners of the small tech company I've been part of for over 30 years I've never felt like I lived up to this.  Amazing the confidence and self worth I have developed in less than half a year.  ..**Struggle:**  This office has both interior and exterior windows plus 2 interior doors (on opposite sides of the room) and was originally designed so that the desk would face a wall.  Not only does this configuration fail to take advantage of the nice view it also makes it so the desk chair has a door directly behind it which is something I really don't like (I'm also told it's not 'feng shui' lol).  Anyway this is pretty much the epitome of a first world problem and I'm enjoying the 'struggle' to make it work for me...**General:** I once got into an argument with a Dubliner about the word "gals".  She was sure there was no such word and accused me of calling her and her friends "girls".  She also maintained that there was no such word as "ass" and that it was actually arse (and that we Americans just didn't know how to pronounce it).  For the record I know arse is a word and how it's pronounced. lol.  
** T: **  Daughter's birthday coming up and I will be sober and not hungover...** S: **  Exam tomorrow!  ..** G: ** The first time I went to Boston I heard a native speak and I had to hold back my laughter because the accent was straight out of a TV show or movie!
Triumph: I got admitted to grad school. ..Struggle: grad school = no income and that's not fetch haha. ..General: I need to eat more tacos. Tacos are great. 
**Triumph:** I have been consistently writing in my journal. ..**Struggle:** My daily-drinker dad is coming to stay with me this weekend. ..**General:** My SO gave our dog a bath today.  Then we couldn't find the dog.  She was hiding under all the pillows on our guest bed. We'll be rewashing pillowcases for my aforementioned dad.  
**Triumph:** This is my third day.  I discovered that drinking San Pellegrino(sp?) mineral water is perfect for filling the void of not having a beer in my hand.  ..**Struggle:** There is still alcohol in the house and although I haven't been extremely tempted it still grabs my eye every time I walk past it.  Each walk past is a triumph though so there is that!..**General:**  I'm really excited to be a part of this subreddit.  The support is incredible.  
Triumph: Day 50!..Challenge: I still get cravings. Today for example... I know logically that Alcohol is poison and I'm still able to abstain but... it's hard at times...IWNDWYT 
**Triumph:**  I've managed not to flip out or break down over the past couple of days of wrestling with the system to try and get my son the medication he needs.  So far I've only gotten 1 of 3 of his scripts filled but I'm making progress.  It's hard to not let my anger and frustration show but I know keeping a level head is more productive in helping to get to the goal.  ..**Struggle:**  I've been sliding back into depression. The world sucks people are awful I can't stand the mess I've gotten myself into and it just all feels so imprisoning. That pretty much sums it up.  ..**General:**  My kids both speak with British accents.  With the first kid I figured I'd let him express himself as he wanted the phase would pass... it's been years.  Now the other kid is doing it too.  They are very aware of differences between pants and trousers cookies and biscuits and the "proper" way to pronounce aluminium.  Rollin' my eyes constantly.  Hahah.  They're also very into tea.  I have strange kids but they're brilliant and I love them.
Triumph: learning about my mind and body. It feels good and I'm feeling connected with the earth. ..Struggle: my parents dog my teen years dog died today. If I had known how sick he was I would have visited. I just didn't know. My dad is falling apart. My whole family is shaken not just from this this is just the latest in a string of sad things happening this winter. ..General: I think I might be a hippie.
