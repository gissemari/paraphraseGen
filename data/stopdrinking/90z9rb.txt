I'm struggling to process my evening last last night.  I played 3 sets of music and I didn't have fun.  I was annoyed with the bar patrons annoyed with the employees annoyed with my band mates.  Slightly bored.  Tired. Stifling yawns onstage.  Didn't talk to anyone new.  I gave away my drink tickets and had water so that was fine.  A nice joyful night would have been so great to give me some positive reinforcement that life will be fun without drinking.  On a positive note I got only five hours sleep and I'm feeling pretty good physically so today should be productive. . IWNDWYT

I like your word  yet.   It will get better.  At 34 days I was just shaking off the immediate negative impact of drinking; the cobwebs were just beginning to clear.  Everyone's journey is different but I felt increasing peace joy and freedom the longer I was sober...Hang in there!  You're doing great.  Congratulations on 34! IWNDWYT 
Not to sound too pessimistic but I've had some pretty shitty moods &amp; some pretty shitty nights because of my mood when I was drunk too. Same goes now. But I've had some pretty great nights out lately too.
