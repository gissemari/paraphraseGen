As I said in a previous post I was suicidal. Still struggling with the thoughts but don't have the feeling to act out behind them. My sponsor once told me this and not quitting and after praying this saying was on my mind. I focused in on it. Test the knives in the kitchen? No don't quit before the miracle. Take all my meds? No don't quit before the miracle. I was in mood limbo not really sure how I felt. Then today I got the call. I haven't worked in 7 1/2 years declared disabled in 2012 and in my sobriety I decided to try to get a job. I got it! My miracle happened. Now I'm excited and happy and hopeful. Thank you god thank you SD thank you everything.
