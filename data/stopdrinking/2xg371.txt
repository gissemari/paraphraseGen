Posted a few weeks ago about how I just realised how serious my problems were and how I was going to quit cold turkey for a few months and see how I feel(I'm 19 years old by the way). Well I fucked up. After two sober weekends I went to a party and I reasoned with myself that it wouldn't matter if I had two or three drinks as long as I paced myself and stayed in control. Too bad I'm a fucking idiot and had like 8-10 drinks got shitfaced and got home at like 6:30 in the morning feeling like absolute shit. .Last night I did pretty much the same thing got home at 04 woke my mom up and talked gibberish - causing her to cry and talk about how she is scared I will become an alcoholic like my father and her grandfather. Right now I feel like the most useless piece of shit but I'm confident that I can stay sober this time for her and for myself. Let's all not drink today guys and gals have a nice one.

Why are you confident?  What is your plan this time?
"I just worry that you'll end up like my father" - Yeah I know how those words feel.Been hearing it for a while now but it always makes me feel like shit anyway
I am with you I won't drink today! I have seen my parents crumble and cry over this too many times to habit - so I really know how you feel. I am also doing this for them as well as for myself; I never want to see that look in their eyes again. Every time you relapse I think it definitely teaches you something too - so all the luck in the world to you and congrats on day 1!
