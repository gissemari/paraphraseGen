Hi everyone. First time poster here \~ wanted to share an experience I've been having:..&amp;#x200B;..I'm on my 7th day sober (again) and already I've found some amazing perspective on a situation that until now held a constant dark cloud over my head: I'd been having trouble getting over a past romantic relationship feeling anger hurt and resentment in nearly every moment of my life - feelings only compounded by drinking. ..&amp;#x200B;..I was initially drawn to him because of our shared sense of humor and his creative talent (which I found to be inspiring in my own art). Most nights we'd stay up drinking until sunrise with other successful artists and I thought in some disillusioned way that this would advance my own career (it's all about who you know right?). I felt so important and was thrilled to be rubbing elbows with people I'd looked up to for so long. But of course the next morning I'd pop open a bottle of champagne (because mimosas are healthy) drink it in bed all day to fend off the HORRIFYING anxiety that hangovers brought me and - big surprise - not make any art. Met up with the same people again that night. Rinse and repeat. I worked 15 hours a week and overdrafted my bank account every time I paid rent. I didn't even care. I was making big career moves at seedy afterparties smoking cigarettes indoors watching people do blow off their own vinyl records and paintings. Certainly this would all pay off soon...&amp;#x200B;..Our relationship essentially consisted of us drinking and fighting (and by fighting I mean him treating me like shit me trying to explain how that affected me and him basically saying "I'm sorry you feel that way" then shutting down completely. I'd drink more and vent at my friends instead of addressing it further with him - bless them for putting up with this behavior for so long). Which isn't to say it was all bad - but it's funny that when you get used to being treated terribly any moment of basic human decency starts to feel like love. When you're deep in it you don't even realize it's happening...&amp;#x200B;..However the last straw was when I spent a whole weekend helping him set up an instillation only to discover he'd been sleeping with someone else every night of the setup. Of course when I found out through a friend I downed 15+ drinks in one night (only slightly more than usual). I'm a 130 lb woman - my tolerance was so high at that point that I maintained reasonably-eloquent angry conversations throughout that night. I cut him out of my life for about six months then slowly let him back in; this only further compounded my drinking. Since he's started seeing someone new we haven't spoken in weeks which hurt initially and I drank to deal with it (why does THIS asshole get to date a trust-fund Barbie meanwhile I a nerdy art geek am still trying to pick up the pieces?) but I know it's for the best...&amp;#x200B;..The last two times I tried to go sober I thought it would fix everything. This third time I now know that it won't instantly solve every problem but I cannot even begin to describe the feeling of clarity I'm having about this particular situation. It hasn't been that long but I feel this profound sense of healing. Already my constant urges to text him have faded.  For so long I tried to make sense of it all struggled to see the tipping point where it all went wrong wanted to figure out how I could have made it better. I thought that drinking helped me deal with my turmoil but it actually made me feel worse. Alcohol and hangovers clouded my judgement and made everything seem SO much more intense and emotional than it needed to be. For the first time I'm focusing on MY life doing what makes ME happy; I'm letting go. I also somehow landed a full-time position at a job I love (in the arts!) no thanks to him or the people I thought I was making "connections" with. It's not going to be easy but I won't let my drinking get in the way of that. I can't wait to see what my life looks like in three six months and beyond. ..&amp;#x200B;..Tl;dnr: Going sober has made me realize an unhealthy relationship pattern and I'm so so grateful.
----------immediate responses--------

Congratulations on the first week and the new job you love!..I also only got over the split up with my wife after i stopped drinking and the repetitive thoughts finally resolved themselves after more than one and a half year after. This tooks many months even after I stopped drinking...I still find my mind becoming clearer by the week even after more than 6 months not drinking really is a gift that keeps on giving.
I've been having epiphanies too about my relationships with other people and also what to me are profound understandings of the nature and roots of addictions and not just to substances.
