I've been an alcoholic for about 5 years and it's destroyed many aspects of my life. I'm just happy to say I'm 3 weeks sober today. I've quit before never have I felt this positive about it. I've been tracking my sobriety with an app called "I am sober" if you're looking for something to help keep track and offer some motivation it worked wonders for me. (sorry if that's breaking rule 4 I'm not sure) I've also noticed that hopeless feeling is created by the damn devil nectar! I feel like I can gain back anything I've lost with ease sober. Anyone out there struggling it never made me feel any better. Stay strong brothers hopefully I can continue making these posts.

Feedback can definitely help. Just the badge counting the days for me helps as I'm bad at dates. Congrats on 3 weeks!
&gt;I've also noticed that hopeless feeling is created by the damn devil nectar! ..&amp;#x200B;..Yes it's the psychological pain that made me finally understand I had to stop.   ...The fear guilt shame.   ...Binging only on the weekends but having it's effects carry through into the middle of the next week.   ...I'm behind in my work and career.   ...Just woke up at 2am on my third day.   .The worst of the mild withdrawal is over but I still had that black fear.  ...Has to stop...&amp;#x200B;
