Hello wonderful folk of r/stopdrinking. ..I have had a few rough few days personally and totally missed the obligatory "100 days!" post...However tough the last few days have been I am so proud of myself that I didn't make it worse by drinking. I knew in my heart that drinking wouldn't ease my problems for anything longer than an hour or so neither would it fix my problems long term. ..It is still sometimes a constant struggle to not drink when I am stressed or upset but I know now that I can get through it...Hope you all have a good day or even if you're not having a good day I hope that you are having a day which does not involve alcohol making your day ten times worse.
