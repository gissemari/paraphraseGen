I don't know where the hell today went but I'm going out for the evening shortly and find myself again without the time needed to write a meaningful post. I expect my time management will improve if I stay sober long enough but I'm still a bit of a ditherer and bit of a procrastinator (that said I've got more done in the past ten days that in the previous month so that's something)...I did want to go to an AA meeting today because today was hard and yesterday half of which was spent with my wife at the oncologist's office was a downright bitch. I can't imagine ever enjoying AA meetings or even believing half the stuff the people there purport to believe but there was definitely something about going last week that ensured I would not drink that evening. I'm pretty sure I'm out of danger this evening however. I've already pledged and I'm going to pledge again now. I pledge not to drink. See. Easy.   ..I'm going to keep believing in this bullshit for as it long as it takes to get to the point where relapse is no longer a possibility--the grave point.
