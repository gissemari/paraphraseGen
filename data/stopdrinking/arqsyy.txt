So today marks my 6th day sober. ..Last night I had a dream that I was in a bar drinking crisp cold beers laughing with my friends stuffing my face with pub food. ..Despite the fact that it was just a dream I woke up feeling groggy dehydrated and struggled very hard to get out of bed. I'm at work at the moment and my brain still feels like a wet cake. I got a good 9 hours of sleep in as well with very little disruption. What the honk is this Carl Jung sh*t??? ..

&gt;What the honk is this Carl Jung sh\*t???..I don't know but this made me laugh out loud.  IWNDWYT..&amp;#x200B;
Don't know. ..But it could have been worse. ..Some guy posted here today he dreamed he bought a bar. :)
Body memory more than likely. ..I don't think we even truly understand what alcohol does to our spirit minds and  bodies...So weird to feel hungover from a dream. 
'Phantom Hangovers' and Drinking Dreams are both very common in early sobriety don't worry!..Congrats on nearly a week keep it up... It gets better.....IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
