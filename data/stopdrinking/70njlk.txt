Third time trying to quit and the third time that random daylong headaches pop up in the second month. One benefit of the relapses was that those headaches stopped. Advil doesn't do much. I guess it's punishment for all of those years even if I'm trying to do right now.

Sorry to hear about the headaches they suck! I'm on day 18 and some weird depression has hit me  I have nothing to be sad about... anxiety seems to have faded into sadness lol...Not drinking with you keep it up :)

Shit is that why I am having headaches?  Woke up with one just now and took some ibuprofen and drinking coffee. I dislike these. But I'd rather be sober! So I guess it's a good trade off!
Second post about PAWS I've seen in the last few hours. I'm sure I had seen the term but never read in to it. May explain the anxiety and insomnia I've been having this weekend. Either way not drinking with you today. 
My previous experience was at least for me they hit hard in months 2 and 3.  I thought I might get away without them this time! 
Wow I was having headaches everyday for awhile. I didn't connect the dots though. Extra Strength Excedrin helped me. I used to ingest that stuff daily when I drank. I haven't taken an excedrin about 6 weeks though. One more bonus for my liver.
I'm at 2 weeks and just started getting daily headaches 2 days ago. Today I woke up with a headache and nausea almost like I was hungover. Do you remember the headaches ended?
