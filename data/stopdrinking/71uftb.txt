I've lurked on here on and off for several months even signed up for a badge thinking that would motivate me seeing the numbers.  But I just kept going back to drinking.  I've been trying sooo hard to practice moderation and most of the time I can do it.  But then I'll slip and drink too much and blackout and feel horrible (like last night.)  I have cut back overall in the past year so I keep telling myself that I'm on the right track but I think I know deep down that I just shouldn't drink...But I'm scared.  Scared of how my friends and family will react when I tell them I've quit (though ironically my husband has been sober for many years after a bout with pancreatitis.)  Scared I'll not be able to enjoy a sports event without a beer scared I'll miss going to happy hour with girlfriends.  Scared I won't be able to do it or that I'll relapse with a vengeance and wind up in a really bad place.  So many fears.  Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.  Thank you..

Don't fear getting sober. Fear what will happen if you don't.
My story was the same cutting back then slipping up.  I was just so sick of the cycle.  It's definitely worth it.  The fears you mention in reality are just awkward situations at first until you figure out your new favorite drink how you answer questions about why you don't drink anymore...it just comes with a little practice.
