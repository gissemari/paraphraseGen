I'm on a phone so I'll try and make this short....Been drinking pretty heavily for about 5 or 6 years with spratic stints of being sober. I recently had a relapse that lasted about 3 days. The withdrawal wasn't the worst I've experienced but it was still pretty rough. It's been 6 days and the physical effects feel like they are about gone. The difference now is that I've started to stutter a bit and I can't get words out very smoothly. I can tell its happening as I'm sure others can. Could something like this become so pronounced this quickly because of alcohol abuse? It's got me a bit freaked out right now.

Withdrawal after repeated relapse is often increasingly severe due to "kindling" [which you can read about at this link.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_\(sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal\))  There is also information in the FAQ on the sidebar.  Alcohol's impacts our central nervous system which also include speech centers.  This should clear up; but I would consider it a warning sign of far worse consequences if I continue to relapse.
