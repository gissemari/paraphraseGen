I'm not the biggest fan of being alone I really struggle with self worth and have this awful anxiety when my boyfriend goes on a night out without me. I trust him it's just me. ..So tonight I am deliberately staying home while he goes out - I didn't want to go out to a house party anyway. Its just drinking and talking with strangers - couldn't cope with it. ..I want to be strong tonight and not drink - I just found a bunch of alcohol in my house and that just sucks. ..Ooft - long night ahead

Hang in there and read a good book.  I will not drink with you tonight.
Be strong maybe go for a walk. That helps me when I have cravings.
You can do it.  
Not drinking with you! My anxious feelings when my husband would go out used to be a lot worse and it really sucked. Hang tight.
