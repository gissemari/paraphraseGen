Made it through my third weekend. A few changes I've noticed are:..1. Not thinking about death or having a new existential crisis every time I drink. Before I would constantly wonder what the purpose of life is what happens after etc..2. Anxiety is way down. I probably have a personality disorder but it doesn't read it's ugly head if I'm not fueling it with alcohol.3. I know this might be controversial but ThC has been a life saver. It's legal where I live but I don't really like it so I rarely used it. Still don't like it but it really kills my cravings..4. Sparkling water and Heineken 0.0 have been great. I'm actually more proud than of myself when I'm drinking sparkling water..5. Waking up hang over free is amazing.6. I did and do have a problem. I always said  oh I just drink faster than most people.  But that's because of alcoholism. I rarely got black out (though when I did it was bad) but I was always thinking about drinking and making it more then 2 days in a row without 2-3 drinks was a struggle..7. I miss alcohol. I loved drinking and socializing. But the costs of drinking started to become too much for me. This is going to be a hard road but I know it's ultimately worth it..8. I asked for advice on day one and with my limited experience the best advice to give someone starting out (aside from seeking medical advise) is to visit this subreddit every few hours. When I was considering going back to drinking I stopped reading these posts because I knew they'd make me not want to drink. Fortunately I came back...Thanks for reading and Happy Sunday. I appreciate all of your support and positivity.

Happy for you being sober for 22 days. I do not agree on THC as it is an addict substance also. Just my opinion.
Try CBD. Takes the edge of without the high.
