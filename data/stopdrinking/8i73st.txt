My sister stopped over today and we got to talking about a social event she invited me to next month \(mini\-golf and "bar hopping"\) with her friends. I told her that I'd love to go mini\-golfing but then straight up told her that I have a drinking problem. She understood completely and was very caring and supportive of me. It was awesome to just TELL someone and to have them be on your side. ..She also told me she'd tell her friends who normally would want to get me to drink that I'm not drinking. Thankfully her friends are very understanding as well and have been in situations with angry drunk relatives or friends so they know about alcohol struggles. One of her friends' husbands is friendly with a former alcoholic who is now 10 years sober so he understands as well. Anyway they're all mature adults and my sister assured me that they would be completely supportive. I'm really happy right now...On the other hand while I pledge each day not to drink and pledge to not drink at this event should I still go? I know some people believe in staying away completely from any event that has drinking until you're able to handle it. But I'd really like to go to a social event since I don't go out much and I'm confident that the people I'm going with will support me. I believe I will not drink \(my love for Coke Zero and Diet Dr. Pepper is vastly greater than my 'love' for alcohol\). ..Thank you everyone! IWNDWYT

Congrats on opening up about your problem isn't it such a relief!..As to the social events it's entirely up to you what you feel comfortable with... Mini-Golf sounds good perhaps the 'Bar-Hopping' not so much.....Keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I think it's **awesome** that you told your sister and even ***awesomer*** that her and her friends are being so matue/kind about it. That is something special! ..I'd totally go play mini golf! I might've skipped the "bar hopping" portion that early in sobriety. But that's me. Have a great time! Since the people you're going with don't sound like the type to pressure you I bet it'll be a lot of fun... just keep your focus. ..Stay strong! I won't drink with you today. 
I don't worry too much about the rules of dry people/dry places but if I'm wavering about something I use this litmus test: is drinking going to be the primary activity or is it another activity where drinking also happens to be happening? If I'm already iffy and it's more the former than the latter I skip it. At first it was because I was worried I might cave and drink and now it's because I know I'll be bored.
