Ug.  I'm struggling right now.  Had some stress at work and didn't sleep great.  I'm tired just chilling at home watching Netflix and finding resisting the urge hard right now!  Today is the first day that hasn't been easy.  Last few days I've walked past the liquor store 2x each day driven past it... Not a single thought to stop in.  But the last half hour has been an inner fight.  Stress at work stress with the girlfriend tired... Ug.

Sorry you're having a rough time.  When I feel this way I try to remind myself that giving in to the craving will only make those feelings worse.  IWNDWYT
Cravings for me got much less after a week to ten days.  Hang in there! It gets better!  Congrats on the great work!
Go to sleep! :-)  Can't drink while you are sleeping . . . 
Yes. Sleep!!!! I went to bed very early when I first quit.
