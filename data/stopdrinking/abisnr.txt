I've been at this for about 2 years and I have been able to string together 6 months and then 8 months but the consequences bin between have been terrible. I sometimes worry I have to be forced to legally get sober otherwise I cannot. I relapsed on 8 months about 2 weeks ago strung together 11 days then drank again and took a small Xanax pill too. Managed 2 days but drank beer this morning. Threw out more than half the bottle. I'm planning on going to AA today and surrendering for the first time. I usually don't do this because of my ego and the fact I had it for 8 months but I need to think less about the judgment and just get in there and say I need serious help. I think I need a sponsor with more than  2 years. Also what do you guys think about avoiding certain meetings because of the people that go there? Lately I have enjoyed the club house / big book studies I have gone too after changing it up.

Hi there..I can't speak about AA but I'm sure lots of others here can share their experiences on that...I just want to say hello and to let you know that I admire your decision to take a new approach to sobriety...Take care of yourself and I hope you'll continue to share your experience here.
Nothing wrong with shopping around to find a meeting that suits you. I've hit every one in town at least once.
