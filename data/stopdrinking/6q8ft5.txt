So I relapsed on Sunday. Took me until today to get things kind of back under control I managed to avoid most of the withdrawal symptoms through careful application of benzos and a lesser known GABA interacting drug....I went in to see my counselor today after basically dropping off the face of the world for a week. She had repeatedly tried to contact me this week after I told someone else in the group I had relapsed...She brought up Vivitrol as an option and I'll be meeting with the detox specialist next week in order to talk about it...I've been reading up on it all afternoon with some people saying it basically removed their cravings entirely. From what I understand it blocks the dopamine release drinking gives basically sucking the "fun" out of drinking...I was just wondering if anyone here has any personal experience with it. Or naltrexone in general as I know the oral form is sometimes used. Going by my track record of noncompliance with meds I think the injection is probably a good idea...I've been looking over the safety profile and I'm willing to risk it.  My body has a pretty good track record when it comes to infection which seems to be the major risk. ..I was just curious if anyone else had used it.
