I went 33 days sober after a bad detox. That was the longest I'd ever gone. I went on a small bender when I relapsed maybe 3 days. ..I thought with 33 days of sobriety the withdrawals after a small relapse wouldn't be that bad. But it is. Haven't slept in days I keep having this nightmare where my teeth fall out in a bloody gummy mess. I'm not just feeling anxiety I'm feeling doom. It's been 5 days of this. Thankfully I have some xanax to help with the symptoms but it doesn't do much because I've built a dependency to it too...My point is to those who get bad withdrawals just because you have a lot of sober days under your belt does not mean the withdrawal is going to be any easier than the last detox. It'll probably be hell.

thank you.
Oh yeah. Each subsequent withdrawal you go through will be worse than the last regardless of sober time in between. I went almost five months clean and a 3-day bender had in full-blast DT.
You might Google "Kindling Effect".
