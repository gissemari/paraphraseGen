Relapsed this weekend. Went out for my sister's birthday and started drinking with my partner. My sister does not know how much myself and and my girlfriend have been struggling and those two beers turned into a weekend of dysfunction. I know that I can be a better person and I need to be honest with those around me and myself. I hate the feeling of resetting the badge. ..I forgot to check in on Friday not sure if I did that consciously or not but I know that by when I would check in for the day it would set me up for a positive and sober 24 hours. I know I can not do this alone and I have a appointment with a therapist on Monday. I know I can do this and thank you for reading.

Welcome back!  and Yes you *Can* do it!
So glad you are back. These "set backs" can actually help us move forward. Love that you are getting more help. Very hard to do it on your own.
