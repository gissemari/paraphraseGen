Thank you! Thank you all for sharing your struggles and sharing your experiences. Because of your sharing and your speaking out I realize I'm not alone and others go through what I go through. Thank you for sharing encouragement and sharing that it gets better. .In hopes that my story may help someone else like me: I'm 37 married father of 2. I'm an attorney and relatively successful. I thought I could control my drinking but I can't. I came home drunk last night and made a fool of myself. I thought it was just a matter of willpower or being able to say "Well it's just one beer". But it's never just one beer. .So today I started reading SD and it's eye opening. I'm not alone. Others go through the same struggle I go through. And I realize I can do this. So thank you. Here's to Day 1 of many.

Good for you. One minute hour and day at a time. Keep it up!
no u
You're the one being all honest and courageous on day 1 we should be thanking you. Keep setting a good example for the rest of us.
We're halfway through this day! 
I have a similar story. I have all the trappings of success but my drinking controlled me. 
I started Day 1 yesterday.  Same same 39 yo high functioning.  Got blackout drunk two weekends ago and have no idea what happened a good part of a night.  You can do it!!!  3 hours 13 minutes left on the west coast....
