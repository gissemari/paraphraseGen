Every day that I wake up feeling good after struggling through a craving wave the night before is positive reinforcement. What a great feeling.

It's great isn't it? I swear I never thought it'd get better. I thought I'd be nauseous forever always wake up with a migraine feeling hungover even though I hadn't been drinking. ..Now I wake up refreshed have more energy now than I did ten years ago. Being sober is amazing!
It s the best! Knowing it has passed knowing you won - enjoy it!..I will not drink with you today!
