Just curious about how many people are aware of and/or suffer from Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome [(PAWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome)...Just wondering as I only recently heard about it but I definitely experience it. It seems to come up monthly since I stopped drinking and this week it came right on schedule for my 4-month chip. Earlier this week I was really down. Feeling blue. Lacking motivation and excitement and energy struggling in my thinking. The exact sort of mood that would lead me to drinking out of misery and boredom and self-pity...Today I am full of piss and vinegar and gumption raring to go and ready to take on the world with a sharp mind. The exact sort of mood that would lead me to drinking out of accomplishment and celebration...But it is interesting to see how my mood ebbs and flows even with alcohol long out of my system. My body is clean but my mind is still unmuddling itself. Used to getting regular doses of alcohol now every once in a while it says to me "Hey what's up where's the booze I crave and expect?" That's getting less severe as the months pass but it's still there. Apparently this phenomenon can go on for years...Fortunately as evidenced by the lack of a badge reset I was able to weather the emotional storm and didn't succumb to any urges. I think a large part of that is that I am able to recognize what is going on in my mind. That this is a common side effect of quitting alcohol and that I am feeling down (or exceptionally up) at the time not because of any actual life event but because of my messed up brain function. I know that in the middle of the month I need to be prepared for it so I can address it and handle it in a healthy way in order to get through it without succumbing to temptation...So for those of you suffering from the up-and-down swings of PAWS especially those newer to their sobriety know that it is your alcoholic brain fucking with you. Knowing is half the battle. Knowledge is power...(ps-This does not take anything away from nor supercede the experience of those in recovery who suffer from mood disorders beyond the effects of alcohol and the associated struggles with and treatment of those issues.)

I don't know if paws is real or just untreated alcoholism. But it sounds good. This too shall pass. Slow- briety. Sometimes slowly sometimes quickly. Trust the process.
