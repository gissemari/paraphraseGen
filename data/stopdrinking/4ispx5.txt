I have been trying to stop for the past two years about six different times. Most lasted two weeks longest was 36 days. I am just so sick of drinking and drugging. I don't want to do it anymore. I am sick of relapsing using whatever reason to justify getting drunk again waking up violently sick rinse and repeat. I'm not so sure this time is any different but I have to keep trying. Finances are shit friendships are gone and family doesn't believe me when I say I want to quit anymore...It's been two days and I can't sleep and have no appetite but I know that fades. Ive been through it before. I ~~want it~~ need it more than anything. I am going to commit to meetings taking care of myself and refocusing my energy on being sober. ..So here's hello again SD. Hello to all you people that understand what it means to be an alcoholic and make me feel like I am not alone. I'll be lurking haha.
