Sitting in the kroger parking lot. Came here fully intending to get a 6 pack and drink several. I want to be able to tolerate in moderation but couldnt make myself go in. I was never a everyday sort of person but definitely any too frequently. This is my longest off streak in weeks. My sleep sucks but my workouts and such have been good. I'm ready for my last semester. The struggle is real hah.

Do you think you're going to keep going with not drinking?
