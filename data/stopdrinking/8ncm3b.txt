I have been saying this to myself every night before falling asleep..I was sober for a while and I relapsed a couple weeks ago. I probably wouldn't actually kill myself but the fact that I'm even muttering that under my breath before bed shows how quickly alcohol destroyed my self worth..Don't do what I did. Stay sober. I'll try to get back on track too.
