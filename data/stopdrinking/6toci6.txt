I am back here for support. I have relapsed so badly. Aalcohol is killing me. I've been on a non stop bender for last 5 days. i am going to AA this afternoon and ill be combing back here for support. Last night felt like i was dying. My asophagous hurts. my entire body hurts and feels like it is on fire. I made a complete idiot out of myself in this new neighbourhood. I have a doctors appointment in an hour to see if i can get some pills or something to help me with withdrawal. But last night i was shaking shivering losing my mind. It felt like I was dying talking nonsense to people. I am done I want out. I can hardly swallow food. Peace and still have to reset my badge

Welcome back.  .Sorry you are feeling so terribly but going to AA and coming back here for support sounds like a great plan to me.  I would just realize that the terrible feelings I have are caused by drinking alcohol and I do not need to have them anymore as long as I do not drink anymore.
