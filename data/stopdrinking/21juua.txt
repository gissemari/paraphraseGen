(I also shared in r/redittorsinrecovery  but both of these subreddits have inspired me so I thought I could share her too)  I've been battling alcoholism for eight years and after more failed attempts than I care to count I checked into rehab last month. I'm currently in outpatient therapy note and just reached my first 30 days today. In that time I've learned new coping skills lost 7 pounds got on the right meds for my bipolar disorder and depression had better quality time with my kids and generally felt better than I have in years. I'm an artist and one small I've made is being able to paint on my studio sober for the first time which is s real step for me. I've always been pretty prolific but my work is better now and I actually remember completing all my paintings. All my problems haven't disappeared of course; my marriage is still a mess and very much over I still struggle financially and I may get depressed. But I'm facing all those with a clear mind and new confidence. I'm ready to keep going and make this work. I could have never imagined being sober this long before it's a good feeling. Thanks everyone.

Congrats on your 30 days!  This is such an accomplishment and the signpost on the road to a whole new way of life if you want.  Good luck and keep sharing.
It would be great to see some of your artwork if you ever want to share it here! That sounds like amazing progress 7 pounds is usually pretty noticeable on people! I bet you are looking healthier and more vibrant with that.
You rock! Congrats!
I'm beating YOu!
Congrats!! Same here!!
Congratulations on 30 days; that's awesome.  Strong work on being productive in the studio.  Just as alcoholism seeps into all parts of our life sobriety opens up so many great possibilities.
