I was randomly looking at imgur and saw this cute little girl and scrolled down to the second picture and it melted my heart....[happy girl](http://imgur.com/gallery/8HTYU)...I had a good cry seeing this. I thought about how uncertain those 1171 days must have been for her. I thought about how happy she must be. I thought about how happy people staying sober are and the struggles they go through as well. Keep posting those X number of days sober posts. They really do mean something. I hope everyone here gets to the point where they are comfortable and happy being sober. Happy holidays everyone and happy new year. Wishing everyone the best for 2017.
