I struggle with this every day. I think about how I won't go to the store and I won't charge money I don't have on my credit card just for a couple six packs...Then I wake up the next day impulse takes over and I run to ABC to grab a bottle of scotch or a couple six packs and I'll finish them in a night. If I don't finish them I pass out...I've ruined three relationships due to addiction. Whether it was drugs or alcohol or cigarettes. Why do I do something like this? I gave up smoking just fine but when it comes to drinking...I don't know. It's not addictive chemically. I don't feel the addiction like nicotine...I just feel like my depression is getting too bad or I feel like I need to celebrate some small little event in my life or I need to get rid of this anxiety burning through my chest. But maybe the alcohol is causing the anxiety...I have to tell someone. I have to get this out and make a promise otherwise I'm just like my grandfather. Doomed to die at 60 years old from liver cancer bladder cancer or just end up on the floor dead at my apartment from alcohol poisoning. That's not going to be my life.

Welcome! It's hard to imagine a life without alcohol but I am here from the other side to tell you it's so worth stopping.  It's hard to imagine because life is honestly better than I knew was possible before. Please keep reading posts here. Stick around and let us know how we can help!
Good luck friend.  It's hard for me but I take heart from the stories and support here. I hope to see you here again.
