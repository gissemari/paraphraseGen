I drank ten beers last night.  On Friday day 27 of sobriety I got it in my head that maybe I should allow myself one day of drinking per month and that Saturday would be the day.  Kind of like how on a diet you're supposed to allow yourself a little treat once in a while.  So I picked up some beer in the early afternoon and then had to distract myself so I wouldn't nip into it too early and end up drunk by 5 PM. That's not something a 'normal drinker' has to do and probably should have scared me...I'm not too bummed out that I drank yesterday provided I can get back on track.  I learned something from it that I had forgotten: **I don't like binge drinking.**  The monthly treat wasn't even a treat...A part of me feels like it was important for me to try that experiment.  There's no need to try it again.  If I'm being honest I do have a second experiment in my head still: one drink once per month.  I realize how stupid that sounds and it's embarrassing to write it here but it's how I'm feeling at this moment...Any comments/advice is welcome.  It's the people here who got me my 27 days and will get me there again.  Thanks for reading.

&gt; A part of me feels like it was important for me to try that experiment. There's no need to try it again...You've gathered your data from your experiment and found that the result was unfavorable. We've all had to "test ourselves" in such a fashion. So there's no need to--..&gt; If I'm being honest I do have a second experiment in my head still: one drink once per month. I realize how stupid that sounds and it's embarrassing to write it here but it's how I'm feeling at this moment...**WAT**..Look based on the first experiment you already *know* the outcome of the second experiment. ..Seriously you know what's going to happen...I know how you feel to be sure because I've had that mindset too. But *logically* you and I both know that this isn't a good plan.
What difference is having 1 drink a month going to make? Why not skip the beer and take a 1 month chip instead? It's fine if you want to treat yourself once in a while but if you're an alcoholic it probably shouldn't be with alcohol. 
You do recognize alcoholic thinking when it's slapping you in the face? Right? You belong here turningrightonthird and we're happy to help.

Hmmmm  one drink a month. I think things like this too- who thinks like this? Alcoholics that's who. Better to just leave it alone life is so much less complicated that way!! 
I have a couple questions if you would be so kind to think about it. Why do you want to drink in moderation? How would it improve your life?
