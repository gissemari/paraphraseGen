Two weeks ago I posted about my blackout binge session that resulted in upsetting the annual family dinner outing. I've since apologized and come clean about my struggle with my family and closest friends...I'm happy to report that I am 15 days sober and plan to get through Christmas without a drink...Happy Holidays!
