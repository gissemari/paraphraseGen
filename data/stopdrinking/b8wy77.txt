I want to again thank everyone here for the support advice and just generally being the sounding board that was missing from my life that I desperately needed.  I'm 120 days sober today and I could not have done it without you...My life has totally changed. I've lost 20 pounds of fat and gained 5 of muscle.  I've been working out and I look good and feel good.  I wish I would've taken some  before' pics because the change is remarkable.  Also reading a lot enjoying old forgotten hobbies once again being productive sleeping like a champ and generally living life like I should. ..For those of you struggling to quit just know that life's problems will still be there but they're a lot easier to face and deal with when sober.  ..I only occasionally have a craving now and they are pretty easy squash these days. I've successfully gone out with old drinking buddies and to social events where the focus is on drinking and stayed sober.  I don't really enjoy that anymore but that's ok because I enjoy the rest of my life so much more...I proudly say now quite frequently  I stopped drinking  and welcome any questions that follow. ..Life is good. ..Thanks SD IWNDWYT
