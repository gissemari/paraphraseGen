So as the title states I relapsed about 2 weeks ago. I was going pretty well and wasn't having any craving or problems which triggered my relapse. In fact my problem was the opposite I was doing well. I was getting things done achieving things and feeling pretty confident...Unfortunately I think this was my undoing. Because  I had been able to give up cold turkey for 4 months & see pretty significant improvements I started to reason that I must have my drinking under control. I mean if I could give up for 4 months on sheer will wasn't that proof I didn't have a problem?..This complacency wasn't something I anticipated and it lead to me falling right back into drinking at the same dangerous levels which made me give up in the first place...Suffice to say I poured the last of the liquor I bought down the sink yesterday and have requested to have my badge reset to yesterday...I am posting all of this in the hopes it helps someone else identify how even after you think you have your problem under control you can deceive yourself into going back to old habits...Thanks for reading and good luck. :)
