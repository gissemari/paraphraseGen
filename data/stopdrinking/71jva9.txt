Let me preface this all by saying that I'm doing well and I'm sober and I hope you are too!  .  .Things have been a bit emotional at home and I was talking through things with my best friend who's overseas and is my emotional rock for all tough things. If you guys have some time to read this I had some thoughts on sobriety and would love for any help/advice on maintaining a healthy mindset/closing out some of these bad thoughts. Some of this is clipped from my conversation with my bud on Facebook and some is paraphrased.  .  .So I always thought the hardest part of quitting was getting started. Actually deciding on "monday" that i won't drink because it's so easy to justify "just one more day" or "i'll quit on friday when everything's easier" and then inevitably Friday rolled around and I didn't want to quit because I'd do it Sunday when I had to be at work on Monday or things weren't easier for some other reason. Excuses right? Pah.  .But I quit and I'm (terribly at counting) coming up to about 100 days or thereabouts. I pushed past that tough stage of actually starting my quit and luckily i didn't have any hospital visits or bad withdrawals - just some night sweats and some trouble sleeping.   .  .So now as the days pass it's almost progressively easier to turn around and say to myself that quitting wasn't a big deal. Which is unfair to myself in 2 ways - (1) because it's like mentally relapsing and saying "oh i didn't really have a problem" and (2) also not giving myself enough credit for quitting which back then was fucking tough to start. ..As a result when something emotional and most likely distressing is coming up it's bad to start thinking of a back-pocket solution of "if all else goes badly i'll just get fucked up drunk with &lt;sister&gt; and it'll all be okay".  ..sober &lt;me&gt; has spent the last ~100 days building coping mechanisms that don't damage my health and i can't let emotional and lazy &lt;me&gt; take over (because on some level i do equate drinking with laziness because if i'm drinking i don't have to take care of myself at all i just need to make sure that i've got some booze available).  . .Cause then i've lost all this hard work . .  .And it's difficult because i see a lot of "yeah it gets easier" . .And you're damn right it does get easier to stay off the drink but it also gets easier to tell yourself that you never really had a problem/never were an alcoholic/quitting wasn't really that big a deal anyway/i can definitely have a healthy relationship with alcohol. .  .For now I'm taking it one day at a time. It's 1:22am (late bedtime!) and IWNDWYT I will be continuing to drink Chamomile Tea instead (been smashing it down great for a night time drink btw). I wanted to get some of this stuff down on a post - just in case anyone else has ever felt this way I want you to know you're not alone.   .  .If anyone has any words of wisdom to share in relation to what I'm thinking I'd love to hear! Sorry for the long-winded post it's been an emotional few days so hopefully I can be excused.  .  .Love you all and IWNDWYT. Peace and love from Australia. .  ..

no wisdom here but I've been going through pretty much the same and my brain likes to play tricks on me when my defenses are down...To keep it simple (for myself) I compare it to a left-handed layup. The backstory here is that I started playing basketball at 16 and never been taught that from the left side you're supposed to take left-right step instead of right-left..For years I kept doing right-left step even from the left then forced myself to learn the right way to do it when I was about 32-33 and it took me many years to feel comfortable doing it the "right" way and sometimes during matches I still do it wrong cause it feels more natural....So I'm trying to apply that to my recovery process. I try not to question what is the right way to do things (it's hard!) and listen to people with more experience. I need to continue practicing my sobriety because it's not an habit and doesn't feel natural (meetings reading this sub not worrying too much). I have to appreciate the effort I'm putting into this kind of training and look for its benefits...It's hard for me not to let my brain wander around and start elaborating questions and doubts and what is right and what is wrong so I try to clear my mind and focus on applying myself on this new thing I'm learning staying sober..
This is the first (and I hope only) time I've ever stopped drinking for good. ..Yet I've stopped drinking many times before. Sometimes for sport event more often because I wasn't comfortable with the drinking habits and thought a month 2 month 3 months (or whatever it was that particular time) and wanted to break the habit.  ..When you've done 3 months and feel totally in control it's understandable I feel to think 'problem solved'.  ..For me before long I would find myself once again feeling uncomfortable with my drinking.  What happened to my perfect control?   ..I've been around that loop many times. Now I realise that it's not going to change. So I had to have an honest evaluation of myself.  I can either be a drinker or a non drinker. No in-between. ..Those are my thoughts.....I don't think they count as the wisdom you seem :-)
