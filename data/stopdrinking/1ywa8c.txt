So a ... let's call it what it is - fuck buddy - just called me out of the blue. I haven't hung out with her since I've sobered up...She's just opened a restaurant. A restaurant with a bar. She wants me to come see it. She's being pretty assertive and demanding in a flirty kind of way...I really have no idea how to handle this. In the past we would drink a lot and have crazy wild sex. I'm worried that my penis is going to make me relapse...I'd really appreciate some tips from someone who's been in a similar situation.

Call her now.  Tell her you are sober that you will be happy to test mocktails.  Put it in terms of sharing good news of your own. But that you need say it now...See where it goes.   And tell your penis that getting some is not worth a relapse.  
Under every skirt is a slip!!  Be warned!
In order to get my life back together I felt the need to draw a line in the sand with the labels "good for sobriety" on one side and "bad for sobriety" on the other. Things like "flirty stuff with cool girls" or "just say Hi to Isabelle" just fell on the wrong side of the line. Tie a knot down there while you sober up buddy... 
Can't add anything to excellent advice already in the comments other than my hope that you'll keep sharing on /r/stopdrinking.  Good luck. 
This is a good one. I agree warn her ahead of time that you're off the juice. I did with a chick the other night actually. She had a few beers I got jacked on some Red Bull and we had a good night. Don't let the tang flush your 44 days down the toilet.
