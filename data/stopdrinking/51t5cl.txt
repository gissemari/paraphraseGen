I'm pretty disgusted with myself right now and am nursing a horrible hangover. Yesterday my grandfather passed away and I thought - I'll call in sick and get drunk as fuck. I sent an embarrassing email to my boss where I overshared and I couldn't be more angry at myself...This needs to stop. I don't want to keep drinking anymore. It's getting worse and I can't control it. It's getting dangerous too. When I'm drunk I do things I'd never do sober. I sometimes drive and get myself into dangerous situations. I send embarrassing texts and emails. I make an ass off myself. ..My grandfather was a good man. I want to make him proud. I don't know what I can do to change but I need to do something. I've tried AA and I hate the god talk and cult feeling. I don't believe in God. It's hard for me to go to a place where God is literally written on the walls and chanted at every meeting. I like parts of it but I just can't stand the hand holding chant in the end. Its bullshit. I can't be myself there. But regardless I need to do something as I can't control my drinking on my own. Maybe SMART?..I won't drink today. That I can guarantee. I usually can make it a few days before I relapse hard which is what happened last night. I almost had a week sober. I keep trying to get this right but I'm realizing I can't do it alone. ..Please help me. I wish I was strong enough to get this right.

Hello.  I'm kind of in the same boat you are.  Went to my first meeting yesterday and I've always had an aversion to the God stuff...But I decided this is going to kill me... I continuously do something that kills me.  So how the fuck is it I can be so sure there isn't a god or use that as a presupposition against doing what has worked for a bunch of people.  Maybe I'll find out I'm wrong or maybe I'll just skirt around that issue.   I just decided not to use it as an excuse not to try...Good luck.
Hi there welcome! I used drinking as a way to "deal with" my emotions for years - it didn't work too well for me. Getting support for my sobriety *did* work wonders. I kept trying new things until I found what works for me and it sounds like you're doing the same thing - giving posting here a shot talking about trying SMART etc. I didn't know what would be most helpful for me until I tried things out...I used SD quite a lot when I was getting sober. I posted pretty much every day for the first three months of my sobriety. I also read a ton on here. I read comments and posts as they happen and also searched the sub &amp; went back through old posts. Support in real life was key for me too - support groups &amp; local SD'ers and my therapist/psychiatrist...Look forward to seeing you around!
