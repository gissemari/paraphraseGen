As a person who absolutely LOVES being social one thing that I've been struggling with lately is feeling isolated. ..That being said I am jonesing for some people interaction so I found a little St. Patrick's day festival nearby and made plans to go with a friend. ..I feel like she's been trying to dissuade me from going by mentioning that it's probably going to rain it's too far away etc. ..Last night we were talking on the phone and she mentioned that she thought it strange that I wanted to go to a thing where people would be drinking. ..It made me think - yes people will be drinking. So what? It's ok for others to drink. I know that I don't want to. Should that stop me from wanting to have fun? Of course not! There are other things to do there. It's an art festival with local bands so there will be plenty to do and see. ..I have the serenity strength and courage to make it though a day of bacchanalia without taking a sip and that makes me proud!!..Happy St. Patrick's day     and as always I won't drink with y'all today!

Thanks for sharing. Yes serenity and confidence in yourself will allow you to have a great time without the alcohol poison. I just ignore the drinking and alcohol that infests these 'parties'. Nobody typically cares as they focus on their own desire to get sauced. Enjoy the St. Patrick Day events  
Happy St Paddy's!! Went to a new supermarket Friday night resolving not to go near the liquor section but in looking for soda water I found myself smack in the wine aisle. I expected the urge to run away and avoid temptation ' but to my pleasant suprise I felt zero craving zero inclination to get booze. Definitely not drinking with you this weekend
