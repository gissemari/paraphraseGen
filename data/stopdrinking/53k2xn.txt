This is the longest I have gone without alcohol since I first started drinking 10 years ago. I have quit and relapsed several times over the past 3 years which was when I first realized I had a problem with alcohol. ..I made the decision after I relapsed 6 months ago that this can't be how I live my life anymore. After ending up in the hospital doing some slight damage to my car and really opening up to the closest people in my life I was able to not go back to that lifestyle. The support on stop drinking has helped me immensely as well. If it weren't for you guys my boyfriend and family I would still be dealing with a lot of problems. Here is to sobriety and many more months of it!
