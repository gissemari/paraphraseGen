I've struggled with drugs and nicotine in the past  and I was in denial about alcohol becoming another addiction. I realized that I cannot enjoy my friends or family unless I'm drinking and I constantly crave some form of intoxication as a coping mechanism with personal issues. It's been almost a year since my last high and I'm going to add alcohol to the list of things I'm clean from. . .Last night I again used alcohol to try and enhance a night out and I once again disappointed my best friends and embarassed myself and my social anxiety is reminding me why I keep trying to stop drinking in the first place. I was throwing up all morning I feel physically like shit and emotionally like shit. In fact my anxiety and depression are back with a vengeance after a couple months of relative peace. ..Sorry for speech I'm just fucked up right now. Thanks for reading.

Sorry you had to go through this but glad you got the lesson. I get anxiety and depression hitting me like a sledgehammer too I just can't do it anymore.  Stay around this sub there's a lot of support here. 
I said something similar a while back.  REF:   I think I've had my last drink... ..It took me years to become a problem drinker and months to take that whole idea of   I think I've had about enough of this drinking crap!  and decide to DO it...I am now nearing 200 days sober and hope to never look back!  You can do this!
I'm on day 1. Horrible anxiety and body aches. I think I slept an hour last night. I'm done w booze hopefully for good. IWNDWYT
