So I just need to vent about something. .Someone told my new girlfriend that I relapsed and now I think I lost her. Why would someone make something like that up she asks? I wish I knew. Now it looks like I'm lying about something that would be a huge deal if it were true. Who knows if she'll ever really trust me again if I even get her back..It was her long time friend that made it up too. Said I looked inebriated at my Thursday night home group AA meeting. The meeting I am GSR for. That I sit in the front in every week. .People suck. This is my biggest accomplishment of my life. The fact that someone else has sewn distrust in a great relationship by saying I relapsed is disgusting. Whatever. .Thanks for reading. Despite the shitty situation IWNDWYT.

Keep your head up. Nothing you can do about it except continue on with your sobriety.  I have had the same rumors swirl about me on several occasions. None of those people are still sober but I am!..Trying to figure out why someone would do that will drive you nuts. She will either believe you or she won't I wouldn't waste time on that either. 
That's infuriating. .  I haven't had relapse rumors about me (that I know of anyway) but having dealt with rumors about me (usually that I'm banging a coworker during my spouses deployments or other nonsense like that). .  The response I would give to someone asking me about a rumor is two things:  have I said or done anything that suggests to you that I've relapsed . And as for why someone would up a rumor -  I don't know but whatever people say won't change the truth.   ..I hope this works out for you. .IWNDWYT
This really stinks but if she doesn't trust you maybe it's for the better.
