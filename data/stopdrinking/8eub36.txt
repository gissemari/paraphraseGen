[It's. that. day. again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** I've been doing a lot of meal prep and watching calories and I'm glad to say I'm losing a consistent amount of weight and keeping at it. And I'm now getting back to my 10k steps a day goal something I used to do consistently in my first year but stopped. I am seeing all sort of other positive benefits from this like improved mood energy levels and generally feeling better. ..**Struggle:** Sweets. I cannot moderate them hah. Have to stop from buying them regardless of how much on sale they were. I ate a box of frosted flakes in a day. ..**General:** I am always on the lookout for new music for my walks and I get excited this time of year because the Austin City Limits music fest lineup gets released soon so I can make my new playlist for all the ACL bands. What new music are you guys finding out there this spring? ..[My fave band from last year](https://youtu.be/dDL5k9LpZ9w?t=1h21m56s)

Triumph: I reset my badge and got right back into it after a slip up. On day 2 but planning to really go for it now. ..Struggle: my boyfriend of over a year and I split up. I asked him how he felt about us and he said he didn't know which completely threw me off. Apparently because at the beginning of our relationship I ghosted him once and because I mentioned at one point I'd like to move out of the state he never took us seriously. This was all a giant slap in the face. I'd been up front with him a while ago and told him I needed to know if he didn't want things like marriage and kids at some point in his life because I do and he led me on and told me he might I guess he never wanted those things and just never told me or was up front with me so I've wasted my time thinking I was in something that was going somewhere. On the plus side I guess I don't need to worry about him ruining my sobriety anymore (he's a heavy drinker). ..General: taking today off school to gather my thoughts and process the above. Thinking about starting a journal again. ..Thanks for being here SD I will not drink with you today (though I may chain smoke and eat ice cream) 
Hey u/stratyturd! Great to see ya here! Love and hugs to our u/sfgirlmary...we're thinking of you love! &lt;3..**Triumph:**    800!!!..**Struggles:**    Ohhh there's been a few (as many of you know). Bottom line girls and guys: Don't. Pick. Up. ;)..**General:**    Got my bloodwork done got all my doc appointments set up for next week finally getting my shit done and ready for SPRING!!!
triumph: joined and went to the gym...struggle: job stress...general: i am feeling good for the most part. 
**Triumph:** Feeling good and ticking along. Sometimes it's easy to take these good spells for granted so I'm celebrating this one...**Struggle:** Balance. Work-home balance sweet reward vs pigging out productivity vs laziness. Especially in these good times I tend to swing too far to the extremes...**General:** [Walk Like a Panther](https://youtu.be/c_x6UOZjWU4) is something I heard recently and been coming back to frequently.
**Struggle:** On Monday I flew from Tampa to San Francisco and stopped for a layover in Denver. When I got off the plane I found myself surrounded by several bars at least one of which I distinctly remembered drinking in while waiting for a flight back in the day. I felt a slight panic and hurried off toward my gate wanting to get myself out of there away from all the temptation...**Triumph:** As I left the area I saw [this sign](https://i.imgur.com/SsSx4jg.png) and felt a wave of relief. It felt like I had come  home.  Then I went and got some Chinese takeaway to take with me onto the next flight. (Having a good hot meal always helps.)..**General:**  Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.   Chinese proverb.
*Triumph:* I've realized I have a problem and am making plans to be the best me...*Struggle:* I have a million regrets and I feel that of those I've told only one actually acknowledge it...
**Triumph:** Found a PCP who actually takes his time and listens to me and talked to him about my problem. Joined this wonderful community and started on my journey to sobriety. Got lab tests done and prescribed welbutrin for depression. Had a team meeting today for work and contributed much more than usual even though I'm the newest member to the team..**Struggle:** My liver is still swollen and tender from my last binging session over 72 hours ago. I'm getting some withdrawal symptoms like anxiety headaches dizziness and crampiness; doing my best to be mindful of what these are and why they're happening rather than freaking out and going to urgent care..Today's a trigger day for me since it is [Lill-L rdag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Saturday) which used to be my justification for drinking in the middle of the week...**General:** Got my lab tests back generally elevated liver enzymes which is to be expected but what surprised me was I was vitamin D deficient 6ng/mL! I've also began trying to play some of the story based video games I have on my backlog instead of online multiplayer games put a couple hours into Pillars of Eternity and am enjoying it now that I can keep track of the story and dialog.
Truimph: Went and saw some old friends last night that i dont get to see often. Really stoked i got to hangout to hangout with them. Now that im sober im feeling really grateful to have them back in my life. Near the last couple years of my drinking career they wanted nothing to do with me so its awesome that they are back in my life...Struggle: Been having tons of doubts about my involvement in AA recently. I keep going mostly because i enjoy some of the shares setting up the meetings and talking to some of the people ive met but i have some problems about working the steps. Got even more problems about the whole "higher power" and god talk shit but i think the benefit i get from being of service and being around others outweighs my distaste for religion for now...General: I really want to move out of California but i dont know where yet. Playing with Seattle or Portland but another part of me wants to leave the states behind entirely and maybe head to Spain or perhaps England.
**Triumph:** I've been doing well socially. Seeing people on a regular basis trying new things with people setting up things to do with people...**Struggle:** Diet diet diet. I can't stop binging on chips and ice cream. Better than booze but still.....**General:** I just started listening to The National Parks even though it's been in my library for ages. [Helsinki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SU1gX_aas) is a great song!
Triumph: I hit two years wedding planning and work is going pretty amazing...Struggle: Sleep I feel so busy sometimes between work school meetings sponsor sponsee that I just crash out. Cadillac problems...General: I fucking love my life today and its always sunny and warm where I live now.
Triumph: went to the gym this morning feeling great.Struggle: not very motivated to do work.General: traveling this weekend for work hate to be away from the family
T: got past a couple of minor surgeries anesthesia &amp; booze &amp; me don't do well.  .S: I still feel like a Sobriety Shut-in cut off from most enjoyable moments in life because alcohol is such a big part of the involvement.  .G: really enjoying Spring
Hi all this is my first time here. .Struggle: I had a 2 day binging event at a destination wedding last weekend that culminated in getting denied boarding on the flight home. Big time shame/self-judgment. .Triumph: I'm accepting my emotions and finding comfort here. Not beating myself up as badly as in the past. Finding a great deal of solace in reading stories and seeing everyone's supportive replies..General: Took a final exam this morning and got my new bluetooth headphones to work successfully. Managed to pick through the sparsely stocked fridge to make myself and son grilled cheese sandwiches last night..
Happy Wednesday y'all!..**Triumph:** Last Friday I went to an event with work sober. The event unlike others that I attend had no objective other than getting drunk. Everyone around me was chugging drinks and dancing wildly \(and this was a high\-profile fashion event in Canada!\) I went as a challenge and I left after 45 minutes because I felt very uncomfortable... But I didn't drink and I consider this a huge triumph. Another triumph is that I'm staying very consistent with my health goals... Little by little!..**Struggle:** I'm still having a lot of trouble getting to sleep early and staying asleep. Though I've lived through my detox symptoms \(exhaustion vertigo nausea etc.\) sleep is something I'm still really struggling with. I keep having terrible recurring dreams about my parents. I've had these dreams for years in which I am sobbing and screaming at them to listen to me and they just laugh in my face. Had a terrible one last night...**General:** I AM SO EXCITED FOR SPIN CLASS TONIGHT! That shit gives me euphoria almost as strong as MDMA I kid you not lol.
T:  Passed my nursing exam...S:  I've had to put everything on hold to focus on studying.  Life is in all sorts of disorder...G:  I like that new JT song w/Chris Stapleton.  Not really a fan of country but it's decent and the video is good too.
*Triumph:* Reached out to get a cycling coach. Structuring weekly/monthly/yearly goals and scheduling races is giving me something to look forward to everyday...*Struggle:* My first appointment with a new PCP just got delayed 3 weeks. Annoying but I can wait. I relapsed on my 31st birthday last week and embarrasingly drunk texted an ex of 3 years. :X My mom's house was burglarized yesterday. She lives alone so I drove 3 hours over to help her clean up and beef up security. I'm about to do yard work and let me tell you the conditioning I put myself to drink and mow grass is very real. It's hard but I'm not going to drink. ..*General:* Very excited for consistent warm weather. Bring on the heat! **Infinity War** comes out soon. Anyone going?
**Triumph** 3 months sober now. Longest I've gone since 1999. Feeling great. ..**Struggle** Work is still irritating in many ways. I'm trying to just be calm and get through each day. It could be a lot worse after all...**General** It's pizza night at my house! Looking forward to a great workout tonight followed by some great pizza.
Triumph: I just got a huge promotion at work basically I'm now at the highest tier at my job. There's no I could be doing this kind of work if I was still drinking...Struggle: Still dealing with the loneliness that comes from losing some friends where the whole relationship was built on drinking. Hard to not see some of those folks but I know I can't just casually hang with them anymore at least for now...General: Go Angels! Sweep those world champion Astros!
Triumph.4 days not drinking.My boss thanked me yesterday .My car runs and I can pay for lunch..Struggle.My husband doesn't know if I am telling the truth about not drinking right now.My husband is struggling at work.I question if my 30 year marriage can make it..General.This is my first post here.  Grateful to r/stop drinking and this Wednesday delightful sub 
Struggle:   My brain went haywire this week and I made a couple impulsive decisions that I used to make while drinking. Lets me know I've got some issues to work on besides drinking.  I actually had the feeling for two days that it was beyond my control not to do something and that was scary. ...Triumph:  I was not tempted to drink at all during all that even when I went out to places where I could not have imagined going and not drinking. There was barely any thought of alcohol at all which was...odd. ...General: All the love to sfmary 
**Triumph:** I delivered *all* the material for the magazine I edit on time. Whoa me holding a deadline?? That's *got* to be sobriety!..**Struggle:** My evil twin has woken from his slumber...**General:** The rest of the snow vanished from the garden last weekend. Summer here we come!
Triumph: 5 months sober today (thanks SD!)..Struggle: Need to improve my self-care especially healthy food and enough sleep!..General: I think I can finally see the light at the end of the long winter...wore just my lightweight fleece today. Yay! 
Triumph: Day 16 sober and Day 5 eating right and couch to 5k!.Struggle: have to produce something creative on a tight deadline - used to use drink to  loosen up  and get The creativity flowing (thought so anyway) so antsy as hell but will not drink.General: looking forward to getting out of town for a few days in May.
**Struggle:** I have been struggling with work because a coworker is bashing me to my other coworkers for the most minor reasons. They're unfounded and I'm sick of it. I have a ball of anxiety and anger...**Triumph:** Getting through cravings! Making sure I reach out when I hear that voice in my head...**General:** Just trying to get my house back in order. Been heavy drinking + depressed and unmotivated. Slowly getting everything back to where it needs to be. When I drink I never pick up after myself.
Struggle: avoiding hanging out with friends and going to parties because I don't trust myself to not drink. I hate being alone and I hate being the drunk version of myself. Hope this gets easier...Triumph: being able to fall asleep and wake up feeling refreshed for work. No crippling hangovers and panic attacks. Cooking delicious meals and being able to taste them.
Yep gotta stop eating pint of ice cream at 3am.. one thing at a time.
Triumph: I have resisted the urge to drink. I found myself unexpectedly alone at lunch the other day. My first thought was go to a bar get some food and have a beer. Then immediately after I reminded myself how terrible I'd feel if I did that. So instead I went to a makeup store then grabbed something to eat at a cafe...Struggle: I have been avoiding responsibilities related to my job because I feel overwhelmed. Of course avoiding things is only making me feel  stressed out and isn't helping anything...General: I signed up to volunteer at the Lincoln Park Zoo. I'm looking forward to it cause it'll get me out and engaged in something that inspires me...
Struggle: I've been feeling bored and anxious trying to occupy my time. I normally enjoy reading but it's hard to do that all day long. I don't have much motivation to do much...Triumph: I woke up at 7am on my day off and went to hot yoga. I also took my dogs on two walks today...General: My husband is trying to get sober as well and got denied outpatient treatment because he hasn't been sober long enough but doesn't feel he can do it on his own. He is trying to find a psychiatrist to get prescribed naltrexone since his GP will not.
*Triumph:* I feel sharper than I have in years and have not had a headache in a few weeks. I remember at my last "normal" job I felt my brain was perma-dead and I had headaches a few days a week (some from drinking some other reasons)...*Struggle:* My skin is turning garbage again. Maintaining good skin is a huuuge motivator/perk for staying sober so I will be pretty bummed if it doesn't sort itself out. ..*General:* I feel hella old in a good way and in a bad way lol.
Hi..Struggle: I'm still going through some withdrawal with drinking dreams and I'm grouchy.  I also live about an hour away from the meetings that I love. I've hit Nashville almost everyday this week and the drive is tiresome. ..Triumph: I'm not mourning or craving a drink. I think of it and just don't want it. I'm not sure what kind of trick my mind is playing on me because 8 days ago I couldn't imagine my night without it. I'm not complaining. I'm genuinely happier and so motivated. I've read a book to my children every night this week...General: My lack of time for reading has turned me on to audio books. It makes the commute to Nashville productive. I'm currently listening to The Naked Mind.  I'm starting to enjoy music again and love the band Cigarettes After Sex. 
**Triumph:** I hit 600 days recently so that was cool.  I celebrated by giving myself a much needed day off totally lazy watching shows and napping and I feel recharged...**Struggle:** Cigarettes.  Ugh.  I am so pissed at myself for picking them up again.  I am seeing a doctor tomorrow and I feel like it will be good inspiration to kick ass at quitting again.  I just still haven't managed to deal with stress in a healthy way...**General:** I asked my community for cammas bulbs and got some cannas bulbs instead.  I am excited to have some new lilies that I haven't really encountered before. You don't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you might just find you get what you need.  
Just commenting to check how days I've been sober!..Thanks to the flair keeping track for me
