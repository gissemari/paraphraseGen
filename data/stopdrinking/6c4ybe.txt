I still feel like a newcomer in a lot of ways :)..I will say that I am glad that relapse is not apart of my personal story but is apart of my experience.  A dude that I have known for 10+ years relapsed (again) but passed away this time about two weeks ago after coming to my homegroup.  ..It's sad and a reminder to stay vigilant.  ..Just for today I will not drink with you good people and hope that my time provides some inspiration that you too can stop drinking and find a new way to live.

nice..I'm 3+ years out and feel invincible in a lot of ways but started posting back on this sub more recently...Partly for me to remind myself of realities partially to help a new crowd who is struggling like I had struggled 3 years ago.
Thank You!  I look forward to reaching that mark --- in another 17 years or so.....I have a new and stable lifestyle but I still remind myself daily that I Do Not Drink...Infinite thanks to this group for the daily invitation to not drink with me today.
Congratulations!.Feeling like a newcomer is perhaps one of the reasons why you're still sober. Thinking we've got this thing beaten and losing focus or vigilance often ends up like the man you mention..
Thank you for this reminder. The longer I'm sober (which isn't very long but still) the more and more I see that my sobriety has to be active. My craving for alcohol seem to have gone away but my craving for numbness is still strong. I just know better self care healthier ways of checking out and relaxing. Can I ask you do you still crave? Does that ever go away?
What a damn lovely number. Congrats!
So many thousands.
