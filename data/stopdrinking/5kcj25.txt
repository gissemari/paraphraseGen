Still here still sober..went to an AA meeting the other night. Have mixed feelings. It seemed like a good thing for everyone there but I still felt so disconnected. Trying to convince myself it's okay to be proud of not just blowing it off altogether out of fear. All in all the holiday season has been okay. I'm sure it would have been much more chaotic and dangerous if i'd given in to the desire to relapse. It's quiet and that is a strange new beautiful comfort to get used to. Hope everyone had/is having great sober holiday fun or is at least doing okay. Love and blessings all!

hi ! I know what you mean by quiet. my brain feels so much more like a mountain lake. not all the time. but there is far less stuff going on when I'm not drunk or recovering each day. ..tell me about the feelings of disconnection... what do you feel disconnected from ?
