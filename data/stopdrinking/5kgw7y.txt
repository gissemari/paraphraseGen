Right now is a strange time for me. I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense....but I originally got sober two years ago. November 16 2014 to be exact. I maintained sobriety up until this summer. During that time I went to AA meetings I had a sponsor I visited this site everyday. I relapsed and in August went to treatment for the first time. I had been doing well for a couple months up until recently. I decided to end my relationship with my abusive father. It was toxic and needed to be done. But now I'm all sorts of messed up and the holidays have only made it worse. I'm revisiting old wounds and I'm desperate to feel okay. I feel like I'm in panic mode. I've been doing xanax oxycodone and muscle relaxers. Not in excess but often enough to be concerning. I popped a couple xanax Friday night and ending up drinking two glasses of wine. I didn't entirely fall off the wagon thank god. But I'm in a dangerous place right now and could really use some support. I feel like I'm in open water with no safety net. I'm not going to meetings I don't feel like AA's for me. I feel lonely I feel lost. I was questioning if alcoholism was actually a disease. I went as far as researching whether or not people have successfully moderated later in life. I don't want to drink but I'm not taking care of myself and feel like I'm in a place mentally that could easily lead to me saying fuck it. I need someone to call me on my shit tell me how it is. I need someone to tell me it will be okay. I appreciate any advice or kind words. I feel so crazy lately and need some sort of reality check. I miss my contentment.

Ending the relationship with your abusive father is huge. It had to be done but I'm sure there are many repercussions. I mean even though it appears your father probably wasn't any of the things a father is supposed to be you're still dealing with the loss of someone who was supposed to love you and guide you. Be there for you. Perhaps now you're realizing that you'll never have that. It was true before but now you know. That's hard as hell and maybe that feeling of open water is your feeling of being alone. .You can go to an AA meeting you don't have to buy all they're offering. Take advantage of the support you so badly need right now...I don't imagine you'd be here right now if you didn't know that alcohol is only going to make it worse. I'd write 500 posts call a friend go to a meeting do something to help myself! Alcohol can only make it worse and I don't know about you but for me drinking would throw contentment right out the window..You're going through hell right now. It will get better a caring ear would help. I wish you the best dear heart..
You can do this Avelene. When I get so sad and so close to drinking because of some awful thing I think to myself I'm not going to let this thing win. I will not let it have the power over me to make me drink. Then I get fighting mad and fight like an alley cat for my sobriety. No one can take that away from me but me and dammit! I'm not gonna let that happen! Sending you lots of hugs be strong.
Glad you're here...You've achieved sobriety for a period of time.  Congratulations...I see some ambiguity some equivocation.  My mind will lie to me.  ..You write things that include -.."often enough to be concerning".."I feel like I'm in panic mode".."I'm desperate"; "feel lonely and lost"........."I'm questioning if alcoholism is a disease"........These all sound to me like *contention* in your mind.  Unsettled unclear not purposeful...I found labels less than useful for me.  Instead I look at my outcomes...I realized that *Alcohol + Me = Undesired Consequences*..I decided to eliminate alcohol-associated consequences from my life...I spoke to a counselor.  She recommended meetings.  I went got support tools resources and fellowship.  I've not looked back...Interestingly you share that you **were** successful went to meetings and had a sponsor when you were maintaining sobriety...Now I hear that your mind tells you "I don't feel like AA's for me."..Take a look at that sentence specifically the choice to employ the verb "feel".  I believe you may intend the word "think".  None of the things that you shared are "feelings" rather they are "thoughts". ..You actually use the word "feel"  in 7 instances when I think you intend the word "think".  Why does that matter?  Well to me this is what my mind does when it lies to me.  ..Living in my head has the potential to screw me up.  ..That's why I focus on my behaviors and consequences...You are experiencing:  "relapses; drug and alcohol mixed use; "messed up"; panic mode; being concerned; in a dangerous place; in open water; not taking care of myself; and on a precipice of "fuck it"...I "think" you know what you the answers are.  I "think" you already wrote about the success you have enjoyed and the behaviors and actions that delivered that success to you...Sounds like you understand where you can relocate your contentment...I care about you.  Let us know how we can support you...Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One
&gt; **There's nothing so bad that alcohol won't make it worse.**
Though you may not see a clear path through right now we CAN! You are too close to it to know but I have absolute confidence that you can get through this. You've done it before and you'll do it again. ..CONGRATS on giving yourself the respect you deserve by calling a time-out on your relationship with your father! That is huge. Continue to be kind to yourself and give yourself the space and time to sort your feelings out. A big change like this can often make things feel so completely out of control and leave you with no sense of who you are. As is common with abusive relationships some of what you may be feeling right now is coming from the things you think your father must be thinking about you. Try to remember that his feelings do not come from a rational place and they are not an accurate reflection of you. ..I'd encourage you to do those things you rarely get to do that make you feel connected to the true you whatever you daydream about (maybe being outside painting cooking working on cars)... remind yourself that in the present moment you are okay. You can breathe. Take all the time you need to get your bearings. ..It sounds like you know what path you want to follow--one of sustainable health and healing--but you're struggling against habitual coping mechanisms and dependencies. These are physical issues preventing you from feeling balanced emotionally. I would encourage you to seek support from an experienced counselor so that you can begin to heal in the way you seem to want and need to. ..Best of luck to you you can do it!! We can all tell you are incredibly strong and are rooting for you!
