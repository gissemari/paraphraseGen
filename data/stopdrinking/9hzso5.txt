I want to find a way to volunteer or help others who are battling addiction but not sure where to start. I was thinking maybe a local homeless shelter anything where I can dive in and just start offering my time and willingness to work...Do any of you have any suggestions? I'm still struggling with my addiction but back on the wagon (meetings reading exercises etc) but I think giving back could give me something to feel good about instead of feeling worthless and guilty all the time a big part of why I drink in the first place.

Have you done service in AA?.Even though you are new there are things you can do.
In Canada we have United Way and in newspaper advertising there's usually an actual Volunteer section with different ads like literacy sessions (helping actual people learn to read) charity drive help (for example the Cancer Society) among others.  Then we can always call up the food bank or lunch center and volunteer to go in too.  Animal shelters also take volunteers.  
Are there any recovery centers in your area that have meetings? Even just showing up in support of people who are going through detox and their first week would mean a lot. It did for me when I was in treatment. I needed all the hope I could get.
Not recovery related but Habitat for Humanity is always open to volunteers. Always something for all skill levels to do. Benefits for all. Peace
