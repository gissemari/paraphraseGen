Hey everyone today marks a month since my last drink. ..When I stopped drinking a month ago a part of me never thought I'd make it this far but here we are and it feels amazing. ..So I'm off into town to my favourite coffee shop with my family to celebrate. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day. And if anyone is struggling feel free to drop me a message. This sub has been one of the main reasons I've made it this far and it's been from the support and kindness you've all shown me in my journey so thank you all so much!
