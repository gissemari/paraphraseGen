Disclaimer:.Master of Architecture not English so sorry for the shitty grammar.	..	I've know I am an alcoholic for nearly all of my adult life. I am 27 now and have seen the habit grow steadily for the past 8 or so years increasing in quantity and emotional damage done to myself and those around me. Withdraws have been a weekly occurrence in my life for years I know the darkness. (for those unsure of the extent of my abuse) I gave up drinking in November and after a couple of false starts was able to stay sober for 49 days - I felt incredible. After a relapse/bender in early January I got back on the wagon and made it another 30 days again I felt the best I have in recent memory. On Valentines weekend I drank non stop for 4 days missing the phone calls and Skype date I had planned with my long distance soon to be fianc  of 3.5 years. We fell in love at College moved to a new city together and lived together for a year before I left for Graduate School and she moved to NewAppleManhattanVille. Long distance relationships are hard and this was an important day for us. Of all the people in my life that love me she has been hurt the most by my drinking. On the Sunday following Valentines day we talked on the phone and confirmed my worst fear. She can no longer handle my drinking and can't imagine a future for us; sadly neither can I. This would have been my 1000th chance to change my drinking habits and well  1000 is a lot of chances. Loosing her is the hardest thing I've ever experienced especially knowing that all I had to do was not drink. There are no apologies. It is mutually understood that I sabotaged our relationship and now both of us are loosing the love of our lives because of it. When I look at my life I see a series of shortcomings broken promises and unattained goals strung together in a mirage of achievement. Objectively I probably seem like a fine if not great human. In the spring I'll be receiving a Masters Degree from a top 5 University I have career ambition and am in relatively good physical shape. But behind this veneer apparent to everyone who has ever met me is a raging self centered alcoholic. I feel like I am destined for failure and disappointment. I feel like years of alcohol abuse have irreparably damaged my work ethic and moral grounding. I am afraid that I have squandered my developmental years drunk or hung over and now I can no longer function as a  normal  person. I haven't had a drink in 48 hours and I don't plan on drinking again  ever but I've been here before and I know it's only a matter of time before I'm staring at the bottom of a bottle of fireball (or god forbid Kamchatka) I am scared and I feel alone. I'm sorry for the pity party my problems probably pale in comparison to many of yours but I really needed this out there. Words of reassurance are appreciated advice more so. Grammar edits will be spitefully made if this is deemed unreadable by the Reditati. Thanks for reading.

I had a time machine in a bottle the problem was it only worked for losing time and moving forward it would never allow me to go backwards. The upside for you is that you are 27 you have a chance to get off the crazy train earlier than I did. I was where you are at 27 and knew it but stubbornly refused to quit...You have made a couple of serious attempts at sobriety and had some success.Try it again but keep in mind you have to want it for you not for your fiance.That relationship may or may not be repairable but fixing yourself for yourself is the best thing you can do - for you. Take care of yourself.
