This week has been a struggle. A lot of emotions  good and bad. And any emotion for the last few years has been a reason to drink! The sun is out and I just found out good news at work but I'm annoyed I can't drink. Earlier I was having a rough day with my husband and can't drink to relax. It's just up and down and I have to fully sit in each emotion... and honestly it's annoying. But IWNDWYT. And I'm sure the sun is nice even without a drink :)

Deep breaths. It will all be ok. Maybe you can enjoy a nice mocktail!
Hear you there! Emotions are a big trigger for me too. But unfortunately drinking simply delays them or amplifies them! Easier to intellectualize than anything but learning to sit with them is key. Let me know your secrets when you figure it out! Haha. We can do this. IWNDWYT!
