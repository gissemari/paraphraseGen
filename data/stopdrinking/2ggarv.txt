I'm working my way back slowly to my personal best (about 10 months). I have had two bad days that were a struggle this time but made it throught them fine. I'm back into my gym routine 5/7 days per week and I got my girl to start going with me; I don't even think about drinking during that time or much after the workouts. I proposed to my girlfriend of four years and she said yes. I have some amazing friends and family. I went nearly a whole week without the smallest urge to drink...This is more thinking out loud for me. I just wanted to post it because you guys have been an integral part of this for me thank you all. Anyone that might not be having such a good time with their own feel free to PM me and I'll be sure to send some positive thoughts and motivation your way like a number of you have done for me along the way...One day at a time stay strong.

Nice update /u/Chronzer!  Keep doing what you're doing pal!
Woo nice work! Congrats on the engagement! I don't know about you but getting back into the working out routine has helped me a lot. Having something to focus on every day is tremendous.
