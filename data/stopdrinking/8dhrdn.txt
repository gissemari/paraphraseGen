"Recovery-The Sacred Art: The Twelve Steps as Spiritual Practice." ..Don't let the fact that it was written by a Rabbi and the word "spiritual" is in the title scare you. As an atheist/agnostic this book is hands down the best book on recovery I have ever read. It walks you through each step one at a time using parables from multiple religions as well as using experiences from the author's life. ..I would say the major themes are accepting how little control we have in our lives and being right-sized. This is the only book in my library drenched in yellow highlighter. ..I will not drink with you today.
