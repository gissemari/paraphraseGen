I am now one month into not drinking! ..Here's my thing I was a moderate drinker. 2-4 drinks an evening on average some less and others more when I went out or there was a work event. This is the most days I've gone without alcohol since I could legally buy it. Some people thought I drank a lot some people thought I didn't. Some people have been giving the impression that I'm overreacting by cutting out alcohol. ..But here's the thing I don't care. Sure I don't think cutting out alcohol is an end all to my problems but it seems to be the starting point. Alcohol has been so much apart of my identity for so long and I don't want it to be. ..So to all you moderate yet frequent drinkers out there maybe my observations from one month sober will mean something: ..**Pros**..* Mo' money. I've saved about 300 dollars so far. Where was I finding the money? .*  Mo' time. Seriously I really noticed this in the first week. I've got an extra few hours of useful brain activity every evening..* Not a mess at nights means better mornings. I'm way better at making sure my phone is charged I have clean clothes I've got everything I need for the next day because I'm not "I can't even" before falling asleep..* I had these "mystery headaches" that disappeared. Yep I think those were hangovers..* I'm able to control my emotions better and think outside of this moment. .* Non-alcoholic ginger beer is delicious. .* Counting calories is less painful when you're not lying to My Fitness Pal about how many craft beers you had. ..**Cons**..* I feel like my social life has taken a hit. I'm struggling to reach out to people to hang out without saying "hey want to grab a drink". .* Sometimes I'm kind of bored. Saturdays with a pizza a bottle of wine and playing Left 4 Dead 2 for hours was kind of my thing. ..One list is shorter than the other. ;)..Thanks to all the people on this sub who are there when I need them. This really is an awesome community!..edit: formatting.

Good post.  Thanks for sharing.
Great job and love your pros list!
Lol at the lying about calories in MFP! I can totally relate with that. Great post and congrats on your insights
&gt; One list is shorter than the other. ;)..Right on. ..Thank you for sharing this. :)
I used to get those mystery headaches too. (and throbbing hangover ones too). Had a headache Saturday but I knew for sure it wasn't from drinking. Enjoyed reading your post. I found it gets better and easier. 
Ginger beer is delicious! I drank the same amount as you and all my mystery "ailments" went away too. Great job!
This is the first post i've seen since I started lurking here that reflects who I was was. Not sure why I'm doing this but it feels right. Seeing posts like yours helps me want to keep it up.
Great job. One tip for the social life hit: for me it helps having some other go-to. I have one friend who I always asks if she wants to go for coffee. We're usually not out as long as before but it's nice to just chat...I have another set of friends who I ask for board-gaming. It's super-fun (according to me). We get to do something for the whole night although it's not usually as often as drinking was.
Moderate yet frequent drinker here -- this is very helpful! I'm just getting started myself. Congrats on one month!
My go-to hangout suggestion is hiking except I don't call it that. I say hey wanna go walk a few loops around the park and catch up? It's exercise but it can be completely tailored to fit whom you're asking to join you. 
Thank you for sharing this! I really relate to your post. My drinking was very similar to yours with an occasional blackout night thrown in. However in my college days I really overdid it. So even though I was able to moderate in my mid-late twenties to an extent I always feel like there is that crazy binge drinker in me. I know the problem drinker exists inside me somewhere. And it's better to just not drink at all. Congrats on your month! 
I use MFP but I didn't lie about my drinks - I just didn't eat real food if I was drinking. I hate the idea of going back and looking at some of those entries. ..You know there's always "hey want to grab a coffee?" :-)
Good stuff. You don't have to have a "problem" with alcohol to want it out of your life. The are so many benefits of quitting drinking that it's downright silly when people try to argue the merits of continuing allow of alcohol abuse. 
&gt; Alcohol has been so much apart of my identity for so long and I don't want it to be...This is me right now.  Well said.
Yep that was me.  I told someone I drank up to 4 drinks a night and she said "if I only drank 4 drinks a night I wouldn't have stopped".  HOWEVER I'm a woman and this is way higher than the recommended amount I felt like I was using alcohol to escape my life and with a history of breast cancer in my family there is just no reason for me to keep drinking.  My life is definitely better now and the unhealthy obsession is gone.  Great observations!  Keep it up!  It's all about whether YOU feel you have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol regardless of what society or others say.
&gt;One list is shorter than the other. ;)..Yep. Good noticing. Sober on!.
Alcohol makes everything in your life worth doing become "I can't even."  Be a good parent? Exercise? Give a shit? I can't even.  Great thought.  I'll join you today in not drinking. 
I read a post on here the other about someone who relapsed and they ended up slamming some drinks in a bar with a bunch of friends. Upon wakening the next morning they soon came to the total realisation that they could have had a BETTER night if they had have just stuck to soft drinks. What's going to change really? The conversation got sloppy after an hour the credit card took a hit the gut too a load of pizza at 3am and the head was a mess the next day. ..It really resonated with me because I struggle too to socialise without alcohol but in reality it puts you in a better position if anything. ..Thanks for sharing your list I take a lot from stuff like this! Great work on the 34 days too bet you're feeling much better physically and mentally?
I feel like you wrote this for me. Thanks!
Still haven't worked up the nerve to make my first post here but when I do it will read a lot like this one. Thank you for sharing...(3-4 a night on average now on third day dry second attempt this month.)
