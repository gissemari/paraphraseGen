Today marks my 100th day of being free from alcohol. I want to give a big thank you to everyone here. You guys have been my key support this entire time. Although I don't check in on the regular anymore or chime in to discussions I still step in daily to read the trials and tribulations of others who share the same struggles...Thank you so much for being there for me when I needed it. There are always darker days before brighter ones...Much love. Keep up the fight!..Edit: Whoa. Reddit gold... you guys are awesome! Thank you so much!
