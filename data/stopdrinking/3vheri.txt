This will be the 3rd weekend in a row I have spent sober. In the last 10 or so years ii cannot remember going more than one week without a drink. ..My body is sure that I will be drinking this weekend. I can feel that pull inside me that I felt every time I've relapsed before. It's an uneasy feeling. ..So far I am keeping myself busy and have almost the whole weekend planned out with healthy sober activities. Other than knowing and sticking to the plans the idea will be to stay in the moment as much as I can. I will not drink for this minute this hour this night. I got this. Well I'm pretty sure I do.
