I know I let myself down but my relapse is Saturday was pretty non eventful.  .Why the immense guilt 
----------immediate responses--------

When this happened to me it was because I had goals and plans and a relapse even if it was just two beers and uneventful was the opposite of those intended plans.  I set a bar for myself and then failed to reach it which brings guilt with it because I knew it was possible to achieve...Like if I run a race as fast as I can and lose no shame no guilt.  But if I run fast for half of it and then jog the rest and get beat then I know I could have done better.
The guilt shows that you care about not drinking. Use it as a teacher. ..Really try to internalize that feeling of guilt now so that the next time a strong compulsion comes on you can take a few deep breaths and really feel that guilt and KNOW what you need to do.
Super sucks!  I hear you!  Me too overdid it on Saturday.  For no reason fun sunny day no terrible consequences.  Except that I feel like a pos and a loser.   Which sucks!!!  Anyhow you're not alone and I look forward to both of us feeling great in our bodies and about our choices very soon.
