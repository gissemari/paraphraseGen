I haven't posted my journal in like two weeks I know I need to keep a routine and stay on schedule so I am jumping back into. I find that it really does help me I have it to look over at the end of the day or in times of need. Lawwwrd knows I can't keep track of anything regardless of being sober so I need to keep a copy of it here ([days 17-32](http://imgur.com/a/Epnah))...* If it ain't flexible it aint AA.* Humble vs. Self-abusive - find your jive.* Isolation is my kyrptonite .* "Functioning alcoholism isn't a type its a stage. We're all functioning alcoholics until we can no longer function".* Stop living in **FEAR** - Word vomit makes you feel better..* Take the g'dmn suggestions and implement them..* Hit the reset button on your day - go to a meeting.* **YOU ARE NOT ALONE**.* "you would call IT for a tech problem why not call an attendee for change of thought process".* "jeffery Domer sold plasma to drink I did too" fkkkk.* [Past is a point of reference not a place of residence](http://imgur.com/a/uNOrC).* Changing my environment hurts but change saved my life..* respond vs. react.* Irrational fear - "roaring river miles wide but only an inch deep.".* "Booze and Dairy Queen won't solve anything: RATIONAL THINKING STAY CALM TAKE ACTION MEDITATE.* steps 4-5 are "unburying the bodies we didn't bury properly 8-9 are final proper resting place".* BEWARE: relapse is emotional thought process & then physical.* SLOGANS: corny as shit but hold water.* "Play the tape forward" vs "play the tape back" *stop burning the gdmn tape* so you can PUSH PLAY ON YOUR LIFE.* Don't procrastinate & Be bold.* **DON'T FEED THE BEAST**..When I think of my first month my mind goes straight to the negative: IT WAS HELL. I felt like shit I couldn't eat then I ate everything all day & night emotional rollercoaster from fkn hell - which I apparently went for a second round in week 3/4 not being able to sleep only sleeping no energy moody soooooooo mmmannnnyyy eemmmoottiiionnnnsss blah...What I need to do is remember all that ^ ^ ^ as a reference **BUT**...I need to [think these:](http://imgur.com/a/YPR02) I got a job spent time with my niece & nephew (& can remember it) did relay for life supporting my family members was able to see the beauty in my city was able to not feel like I was going to explode around a crowd lots of service things nice for myself (fuzzy PJs and tea) take care of my health (working out/meal prep) stay active (across with board with SD/AA) house sit for a friend who lost a family member play "tag" with my sister feed some baby ducks get out and be active (5k and canoe) LEARN GRATITUDE (for many things like knees & eggs lol but seriously I have a lot to be grateful for)...[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)..PS. Red remember your knees compare them to your sobriety. Yes you use to an excellent runner but you tried to take on a 5k less than a month sober and with like years since you last ran now you're injured. So sobriety - Yes you have had some time before but you haven't in a while. Take your time don't rush it. Nurture it go at a natural pace build it up. The future will still be there. It is okay to walk slowly just stop walking backwards. You've done it [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/5dtv7p/my_journey_beforeafter_pic/) you can do it again. You want more than just keeping [her](http://imgur.com/a/sF5Yw) alive you want her to thrive.

Hey Red! I was hoping you had posted tonight. Wanted to see how you were and how things were going. Glad it's going pretty good. LOVED this post. Pretty cool to read. Anyway wanted to say hi. Oh and I need to get back to my journaling too. I've been slacking BAD. Let's get back to our routine. ..See ya tomorrow!  .
Hello me too was wondering when you would post. So happy for your month and your post is amazing. You need to think about writing a book either self help or a humorous one as you have a way with words and people can relate. Seriously it's that good. Decided I'd take the dog I a big hike today sick of taking about it so going to do it.  
F.E.A.R.= Fuck Everything And RUN!..H.O.P.E. = Holding Onto Positive Energy
Hike did not really materialise. Still out walking with her though. I'm on half term next week I teach so def want to get out and about hopefully the beach. Seriously though I live your posts and they are very inspirational. I had my tatoo went for the be string and two flowers since I'm two weeks away from 2 months. Next flower 6 weeks. I can't post pics think j have to download that pic app.
