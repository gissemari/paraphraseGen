I got back together with my ex last month. I hadn't spoken to them in a very very long time. The relationship was good at first but over the years it became unbearable. So much so that even though it pained me I had to leave. For a long time after we broke up I struggled to find myself again and all I wanted was the comfort of my ex. But slowly I moved forward. Life became enjoyable. I really and truly was living my best life. Last month I saw my ex again. Everyone was enjoying their company and I couldn't stop noticing it. I knew better. I knew that if I gave into my ex's company that I would travel backwards. But I gave in. It wasn't so bad. We got back together and it was as if we never broke up. But here it is a month later and in just 30 days it went from great to explosive. I know this can't work out. There's no denying it. I have to face another break up. It's so hard to say goodbye again. Maybe even harder than the first time. I know in my mind what needs to be done I just don't know if I'm strong enough to face the pain of goodbye...This is how I feel about you Alcohol. I should have never given into you last month thinking things could be different that I was strong enough to say  'yes just a little'. I have to face you again Friday when my friends come visit. I'm scared I won't be able to say no.

Thanks..After so long what happened?
I have always viewed alcohol as a fake best friend who will pretend to have fun with me but as soon as I'm down will screw me over and ruin my life.
