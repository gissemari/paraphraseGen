Not sleeping well has been the story of my life since I was a little kid. I started listening to the Sleep With Me podcast last night and it was pretty awesome. It's just a guy telling a really boring story but for some reason it works wonders. I slept thru the night for the first time since I can't remember when.

i'm totally trying this tonight!  since i quit drinking i've been sleeping less and i'd love to sleep through an entire night.  thanks!
What??!!  Thanks.  Jeez my sleep life has always been hard.
Cool thanks for the tip! I'm always looking for something to help lull myself into sleep. 
I've always had trouble sleeping and what worked best for me when I was younger was to have a movie or CD/tape playing so quietly that I couldn't think about anything or else I couldn't hear it. My issue has always been getting my brain to shut up and this used to help a ton. I had to train myself off it once I hit college though and now only rarely use it. But there's another tip for people to try if they want some options!
Il check this out thanks :)
Wow thanks for sharing about the podcast! I got sober 3 years and 10 months ago so it means a lot knowing it can help anyone out there.
Thank you for recommending this u/majorbedhead. I used it last night and it works like a charm...And to the man himself - u/dearestscooter - thank you for creating this and for posting about your sobriety! I feel like SD has been visited by a celebrity.   ..
