It's a good feeling to wake up this morning and mark one week of sobriety. That would be the first time in more than 10 years. I did quit drinking for 30 days 11 years ago but that was so different. The entire time was agony and in truth it was only a countdown until I kept that promise and could get smashed again. So I kept the promise -- 30 days -- and then got smashed again. And again. And again. Another decade of agains..This time was different. I work a goofy schedule a white-collar type job but a graveyard shift. And I'm 1700 miles from home from Denver the past two years. Booze was always a big part of my life but here I'm all alone and it had become my only companion. Sometimes three or four beers before work (I start at 11 p.m.) Always more than a case on the weekend. .My bottom arrived last Sunday actually Monday 4 a.m. Blottoed on the porch couch. Dropping and breaking the Rolling Rock I had just fetched from the fridge watching it spill across the porch floor..And I had to ask myself even as drunk as I was: WTF are you getting out of this? What feels good about this? What doesn't feel out of control shameful isolating desperately lonely? What doesn't feel like you're stealing from yourself? Your hopes your talent your self esteem your dreams?.I had been thinking talking in my head for a while about quitting but when Saturday rolled around it was match over beer wins!.In a lot of ways it was this sub that got me over the hump finally gave me the flicker of hope that my life didn't have to be like this. I'd been a lurker for a while. There's something very valuable in knowing you're not alone that lots of other folks of all ages stripes and types are fighting the same thing and that at the end of the day we all have the same wish: I want my life back..My first badge lasted two days. But I kept up that conversation in my head. I kept reading your stories. I kept listening to the encouragement you offered..I went into that bout last week with that question in mind. I gave myself permission to do my usual sleep till 7 p.m. and then take that 12 out on the porch and start drinking text your ex make her upset go back in the house for more when the first 12 is gone keep drinking be angry at the world for your situation keep drinking till you stumble upstairs to sleep or maybe just tip over on that couch. But this time there was one condition one thing I promised myself I would do: Keep asking yourself over those 10 or so hours of drinking how do I feel? what's good about this? what am I getting out of this that's positive?.Even drunk I did manage to keep those questions surfacing every now and then. And a few times I peeked at this reddit saw that other people were fighting other people were struggling too. And that other people were taking steps making gains. Seemingly small to someone who doesn't know I suppose. One day two days three days. But big steps big changes to those of us in the same spot from where those folks began..I guess that was the biggest thing for me to truly appreciate that I'm not alone that there is a community of people willing to fight the same battle I am. That there are a lot of people who share the fight who have tremendous perspective compassion wisdom and encouragement. For me that made a difference a very large difference. I was NOT just some anonymous old drunk doing his Saturday and Sunday drill. I was a part of a group that chose to fight back that wanted all those good things in a life back all those things that slowly get traded away for booze..I feel good. I'm a practical guy not a pink cloud type. And I have some zen training experience which is so useful -- just today just this moment. This is when you are alive only now. So in one way I'm a bit conflicted about marking one week. But in another I'm proud of it damnit!.So I don't have to worry about not drinking tomorrow or not drinking on Saturday or not drinking next year. I can focus on not drinking right now not drinking today. That's manageable..I know I made the right choice. I know it will be a daily journey. I know I will keep looking here for wisdom support encouragement advice. And I know I will do my best to encourage and my best to counsel in situations where my experience and what I've learned might be valuable..I am very grateful I found this community it made the difference for me and I am proud to count myself a member....
