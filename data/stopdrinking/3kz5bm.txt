Today around this time marks two weeks since I had my most recent drink. It also marks two weeks since the last time my SO and I had "The Talk..."..I'm certain that most people here have experienced this. A loved one expresses their concern for you wondering how on earth they can help you they really genuinely want to help you but in our drunken state we lash out. Likely saying things we would never dream of saying while sober. We know its hurts them that's why we say it we are so worked up into defensive mode that we lash out at people who are only trying to help us. We are so inescapably afraid of admitting that we have a problem that we have a weakness that we will try anything to weasel our way out of the conversation...The morning comes around and regret fills you as you remember some details of the previous night. I don't need to tell you all this you've been there I'm sure...The last time I had this conversation something was different. I had struggled with sobriety for so long that I finally broke down. I let the walls I had built around myself fall down. Something changed. I finally understood that someone felt true compassion for me...My girlfriend did not want me to get sober for her although it would maybe make her life easier she truly and deeply wanted me to get sober for me. I finally figured that out. I finally had someone I could share my struggles with. I was no longer afraid to admit I had cravings or that I needed help sometimes. It was beautiful and these last two weeks have been beautiful. The changes I have made have already started making me a happier and healthier person...I may be new to sobriety but if you care to hear my advice I really recommend you seek out a loved one who you can trust and ask them for help. Tell them the situation. It gets said a lot on here but I really don't think we can do this alone. I get really bad anxiety so meetings aren't for me but I still realize that I need someone...Anyway I've started ranting a bit. On day 3 of my sober quest I shared a poem. Some people liked it so I want to end my post today with another I wrote. I hope you enjoy it....Edit: formatting is hard..............>Please don't live intermittently..>Span the difference between who you are ..>And who you want to be....>Exaggerate the excellent qualities of existence..>Diminish the dim dark dreadfulness of past doings....>Focus on now...>What do you want?..>Are you happy?..>Focusing on whats in your way is a trap see?...>If you let the walls keep you locked in..>You will never have a view ..>Except from within....>Break free live with no regret...>Rather an objective to grow....>Learn everyday to look outside...>We can all make it..>The world you want is out there..>Take it.

Congrats on two weeks - that's fantastic!..Having someone in your corner that is there because they honestly want you to be sober for yourself is huge. I have that as well. We're both very lucky. 
&gt;The changes I have made have already started making me a happier and healthier person...Little changes add up to huge differences.  Congrats on 2 weeks!
