I've been struggling with alcohol abuse and blacking out for years lost many friend due to excessive drinking and saying things I don't remember lost a relationship to a girl I love and am about to lose a job due to chronic showing up late and calling out...I went 54 days and felt amazing and hopeful to only go on a bender and call out again making me full of anxiety and feeling like I've been getting weird stares at work...I'm trying to stay hopeful so here's to day 5.

Sober On!
Staying sober is much easier with a support system. At least that has been my experience. A therapist to talk with in confidence treatment and involvement in AA gave me the help I needed to maintain sobriety. I wish the same for you.
Now's the time to start digging upwards instead of down
Stopping my digging saved my life. I know that we can do this. IWNDWYT.
