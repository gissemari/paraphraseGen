Tonight I came home from work and had alcohol on the brain. I've struggled to moderate for some time. My day count is so wrong. On Friday I got drunk and went out to a bar. It was a success because I remember coming back and didn't lose anything. Big success huh?..Oh I slept all day Saturday though. ..Well tonight I looked for tea shops around my new condo and found one that serves mojitos. I googled like crazy to see if they contained alcohol. They don't. I decided to go to whole foods to get ingredients for one. Whole foods is healthy! ..I bought hard cider instead. My beer strategy worked Friday. I opened one at home and poured. Then I thought what am I doing?..Last time I drank on a work night I missed work...The wave was brutal but it passed. I don't know what came over me. I think I've got pretty bad depression. I'm on meds have seen a therapist. Drinking brings mild temporary excitement to my life. Otherwise it's hard to care about anything. Fear of losing my big job keeps me in line...Poured it out. Not today. Anything but that.

Woah that's hard to  do once it's been bought. Well done
Never give up hope. Keep trying and eventually you'll find the way
I've been at that last point before and never been able to pour it away. Real good work my friend that's very strong-willed.
