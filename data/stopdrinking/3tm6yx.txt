Normally I'd have a cold one cracked as soon as I got inside from walking the dogs.  Tonight I'm meeting a friend to see a movie shortly after I walk my dogs.  I've confided in her that I've struggled with alcohol for years and am making a concerted effort at not drinking through 12/31/2015.  She's super supportive and I really appreciate her telling me "you can do it"...Here's to a sober Friday night friends!..
