I'm sure to some the title makes little sense but many of us have had those thoughts.  "Just a couple days of beers in the sun then I'll be right back to it."..Cut to tonight.  The withdrawals are debilitating.  Anxiety has taken over my life.  If I don't get fired tomorrow I'd be amazed except for the fact that my company laid off everyone else in our department leaving me as the one to do 4 people's jobs...And now every single day is a cycle of "just a couple to stave off the shakes" to "still not feeling quite right one more" to "another half pint of vodka is the only thing that will let me sleep"...I'm scared.  I reached out to friends with strong hints that I need someone to help me through these first couple of days but I dont think they understand how scared and desperate I am. ..Alcoholism sucks. The fear the sickness the hopelessness.  Fuck.

You are not alone. The community is here to support you. Fear is normal let it go through you and make you stronger.
Glad you're back!..If the withdrawals are bad can you see a doctor? ..It doesn't sound like trying to drink them away is working.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I agree with what woody said.  he always gives good advice.  I understand the fear the sickness the hopelessness that you mentioned.  I also thought I could drink again and got caught up exactly as you described.  Alcohol really wasn't working well but the withdrawals were indeed debilitating   The anxiety.  I needed to keep drinking to stave off the shakes.  I didn't see anyway out and I was ashamed and scared to tell anyone.  Out of desperation I told my doctor.  He gave me a few valium (Librium would have worked also) and I was able to break the cycle at home.  I think you have taken a positive step posting here.  I suggest that you tell your doctor and you might find the help you need.   
You're doing great.. we're not going anywhere!

# Stop now.  Do whatever you have to...**including seeing a doctor maybe even signing yourself in to a detox facility.**  ..yes I'm shouting. you may be past 'I can do this on my own' and the slope will only get steeper.  ..The good news is that you never have to do this again that a much better life awaits. And your job may be protected to an extent by the disabilities act... (I am not a lawyer so don't trust this. - and your job is not your biggest problem right now)
I understand as I sit here with head full of cotton ears ringing neck aching stomach turning and reeling at what I do remember.  I'm not sure if I'll ever make it out of this hell alive.  I won't drink today though and you are not alone.
No advice but sympathy. I'm in the same situation.
