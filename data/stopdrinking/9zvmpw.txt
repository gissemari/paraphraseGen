After the third relapse in 7 months I'm learning:..It's more about becoming a whole and good person than it is about alcohol..I'm still a self centered asshole but hopefully not as bad...Still not thinking clearly or able to concentrate but it's getting better...My sponsor wants me to go deeper into steps 4/5 and not leave anything out...God as I understand him has less to do with The Church and more to do with a relationship as I understand it...Anyone else notice these things?

It is definitely about becoming a whole person I have grown up a lot in this past few weeks - at the grand age of 46! Well done on 33 days that is great
