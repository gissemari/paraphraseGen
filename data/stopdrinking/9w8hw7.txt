I'm at two weeks since my last relapse. Having the hardest time. Trying to stay strong and motivated. Weekends are the worst for me. All my slip ups happen on weekends

You can do this. We're all so proud of how far you've made it! IWNDWYT.
I feel you on the weekend thing.. I threw away 36 days yesterday and man am I beating myself now. But we're gonna make it.
Stay strong!  One day at a time was the ticket to freedom for me.  Getting through the tough days got me to easier days.  Sending positive thoughts your way! IWNDWYT 
I was about to cave in an hour ago. Then I ate a big meal followed by too much ice cream. There is no way I can drink now I don't want to but it was close. Is there a diner nearby where you can grab some food? Food is my go to craving killer.
This used to be me. Every two weeks for months. I wish I could say something profound but I just knuckled through worked like crazy on my issues leaned heavily on SD and broke the cycle. There's a rhytm in our bodies and brains and after pushing through that rhytm skipped a beat began to change and things got better. Craving lost its territory. Hang in there you can do it! I will not drink with you today! 
Thanks for all the support and suggestions : ) 
How's it going? We are here. 
I made it through : ) honestly can't believe I did it. But I'm feeling great and accomplished.
