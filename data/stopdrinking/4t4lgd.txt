After 20 days of sobriety (a record for me!) I made the conscious decision to drink last night.  My husband is out of town and my daughter was at a friends house so I knew no one was watching.  I went to a restaurant for dinner specifically  because I knew I was going to drink there.  Had 3 drinks and bought a bottle of wine on the way home (low alcohol % in the wine).  I finished that while watching TV.  I didn't get crazy or sad or upset or out of control.  But I wasn't having fun either.  I went to bed and woke up this morning with a headache I had weird chemical smelling poop and feeling like my body is full of poison.  I just want it all out of me -  Ive been drinking water all morning trying to flush it out.   This is the first time that I have ever really thought of alcohol as "poison" and I feel repulsed by it.  I feel like I have turned a corner... I absolutely do NOT want this poison in my body again.  I'm struggling with whether or not to change my badge back to day 1.  Thoughts on that?

Thoughts on that - if it were me I would reset my badge which (again for me) represents consecutive days of not drinking. I appreciate you sharing your experience. Poison indeed!
If I drank again I would go get my requisite day 1 chip at my home group. Whether you change your badge or not to day 1 is up to you. Why reasons are there not to? 
I would definitely reset my badge. That the whole reason it exists. Blip or not I would need to mentally reset. 
I think most here would reset the badge if they made the choice to have several drinks and a bottle of wine but that is your decision. The badge means what you want it to. ..The important thing is that you feel you had an epiphany and are ready to get serious about staying sober. That is awesome! Welcome back! Have a good weekend and please keep posting.
I am so dang glad to hear this... ok as strange as that may sound. But I feel I'm seeing a soul change and yeah that's sooooo good to see. ..For me **the** critical element in my recovery is honesty. That is the only "weapon" I have against this insidious disease's denial that I can control. No I have not been nor expect to be perfect (thank you!) but that...? Honesty is my mirror and I **HAVE** to be able to look myself in the eye... every day.
When is it not a "conscious decision" to drink? An unconscious one exists? Like sleep walking?
I would reset my badge. However it's awesome that you're honest about it and that you don't want the poison back in your body :)
It sounds like you had 8 drinks over the course of a night three of which came at the restaurant before driving home. I used the free app Alchodroid to estimate what that would do to my BAC over the course of a night. I'm a 175lb man...After leaving the restaurant my BAC would have been close to .07. Close to the limit. By the end of the night I'd have gone to bed with a .112 BAC well over the legal limit...I changed my stats in the app to a 140lb female and there was a significant change. I would have been at .084 after leaving the restaurant (over the legal limit in the US of .08) and would have gone to bed with a .186 BAC...BAC isn't the be all end all (unless you're a State Trooper) but there you go...Edit: I used 5% for drinks and assumed each drink was a standard glass of wine.
thanks for all the input - badge reset
Thank you for sharing this.  I am not drinking today.  But I can see myself making these same reasonings and having the exact same results.
I may be going to Ireland for Christmas and there's going to be massive amounts of binge drinking around me for 2+ weeks. I found myself asking whether or not I would reset if I decide to partake in the festivities (already mistake number 1 planning to get drunk) and I thought to myself I wouldn't reset because "it's Ireland!". After more deliberation I thought about the many consequences of drinking with my SO and his friends/family. The fights the falls the hangovers the probability I would come home and want to continue drinking. Like everyone else has already said the badge means what you want it to mean but for me if I got drunk I would need to reset in order to not keep justifying drinking more.
I used to lie to my calorie counting app (by not recording desserts on "splurge days" or alcohol just cause) and then I was mystified because the app showed so many consecutive days of staying under my calorie goal yet I wasn't losing weight. With that previous example of basically not being honest with myself about my own effort or commitment to losing weight I plan to reset my badge here if I have a drink. Otherwise I'm afraid that two years from now I will be thinking Why am I still getting drunk when I have 730 days sober?
I'm reading The Naked Mind and I have realized that my subconscious began to shift when I realized like you did that alcohol is a poison that literally does nothing for me. [Making this list helped](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4q61f9/alcohol_is_a_poison/d4qhipc) as did realizing that the only thing I got from drinking was an initial feeling of euphoria that was feeling more and more like anxiety/paranoia. I came to this conclusion after several years of quitting/relapsing/quitting/relapsing. The Naked Mind has shown me that now that I've had this insight my conscious/subconscious mind aren't at war like they used to be. In the last three weeks I haven't had the cravings that I've normally had in the past and am hopeful for the future. Good luck to you!
