Driving to work this morning I glanced at myself in the rear view mirror (appropriate metaphor lol) and I noticed that my EYES WERE NOT BLOODSHOT! And my eyeliner was perfectly straight and not smudged everywhere. Seriously people you do not understand the struggle of applying liquid eyeliner after several shots of vodka in the mornings hahahahaha. Ok not funny. But it gave me a little boost. I like not drinking.

Yesss! My eyeliner has been (mostly) on point the last couple of days. I'm still learning haha. It feels good to not have to put Visine in my eyes in the mornings. You got this girl!
Liquid eye liner is more than I can handle even stone cold sober. Congrats on your victory! There are no small NDVs!
Wooo Hoo! 
I love doing my makeup sober! When I was drink my skin was dry and eyes were always puffy..now I get compliments :0) well done and I will not drink with you today!
Afraid I can't relate very much to the eyeliner issue. But I can relate to how great it feels not drinking! Congrats on your victory!
Hah!! Nice one it's always the little things that matter
Yeah you go girl.  
Hey hey happy Saturday Lady-set-free.  I like not drinking too...I'm really loving this group: probably more in common with people and less expensive too!
