I'm 21 and when I say I don't drink people usually assume I'm on a diet or that I'm doing a cleanse not that I struggle with addiction. I'm more than fine with this but it also means people want me to drink with them and don't understand what they're offering me. Tonight I was offered a shot and a free drink I took neither. I'm the third member of my immediate family to go sober and I want to make them as proud as they make me.

Hooray! Nice job. :) Shots are silly anyway. ..iwndwyt
21 here too and struggling with you....I'm at 59 days sober and have almost fallen back to it through temptations like this..It's not easy to say no but you are powerful in the sense that you control your addiction and not the other way around!..I'm proud of you and you should be damned proud of yourself too!
Great job :)
