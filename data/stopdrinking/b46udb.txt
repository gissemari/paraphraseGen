Welp I made it. 365 days. Last time I was here in relation to the Sun I was in a very bad spot. Rock bottom if I may...&amp;#x200B;..I'm 35 y/o male. On that day I was handed a document to sign at work and I was unable to do it because my hands were shaking so bad. I had a small panic attack in front of coworkers and students they were all asking if I was ok as I was sweating some buckets. I had to excuse myself and tell fortright that I was going to sign the document later...&amp;#x200B;..That did it for me. I finally had my last straw...&amp;#x200B;..After that I came home from work and threw my half bottle of vodka down the drain and started one miserable first week of recovery. My sleep cycle was hell. I felt like a zombie on the first few days (they are the worst)...&amp;#x200B;..That day though I stopped digging. ..&amp;#x200B;..Today it's easy for me to say that it was very hard (even a bit irresponsible of me quitting cold turkey without any medical support after 15 years of hard abuse of alcohol) but it was completely worth it...&amp;#x200B;..I still think about alcohol and my struggle with it constantly. I see this as a sign that I am still an alcoholic. It reminds me and keeps me from relapsing. I hope I can keep it this way...&amp;#x200B;..And lastly I couldn't do it without the support of this amazing sub! On the last months I became more of a ghost/lurker but SD's support was necessary for me to get where I am today...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT

congrats on getting up from bed 365 days sober and not drinking that day.
Holy crap is right! Congratulations. Your story spoke to me profoundly. I am so embarrassed at how my writing is so shakey at work. Yesterday I was shaking and knew I had to do a presentation at work so i called out. .How did you decide 365 times not to take that first drink?
Fantastic! Congratulations!!!
That's amazing! Congrats on your one year of sobriety here's to many more!
I can totally relate. Sitting in meetings hungover I was convinced they had to see me about to have a seizure (I never have but it felt like it) or trying to hold my soda water can steady or looking someone in the eyes and being unable to hold contact because my eyes would freak out. Not to mention how sick I must have looked...Congrats on 365! Hoping to celebrate 366 367 and so on with you!..I will not drink with you today!
Congratulations on your Sober Solar Circumnavigation!
Congrats!!!
Holy crap! That's what I feel like I've been through this past year  .....There's something to be said for staying sober a full year whilst still struggling with cravings. Well done...IWNDWYT    
Well done.  I'm sorry that you're still struggling constantly.  You should be long past cravings so I'm wondering if you're seeking some counseling or attending meetings? You've overcome the biggest hurdle and made it a whole year without drinking.  It pains me to know that it's still hard.  IWNDWYT
That's great news! If i get a bad craving I sometimes drink non alcoholic beer. It's helped me stop the bad ones. The Alan Carr Easyway book is also a good way to escape 'the prison' as he calls it! Anyway one year is great! 
Congratulations. I love that way of describing it. I'm looking forward to saying the same thing :)
Happy 1 year to you! What a great achievement.
