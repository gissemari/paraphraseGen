I recently completed 30 sober days in June and felt great... normal  even. I didn't intend to keep a sober July just moderate. And I did until I didn't. ...I'm so ashamed that each relapse gets worse more embarrassing and oftentimes more dangerous. ...I still wish I didn't have an alcoholic brain but I'm working to accept that....Today though I feel good and so optimistic about staying sober. Last night I got to DD dinner for my husband's birthday. And today I enjoyed a brewery tour and felt so proud to make it through without taking a sip - and being able to drive home.  After being a mess for so long it's so nice to be someone who can treat others to a night out....I know this feeling will pass but today I feel proud of myself. And I feel so happy to not be drinking with you all.

Congrats on day 3. Here's to day 4. Have you read This Naked Mind? She talks a lot about how imbued booze is in society. 
I completely relate to this.  I spent a long time trying to tell myself I could moderate.  Instead I too found my drinking getting more and more problematic.  I was ashamed that I could not drink like other people - that I couldn't simply control myself...It sucks but we're alcoholics.  We can't drink.  I can't even have one because one just leads drunken oblivion.  But you're not alone.  Congrats on 3 days.  I will not drink with you today.
