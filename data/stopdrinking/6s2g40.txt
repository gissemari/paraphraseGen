I hit 6 months on 7/26 just had my birthday and went to an engagement party this week. I also hit one year at my job. I refinished a deck this summer as well. ..This whole not drinking thing is pretty sweet. I had no shame rolling up to the party with a case of la croix. I stayed sober and had a wonderful evening with a bunch of close friends and the family of the engaged couple. ..With my medication and sobriety I've started to really engage in my life a lot more and I'm starting to become a lot happier even though I still struggle with anxiety and depression. ..Life's pretty sweet right now guys and I have to thank SD for being there to help. ..I love you guys and this place. ..Here's to not drinking with all of you today
