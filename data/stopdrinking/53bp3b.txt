(Badge reset in progress)..**Brute force: 0%** .Not drinking because of medium to long term financial health relationship or legal concerns has a roughly 100% failure rate for me.  The underlying short term urge is too strong...**Books by Allen Carr Craig Beck Annie Grace (mild to moderate success)**.The first time I listened to Allen Carr I quit for a month.  The main theme of these types of books is that Alcohol has no actual benefits only illusionary benefits.  Alcohol addiction is a behavioral negative feedback loop where the illusion of pleasure is actually just relief of from withdrawal symptoms.  ..**Naltrexone (Moderate success)**.I initially drastically cut down my units per week by roughly 50% and at one point quit for 3 weeks because Naltrexone really does dampen the high of drinking.  Eventually I decided to not take it once so I could really enjoy a night out and then became an on again off again user.  After a long period off I started it again and the side effects from Naltrexone became very uncomfortable and I can no longer take it.  I'm not sure why the side effects became so pronounced after I resumed taking it after a month or two break but they did.  Naltrexone probably needs external support through therapy or some other support network to be effective.  Compliance Compliance Compliance.  This medication will drastically alter your relationship with alcohol but unfortunately addiction and compliance are tricky. ..**Mindfulness (57 hours i guess ?)**.After listening to Allen Carr and Craig Beck on repeat a few times (still drinking daily) I bought a lecture on Mindfulness on Audible to take a mental break and listen to something new.  There was one chapter on Mindfulness and addiction.  This gave me the nudge I needed to start attempting 100% sobriety again.  Here's the TLDR gist.  ..By anchoring awareness on a fixed object (the breath body sensations... whatever) you can let your mind produce thoughts.  You can observe the thoughts/feelings acknowledge them and let them go without becoming attached to them judging them or acting on them then you return your awareness to that fixed object.  This is the point where you have interrupted that craving generated from some part of your brain that you have no conscious control over from ruminating in your consciousness for a few minutes and unraveling into a "fuck it I'm drinking" moment. ..This is a skill much like building muscles by going to the gym.  You aren't going to benchpress 2x your body weight the first time you step into a gym and you aren't going to sidestep cravings like Muhammad Ali dodging punches the first time you practice mindfulness.  You will start to gain the upper hand on them however and you will get better the more you practice...You don't have to sit on a cushion in a garden somewhere to be mindful.  I don't actually regularly sit and meditate.  I've been using "informal" mindfulness practice throughout the day...It has helped me for the first time in my life actually ride out a heavy craving and not give in.  I've literally never succeed in doing this once.  Allen Carr helped me consciously want to quit Naltrexone dampened the cravings but I've never just decided to ride out a heavy craving on a random day of the week when I hadn't formally planned to quit.  Booze has won 100% of those fights my entire life without a single exception.  ..I did this on Friday on the drive home from work.  I had a massive physical and mental craving to drink.  I started the breath awareness and let the craving build and subside over and over.  It became fascinating to watch my brain keep throwing thoughts into awareness to try to justify why I needed to drink that day.  Then the mindfulness... observe the thought acknowledge the thought without judgement return awareness to the breathing without becoming attached or acting on the thought.  ..57 hours of sobriety an audio book a few weeks of informal mindfulness practice don't make me any type of resource on the subject but it may be a tool for some of you that may be struggling to ride out cravings while pursuing your own path to sobriety be it medication AA CBT or good old fashioned determination.  Next stop for me will probably be AA but mindfulness has been a decent day to day tool.  One last note I almost quit practicing mindfulness because it was incredibly boring at first but I started noticing increased calm/self control.  Also you don't have to care or be interested in anything regarding Buddhism to use mindfulness/meditation as a tool...My mindfulness without the bullshit short list..- The Science of Mindfulness: A Research-Based Path to Well-Being.Professor Ronald D. Siegel Psy.D..Harvard University..- Buddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness Love & Wisdom..- Practicing Mindfulness: An Introduction to Meditation.  Professor Mark W. Muesse

Thanks. Will definitely look into your suggestions. ..Are they all audiobooks? Not on App Store. 
This is good stuff!  ..Do you have any fellowship?  A support network?  Others you're working with?
