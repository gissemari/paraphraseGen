I've been a long time lurker but I finally decided to create an account and take the first few steps towards my recovery. I was at the [IRC Chat Room](http://is.gd/IFEtCW) earlier and found it very comforting to talk to people that went through what I'm experiencing right now and are completely sober. ..I'm 28 and I've been drinking almost every day for a few years now. I've taken a few breaks every now and then but I always relapsed. I think this is finally catching up with me this Christmas after I got sick with bronchitis. It's usually cleared after 5 days of antibiotics and a nebulizer but not this time. I've been through 3 rounds of different antibiotics and I'm still sick. I have an appointment with an specialist tomorrow and I'm hoping to hear some positive news...I'm obviously not a doctor but I'm almost sure I'm not getting better because of my drinking. Seems like my body is too weak to get rid of the virus/infection even with medication. I will remember these miserable last few weeks before I think about having "just one drink" in the future...Thanks for the kind support and help you guys offer to any stranger that comes in desperately to the chatroom or this subreddit!

Some nasty stuff going around this year for sure. It feels like everyone I know has been much sicker and for longer than in years past. Still drinking likely does not help the immune system of course. You may need a little more motivation for long term sobriety than overcoming a cold. Good luck!
So tell me something about the IRC Chat /u/MarkV- do those crazy kids make any sense to you?  :D ..All kidding aside it's a great place to get support in real time.  If you've been in lurk for any time you no doubt have seen (or even read?) [the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  If not there you go--it's where I started stopping.
Hey MarkV!  Welcome!  Your story sounds very similar to mine - similar ages daily drinking a few breaks (mine were a week at the most) and now you getting having a hard time shaking illness...I've found it helpful so far to talk to people in IRC (they're such dears!) to post on this subreddit to go to meetings to read up on alcohol addiction and abuse and to go to counselling.  And pretty much anything else I could think of TBH...Wishing you the best of luck in your sober journey and a return to good health!
