To keep it short I feel like I've been getting worse over the past few months or so. I have been routinely blowing all of my income at the bar and I can never just have -one- drink.....I can't seem to stop once I've had one. I even tell myself "Just have one then go home". It never works out that way...I have been reading posts on this sub for a few days and it seems a lot of people struggle with the same problem. I just thought I would finally say hello to you all and try and stop drinking myself. It's not doing me any good....

Welcome! :) Glad you're here. I was really struggling last week when I found this sub and it's really helped me a lot. I'm glad you've decided to do make some changes for the better. Sobriety is worth all of the effort you put into it. Looking forward to hearing more about you and your progress! Best wishes :)
Hello u/WilliamRaine !..Glad you're here...What kind of approach are you using to "stop drinking by yourself"?
May need more motivation than just being broke.  That being said it does get much easier every few days.  If you have not done so highly recommend reading This Naked Mind.  Made a real difference for me.  Read it and see what you think.
