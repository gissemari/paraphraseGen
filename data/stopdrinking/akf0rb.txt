I relapsed over the weekend.  I drank a LOT. And today I am in serious withdrawal. I'm shaking and feel like shit. My anxiety is at a level 10 and I feel like at any minute I could start panicking and crying. I'm trying to keep it together. I also need to remember how awful this is so I never drink again. This is the WORST. But there is a small voice in my head telling me to take the edge off with a drink. I'm so fucked up. I hate this.

I would AND DID seek medical help ASAP!  This can be dangerous.  My potassium and sodium and dehydration due to withdrawals were at deadly levels. I had NO idea. I was just panicking and wanted Med detox. Journal this so you remember.

Personally when I try to drink to alleviate anxiety I feel worse. That's about the only time alcohol won't work. Dont beat yourself up though. There's gonna be times we slip up and it may even happen again but what matters is learning from those times and getting back up and saying you'll do better next time. 
I'm in the same boat as you. Drank a lot this weekend feel shitty and close to a panic attack. All we can do is move forward. We've got this together. I will not drink with you today.
Take a hot bath order a pizza drink lots of water and watch your favorite shows or movies.. you can get thru today! Just relax and stay strong. 
I saw a doctor when I had withdrawal symptoms like yours.
