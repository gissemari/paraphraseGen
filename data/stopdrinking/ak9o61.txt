So I stopped drinking about 2 years ago. Had a relapse in between. It was one drink. It consolidated the no drinking for me. Anyway the point of this post is. It's become easy for me as I'm not focusing on not drinking but on things I want to do. The person I want to be. I want to be someone I can admire and be proud of. I want to look back on my days and know I did something different even if only for myself. Not pissed away my days in a bottle and not just a dry drunk miserable fuck. So today I am in Kilimanjaro Tanzania. This morning I'll be setting out to climb Mt Kilimanjaro. ..7 days on the mountain. Climbing a physical mountain and conquering a psychological and emotional one. One that I dont see as any different to the mountains many here are in the process of climbing. It's a strenuous journey and all you can see is the summit. But focusing only on the summit makes it so all you know is the uphill before you. I want all of you to see there will be other mountains. There will be other summits. PhpWhen you've gotten over this one you'll set you sights on the next and having conquered this one you'll be all the more prepared for the next ones. ..Alcoholism is not a part of you. It is something you have momentarily fallen into but it is not an inherit part of who you are. You WILL overcome that mountain and be the liberated person you deserve to be. Godspeed brothers and sisters and carpe diem.

What a wonderful way of visualizing recovery. Thank you for your words. I won't be climbing physical mountains any time soon but looking forward to living vicariously through your report when you return from the summit! Godspeed to you!
