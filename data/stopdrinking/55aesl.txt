Every night for the past week I have been writing one paragraph in a word document about the day. I cover cravings confidence about not relapsing anxiety levels depression levels ect. It isn't a normal journal I don't talk about my life or anything outside of things relevant to my sobriety. I've already learned so many things about staying sober by observing the changes from day to day. The best thing I noticed is that feelings are temporary. They change from day to day. The first night I wrote in the journal I was feeling overwhelmed about the thought of relapse in the future. I knew I wouldn't relapse that night but I couldn't get my mind off the future and take it one day at a time. The very next journal entry I was totally fine confident and wasn't worried about the future. So if your feeling overwhelmed just remember things and feeling change daily you might be fine the next day. Also my anxiety went away overnight. Its pretty cool to watch the anxiety rise and fall. Anyway I recommend a sober journal. If anything its fun to look back at how you did each day. 37 days down!!!

i wish i would have done this! i just started at the beginning of september. i think it is so helpful to go back and look at your moods...37 days is awesome. have a great weekend!
Great idea. I really want to try it. I have a little notebook that I use to take notes on the big book/meetings with my sponsor... maybe I will turn some of that into a journal :)
