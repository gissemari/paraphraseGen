Had some pretty long stretches of sobriety for me in that time. Hangovers after those stretches are pretty bad. Can't stand coffee anymore too much association with booze for me. At least I'm learning something new every time. Great to read about others successes and their struggles. Anyway just checking in while I try to dump about 18 oz of vodka. Afraid of the bad insomnia tonight had the okay kind last night.  Don't feel like vomiting anymore that should be enough to toss the booze. Don't like being so lazy it makes me so rattled and exhausted simultaneously. So childish to have a getting caught or not mindset. Feel like I can sleep now but also have a lot of actual messes to clean up. The positive of being so drained is I at least I'm not drinking never could stand warm booze- no energy after pouring my last ice water. Not having as much of a pity party as it sounds just wantedn to say I'm still here to fight my addiction I guess. .Edit: finally flushed the vodka. Scared and relieved at the same time.

It's good to hear you're still here. It doesn't sound like a pity party to me just the sort of taking stock that one tends to do after a good pour-out just before getting healthy.
