Last night I went to two meetings went home (staying with my parents for a little bit) they had company over and were all so drunk when I got home. I was so angry and hurt I would just rather not be there. I almost relapsed...So even though I'm exhausted and worn out and not exactly feeling it I'm going to my fifth meeting of the day. Because even though it does not sound good to me it sounds a hell of a lot better than picking up that drink..Anyone else have days like this?

Every day that you go to bed without taking that first drink is a victory.
My first few weeks I went on AA safaris.  Saw all kinds of meetings and figured out where I needed to be. Some were good and a few I just rolled my eyes.  One good thing is I started at around the same time as another group of fellows and we sort of support each other. You know if he can do it I can do it.  I get so much out of the fellowship that I can leave all that Sweet Baby Jesus to the rest.
