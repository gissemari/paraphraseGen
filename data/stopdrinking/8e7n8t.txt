Attempt #2 starts today.  I made it a almost 4 weeks in Feb-Mar felt great and then went to a wedding and thought I could drink "only 1 night".  Fast forward to a few weeks of business travel never resetting the clock and just drinking way too much every night from the wedding night until today.  My goal is small to start.  Go 4-5 weeks and then treat myself to a pair of Maui Jim sunglasses with the money saved.  I need to keep reading this thread.  I need to remind myself how good it feels waking up in the morning.  Thank you everyone for your stories and support this is quite a struggle.

That's what I'm doing too saving my money saved for a treat.  Hoping it will be a huge reinforcement to have something tangible from my money instead of literally just pissing it away
