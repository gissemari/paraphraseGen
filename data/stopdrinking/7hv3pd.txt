I shared about my mom's cancer and chose emotional sobriety as my topic because the lack of emotions I allowed myself to feel my first time around really led to my relapse. Everyone took it as an invitation to talk about when their parents died (almost all old timers). I started crying and couldn't stop. I still can't. And it was one of those meetings where they go around and they look the leader straight in the eyes gahhhhh. It's like they turned on a faucet and now i can't get it to stop. My mom probably won't die either..I hope. At least i have to tell myself that and then they pushed death right in my face. I'm just glad it's over. Crying in front of everyone for a solid hour was a nightmare...

Sending you hugs. I'm sorry you are feeling this way. I don't attend AA anymore &amp; haven't in years but I remember crying big ugly tears all the way through a meeting before.  Please remember that tears are just emotion not weakness &amp; sometimes our emotional cups runneth over.  Best wishes to you &amp; good vibes for your mom. 
Aww sweetie!!! I know that feels kinda horrific... oh god the joys of crying in front of people :/ But I can assure you those people felt very touched by your share tonight and that's why they were able to open up. All those hearts opening... wow...On the other had a tad insensitive to talk about death if you were only talking about illness. That's the last thing anyone wants to hear when they mention the "c" word.
