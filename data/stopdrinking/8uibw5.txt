Hi all. *Lurker* I've been coming here a lot recently I have found it super supportive without even participating. I am 5 years sober from alcohol 2 years sober from clonzepam...I left my SO of 5 years recently because he cannot stop drinking himself. His problem has made me contemplate my own sobriety from alcohol but I know my life is better without it.  I wish I could help him but I have to continue to help myself.  Never drinking alcohol again was the smartest thing I've ever done for myself and leaving him might be the second smartest... ..To all of you struggling with this pain IWNDWYT.

Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigations!!
Thanks guys :) I needed a little affirmation and from reading all the encouragement going on in this sub I knew this was the place to be.

Congratulations! 5 years is amazing.  It's tough to want to help someone you care about who just isn't ready.  I've been there. People always do what they want to do in the end though no one change's until they're ready.  IWNDWYT 
You! I like you. 5 years is epic. I used to think people like you were an enigma. But I know there are lots of you/us. Happy not drinking with you today!
 fantastic. Thus is what I want for myself! 
Congrats on 5 years!  That is a big accomplishment.  Bigger high five on getting off the benzos!!!!  I've never taken one but somehow I stumbled on to youtube videos of people sharing their experience getting off the benzos with micro tapers.  It was absolutely heart wrenching.  Hats off to you!

Nicely done. Great milestone!
Congratulations
