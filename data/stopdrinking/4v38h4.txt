I've seen a lot of posts about "drinking because of depression or depression is the cause of my drinking."  I posted a few days ago that I was struggling but I ended up picking up last night.  Like I said before I can't even count the times I've given the attempt to stop.  For some reason this time feels different.  It's almost like I want something bad to happen to me to make the change.  It's ridiculous thinking.  I don't know why this is happening....

It sounds like you could use more support. I couldn't do it without my therapist treatment and AA. Maybe this saying applies to you:..&gt; When it is more difficult to suffer than to change;.&gt; .&gt; We will change. 
I deal with depression too. Alcohol makes it worse. It's bad for the brain.
&gt;It's almost like I want something bad to happen to me to make the change ..I definitely felt this way. Guess what happened? Something terrible happened to me. ..Really wish I stopped before hand. Also something much much worse could have happened.
