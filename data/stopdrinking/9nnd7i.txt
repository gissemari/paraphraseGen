I had 6.5 months sober working with a sponsor. Around month 5.5 I started indulging in the odd benzo or other "treat" I called them. Somehow my brain thought that was excusable behavior. A couple friends from AA found out and told me that I had relapsed so I ended up going for the full experience since I'd relapsed anyway right?..&amp;#x200B;..I was out for a month or so and ever since I have been having trouble. For the last 2 weeks I had been planning on trying The Sinclair Method. I didn't even make it to the doctor's appointment to talk about the medication. I was so drunk. I feel like I can fully concede now that I am powerless over alcohol. And that's not going to change...&amp;#x200B;..I have spent some time thinking about what I did well in the first 6.5 months vs. what's happened now. It is without question that I cannot use any mind altering substances. I was also doing step work before but had only made it to step 5. I believe in AA and the 12 steps. I am currently looking for a sponsor who will sponsor me by the book. I have a counsellor for outside issues whom I am seeing once a month for now...&amp;#x200B;..My plan is to do 90 in 90 again while I find myself another sponsor. Unfortunately treatment is not an option for me as I am self employed. ..&amp;#x200B;..Thank you for being here SD.

Welcome back.  It sounds like you have learned from your mistake which is always good to hear...Do you ever listen to Recovery Elevator?  It feels a lot like an AA meeting to me.  My version of 90 meetings in 90 days was to listen to at least one recovery podcast per day.

&gt; For the last 2 weeks I had been planning on trying The Sinclair Method.  ..I found great success using TSM. Sounds like you have a good plan going forward but keep it on the back burner. Wish you well.
