I feel like this is the only place where I can share honestly...I can't stop. Still.  I go to meetings every damn day have a sponsor ( underutilized ) and I pray but...  The compulsion and the craving man...No matter how fucked things get when I drink and how great things are when I don't I am struggling. I had thirty days and flushed them and now it's an all-out war with myself. ..Cunning. Baffling. Powerful. PATIENT.

So so patient :/ ..Hang in there FistyAnn. 
This too shall pass!
An old timer once told me about being in a cheap hotel with a bar in the lobby.  He spent the night awake laying in bed holding on to the frame.  He figured if he could hold on until daylight he wouldn't get up and go down stairs.
Hey FistyAnn. Sounds like you're looking for something new (to you). Have you read the Carr book (while sober)? I spent years in and out of recovery and I read it two weeks ago. I think it may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I recommend it.

This reddit is my favorite meeting. &lt;3
Sounds like you need to evaluate your thought pattern. Put down your burden. This way of life can open so many doors and give you so many benefits. It doesn't have to be an unendurable all-out war with a killer. ..All of the "cravings" "triggers" and other victim-based notions are literally all in your head. Instead of simply not drinking tie that to other progressive moves in your life. Make a plan. Stick to it. Watch your life get better slowly but surely. You *can* do this. All you have to do is make a choice and use the tools available to you to help you with that choice. 
Those 30 days sober are still there alcohol consumption is not retroactive.  Hang in there!
