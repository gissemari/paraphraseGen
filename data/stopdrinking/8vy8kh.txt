Just a quick share for no real reason. ..Started drinking daily a few weeks back and have been trying to cut back for the last week in an attempt to be down to zero for the weekend. ..Main things I'm struggling with is feeling extremely unhealthy bad diarrhea and hot sweats. Also  feel  shaky but don't look it...Also loads of health anxiety. ..Not a great feeling and wish I didn't start. ..Good luck to everyone for today. .

I'm sweaty feeling sore muscles hazy brain confusion eye soreness frequent waking in the night - but it's all worth it cause I don't want to feel this way ever again...The anxiety will go away as you string days together - per all the other wonderful redditors on here.
The body immediately starts healing.  You should see all the  posts glorifying a good poop after a bit of sobriety.  It's all good.  IWNdWYT
I'm here I survived all that . It's all gone away for me . I wish you well .
