It's really weird but I can't get over the fact that I still just don't want to drink.  Sure I have some cravings somewhere back in my reptile brain and even get a little shiver when I see a bottle and remind myself that I don't drink anymore... but I'm not consciously thinking about wanting to drink and finding ways to rationalize that behavior.  And that's really weird.  Because I've never made it to 40 days without coming up with an excuse to go back...I've been out at social gatherings I've had visits from family who stocked the fridge with beer I've been handed a glass of bubbly at a birthday party... and none of these things made me feel like I was going to break. I've quit drinking dozens of times in my life but this is the first time it really feels like I've actually *quit*...Not looking for a pat on the back just putting this out there for anyone who may be struggling.  Sobriety can feel like work but it can also feel really really normal.  In fact I've been watching other people drink and it's starting to seem so incredibly *unnatural*.  Did you guys know it makes you all red and sweaty and makes everything you say come out really loud and stupid?!

That's how I feel right now at day 8.  I'm worried that once I'm feeling physically good again the rationalization will start.  "Oh you can just have one drink...you're better now."..Congratulations on your 40 days...an inspiration to me.
