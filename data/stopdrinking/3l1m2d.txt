You guys know the story by now recently moved across the country (a month ago today!) and having a rough time getting settled. ..I know I'm being melodramatic and hyperbolic but I can't seem to snap out of this negative thinking. I feel like I have zero support no one "on my side" so to speak.  It's difficult being the new server at work; the restaurant industry is really territorial and a couple of the other servers are making the transition difficult by asking the host to seat them more than me (not speculation I actually overheard them talking about it) and also chiding me for not knowing the ins and outs of the restaurant when I ask questions. It's affecting my mental state and my pockets. ..Then there's school. I'm auditing two graduate level classes and trying to impress the professors so that I can get recommendation letters to officially get into the program next year. But I can't seem to allocate my time well enough to get all my schoolwork done. I haven't turned any assignments in yet; I feel really frustrated and like I'm going to fail if I don't start working harder. I just feel so tired after work and being on my feet all day that all I want to do is sleep and that's not really conducive to studying. ..And there's living with a roommate after living alone for the past six years. Last night it was really hot (85 degrees F after dark!) in my apartment so I decided to turn the AC on so I could sleep. I peeked in my roommate's bedroom and her window appeared closed but it wasn't apparently. She got really upset with me and I kind of feel like a piece of shit because her view is that I could have broken the AC unit by causing it to overwork and also that I wasted money and electricity while I was just trying to be respectful of her privacy. I feel like I can't win!  ..And then recovery meetings. I love SMART it's my POC (program of choice) but there's only one meeting a week 45 minutes away (and it's awesome!) but I need more support than that right now. ..And then my mother. My default is to vent to her when I'm feeling upset. But I've realized over the past month that this only makes me feel worse. She doesn't just listen she wants to try to fix everything and she doesn't always have the best advice unfortunately. I end up feeling more stressed out and confused and on top of all that like I'm letting her down when she helped me out a lot financially getting this move off the ground. ..And my friends. They're all so busy and it's hard to keep in touch. I'm too new here to really be able to trust anyone with my feelings without being judged except in recovery meetings. ..Yeah that turned into a super-long vent/ramble. r/SD feels like the only constant in my life right now. I'm sorry I've been posting about struggling for the most part lately and not really offering anything to help new people. I can barely hold myself up right now.

I'm just writing to let you know that you've been heard.  ;) 
Oh my goodness what a giant pile of stress.  I am so sorry you are so overwhelmed...Listen I know that SMART is your POC but is there anything else available in your area?  I know for me I feel really really overwhelmed when I don;t have contact with other sober peeps.  ..Hang in there.  You have done so much awesome work keep going you can get through this.
