It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Sophie who has been my best friend since childhood is married to a guy called Charlie who is one of the nicest men in the world. He comes from a big Midwestern family and has always cheerful honest and hard-working an all-around good guy. While I have pinwheeled from one romantic catastrophe to the next over the years Sophie and Charlie have been very happy together and clearly love each other very much. While various boyfriends have treated me badly seeing how well Charlie treated my friend has cemented my belief that not all guys are jerks some men are intrinsically good. ..Unfortunately Sophie has just discovered that Charlie has not only been having an affair but also lying to her about numerous other bad behaviors that she knew nothing about and that seem completely out of character for him. I have been very shaken by this news. I am heartbroken for her of course but it also reminds me that what you least expect can happen at any time because Charlie was the last person on Earth that I would have thought capable of this kind of behavior. Somehow this makes me scared of relapse like the last person I would expect to relapse (meaning me an SD friend or a fellow mod and dinosaur who I had assumed would never drink again) might be the one to go ahead and do it for the simple reason that clearly anything is possible...**Triumph:** I am so glad that I can be there for Sophie because I am not going through my own drunken disaster. I plan to mostly listen which is what I think she'll want and need the most...**General:**  Maturity means realizing that not everything requires a comment from me.   from a post made on the r/dinos sub..

Triumph. Last night I was called at 10:30pm to pick up my son from hospital - 2 hours away - because he had hurt himself at school camp. Six weeks ago I would have been way over the alcohol driving limit and unable to do it. I had a quiet little moment of internal triumph as I jumped in the car to go get him! BTW - not seriously hurt - knee cap popped out....
I'm sorry for your friend and the disillusion that goes with that. I'm not drinking with you Mary!..**Triumph:** I believe I've now completed 12 interviews (about 1/3 of which are 2nd interviews). This means I'm getting better at interviewing which is one of my least favorite activities. I've got 3 more scheduled this week. ..**Struggle:** Uncertainty does not sit well with me. I'll feel a lot better when this unemployment thing is over. I've been stressed about it for a couple of months and officially I've only been unemployed for one day now. LOL.
Struggle: My health issues are in a type of remission but years of not being able to function have taken their toll. For the last 6 months or so I have been doing everything I could to remodel my house so my son could buy it for his family. Spent a good chunk of my 401k. Two weeks ago or so he told me he couldn't because he was getting a divorce. I couldn't keep up the maintenance and I obviously don't need a huge house anymore so I bit the bullet and called a realtor friend of mine to come tell me what else I needed to do to sell it. She convinced me I should sell it as is and asked if I could have everything out of the house by April 7 because I leave for a two week trip to California on the 8th. She wants to list it immediately because there are only two other houses listed in my gated community right now. This is rare. There are usually a dozen.  I pretty much freaked. I told her I needed to think about it. ..Triumph: I found some energy and personal resolve I didn't think I had. I rented a storage space packed up about half of my stuff in boxes and have had friends jump in to help. Movers are scheduled to come April 7. Now I am waiting and hoping she can get me the forms I need to sign before I leave for California. ..General: I wonder where I will actually live when I get back from California. After living in the same house for over 25 years I am actually pretty calm about not knowing where I am going to live. I have a room in a friend's house I have been staying in. I'm not ready to say I am living here but it's nice to know I have a place for some of my clothes and a place to sleep. I am strangely calm right now. ..In almost 27 years of sobriety I have been through a lot more stress and a lot more trauma than this episode- but I know I need to stay vigilant and keep sobriety as my number one priority. ..IWNDWYT 
Struggle: Feeling lonely husband still drinking every night so he is more of a shell than a partner in the AM and PM..Triumph: Went to drug store on my way home where I used to buy IPAs and wine bought neither..General: It is to the point where not drinking is the habit so it is easier. Still not easy though. *Easier*.
Struggle: need to make some major life decisions a lot of which are intertwined. Procrastination and depression (been sleeping 16 hours daily since last Friday) is kicking my ass. It was a beautiful evening outside. Couldn't bring myself to go out...Triumph: exercised this evening. Decided what will be will be. ..General: hopeful for the future. I didn't imagine 11 months ago that I'd be here today. But I started and here I am. Onward I shall press and trust in God to guide me. Be well sobernauts.
This is it for me day one...before I hit rock bottom I'm stopping it myself. Hoping I havnt cause too much damage yet. Tried to talk to my therapist about it and that didnt help at all. So I'm going to avoid places I buy alcohol at and keep busy. Hopefully I dont get sick cause I'm on my own with this. 
*triumph* I have made it to mid-semester break without missing a class or being more than 5 minutes late for one - which is a bit of an achievement given I live almost an hour away and still juggle in work and Kiddo stuff. celebrated with a delicious chocolate bar eaten with my car-coffee on the way home...*Struggle* I have been lapsing on my gluten-free diet because crap is just so easy and easily available...and have managed to make myself quite ill as a result. Time to really nail that particular bad habit and remind myself that no matter how boring the spread and avo GF sandwich made at home might be compared to a bought something it will feel better afterwards...*general* looking forward to the next two weeks of no classes so I can catch up on life generally! 'Let it go" might work as a Frozen theme song but it kinda sucks as a housework method!.
**Struggle**: Someone I used to be very very close to in 2016 suffered a devastating loss. Their partner died of a sudden heart attack - at age 42. This happened in February but I only learned about it yesterday due to not being on social media. Gobsmacked and grieving and a little despair-stricken...Also anxiously awaiting edits for that story. "I'm sure they'll hate it! I'm sure they'll just be like oh sorry TCS you don't actually belong in this great prestigious magazine haha lol you couldn't have thought we were serious."..In a somewhat serious depression where not just daily functional activities like exercise and eating and working and self-care are slipping but also basic hygiene like brushing my teeth (at night) and cleaning my feet (again not a big issue but it's a sign). ..**Triumph:** The person's sudden death is the kind of event that would have driven me to drink to harm myself. In August last year someone in my social circle (but not an acquaintance) killed herself and I felt its ripple effects strongly. I'm still indulging in various kinds of self-harm - of a much much lesser degree - but the gigantic life-affirming favor I'm doing myself by not drinking is just such a huge boost. ..**General**: My father is at the bedside of my 94-yo grandfather who suffered a fall. My dad's going to come back and treat me as his "emotional urinal" and I have to practice boundaries. 
Struggle: have been going through a pretty intense depression. Lots of self loathing bad image issues ect. I've been frustrated with not getting more done each day...Triumph: 8 days without drinking today! I've been really keeping up on my exercise and I can feel the effect that's having. Depression feels like it's starting to lift a bit and I'm proud of how I've handled it. I'm celebrating by going to a spa today which I wouldn't normally like to spend money on but I feel like I've saved a bit from not spending it on alcohol. ..General: Im really realizing that this is a period of my life where I face my emotions instead of suppressing them...
**Struggle:** I'm finally working for pay again after more than two years. Yay! I've done volunteer work and preparations for our new business but working fixed hours takes its toll. The upcoming days and weeks I have to go *way* out of my comfort zone in our first serious fundraising campaign...**Triumph:** I was at a rehabilitation facility last week (physical not alcoholic). It was rough and it was nice. SaintMarge is particularly happy that two specific conditions are now proven to be uncomfortable but not deadly lol...**General:** My three year old threw a giant tantrum this morning kicking and screaming and throwing his breakfast on the floor because it didn't have the cheese he didn't say he wanted. So counting to ten I decided to mirror him - folding my arms nose up loudly exclaiming  unfair   don't look at me   I don't want that . When he stared blankly at me I began this  oh no what is this tingling in my cheeks  game which erupted in a massive hug-out with lots of laughter - and a finished breakfast...I wish I were this mature all the time.
IWNDWYT Mary. Hugs to your friend I'm so sorry. LOVE that quote.  
You never know what is going on in someone else's heart huh? And often thank goodness for that. ..**Triumph** The new person I hired for our front desk at work so far is doing great and I think ultimately is going to make my life a lot easier. ..**Struggle** Aches and pains. Have to admit I miss numbing them sometimes. Not worth it I know but a little relief would be alright. I think my elbow I injured shoveling snow on 12/30/18 is going to hurt forever and morning's are the worse. ..**General** We are having that nasty Minnesota spring weather lately. 35 mph winds yesterday with off and on snow and overnight about half an inch of snow. 
Doing a little bit better on day 5. Glad I hopped back on the wagon and am thankful for having friends I've been able to reach out to. Also started using the IRC which has been a great source of support and comfort so far
**Struggle:** I've developed some chronic back/glute/hip pain that I am seeing PT for but it's really put a damper on my activities. My husband and I were supposed to do a week's worth of pretty aggressive hiking (aiming for Long's Peak via the Keyhole route) in September in CO and I don't know if my body will be in a place to do that. It's hard not to panic and see my life as one series of chronic injuries and pain. I don't want that and I won't live that way if that's what it comes down to...**Triumph:** I had a phone interview for a nurse analyst (IT) position and did a second round of interviews for a nurse coordinator position for our liver department. I definitely get the saying that you should look for a new job while you still have a job. I love my coworkers and even my manager at my current job but just need a change of pace/something different. Knowing that I have a job that I really do like for the most part to fall back on makes interviewing SO much less stressful...**General:** I wish I had a crystal ball with all the right answers in it. I struggle so much with major life decisions because I want the "right" answer although I logically understand that there are few totally right answers in life. I also have a niggling worry that just changing my job position isn't going to help me shed this dissatisfied ennui that has characterized the last year or so of my life.
That really puts things into perspective about your friend and I'm sorry to hear that situation. Unfortunately all too familiar these days.  ..Struggle: I've relapsed a few times in the past few weeks.  I've had to really dig deep to see why and it's basically my thoughts of: "I can moderate.  This is will fine".  And it hasn't been fine any of those times.  I'm really reading up now with some new books and podcasts and would like to try and dive into some self-image and other emotional issues.  ..Triumph: I finished a 3 month workout challenge with pretty good results.  I know they would have been better without alcohol but it's an accomplishment none the less. ..General: I'm really ready for it to be the weekend
*Struggle*: Getting over the hump on no more alcohol trying to busy myself with other things and looking for work is what stressed me out to the point of drinking last time. I'm past a month of sobriety and I'm wondering what lies beyond. .
Triumph: finally seeing results in getting back down to my pre-drinking weight. I'm the lightest I've been in 10 years.  Another Triumph I was able to go to 2 concerts this weekend and not be tempted to drink..Struggles: despite my "practice" I still find myself getting "outside of" of or ahead of myself and start trying to dictate the past or future from my seat in the present. If I stay fully present and in the moment  the worry for the future and regret of the past fade away.  ..IWNDWYT ..Be excellent to each other
triumph: my marriage therapist thinks that there is hope for us because we are committed to &amp; doing the work...also last night my wife agreed she would join me in sobriety (at least until our next therapy appointment in 2 weeks.)
About half of people cheat regardless of gender it fucking hurts. I'm still trying to get over my ex and she's already over the guy she cheated on me with and left me for. Thinking about it makes old coping mechanisms seem appealing however IWNDWYT.
**Struggle** \- Realising I need to stop micromanaging my colleague who is five years younger than me and we're at the same level of job but man it's hard. He gets distracted super easily and I have to push him to do stuff so we can meet specific deadlines that affect me too...All he needs to do is print off a booklet he made so we can proof it and send it print. He still hasn't done it and I keep having to say: have you done it yet? It's doing my head in...**Triumph** \- Dealing with a lot of pent up anger in therapy and boy do I have a lot. I mean this may not sound like a triumph but I've spent a lot of my life running away from anger - at any sight of it I often manage to squash it down and turn it into some kind of guilt trip on myself. ..Actually putting aside the self-blame for once and admitting it isn't ok for other people to treat me terribly - is a pretty big deal for me...**General** \- The clocks going forward has messed up my sleep pattern it's just an hour but I've been exhausted all week...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
**Triumph:** My brother and sister-in-law were visiting for Spring Break.  There were challenging times--we've got a long history of friction and still rub each other wrong occasionally--but also lots of fun. No I'm looking forward to settling back into my more normal routine...**Struggle:**  Not much. Things are going well right now. Happy dance!..**General:** I do do this adulting thing all that well... maybe I should have kept that to myself.
Triumph: I had a job interview on Monday and I'm 99.9% sure I will be formally offered a position in the next 2-3 weeks. This is my dream job!..Struggle: I graduate and will begin working in just over a month. While I am excited and everything is changing for the positive I can't help but be really scared and anxious. I know these are good things but change is change and I am afraid. ..General: I started yoga this week and I love it. I go again tomorrow bright and early before work. 
Struggle. - controlling my snacking. I have a killer sweet tooth and workplace is always loaded with treats and I just can't stop eating them! I have no excuse I'm a snacked! Ok I'm only 10.5 stone but I should be under 10 for my height. This is nothing to do with not drinking I have always snacked      ..Triumph - for 11 weeks in a row I have exercised three times a week without fail. This is unheard of in my whole 44 years I have hated and avoided exercise! And I totally feel the mental benefits of it and I can only do this because I'm sober.   ..General - sober me has great skin compared to drinking me and I really love the self care routine of proper cleansing my face and bit of a skincare pamper   
Struggle: My anxiety has been acting up lately and leads to a cycle of poor sleep &gt; more anxiety &gt;even worse sleep and on and on. I'm using all of the tools in my toolkit but sometimes I wish there was some switch I could flip to turn my brain off! Just no thoughts for 10 minutes would be SO amazing. Still I know drinking would never make any of this better in the long run...Triumph: I biked to and from work for the first time yesterday! It was a little scary riding on the busy downtown roads and the way back was ROUGH because it's all up hill but I did it (albeit with some breaks to huff and puff) :) Hoping my cardio will improve by the end of summer.
Iwndwyt   
Truimph: I got a new job that pays a lot more than my old job and is way less mentally and emotionally taxing...Struggle: first week on the job and I'm already working 12 hours a day 6 days this week. Its a super physical job which I really like about it but my body is already worn the fuck out from working the less two day and I still have three and a half more days to go...General: anyone here program or learning to program?
I've been a sub here forever and fell back into old habits. I've been doing stupid shit drinking every day after work sometimes during my lunch break at work. High content IPAs are my drink of choice. I'm resetting my count and trying again. I don't want to live my life like this. Starting today no alcohol.
**S:**  Had a really horrible no good day at work...**T:**  Stopped to stock up on some tea and as I walked in I was greeted by a pallet of craft beer on sale for dirt cheap...**G:**  When bad things happen and we don't drink it's actually a really good day.  Sure as hell doesn't feel like it sometimes...
**Struggle:** Of course having a slip Sunday evening is my struggle. Not getting back on the horse but having to tell everyone I messed up. A lot of emotions right now. ..**Triumph:** Boyfriend and I finally settled on a house and are approved to move in!! One less stressor...**General:** I feel good overall and solid. I have a checklist of things I need to do daily like checking in with other alcoholics and readings. 
Struggle: I can't seem to untangle my feelings. I feel like I want to cry but I don't know why. ..Triumph: I'm still sober. ..General: a cool quote I saw the other day was  Pain is inevitable suffering is optional. 
Tomorrow I will hit the milestone of double digits without drinking. 10 days. Today I fell off my horse cleaned dirty Guinea Pig cage almost got into a car accident went for 3.5 mile hike and did much laundry. I may have licked the back of a spoon with vanilla extract on it because I was baking cookies. But through all of this I AM STILL HERE. And I did not drink. Whew....on to tomorrow. Hang in there everyone. And thank you for your stories. I am grateful. 
Checking in my peoples. IWNDWYT.
