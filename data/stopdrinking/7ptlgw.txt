I am a recovering alcoholic. I falter each time I've tried to stop drinking. In the last 2 years the longest I've gone without drinking is 14 days...Of course on that day my alcoholic mind convinced myself I'm not an alcoholic and I ended up drinking as a reward...I am fighting every ounce of my mind to not go and get more. My husband is at work right now and even then...he's not someone that struggles with addiction and as much as he loves me &amp; tries to support me I need support from people who get where I am right now...Today I am starting over again. Help please.

The good news is you NEVER have to feel this way again!..Alcohol made me a liar and a thief.  Alcohol made it easy for me to lie to myself misrepresent my impairment to others and "try to keep it secret".  That resulted in guilt and shame.  I stole emotional connection and my presence from my loved ones....I needed support to be successful.  I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  They were warm welcoming and non judgmental...They were sober wanted to stay sober and amazingly wanted to help ME be sober!..Evening meetings were especially helpful!.
Hey! First things first! Do you have something sweet handy? Sugar calms the hypothalamus and squashes cravings. I've got my Oreos right here!..Second you're doing an amazing thing for yourself. I know it's a goddamned PITA at the moment but hang in there!
