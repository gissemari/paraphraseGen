I'm fairly new to reddit and from day one I've been in this subreddit. I just wanted to bring some positive light and inspiration. Almost a year and half ago I was a complete waste of a person. I was homeless my family wouldn't have anything to do with me and I had no hope of being anything other then a drunk and junkie for the rest of my life. I had accepted my fate. I hoped it would be a short life. Somehow I got sober. Not everyone has the same bottom that I did but for the people who are questioning wether or not they have a problem you too can end up where I did. I came from a good family I always had everything I needed and mostly everything I wanted. I had potential and opportunities handed to me. But because I have the disease of addiction I wasted a lot of it. .Today I'm truly happy. I have peace and serenity. Fear doesn't run my life. I don't take myself too seriously. I got sober through AA and I know that's not everyones path but I am extremely grateful for AA and the supports I have there. Now since lingering around this subreddit I feel I have even more supports and everytime I comment and give someone else support it helps me all the more. I just want to say to the newly sober or struggling alcoholics there is hope and you don't have to drink even if you want to.

Welcome restoringhope. Thanks for sharing your spare good cheer. I hope you'll keep coming back.
Wow that's amazing.  For some reason I find stories about people surviving homelessness the most moving of all.  Thanks for sharing this with us.
