I just made an apology to the ex that caused me to relapse. I said some absolutely horrible things to him last night while beyond trashed. I'm mad at him. But he didn't deserve the wrath of wasted upset me. It felt good to tell him I was sober again and that he wouldn't get anymore texts like that again. .I think I'm having an epiphany that will save me from drinking in the future. I have two parents who love me more than anything in this world. A roof over my head. And I'm young and ready to take on the world after having our life together collapse out of no where. I can and will rebuild my own happiness. I'm truly blessed to have my life. I'm overwhelmed with gratitude for being sober right now. I have a splitting headache and I doubt I'll get a wink of sleep because of the cold sweats... but I'm sober. I have my mind back and it feels so good. I don't have to let my ex influence my ability to stay sober. I will be strong for myself and for the ones who truly love me. Which I found out the hard way is a rather short list. Still better than having a long list of people faking it.
