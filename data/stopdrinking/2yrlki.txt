I was feeling depressed and really bad earlier. Thinking dark thoughts and hating myself. I didn't even think I was about to relapse. I am over alcohol. But I came here anyway. I read some posts and I feel so much better now. You and I are all doing something great for ourselves. We are working on or have dropped alcohol. We are awesome for that. ..So when you feel like shit and like you don't do anything right tell yourself "well at least i'm trying to stop drinking."

Hey! Glad you're feeling better :)
Glad you're feeling better! Whenever I'm in those moods I find that the best immediate fix is literally drowning my thoughts out...I put on some good headphones and crank up the music. There's NO way anyone can feel down after listening to the "Freebird" solo...
The most important goal I gave is sober head on my pillow at night...If I've got that I'm golden. ..Stay gold steak21.
AND GALS ;).I have this attitude sometimes like my body goes through a cycle where I'll just _be depressed_ for no fucking reason. I'm starting to be able to recognize it better since no drinkie drink and I turnthatfrownupsidedown
