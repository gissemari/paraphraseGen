To those of you just a few days in. I'm happy to say that there may be some days that you might come to very soon that are a bit easier. I had one today. Spent some time with my momma who is dealing with some heavy issues went to the gym for the first time in two years and read a lot. I'm kind of sleepy maybe from actually getting excercise in today and ready to hit the hay. It does get better. I most definitely will not drink with you tomorrow even if feelings of struggle come back to say  hi again.

Good work. You are treating yourself better and reaping the rewards. Keep it up. The clear head and good sleep are worth it. I won't drink with you today either. You aren't alone.
