My boyfriend doesn't drink and I have a past history of some pretty heavy alcohol abuse but in the past few years have been drinking "socially" with a few blackout nights sprinkled here and there when friends are in town etc. But recently my boyfriend asked me if I would consider giving up drinking and I agreed to give it a shot. I've been clean from a prescription pill problem for about 6 months so I knew quitting drinking wouldn't be a bad idea either. ..The biggest struggle for me wasn't the alcohol itself but the idea of fun crazy nights out. (Like I didn't have enough of those in college). I felt like if I stopped drinking that meant I was a real adult and couldn't go do fun things anymore. But last night I realized that isn't true. My boyfriend took me to play pool and he drank Sprite all night and I drank diet coke. I had the BEST time laughing playing pool and just hanging out. It wasn't until we were heading to the car that I realized "Woah I didn't have a drop of alcohol all night and I had a genuinely FUN time." It actually made me really proud of myself because in the past I was always the person who would set out to have a sober night but would end up drinking because I felt like I wouldn't be able to have as much fun as everybody else. I guess I don't depend on alcohol to make me fun or social as much as I thought I did. ..Just wanted to share thanks for reading :)

Good for you /u/lizbot10 -- one of my best friends is a life long teetotaler and he often heads out to shoot pool till all hours.  He has a blast.  ..But be careful about being in bars or saloons where drinking is the focus.  I can't tell you how many times SD regulars or newcomers will say: I was at a bar drinking sodas and suddenly there was a mixed drink in my hand.  Or I was drinking an NA beer and "I slipped."  Sobriety must be my priority.  
Thanks for sharing this--very inspiring. I'm 30 and have had a lifestyle of binge drinking since I was a teenager and forgot I could have fun on a night out while sober. I keep thinking back to the time before I started drinking--like at 15 or 16. My friends and I still had a lot of fun just hanging out playing games and drinking TONS of coffee at 24-hr diners. Glad you and your boyfriend are so supportive of one another!
