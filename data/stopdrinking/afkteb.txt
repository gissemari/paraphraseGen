When I posted yesterday I really thought I was going to relapse yet again. I did it. I completed 50 days. Without the outpouring of love I received yesterday I don't think I could've made it through the day. ..It makes me so happy to see an online community that's actually impacting so many people's lives in such a positive way. I admire each and every single one of you not matter what your  count  is. Each day is an incredible accomplishment. I'm thinking of all of you and on your side regardless. ..I'll continue chugging my new drink of choice diet coke and I will NOT drink with you tonight.

Glad you made it through. Today will be much better with another day sober as opposed to be hungover and regretful.
So happy you made it! I will not drink with you today or tonight!
Well done on getting through it. IWNDWYT
