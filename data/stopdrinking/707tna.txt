I don't know if I've ever seen the subject of PAWS come up and I believe it is something that is not widely known. It is mostly psychological and a sign your brain is adjusting. It can potentially last a while ( from weeks to months or a year or two I believe) so it's good to know what you're battling against and that it's a result of drinking and not your new normal. A lot of people relapse due to not understanding what forces are working against them. Is there anyone who is well-versed in this subject or anyone with significant time under their belt who has lived through this and come out the other side?
