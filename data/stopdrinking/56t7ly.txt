11 days dry of drugs and alcohol until today. I had a few ounces of brandy. I've been a real asshole since being sober. I'm an all in or nothing kind of guy. I have been taking life too seriously. To the point of putting uneccesary stress on my relationships. Self centered and very abrasive. Sights focused on possibly the wrong targets...I might have been better to others during my own self destruction but being sober I've been bad to others. There is a fine line between the two and inebriation/sobriety struggle only makes the equation more complex. Unless the only platform of communication between myself and others is under the influence which has been my case for over a decade. Still learning who I am as a sober human...This is new to me and I am learning how to cope as well as balancing personal relationships. The sad truth is after a few drinks I realized what I've been doing wrong. Maybe someone can understand what I mean. Adjusting is brand new for me. Maybe I should've tapered off before a 100% sober life. ..Edit: my relapse was hours prior this post was made with entire sobriety.

Hi there as you mention you've been drinking today please be aware that in the [participation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_post_only_while_sober.) for this subreddit we ask that you please only post when completely sober...In the meanwhile there's lots of information in the posts here and lots to explore in the sidebar. .
It's a slow proces adjusting to sober life. It's not a big bang but rather thousands of tiny changes. I get what your saying. Keep in mind that any failed attempt is also a step closer to the eventual solution. ..For me it took hard work physical emotional relationshipwise communication awareness etc. Now years later I can tell you I was that some a-hole you 'are'. Things change and you can make it happen. ..Love the 'learning who I am as a sober human'; it can be a fun and exhilerating ride. Enjoy the learning curve I'm still on it join me...Wish you well on your journey my friend! 
I can relate. Feeling feelings is rough business.
