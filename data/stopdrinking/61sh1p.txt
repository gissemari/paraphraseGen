I don't really know what else to write. I'm always drunk I always feel ill my skin is bad and I'm lethargic. Also I piss my pants a lot. ..My brother is very ill and he needs another kidney. I'm sure I will be a match but it would absolutely destroy me if I couldn't help him. I wouldn't know what to do. ..But i struggle so hard to say no to the booze. even though it's expensive and makes me feel like crap I just can't turn it down. How do I say no? How do I make sure I can help my brother. how do i make sure I dont keep relapsing?
