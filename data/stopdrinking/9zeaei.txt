I've tried getting sober before MANY times. A few days here few months there...One of the things that has been a game changer this time around is my general mental attitude of eliminating alcohol as an opportunity instead of a sacrifice and the other is YOU GUYS and a community of sober people IRL. ..For way too long I thought I was the only one struggling like nobody would know what I was going through. Haha. Oh man - the first time I went to an popular pre-holiday AA meeting in my town and saw easily over 100 people in the room or found this sub and realized there were THOUSANDS of people on it it opened my eyes to how many of us are out there and how not alone I am. It's humbling and also instilled a great sense of hope in me. So today and every day I'm grateful for you for being here and reading this - whether or not you know it regardless of where you are on your journey the fact that you exist and make this sub happen is one of the things that keeps me sober. You're not alone and neither am I!
