Anyone else have bizarre dreams after recently being sober? Just a thought. Today I need to come here to post that I've made it through what is usually the day I choose to relapse and today I chose to finally fucking fight it and be sober. So I come with love and gratitude. I made myself dinner and took a hot shower. I'm in my pjs and in bed. I don't have to worry tomorrow about what I did tonight and the stunts I pulled. I choose me because I am worth it. Love you guys. Stay strong. xo IWNDWYT

yup...I had this dream where everyone at my former work place including my brother and me were taken hostage inside a cabin/compound and there were people shooting us from the outside every time they could see someone.  So on the inside it was just random people getting shot and killed.  Not fun.  Then finally the sheriff came and got us out.  But then after we got out my former manager started to strip naked in front of me exposing everything...wtf?  Random.  IWNDWYT!
I have been having bizarre dreams especially last night. I am heading to bed in my pjs. Going to do some meditation and fall asleep sober. Hugs!
This hits home hard. I get them really bad after I begin a period of sobering up. Usually they are pretty random and meaningless but I get a bunch of really dreadful ones about how I've let everyone down. 
Yes! I find I have dreams that feel so long and I've only been asleep for like 30 minutes. Crazy. I won't drink with you tonight!!
