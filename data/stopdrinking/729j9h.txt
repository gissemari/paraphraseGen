Was sober for two and a half months before relapsing this past week. I turn 21 in a couple weeks and at this point am almost considering just not trying again until then. Tonight I've been sober for 24 hours so just trying to go with that..

&gt; Tonight I've been sober for 24 hours so just trying to go with that...Good work. That's all I ever truly commit to myself. I overwhelm easily but 24 hours I can manage. Won't drink with you tonight.
Just take one day at a time! So i will not drink with you today
