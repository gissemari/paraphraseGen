I keep the Twenty-Four Hours a Day book next to my computer I try to read it every day when I can and getting the day started I needed a little bit of a thought for a day in which I read it:..> After we had sobered up through the A.A. program we gradually began to get a peace of mind and serenity which we never thought were possible. This peace of mind is based on a feeling that fundamentally all is well. That does not mean that all is well on the surface of things. Little things can keep going wrong and big things can keep on upsetting us. But deep down in our hearts we know that everything is eventually going to be all right now that we are living sober lives. Have I achieved a deep down inner calm?..While the first part of the A.A. program may not relate to everyone remember that by being sober things are still going to bug us and get under our skin but things will remain to get better if we allow them to by keeping a healthy and sound mind...  A lot of little things have been building up over the last few months but I've been working with my sponsor and meeting new sober friends which has been making it a lot easier to deal with.  I have a lot of work to do and need keep going but I like the new path I am on and am feeling great...

Thank you for this! 
I get very frustrated very quickly these days - I'm getting my house ready for sale and my realtor was not kidding when she said it was going to suck. But..&gt;everything is eventually going to be all right now that we are living sober lives...is so true for me. For all my frustration I couldn't be doing this if I was still drinking. 
Awesome advice. Thank you.
