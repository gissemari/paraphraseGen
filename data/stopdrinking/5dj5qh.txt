I had a moment looking in the mirror this morning. I said to myself there's a better/new life waiting around the corner. The thing that came to mind then was that I'll never get to the corner if I keep going in circles around a bottle...I've been struggling the last few months with a host of things I need to write about but at another time. For now these little moments of clarity are helping. ..So I'm making this my new mantra. ..Bottles don't have corners.

I like that thought. I won't go around that circle with you today.
I like it! 
Neither do cans!
Hey nice to see your name! Its been a while.
Living in the future.  A trap that gets us all.  How many times did I say - and know(!) - that tomorrow I'd get better...I still have the general issue but not as bad and probably the main thing I don't do is work out.
That's excellent!
This is a perfect analogy. WTG! Congratulations on your year sober I wish you many more to come.
