I had ample opportunity to drink today and didn't even have to struggle to not touch a drop...Would be nice to think that it stays this easy but I'm expecting tougher days because I've been here before around this time I start telling myself   see it wasn't such a big problem   and suddenly I'm back at Day One..IWNDWYT

Nice work on 8!
5 more days and you're through the holidays. And that would be day 13 for you.  Today is my day 50.
