Over the weekend I found out a friend of mine was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He goes In for surgery next week. The doctor basically told him the life expectancy is only a couple of years and the chance of success with the surgery is low. ..Why is this relevant?  Well I can tell you the challenges he is facing are far greater than the ones I am facing with not getting drunk. I ultimately choose to drink or not drink. If someone says something mean to me at work if I get a flat tire if my dinner is a little burned or my favorite shirt gets a stain on it I still have the choice to drink or not drink. He doesn't have a choice to have a tumor or not have a tumor. ..I will get inspiration from his struggle to maintain my sobriety. He will follow the steps his doctor outlines for his recovery just like I will follow the steps outlined in the Big Book. ..I hope someone else in this thread will benefit from my perspective and also use my friends situation as motivation to overcome triggers in their own lives. We can (and will) beat the disease of alcoholism just like he can (and will) beat cancer. ..God bless all of you!..IWNDWYT
