I am writing this sheerly to let people know. I have taken Antabuse for the past 5 days since leaving the ICU. Today I decided I was going to drink and have already drank a 6 pack on top of the antabuse without side effect. I was taking 250mg/day for 5 days and I took one at about 9 AM EST this morning. I want to stop drinking I just can't. I had 6 years lost it recently had 10 months then broke my leg and this has made me relapse time and time again. Thanks all!

I've been in Antabuse too and I can tell you this: it did absolutely nothing of value for me...I took naltrexone following that and I kid you not: it sent me for a spin. But I've also heard the opposite from others so as with all drugs: your mileage may vary...If it's not helping try something else. Tell your GP and go from there. You haven't really messed anything up until you've stopped trying. ..Best of luck! 
You didn't get super sick like everyone says? I've always heard that you'll puke for days if you even smell booze...Asking because I've considered Antabuse myself.
I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
