Hi. It's been three days and I fell great. I have been trying to stop for three years. I came across this site 2 weeks ago. Just reading and knowing other people are going through the same struggle has given me the courage to stop. I have tried into the past with no success. I feel different this time I can't explain it. I didn't have any escape clause like I'll quit till my birthday or I'll just for a bit. I also have been truthful this time to my Wife and more importantly my self. When ever I have a ping of doubt I come on her and read other people's stories and it gives me strength. .I have been drinking for 13 years and I has taken three just to get to this point so I not saying its going to be easy just saying thanks.

Good for you /u/Bigger_cat!
Thank you I needed that.
You never have to quit alone. Even if you want to we'll always be here. And there's AA and SMART recovery and therapy and people the world over who want to make sure you never have to go through quitting alone. And we'll always be here.
3 days is a great start! Keep us updated with your efforts as you said it gives strength to each other. Thanks for the post!

It's so great when you stop and you can actually feel a change in yourself. I don't know what that is but it's like you can feel real drive and determination. God I wish I could bottle that feeling. 
Thank you to everybody who commented. All of your support gives me strength. /u/getmyselftogether I know what you mean when you say I wish you could bottle this feeling up. Stay strong brother.
