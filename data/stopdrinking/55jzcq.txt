The thought that's helping me keep sober is that if I drink I may ruin my life.  ..See I used to drunk-text people which resulted in all my friends and acquaintances cutting ties with me.  But it ultimately didn't matter all that much back then.  ..The difference is that I'm now in college and my entire future rides on me passing this course.  If I were to send inappropriate text messages to my classmates an expulsion would most certainly be in order because my school has policies against that sort of conduct.  ..Obviously that will never be a problem for sober me but drunk me has no control in that regard.  When I'm drunk everything seems like a good idea so I cannot risk it...Well that's it.  I'm enjoying sobriety I don't want to turn back but when I occasionally feel vulnerable that's the thought that keeps me going.  ..Have a nice day.

I know that fear..that fear of doing the things we hate when we're drunk even though we haven't taken a sip...That fear is a huge part of what's keeping me away from alcohol currently. I keep calming myself by remembering that if I never take that first sip I never have to have that fear...
Well done!..I also think fear is a great motivator. :)
