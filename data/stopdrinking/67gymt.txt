Long time lurker..I talked to my wife about this last night. I am an addict. Alcohol is the carrier and has me realizing that it's the easiest to obtain. I don't need a prescription or an acceptable state to live in for my high. I simply go to the store buy repeat...I am somewhat of a functioning alcoholic. I say this because I run a business but could run it a whole lot better without my "days off". ..I have been trying to quit now for roughly 100 days...with about 5 relapses. It seems like the more that people say I can't..the more  I want. I have a super supportive wife and a 2 year old daughter. I'm scared my life choices are taking them away. ..I want to be a good dad and husband. I have been seeing a counselor for my issues...but need some help from you guys...I am on day 1 again and feel all the anxiety pain and crap that goes with it....

I'm an addict too. I run a business too. Each time I've gotten sober I've had a very distinct "this is it" moment. Even after many many months of trying and trying and Day 1 after Day 1. I don't know what that moment might be for you but it probably has to do with your family. Good luck to you.
Welcome to SD! You can do this. One moment at a time. One day at a time. Maybe a support group would help? AA SMART or Refuge Recovery. I have tried quitting and moderating to end up back drinking. I am trying Refuge Recovery myself. I know I want this to last. I have read from many of the longtimers here that group work has really anchored their recovery...I wish you well friend. I won't be drinking with you today!
The book 'This Naked Mind' available for free download load in the sidebar really helped me overcome a lot of mental blocks that I had about quitting drinking. I highly recommend it. I won't be drinking with you today.
