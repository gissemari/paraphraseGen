Some struggles but I got this. Keep telling myself that I must hit at least one year before I address the part of me that thinks it will be able to make exceptions on  special occasions.  I did quit with that intention but what a slippery slope! The 1 year commitment is helping me like the daily pledge does. So who knows maybe I'll make another one year pledge in 47 weeks! I will not drink with you today.

Happy 5 week's!  I got this  is a great sentiment in some ways but that one really really did a lot of damage to me. I'll never have this addiction beat; the day I think I do is the day it wins
Congrats on getting to 5 weeks! You have got this - you've shown to yourself that you can do it...I will not drink with you today
Congrats! I'm coming up right behind you and I've had that same thought about a year. Sometimes it helps. Sometimes it feels like I'm fooling myself. But whatever it takes to keep me going for today. ..I wonder how many others with a lot of days under their belt had the same deal with themselves but then discovered they didn't want to explore that option after a full year?..Always curious to hear from those who've been at it for longer than me. And to find fellow sobernauts around the same number of days as me. IWNDWYT!
