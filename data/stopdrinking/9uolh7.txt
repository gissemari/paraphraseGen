I'm feeling pretty low right now. I relapsed and my wife asked me if I had been drinking when I called her after my relapse.  I told her  no .  I had to cycle back to the beginning of the conversation and tell her the truth.  This is the third time something like this has happened .   I'm so tired of these phone calls.

Glad you're here!  Lots of support!..Alcohol made me a liar and a thief.  I lied to myself and misrepresented my impairment to others...I stole time and emotional connection from people I cared about...Then I did One thing different: I asked for support...I went to a recovery meeting and just listened.
That is rough.  I find that I still lie as a knee-jerk response at times.  I'm proud of you for reaching out and being honest with us.  Funny how it seems so easy to be honest to a thousand internet strangers but so hard to be honest with the ones we love the most.  I know for me fear and shame get the best of me often and muck-up my good thinking.  If I ever figure out how to tackle those suckers I'll let you know.  Keep up the good fight!  You can do this!
