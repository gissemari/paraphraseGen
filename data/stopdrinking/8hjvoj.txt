I told myself after my first month sober I would reign in my diet a little. I don't think I've gained weight but I haven't lost as much as I expected either after cutting out all those alcohol calories. Who else has had this problem and do you have any tips to share on getting my diet back on track? I'm almost afraid to make myself too uncomfortable because i fear relapsing.

Early on don't worry about that. Sobriety is your number 1 priority. Nobody crashes their car because of bread or pasta.  Healthy diet is a problem to be dealt with once you are more comfortable with sober living.
I fear relapse far more than I fear calories. If it's a tug-of-war between a pint of ice cream and a pint of beer hand me a spoon...Maybe it would help to gradually start to replace? I don't know what your carb-of-choice is but maybe go one less a day/week. Drop it down so your body/brain get time to adjust.
My tip would be to wait on the diet. I tried to eat clean and get sober more times than I can count. Never worked for me. One battle at a time! 
I ate a candybar a day in my first 2-3 months of sobriety.  Compared to the damage I had been doing with alcohol it was an easy trade-off.  I started focusing on fitness and healthy eating about 5-6 months in.  
Be kind to yourself. It's better to eat junk than go back to drinking. I'm planning on going easy on myself until I have more sober time under my belt. I also have an unhealthy relationship with food and I don't want to make it worse. Best of luck to you! 
Food can be comfort and in times like this we may need comfort. I can only speak for myself but right now I am fighting my first battle - diet will be the second as soon as I get comfortable with my sober self.  I hope you find what you are looking for!
