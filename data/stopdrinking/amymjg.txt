You are doing good fighting the old instincts! Don't give up and keep reminding yourself why you wanna be sober! 
Find something you can do to distract yourself whatever can take your mind off it. Don't give up now you can keep going the strength is in you.
If I start thinking along those lines it creates more pressure and worsens cravings. If I just think about this moment and today and say I am choosing this today (and remind myself why) my system can relax a bit and I just walk through it until bedtime. Also it's good to step back and see it's my brain spinning not me.
Nothing wrong with a little accountability but were I you I would resist letting that become too much of a motivator. In my opinion the things you do for yourself are the things that stick. You've got 25 days and 25 days ain't nothing so you're doing something right! IWNDWYT
I'd like to think your family wouldn't act that way.  When i feel that way about my family i try to just tell them how I'm feeling conflicted. I find that being honest with them builds trust and is most crucial in the times when i feel like I'm failing them. They remind me that I'm loved and just a human. It's that kind of reaction that helps keep me in track. Regardless of what your family feels i believe in you and send you love. 
Ive been reading [This Naked Mind](https://books.google.com/books/about/This_Naked_Mind.html?id=KB9BDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button) and its actually been helping me find perspective. Maybe try to find something to read to help you stay focused?
