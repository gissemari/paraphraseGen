Hey everyone I have been lurking in this sub for quite some time and finally decided to reach out for support. I've been struggling with binge drinking for more than 10 years and I've had enough. I'm 37 and I don't remember most of my late 20s and early 30s except for the times I embarrassed myself of course. I decided about 6 weeks ago that I'd had enough. I started working out every day like I used to eating much better volunteering at the local homeless shelter and getting involved in my church. I felt fantastic. I even met a woman who has overcome addiction issues in her past which I thought was fate. I'd had a few drinks socially here and there over the past few weeks but instead of having 2 beers out at dinner and then drinking 6 more or half a bottle of whiskey at home I would go home and to bed. I had finally finally proved to myself that I can control my drinking! Wrong. I had a friend over to watch football two weekends ago and bought a case of beer because who doesn't provide beer while watching football right? I found myself drinking 4-6 beers per night until the case was gone. Not ideal but still nothing compared to how much I used to drink. The problem is that I haven't been to the gym haven't been volunteering and basically turned back into the lazy SOB I am when alcohol rules my life since bringing that case of beer home. Last night at dinner with my parents I had 2 beers seemed like no big deal. But I couldn't talk myself out of stopping at the liquor store on the way home because I really just wanted a little bit of Scotch. Just a little bit. I went to bed at almost 2am woke up feeling like crap and the anger and disappointment I feel is the worst of all. I looked at the bottle this morning and was disgusted to see that I had drank almost half of it. I have refused to admit that maybe my problem isn't that I can't just have a drink or two but maybe that I can't have any alcohol at all because I will never be able to fully control my habit. I can't imagine not drinking in social situations or seeing other people drink and not doing so myself. When I lurk on this sub I feel so jealous of those of you who haven't drank in weeks months years and explain how amazing and healthy you feel. I want that so badly.

I too am 37 and while not at risk of losing it all was drinking way too much way too often.  I was always in a negotiation  with myself - ok I'll drink 5 days this week.  I'll have 10 days sober a month.  No more than 3 glasses tonight.  Sometimes I'd succeed and often I would not.  After visiting here for over a year (but still drinking on and off) I finally had an epiphany almost a month ago while listening to an episode of a recovery podcast the Bubble Hour - I am obsessed with alcohol.  I might not drink all day everyday but some serious mindspace is taken up all day everyday about how/if I would drink feeling like shit from drinking the night before do I have a drinking problem do other people realize? etc.   The logical conclusion after realizing that I'm obsessed with alcohol is that I'm alcoholic.  Which is something I had been fighting *not* to acknowledge for a long time.   This time when I accepted it - it was pretty obvious to me that I couldn't drink anymore - as now I could admit that after 10-15 years of drinking - things were not *improving* so it didn't take a psychic to see where things were heading if I continued to drink.   Anyways - now I'm at my longest sober streak in 20 years.    Hang in there!  
Hey!! i feel the SAME EXACT WAY about not being able to drink in social situation ever again. That's what makes alcohol so hard to stop  because it's so socially acceptable. BUT what i have learned on this sub granted i have only been sober for a few days is that you aren't saying you'll never drink again you just face the one day that has already started and say you will not drink on this day. When you find your mind start to wonder to the point where you start thinking about NEVER drinking EVER again just reel in your thoughts take a breath and realize that's not what your saying but that today you will not drink. ..My family are big social drinkers and i have Christmas this weekend. I start to think like what am i going to do how am i going to do this and not drink but then i just say don't worry about that now well address it when it comes. ..The more you think of how you wont be able to ever drink again the more it will lead you to drink  more today because you are harping on how you cant do it. Just tackle today first worry about tomorrow tomorrow. ..Hope this helped even a little.
