For the last few weeks (or longer) I've been trying to minimise contact with my parents...Not out of spite or anger but I've asked them to give me some space to work out some stuff and they've been getting more and more intrusive...Anyway I've been waking up to more and more aggressive (and passive aggressive) messages over time and I've been really struggling with how I wanted to handle it...Today I wrote to them and after about 15 revisions I managed to craft a polite but firm message telling them that while it's their choice to ignore my request I would not be telling them anything about what's happening with me...I also suggested that we could have lunch when I'm visiting their country next month but I won't be engaging in emails / messages before then...I didn't try to  win  the conversation I avoided making accusations I didn't feel a need to justify my actions or apologise for anything...I finally feel like I was able to speak with my own voice instead of keeping quiet to keep the peace or allowing myself to become flustered and argumentative...Whether or not the message is received is not in my control but it is a fantastic sign of how far I've come in the last two years...And that will do me just fine.

Yay for healthy boundaries that's awesome!!     That *is* a huge achievement - setting boundaries and disengaging can be hard it's something that I'm working on myself. But it makes staying sober a lot easier there's so much less stress and emotional turmoil when I do.
Nice! Boundaries are the best. 
Fancy a new job checking over my messages/emails/texts to my ex?? ..My default now tends to be the big red circle on my phone when she starts launching another cruise missile in my direction :-)
