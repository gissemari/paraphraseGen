Good morning / afternoon / evening..Theme: Beginnings..**"You know that the beginning is the most important part of any work..."   [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato)**..What I get from it: Getting sober was not easy for me initially. For a lot of years I wrestled with moderation and I tried to do it before I posted here... really tried. When I posted here and asked for help I got a lot of the right kind of support that helped me get [more days than I had ever got before on my own (see my post on day 7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ezhmn/today_is_day_7/) the 17 years prior. It was an achievement I never thought I would reach but I still had my doubts. I hear people talk about feeling like a child in early sobriety and in a lot of ways I still feel I am. Getting sober I had to learn to do a lot of things I had never attempted wanted to try or tolerate. Feeling uneasy pissed off without release and just miserable in general! Continuing to read here helped. It does take what it takes and sometimes it takes time to grow. If you are struggling today [coolcrosby has posted the baby steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and though I didn't follow them to the letter to start I eventually found a way to work them all. ..Have a happy Friday!
