I'm coming up on 90 days in a few weeks. Since I quit drinking I also started eating better and working out more. Like eating MUCH better. Better portions much healthier less-to-no junk food...I found a new stretch mark yesterday and I'm too scared to weigh myself. How can I cut out all the unhealthiness of alcohol improve my diet become more active and still gain weight?? As someone who has struggled with self image and eating habits for years it's hard. It makes me want to drink but then I remember drinking won't help. I may not know what I need to do to make this better but at least I know what makes this worse and I can avoid that. IWNDWYT and if some of y'all could will me a portion of your newfound fitness I'd appreciate that.

Are you lifting weights? Maybe it's muscle volume causing stretch marks...Which at the thought of it would mean that you're eating at a surplus either way but still. Try counting calories for a few days it might be surprising what even healthy food can add up to.
My weight hasn't changed much either. Two things I keep in mind: everyone is different and someone who posts about losing 30 pounds in 2 weeks is probably starting from a different place. Also we are recovering from a long-term condition of being thoroughly poisoned - our organs tissues and brains saturated with an addictive substance that altered us physically and mentally. It takes time to recover from that more than a few days or a few weeks. Your system will come into balance eventually. And it's a good thing that recovery takes time otherwise it would be easier to relapse.
I don't know you but I can see that your honesty and ability to self-reflect are beautiful. Your sobriety is beautiful. For all that you are immensely strong. It is a God(dess) in my book who can gracefully accept all of their flaws. Keep your head up I believe in you.
