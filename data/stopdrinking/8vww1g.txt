I have posted on here before and found this community to be super supportive and helpful. I am still in an ongoing struggle to stop my destructive drinking behavior. I quit cold turkey on August 31 of last year and stayed completely drink free until February. I lost a bunch of weight and my mental health and happiness soared. I think the happiest I've been in a long time was those 5 months. Then had a relapse and picked up drinking right again. ..I've been pretty good about cutting it off on Monday morning and then feel like crap for a few days while my body heals itself. My problem has been on Friday afternoon when I feel normal again. I inadvertently slip up. I'm starting over again today. I'm going to an AA meeting in about 30 minutes. After that I will continue to not drink. ..Thank you all for the support and knowledge on this page. It's going to be a hard week of healing myself but I know I can stop with this group and with AA like I did last time.

Those months are not for naught my friend. Welcome back. 
Wow that is a lot of time sober though. I think you can do it again friend! ..Friday night is always a crucible for me too. It sucks because I flippin' love Saturday mornings. So the extra hungover guilt is killer.  I can only stay sober on Friday night if I make a plan to get up early go to the gym and also make plans for breakfast (usually at the markets near my home) at the very least a coffee out and about so I'm up and out of the house. It worked last weekend and I had a super productive Saturday. ..Best of luck at your meeting. 
Welcome back! I'm restarting right along side you. You're strong. Stronger than me. I've never made it to 5 months. But this time I'm not focused on that. I will not drink today. ..I will not drink with you today.
