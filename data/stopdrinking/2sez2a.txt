Being drunk. ..You can't know who you are but you know how to be somebody. Navigating through a thin fog that doesn't always mask what you can see but will always mask how you see. Millions of men wiser than myself have succomb to it's seduction and made more profound statements. Millions more will. ..Right there with all the other things you no longer remember but revealed in as you floated gracelessly aimlessly and forever with others like you. Drowning misery requires company for we are all one anothers life rafts. There's nothing poetic about drawn out enthusiastic mass suicide. Nothing pretty nothing divine...nothing tricky either. It's the nature of the disease that makes us wax on about it. It's interesting when you're sick with it. Fascinating like a top notch narrative. And it comes in many delicious flavors. ..There are different grades. From  presumably safe to drink  all the way up to  I don't realize how foolish it is to spend money like this but shallow validation is all I can get  a consumer can accessorize with a crutch that'll fit any occasion. Marketing loves booze. They can show you exactly what you'll want and they'll make sure you associate it with manic consumption. Every time you drink will be the best time you've ever drank in your life. Now look at these attractive people for a second before your sport resumes. ..The best part about alcohol is that you can justify doing almost anything at the time you decide to do it. Want to cheat on your significant other? Be drunk when you do it. It'll help you sleep at night. Want to tell someone off? Get drunk and do it! You'll be so much more articulate. Don't operate heavy machinery though. That's a bad idea...If you ruin your life and lose all your friends you're just a new drinking establishment away from a whole new life and a new set of friends. You already have the only thing in common you really need. And your old friends will probably forget eventually because they do navigate in the fog. The fog is forgiving. ..People who aren't in the fog are not forgiving. They see everything for what it is. They take things seriously that are hard to even notice in the fog. They are responsible for guiding us at times. They have nothing to numb themselves from the loudness the crassness the lack of control that feels so normal in the the fog. In a heavy fog this can be confusing often requiring a thickening of the fog to prevent feelings from being hurt. ..When man decides to travel into the fog he does so knowingly or unknowingly without the company of a sober guide. For no matter how hard you try you cannot follow the lead of someone outside the fog. You cannot hear and comprehend when they suggest you slow down. That you have a problem. You cannot exit the fog and maintain continuity. Not until you get a glimpse of the world without the fog. ..It can happen at any time for presumably any reason. It's not triggered by anything outside the mind. Outside stimulation might play a part in things but it's a clarity in the brain that has to be present in order to leave the fog. It takes a team of people to rescue someone to pull them out of the fog without a relapse. Relapsing makes someone forget how the clarity felt. It might send them on a quest to find it again and ideally that would always be the case. ..Leaving the fog isn't so simple. There are regrets. Hidden feelings. Forgotten moments where the fog prevented something from happening or allowed for something to happen which was not repairable due to the sobriety of the others involved. ..These things need to be dealt with based on their severity and the dry drunks ability to handle all of the baggage. A dry drunk is nothing more than a baggage handler until they find peace with themselves. Emotions are meant to be dealt with or drowned out. There isn't a third option. Once you stop trying to drown them they are dealt with in a manner that you have no control over. ..Things might seem very urgent like repairing a friendship and things might seem confusing due to their complexity. It will all work itself out. It has to in order to keep you out of the fog. Staying out of the fog is never easy. Like outside of the fog is always much easier than life in it. ..Feeling everything becomes the new challenge. Stay the course. Find like minded people. Go to meetings. Don't be around anything you can't handle. ..It's a whole new game. Sometimes you feel like you've disappeared. Sometimes you feel like you're doing more things than you ever could of imagined. You'll suffer until you find your place in the world. Drifting through fog isn't really a place so much as it's a way to make anywhere feel like a place. You'll find the comfort you were seeking in the fog once you're comfortable outside of the fog. You'll wonder what you were thinking but you'll have no regrets. ..You'll be at peace. .
