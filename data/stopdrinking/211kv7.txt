Ten days down and I have a new badge on Reddit!  (Although I don't know how that system works but new is always good!)..I cannot describe in words how amazing the past 10 days have been.  I had a catastrophic life event that made me face my problem head on.  Reddit was the first group I turned to and you all have been amazing.  ..Since then I have felt so much better.  Physically mentally it's really amazing.  I feel so good to be sober.  I had withdrawl symptoms but they are going away and I just feel so alive.  ..My girlfriend who had left me over my drinking saw how much I changed and how willing I was to change and took me back.  We are trying again taking things slow but I am so lucky that I was able to see the problem in front of me before it ruined everything for good...I can't wait to be sober tomorrow.  Or the next day.  Or the day after.  I am still new at this so of course I wonder if I will relapse in the future.  Maybe on vacation I will have a drink?  Maybe on my birthday I'll smoke some pot?  But these are just thoughts for the future and my urges are dissipating by the hour.  For now it's one day at a time...Thank you again to everyone on these boards.  You are all amazing and your stories really helped open up my eyes.  I honestly feel so fortunate and lucky to have you all by my side and helping me along this new and scary journey.

Congratulations amigo ;-).It sounds like you are really on the right path and have the right mindset to conquer this. Can't wait to see that badge say 20 days!  Keep posting and keep focused on what's important in your life. Much love to you!
See how not drinking and taking action can improve our circumstances? Things we thought were impossible to overcome and change somehow manage to work themselves out!
