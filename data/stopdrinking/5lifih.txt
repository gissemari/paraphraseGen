Hi all..Thanks for taking the time to listen to me today...I admitted that I had issues with alcohol a few years ago now. I am comfortable to call myself an alcoholic. I have told my mother my friends and everyone close in my life. I am not in denial about it at all...There are parts of me that want to give up the booze or at least learn to control it somewhat but there is barely any incentive to do so. I have a full time job at which I am excelling thoroughly. I have been given a promotion and 2 pay rises since I started and I am looking to go into a managerial position within 6 months. I work from home a lot as we can work wherever we want so there is no incentive to be up at 8am and even if I do have to be in the office at 9am it's only a 5 minute cycle so the pressure to not get drunk the night before really isn't there...I maintain excellent relationships with my friends and family (aside from my dad who everyone has issues with all of which are unrelated to drinking) and maintain a strong community of friends...I go to the gym three times a week and cycle everywhere. I try and moderate my diet to a healthy amount and my friends have been saying how healthy and fit I look since I began working out about 4 months ago (mainly to combat my depression)...I do have depression and anxiety both of which I have managed for around 10 years now having learnt skills acquired in CBT therapy. I am entirely open about my depression and anxiety and try to give counselling to others on my experiences. I continue to seek advice and keep those close to me well informed about my depression and there are no serious concerns about my mental health because of this...I hope from me telling you this that you can see my issue. Aside from the far off future of an almost certain health issue(s) arising from my alcoholism I am doing little to no damage to myself socially or work-wise and nothing to hurt the people I care about. It was only last night I was sat with my friends at my new years party and three of them ambushed me to tell me what a positive impact I'd had on all of their lives and that they were so thankful I was part of theirs...I guess you could call me extremely lucky to be this kind of person and not one who's affecting people negatively however it comes at the price of nobody every stepping in to aid me in managing my drink and nobody to talk to me about the clear damage I'm doing to myself...I drink every day of the week often have perhaps a bottle or two of wine a night (I struggle to sleep without it) and on weekends I binge drink through Fridays and Saturdays (in excess of 40 units a night) often spending an afternoon on Sunday in the pub drinking over a roast. I also do narcotics in waves. For example recently I've been doing cocaine on Fridays and Saturdays. I am able to control this very easily and confine it to the weekends only with no discernable urge to do it during the week - thus please correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think this is much of a problem. Obviously my body isn't happy about it but I'm seeking advice on addiction. ..Can anyone give any advice for me? What am I to do? At present I do often think about giving up but then I immediately dismiss it as a silly idea. My whole life revolves around social drinking. FYI I love in London and anyone who has been here will know that social events almost unanimously involve going for a pint or at least sitting in a space where alcohol is normally consumed. I tried to start the gym to give me something to do and I now do yoga on a Monday to try and take my mind off drinking. I also go to the cinema on my own as much as possible and try to avoid drinking but it's difficult to fill every night with excuses NOT to drink!..My worry is that giving up booze would mean my social life would change massively. I have friends amazing wonderful friends who would absolutely still want to go out with me and support me if I tried to give up drinking but I can't help but feel it would change the whole dynamic of my life. I simply cannot imagine a life without drink. When I last went two weeks without booze I found myself to be quite dull. Maybe it was just me but the world seemed a bit grey and bland without it. Even when I felt the positive health benefits of not drinking I felt like a part of me had disappeared. My sense of humour wasn't the same. I didn't feel.. like me? I suppose this comes with having started drinking at 14 and developed alcoholism at 19 (I'm 25 now)...I'm very confused and to be honest just writing this made me feel better. Any advice anyone can dish out would be great...Many many thanks.D..Edit: thank you all from the bottom of my heart for commenting and really changing my perspective on this. I felt so alone before in all of this and knowing that there is a community ready to jump to my aid and provide such valuable advice is so comforting. I wish you all the best and I hope to see you around this community more I'll definitely be sticking around and when I have a little more experience I will be doing my best to return the favour to others as you have done to me...All the best xxxx

When I drink I indulge my self-centeredness.  ..Alcohol fuels my self-indulgence and selfish tendencies.  ..When I was having a "few" glasses of wine every night I may have been physically in the same room with my family however I was *not truly present* ----- I was *Impaired*.  In effect I was *stealing* from my loved ones...What do you want for yourself?
When I was 25 like yourself I too was convinced that I had a special kind of alcoholism that mine was the high functioning kind and that I would continue along with drinking a six pack of strong IPAs every night for the rest of my life. What I learned myself and what I've seen in others since getting sober about two years ago at 29 is that "high functioning" is not a type of alcoholism rather it is a stage of alcoholism and for some it lasts a bit longer than it does in others. I juggled a lot of things with a good amount of success until one day it was all too much. Alcoholism is a progressive illness it is simple physiology that our bodies will require more and more of a substance to achieve the desired effect as time passes and tolerance continues to build. Nobody is immune from this unfortunately. ..Some are able to stop before it gets really bad. I had to experience it myself to be convinced that I absolutely had to stop drinking if I wanted to have a happy successful life. Are you convinced that you need to stop drinking in order to achieve your goals? 
I don't really have any advice just my experience.  I was a daily drinker for many many years and managed to raise a family make it through medical school residency and begin practicing medicine successfully.  Then as life became more taxing and feelings or fear guilt and shame piled up I drank more and more to cover those things up.  I was still functional.  But then it progressed to interfering with the professional and family life all while I was in complete denial.  The day I lost my job I still denied I had a problem.  And the thought of never drinking again terrified me.  For me this disease was progressive.  It never got better only worse with time.  And my attempts to quit on my own failed.  It was only with admitting my problem and accepting outside help that I began to heal physically and emotionally.  I've a ways to go but I feel a hell of a lot better than I did one year ago.  I wish you the best.
In your post read a lot about how alcohol does not *harm* your life -- How does alcohol **enhance** your life? ..I never suffered any tangible consequences of daily drinking. Having lived sober for awhile I am able to see what alcohol was sneakily keeping me from - true enjoyment peace rest meaningful interactions with loved ones *no matter the time of day* and money (my hobbies are way more fun and less a guilty pleasure these days)...I haven't stopped drinking *forever*. I have decided *not to drunk* **today**. ..Have you considered 30/60/90 days without alcohol just to see what abstinence looks and feels like for you? Ultimately only you can decide if some a little or no alcohol is the right choice for you. 
When I was in college I had a brief moment of clarity and was able to see that alcohol and drugs were probably decreasing my quality of life rather than enhancing it. But my grades were good and I was achieving all my goals so I did not see sufficient reason to change. I did things my way for the next 17 years - got married had kids and was tremendously successful in my profession. But my overall enjoyment of life was steadily decreasing all the while. Everything that was truly worthwhile became just another obstacle to be endured until the next time I could get drunk or high. I had everything I was supposed to want but at the end I found myself driving through an ice storm looking for a good bridge to drive off so I could finally end the pain. I decided in that moment that maybe I had a disease that I hadn't treated so I reached out for help. That was 16 years ago. Today I can say unequivocally that I would not trade my worst day sober for my best day drinking. There is so much profound yet subtle beauty in this world that I could never appreciate during all those years I was chasing the perfect buzz. For me the best chemical euphoria is just a cheap imitation of the genuine joy that now get to feel on a regular basis. Yes sometimes I may be less outgoing than I was while drunk but I am always more present and more authentic and I'm not willing to give that up today.
I can relate I have no real answer. But it would seem that you are bothered by your drinking or you would have never ended up here. Feel lucky that you are having this realization now when you can make a change. Many people never get that opportunity. 
Drinking nightly from 24-31 I was able to graduate law school pass the bar run trials all while staying fit dating often purchasing materialistic trivial things etc. ..You are your own man but I warn you it can catch up to you...I've posted my full story if you care to read it.  ..Good luck and I wish you continued success. 
&gt;There are parts of me that want to give up the booze or at least learn to control it somewhat but there is barely any incentive to do so...What are the reasons you might want to give up or control the booze? Is it just the near certainty of health problems later on as you mentioned or are there other reasons?..&gt;I do have depression and anxiety both of which I have managed for around 10 years now..Honest question: Was drinking one of the ways you managed that?..&gt;I can't help but feel it would change the whole dynamic of my life...It is absolutely changing the whole dynamic of my life--some parts of this are challenging right now while other parts the parts I choose to focus on these days are wonderful wonderful changes that make it worth it to me. I have experienced that empty feeling of not feeling quite myself especially a week ago but I'm developing a new normal for myself that I like more. I think it'll be a while before I can be around boozy gatherings with lots of people--Christmas was a challenge so I spent NYE at home. What's working for me right now is taking a break from many things I would normally do. I spend a lot of time on here which helps with the hours when I don't have other satisfying non-drinking activities to distract me...In terms of abuse I inflicted on my body I got away with a lot more 10 years ago than I do now. I know my drinking made that worse. 10 years flew by and what I wouldn't give to have made the changes I'm making now 10 years ago instead. But at the time I didn't suffer as much because of it. And so it goes...Thank you for sharing your story with us. I wish you all the best.
I experienced that alcoholism is a progressive disease.  It only gets worse.  When my consequences were not yet convincing I kept drinking until they were too painful to bear and I had to stop.  Quitting before desparation is quite extraordinary.  Beat wishes to you in being able to stop before your misery forces you to.
I too felt for a long time like drinking was a huge part of my social life (indeed - I have social anxiety so I was convinced I needed  alcohol in order to have friends). ..I never lost a job due to drinking. I never hurt anyone. I wasn't the "skid row" type drinking out of a paper bag on the street. so what was the problem?..I agree with another commenter that "high functioning alcoholic" is a stage not a type. 20 years from now if I'd kept drinking what would it look like?..I'm 29 now and I quit because I could start to see that my "yets" were getting closer. I didn't have a DUI - yet. But I was starting to drive drunk a lot more. I didn't lose my job - yet. But I was calling out "sick" (drunk) a lot more. I didn't lose any friends yet. But I wasn't talking to them either. When I started blacking out more often and contemplating suicide almost every time I drank I knew it was about time to stop. ..Whatever you decide to do - it's great that you're thinking critically about your drinking. I hope you find the answers you're looking for! 
Self knowledge won't save us. I knew what I was (also high functioning straight A college student got a good job in my field before I even graduated etc.). Then I stopped being high functioning and got chronic and pathetic. You don't have to bottom out you can beat the system by quitting while you still have control. Life is duller but you don't have the lows you know. I think if you're positing here you must want to quit at some level. Good luck!
You're only high functioning until you aren't... and it WILL end. Trust me. Your story is so similar to mine. I am 27. Stopped drinking at 26. It wasn't until I turned 25 that I started getting sloppy. I thought I was invincible or special or just REALLY knew how to handle my alcohol... I always did well at work had a great social life awesome relationships always on top of my shit... then one day I woke up to my boss slamming his hands on my desk as I had passed out drunk on the sales floor in the middle of the day (long story short). I still didn't quit (well I did for a month after that). And things got progressively worse. My advice: quit while you're ahead. Non-alcoholics don't ask themselves constantly if they have a problem. If that thought is on your mind often you probably do. I wish you all the best of luck and hope you're able to make the choice that's best for you. We are always here to help. 
Alcoholism for me was a disease of selfishness. It did not matter the risks I put on my job or life (being hungover/drunk for work) because I could function. People had a hard time discerning between the two besides the fact that I was more social outgoing and adventurous when I was influenced or recently influenced. ..My biggest advice is find a reason to quit. I ended up slipping on ice bouncing my head of the sidewalk and saved by the police. I realized I'm just endangering myself. I didn't think I drank more than usual and I probably didn't but things got out of hand obviously...After waking up in detox because of a high BAC (which I asked NOT to know) the doctor told me he couldn't tell if I was acting strange because of the high alcohol content or head trauma. Throughout the next week I decided I wanted more to life. I want to have goals of travel hobbies (probably leather work or wood working) and become the fun me while sober. Or at least find out the best of sober me...TL;dr if you want to quit find a reason to quit. We all thought we were functioning alcoholics.
As to the social aspect it is well-proven that behaviors are catching both positive and negative. So maybe right now your entire social life revolves around alcohol. But if you opt out of that system and create new social events you may find a lot of friends follow you. I have noticed when I do not drink my family is much more likely to drink less or even not drink at all (temporarily). 
How about your kidneys and liver?  That's incentive.  You don't wanna be 40 on a transplant list.
