Do you get those? How do you deal with them?..I've been sober for over 5 weeks now (and before the last relapse I was sober for over 3 months) and I still get those friday night urges. They usually come around 4pm on friday when work is almost over and when I know I could afford to be hungover all weekend. ..I look at where I could drink and drug but then I think about the consequences and I don't use. Is it normal to still have those urges? Anyway I'm still sober and I will wake up tomorrow with a clear head and without any regrets.

Totally get the same thing. Find if I can get past 4pm to 6 pm the rest of the evening is somewhat easier but those 2 hours felt like 2 days today. 
Have lots of food on hand. I find I don't wanna drink on a full stomach.
I wasn't really a weekend warrior type drinker it was all the time. Just wanted to say its all about changing habits. Stick with it and i'm sure you'll have a positive outlook on your weekend. Nice job on your 5 weeks you should be proud you're gonna do another weekend sober.
Got a strong urge for a few beers cause I've been good this month.  Pulled in the parking lot of my dive bar but was like fuck this and drove off.  Went home and took my dogs for a walk. 
I just have nothing else to do. I worked my ass off all week  all my pals are meeting up right now then going to the bar and I am at home pacing around my apartment trying to resist the urge to crack a beer. Im going to cave in about 10 minutes. Only 6 days in.
