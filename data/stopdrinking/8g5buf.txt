When I was drinking I struggled with words I knew how to spell often but now that I'm over 100 days the problem has subsided and I don't feel like an idiot anymore. ..Has anyone else overcome this issue or something similar?..IWNDWYT.

Not since they invented this autocorrect. It makes me say stuff I didn't nintendo. 
I used to struggle with even thinking of words! Like I knew what I wanted to say but couldn't articulate myself. I'm doing much better with my vocabulary now and probably wouldn't be so bad at spelling if I didn't recently install the Grammarly plugin on my laptop haha
My issue was numbers. I think it is getting better...? I don't know too early to tell. Anyone with issues doing simple math operations while drinking? I started having a tough time doing tips at restaurants for awhile 
Are you kidding? 205 days sober and it still takes me a half hour to compose a one paragraph reply to emails at work because I go back and re-read what I just typed and say "Dafuq did I just read??" and have to go back and re-phrase it.
