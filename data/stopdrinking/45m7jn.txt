Still no solid sleep still a little bit of anxiety but the last two days have felt... amazing. I've cried shook and been scared of shadows and everyone tells me that it gets easier and I'm sure that's true but this morning I woke up with a realization; even if it was always this hard it's better than drinking. My body might hurt and my mind might race but I feel in control for the first time in my  life. I would take this sharp pain that's my own over the dull numb of drinking any day. That being said I can't wait for these withdrawals to leave me I've decided to not pick up my Librium prescription. I wanna feel it. Sorry guys just rambling I know but I gotta post here to stay busy. Thanks for everything SD.

Librium does help.  I understand the shaking and all that and it really didn't help me sleep but I didn't have night terrors.  
That realization is a good place to get to. Like land coming into view when you've been at sea too long or something. Keep on! 
It's very empowering to slay this dragon! Good for you!
If your withdrawal is waning and you have a history of abusing benzos I think I'd forget about picking them up. It doesn't sound like you need them unless you have a history of seizures. .Thanks for your post. It gets better every day so hang on!
Glad you are working it.  I stay here a lot too right now.  Good therapy.
