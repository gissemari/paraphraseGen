I do not know how to be honest with myself. For some reason I think I can moderate. I only had one glass of wine on Thanksgiving. I only had two glasses of wine the Friday after Thanksgiving.....My oldest went back to college on Saturday hubby had to work my youngest (he is an adult) was playing video games....my football team was playing a big game.....I DRANK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF WINE! Ugggghhhhhhhh......what the hell is wrong with me?? Oh yeah I remember I have a problem....I feel so alone :( hubby gets disappointed BUT stops short of agreeing with me that I have to stop. See I think if I stop he thinks he will have to stop and he likes his occasional scotch beer or whatever.....this wouldn't be the case. I have never told him he had to stop. It's my problem. I appreciate his support but I don't think he understands the struggle. He doesn't get addicted to anything. He could have several beers right now and not touch the stuff for 6 months. Sorry for rambling on and on....I just know that SD understands how extremely hard this is :( So disappointed in myself.......here's to starting over AGAIN......

So yeah: you can't moderate. And your hubby can. It's not fair...But you know it and that's good. You can't moderate. But you can abstain and be fine. That's what I do.
It's the same with me. I can do one glass but the next day it's 2 or 3 and after that the sky's the limit. So after learning the same lesson many times I am trying to not drink that one glass. For me that is really going to be the only way maybe for you too.  And I also have a  normie  spouse who will have 1 or 2 every few days but never more. So I just have to accept that we are made of different cloth! Best wishes to you!
Same here as you know I can't moderate and have to be honest without has been great with some set backs and romancing about wine. But this holiday was better then the past I REMEMERED IT and no... do you remember what you said/did; or hangover....I have to say I am married to a normie too and get jealous....as I still do miss my wine friend....IWNDWYT
Unfortunately you are probably a part of the 7% of the population that doesn't have the "off-switch" that your husband does. Join the club! I spent years fooling myself with the illusion of moderation. The only way I was able to escape the slavery of alcohol was embrace the fact that booze simply could not be a part of my life.
The very next time you're faced with the option to drink don't. Just don't. And as soon as you pass up that drink imagine a little counter in your head that ticks off a 1 to 0 score.  You're now winning.  You'll have more opportunities to score points later maybe even as early as tomorrow. But when the next opportunity arises refuse that drink as well and notice your counter go to 2 to 0. So far so good. You're refusing one drink at a time one day at a time. Do not start worrying about how difficult it will be to stop drinking because you've just shown yourself twice that you have power over alcohol and not the other way around. It's a slow and steady journey so relax. ..And it's okay to lie about why you're not drinking today. Say I'm gonna pass today my stomach has been fucked up all day. Or say I still haven't recovered from yesterday haha (other alcoholics will understand your trying to sober up for at least a day). The point is no one cares if you don't drink. It's quite often the opposite that's true: your loved ones will respect your decision and probably respect you for your courage. Be honest if you're comfortable and say Ya know I'm cutting back this month. Then say the same thing next month.  Only you know the truth: you're not cutting back for a month you're quitting forever. You've had your last hangover and you're going g to feel great about it.  There's nothing to regret. You'll lose nothing but weight. You'll get your life back. ..I won't drink with you today. And together we will not drink tomorrow.
It was a struggle until I laid down my sword and shield...I realized that I'm more powerful than ALL the alcohol in the world *outside my body*.  I accepted that after the *first* glass of wine alcohol is more powerful than my will alone.  ..I got support.  Alcohol can't beat me + my support network!
Hey welcome back :) I think for me things changed a little bit when I started feeling the good parts of not drinking (like beautiful mornings! No hangovers! Not being obsessed with drinking all the time!) and then I stopped feeling like not drinking was my punishment for being a bad drinker. Like when I actually started to ENJOY not drinking. But yea it took me awhile to get to that point can imagine it would be even tougher when someone else is drinking in your home. Anyway I hope you aren't beating yourself up too much it's a process! We are all here for ya &lt;3
Do you listen to recovery podcasts? I find them super helpful.  The Unruffled Recovery Elevator Since Right Now are a few I like. ..Also - once I really accepted that there was nothing for me at the end of a wine bottle I began to get curious about what my life might be like with 90 days 6 months a year sober.  What if it was really cool?! Then I didn't want to relapse anymore because I knew what drinking a bottle of wine did to my life...but the other path was a complete mystery.  Turns out it's pretty great!
