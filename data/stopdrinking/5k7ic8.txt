Stay sober today! Don't undo all your hard work!  If you're struggling just take a second to remember the first two weeks...do you wanna do that hell again? Nope...

Merry Christmas to you too!..Happy Hanukkah! ..Happy Yule! ..Happy Solstice! ..Happy Boxing Day! ..Happy Kwanzaa!..I know I'm early/late on some and probably missed many others.  But no matter what you celebrate  I wish you nothing but joy peace and of course sobriety. .
