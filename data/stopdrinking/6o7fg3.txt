I can't believe it! It has gone so slowly and yet so fast. It feels like I've been dong this forever and yet it is the slightest fraction of the time I spent drinking...I was one of the ones that suffered quite a bit of PAWS (Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. Read about it here: https://www.elementsbehavioralhealth.com/addiction-resources/drug-addiction-resources/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome-stages-symptoms/ )..So it's been a bit of a drag. ..I feel much better now though! My energy is better the mental fog is lifting and I am not as spaced out tired and emotional as I was although I am taking care to be aware that I might experience PAWS symptoms in the future and be ready for it...I am now somebody who doesn't drink which is nice. I am not struggling with drinking anymore those thoughts went away after about week 2. This is my new normal...My sleep is great. My skin looks better (even liver/age spots I had on my legs are fading) my hair has thickened right up my anxiety is nearly non-existent! (I had a presentation today of my work/research and it went spectacularly well!)..The positives are too many to count and I can't wait t discover more of them as each sober milestone goes by...Thanks for being there throughout the journey each and every one of you. I couldn't have done it without you!..Take care all :D
