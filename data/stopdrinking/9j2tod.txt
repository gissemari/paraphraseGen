In my previous life i used to enjoy going to a pub close to home where they made a pizza that i just adored (prosciutto and goat cheese). Mind you back then the principal reason for going to that pub was for the wine and beer and the pizza came in second. A few days ago i remembered the excellent taste of that pizza and decided to go to that same pub. I sat down at the bar ordered my delicious pizza and a large glass of lemonade and ate the whole thing. Not one minute did i think about drinking other than my lemonade and i left the place fully content. While eating i heard the barman talking to a fellow employee and saying how much he had drank the night before and how sick he was the next day. Hearing that reconfirmed my decision that alcohol has left my life and will never return. Yes one has to keep vigilant in regard to alcohol relapse but i have this firm voice inside me saying that this is such a better way to live life to its fullest...The other thing that I realized is that when I was drinking my sexual drive was very low and it feels so good to know that it is coming back to its full potential. What else will i discover about me as time goes by into my sobriety. I don't know but it sounds real exciting. I feel so much in line with living my life in accordance with my true being. I am blessed by so much right now. You should see the smile on my face..IWNDWYT

Excellent! Well done. That pizza sounds awesome as does 13 months.
I was reading about how we get a brand new body every 7 years since our cells all turn over in that time.  I like that thought!  IWNDWYT
