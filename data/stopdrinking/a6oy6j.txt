I hate the relapse dream.  Funny part is that in the dream my primary worry was about picking up my AA slip chip. Did I mention I hate that dream?

I had one the other day! I think they are sent as a reminder of how disappointed we would be if we had to reset. Nothing better than realizing it was just a dream tho. Have a great day.
Sometimes I fear that all is in vain. Sometimes I fear it was all just a dream. But if it was it would have been the best dream in a decade. IWNDWYT 
Stress brings them on for me.
I learn soooo much from those dreams
