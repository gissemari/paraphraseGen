      I have been drinking for about 5 years. Not the longest but enough to know I'm wrong. I recently quit for several months but I've started again. I won't blame it on pain or anything else going on in my life because there's plenty I could try to blame it on. It's me. I'm just ready to quit and I almost forget how good it was not drinking. ..      I'm dying to take the first step again (getting off work and not getting beer on the way home). I just don't know what I'm supposed to tell myself. It's so dumb that I can't just say "OK step 1 don't buy beer". It's a problem and I'm struggling. I'm desperate at this point to pull it together. I'm at a really crucial time in my life.

You can do it!..Could you take a different route home from work so as not to pass the booze shop? Perhaps check in here right before you leave to re-affirm the commitment?..All of us here started with a Day 1 and you've done it before so you can do it again.....Here's a couple of resources which helped me stop and *stay* stopped and made the transition a lot easier:..The book and YouTube Channel [*This Naked Mind*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4KpBxerD_BIksjUfUT4hVw/videos) are fantastic and helped me enormously... ..The book [Alcohol Explained](http://alcoholexplained.com/about-alcohol-explained/) explains alcohol and alcoholism from a chemical physiological and psychological standpoint and is very enlightening indeed.....Perhaps you could spend the evening reading/watching some of that accompanied by lashings of fizzy water or your favourite non-alcoholic beverage and some really yummy food......Hope that helps!..I'm not drinking today would love you to join me.....Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Welcome Pud!  Getting booze on the way home from work was a big trigger for me. Had no choice but to drive past the stores. As soon as I get off work I first treat myself to a hot chocolate (high sugar content that I never imbibe in normally) or a fancy latte a smoothie etc. I sip it as I drive and enjoy the treat instead of white knuckling it home. Sometimes I even look at the stores salute it with my drink and let my Zombie brain acknowledge that it ain't gonna be gettin' anything from there anymore. Take *that* Zombie...time to make new connections in my brain!..I will not drink with y'all today.   within
