As an alcoholic that sees people I care about struggling with me is there anyway I can convince them al anon is something they need to look into?
----------immediate responses--------

For many years now I've though about al anon or AA...as I've gotten older my social anxieties and low self esteem ends up preventing me to go to such things.  I am a veteran with a diagnoses of PTSD and some days it's just hard to even leave home.  That's why I'm so grateful for this page!  
Hmm maybe you could just ask your loved ones if they are interested in it &amp; provide some contact info for a group meeting or links to info online if they are?  That is the move I would make. Best wishes to you.

I would get some pamphlets explaining the program and give them to the friends and family who are struggling. 
I should have gone before my first sip. The alcoholics around me ultimately lead to me drinking. You have to protect yourself first to be there for somebody else. My friend's husband would go once per week with his mom because his dad was an alcoholic. My friend hated it and thought it was ridiculous...because she had a lot of issues with alcohol.
