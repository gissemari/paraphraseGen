And my brother had got me some fine beers...And I thought "Oh"...Because I hadn't felt a need to mention I wasn't drinking before now. But it was all good of course. He was not offended when I explained. And I did not touch a single one. It was just . . . there it was beer that was mine. ..And once again I wonder to myself "Why is it that I've decided not to drink again?"..I still struggle with answering that question sometimes. But then again I struggle with answering a lot of questions I'm a pretty existential guy haha...Whether or not I *need* to be sober I know this sobriety thing still has some experiences to offer. So I *choose* to be sober...If anyone is wondering I'll be turning 22.
