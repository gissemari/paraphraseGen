This is actually the first time I'm happy to return to zero and rejoin the community. I don't mean I was unhappy trying to be sober before but actually excited to start over. ..I have always been struggling with alcohol since my first 4 year relationship ended with my SO cheating on me after we switched to long distance when I graduated college. A mix of naturally binge drinking in college at parties when I moved across the country with no friends and family for thousands of miles the only thing I could cling to that had any resemblance of where I had come from was the relationship and the knowledge that in one more semester I would be back together with her. Well long story short that didn't happen obviously. I now found myself in TX with a brand new career and no one familiar. ..So what do you do to meet people?? Well obviously go out and see who's at the local bar. It started off slow but then the addiction turned exponential. Blackouts became a regular occurrence. Lost a job a couple times because I hated being up in the mornings. Eventually a DUI. The happy go lucky partier slowly morphed into a depressed introverted person. I couldn't understand it. I started lurking around AA and r/stropdrinking. To me this was just to remind me to not let it get out of control...Moved to Seattle to follow another long term relationship. Then that fell apart as well. Alcohol had a bit to do with it but we just weren't right for each other. Anyway as we started having problems that exponential addiction would return. Anytime I felt that I was about to lose the only thing familiar to me I would quickly be back to blackout nightly. I still couldn't understand it. I rationalized it with  Well I just need to find a relationship that works and I'll be fine.   Just go out. Stay subbed to r/stopdrinking and be careful.  To me that was the only way to get back into the dating game. I mean you can't take a woman to a non-alcoholic date as an adult right? That's what middle schoolers do because they aren't old enough.  I'm an attractive guy with a great career making plenty of money. How could drinks at a bar with a girl (or new friends) take me down?  Is what I told myself frequently. With every new person that entered my life it just got worse. I needed to be seen as the cool calm friend that anyone could come to! How am I supposed to be that guy for my new friends if I can't handle a stupid drink??..This is where things started spiraling out of control. I was starting to get embarrassing in public. Falling asleep in bars. Getting kicked out. Getting into fights etc. People didn't want to go out with me anymore. I was doing so many stupid things. Blacked out every date or night out. I don't know how I didn't kill myself by accident...I wanted to fit in somewhere so bad after all the moves breakups job changes etc that I was asking people to go out with me almost every single night. I would quickly get hammered to get rid of the feeling that I didn't belong here and so that would make me more chatty and not boring...As things just went completely down the drain I finally said  Ok. I'm going to listen to the audio book that everyone keeps talking about but I'm not going to quit drinking. I need to be able to find friends since I'm new in town. This will just be another nudge to keep me on the right side!  That book was  This Naked Mind ...I was completely blown away! The information about the science and marketing behind the alcohol industry was disgusting to me. At the same time I couldn't believe that I had fallen for a marketing ploy!!! I'm a fucking construction project manager. How the fuck could I fall for something like this? I laugh at all the stupid commercials boasting sales and discounts. There's no way I fall for any of that crap. When she started describing that the alcohol industry advertises exactly like the tobacco industry did before they were basically outlawed completely blew my mind! In middle school health  we learned that tobacco used strategies like making smoking look cool or a social thing. We all knew to not let cigarette companies fool us with those strategies. This was drilled into my mind and I never picked up a cigarette! How did I fall for this from the alcohol industry when I already knew better?!..After hearing these comparisons I started thinking back to my introduction to alcohol. In order to be social in college you had to be cool. To be cool you needed to show that you could drink. The alcohol loves that message and pumps that hard into everything! Commercial after commercial where if you want to be in a social setting and be cool you better have a drink in your hand. And I fell for it. College graduate project manager that always laughed at how dumb marketing was was tricked into thinking the only way I'll be able to hang out with people is if I can drink. My mind morphed into equating having a drink to being with company...This was the final thing I needed to hear. It made so much sense. That's why I'm so excited this time. I can't believe I fell for the same lies my ancestors did with cigarettes. I was smarter then them. I was supposed to already know the tricks they used!..The motivation I needed was to be furious with myself for allowing myself to be taken advantage of. Fuck that. IWNDWYT!
