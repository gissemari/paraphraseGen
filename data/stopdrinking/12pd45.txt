I read Carr's book just over 2 months ago. It made total sense to me and I stopped drinking. I had no regrets. I feel great. My family is happy I am happy and  everything has been going great. I hurt my back a week or so ago and was prescribed some pain meds. Without even thinking about it I took the prescribed dose. Whoa...felt high as a kite. I didn't abuse it. I just followed the prescription period for the week. The back pain is gone and so are the pills. But now an old feeling is back. I want to feel high. The little voice is telling me "hey maybe you can have a drink once in a while. Look how well you've done you deserve it. A reward." ..It was shocking how easy the first month and half was. Now I am sitting here just craving something like I quit yesterday.  Just typing this I feel my mind making all sorts of excuses as to why i deserve a drink. ugh Why do I want to poison myself. ..Thanks for hearing me out. I just needed to vent.

Uhg.  It's a good warning to be wary of other intoxicants.  Thank you...You aren't asking for advice but let me suggest to picture what would happen if you had that drink.  Do the "play it forward" thing.  ..You got through it before you will get through it now...Be well.
Funny how the poison is the reward :/ the crazy passes. Even when it's so strong it's total... Why? Meh... at the end of the day doesnt matter as long as my sober head touches that pillow
