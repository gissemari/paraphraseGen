It's not the day I stopped drinking but is the day I decided I had to stop for good. I made it about three days counting the hours. It had been several years since I had more than one day off in a row. I went to a 4th of July party said I wouldn't drink but accepted a beer anyway. Later at the party found the hard stuff in the kitchen to get to that 10 drink plateau. Restarted the addiction for another one and a half years. The next time I tried to stop it was immensely more difficult but I have made it so far...To everyone who is just beginning a sobriety program and to those who will be paying extra attention during the 4th holiday activities think about everything you've achieved and the good things to come. Remember your friends and family are proud of you for being alcohol free even if they might not always say it. And there are people you don't know about who are struggling with their own alcohol use and see you as an inspiration. .

I'm genuinely curious do you remember what you thought/felt when you were offered and accepted that beer? 
Congratulations on nearly 600 days
