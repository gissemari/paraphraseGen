Anyone else here use ibotta? For reference it's essentially a coupon app. I love it but was struggling with the massive amount of coupons for alcohol. Turns out if you click on your account -&gt; settings you can scroll down and turn off ads and coupons for alcohol! You'll have to restart the app but it has made shopping a whole lot easier for me :)

Thanks for sharing. Similarly any time that an ad for alcohol shows up on Facebook or Instagram I mark it as not relevant.
Yes!! I was hoping there was a way to hide them too.  Towards the end of my drunk ass fall I justified buying pinnacle vodka 3x a week because it almost  paid for itself.   Hahahahaha that was a good mind trick I was playing on myself 
Thanks for sharing!
