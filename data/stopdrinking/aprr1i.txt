Last year I stayed sober for the first five months before I kept relapsing back into old habits. My 32nd birthday was my first sober one in many years but this time around I want my 33rd year of life to be fully sober. No excuses that something will be better with alcohol (it won't) or that it's OK to have alcohol maybe once a month or less (because I can't moderate)...IWNDWYT..Helen :)
