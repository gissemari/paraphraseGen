90 days ago picked up a DUI and then posted here b/c I was freaking out.  I got some great advice some good words of wisdom and support and all of it helped.  It has been 90 days without a drink and things are going pretty good.  I've decided that day was my bottom..I lurk here a bunch but don't post much but I figured I'd say thanks.  So - thanks to everyone and to those who are struggling - keep fighting and find a meeting - its worth it.  To all those with tons of time who post keep it up too...It is always welcome.

Congratulations! 
I got a DUI yesterday at 2 in the morning. Reading through your previous post really helped me out. I hope in 88 days to be like you. 
Really glad you're doing better.  I hit my low point two weeks ago so I know how it feels.  Please keep us posted and keep fighting the good fight.  Have a great day!
Happy (re) birthday to us. 90 days checking in. ..Glad things are going better and like you I appreciate what's happening on this subreddit and all who contribute stories requests for help and advice.

My second DUI was my rock bottom.  .A DUI can still be difficult after conviction if you end up with court ordered therapy and other responsibilities. I made a post a few days ago that wasn't well received because I was very bitchy resentful and defensive in it. I poorly posted and focused on the wrong things rather than addressing my main question on how to cope and ask for real advice on dealing with the sadness that I was experiencing.  .However feel free to message me at any time with questions concerns or feelings. Life is so much better after quitting and everything is manageable.  .Best of luck in your continued state!
