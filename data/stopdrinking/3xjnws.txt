I have the BIGGEST headache. When you don't want to be somewhere maintaining a happy sociable appearance is just so exhausting. I still struggle with festive situations. I feel very dull / stuck up although I've said nothing derogatory. I wanted to let my significant other have a decent time. Everyone was just so drunk. There was no food and the music was obnoxiously loud. I wanted to check in but couldn't find any service...My spouse decided to smoke a cigarette. Now he thinks I'm mad at him. He told me he was going outside to "be bad". I said that's a stupid idea. Situations like these are the reason he's had to quit smoking like three times. It's his decision whatever. I said I was tired and we got out of there after like five flipping Mountain Dews. Now I'm home and he's telling me random drunken fun facts (my patience is dwindling). I just want to eat something relieve my hangryness and go to bed...On the bright side someone who knows my story said she was proud of me even though she misses my jello shots. That felt sort of nice and I went home with a bag of candy from the Yankee Swap...That fulfills my Holiday Party quota. I'm done for 2015.

Good job! Try to do something "nice"  for your self as a reward. 
I feel your pain. Socializing will never be the same. Gone are the carefree days where I would stay until the end of the party (or when the booze ran out). Parties now take so much damn effort. Add in having to deal with your drunk spouse....blech. Painful night but hey you did it sober and that's always a victory in itself.
