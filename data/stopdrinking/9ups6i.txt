All I could think about on the bus home was a cool pint (or 5) with my mates. I'm home now gonna head to the gym and shake it off. Here's to hoping that the struggle becomes less intense.

Not worth it. IWNDWYT. You're not alone!
Shake it off man! The feeling you'll get from working out will be much more satisfying than the feeling you'd get from drinking
