Doing a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was one of the most helpful tools for solidifying and maintaining my motivation during the first few weeks of sobriety. This week's meeting exercise was a CBA. It was interesting to compare my CBAs done almost two months apart. There are both big differences and very little change...The biggest difference comes from my current mental and emotional state. While I was drinking I did not realize the costs that I was incurring. I still have a lot of work to do but I am becoming better person--much more productive focused learning to experience and cope with my emotions and seeing mindfulness practice pay off. These gains things I did not understand two months ago would be the hardest to lose if I relapsed...I also realized how much I miss the buzz. Not the drink-til-I-can-sleep non-coping but the hours where I got the dosage right and rode the crest of the happy uninhibited goofy ride. I've had euphoria without alcohol but not as many. The lows are much better though. It is like shoveling down the chemically induced high points and using that to fill the deeper potholes...There was little difference in the perceived benefits to drinking. Socializing over beers was a primary benefit. As costs to not drinking those factors have not been as important as I perceived them to be. ..If you are interested here's a [CBA worksheet](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/library/Tools_and_Homework/Quick_Reference/CBA_Worksheet.pdf) and an [explanation of how to use it](http://www.slideshare.net/SMARTRecovery/cba-the-costbenefit-analysis). I had not planned on a  60 days  post but ended up with one. Thanks to everyone here for helping me through the last two months. Lurking and listening has been a huge help.
