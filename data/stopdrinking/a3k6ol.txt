Today has been the hardest day I've battled since starting this round of sobriety. It was all I could do to not stop at the liquor store on my way home. Today was the last time I'll see the therapist I've been with for two and a half years. She's helped me through so many relapses highs lows everything. I spent about an hour crying after I left her office. All I want to do is drink and forget about it all. But I know I can't do it because she would be disappointed. I just want to not want to drink.

I'm sorry that sounds really tough to lose somebody that helps you so much. Hang in there.  I hope they made some good referrals for you. I will not drink with you today.
I'm sorry. I hate when that happens. When my psychiatrist lest I cried too. Getting comfortable with a therapist or doctor takes so much time. I don't like starting with a new one. ..Drinking of course was never the answer. Somehow I survived with the help of AA friends. 
I'm sorry. I had a therapist retire and was so bummed for the reasons you describe. But the next one brought fresh perspectives and got me jumpstarted in new ways. I hope your new one is helpful and if not there are great ones out there. ..I will not drink with you today. Hugs. 
My wife went through the same thing although not needing to be a sobernaut like us. She had never opened up with anyone like that. Her therapist had a lap dog she loved.  It was heart breaking trying to comfort her through that.
