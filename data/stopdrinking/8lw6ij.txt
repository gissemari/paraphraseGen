I'm 6 days away from a year here at SD.  Lurking on this sub and occasionally chiming in has been my only support system.  ..When I started I had the goal of making it one week.  Then one month.  Then one year.  I'm so close and I should be happy about that but right now I just feel like sabotaging this whole thing.  I don't even know why I keep up with it at this point.  ..I quit to feel better.  And I guess I feel better but honestly it's hard to tell.  I should be waiting until my badge says 365 days because it's a nice round number but I think celebrating at 359 makes more sense.  It reflects the struggle to make it to 365 and honestly the struggle is the most apparent aspect of not drinking.  Next year I'll be looking for new things to keep me going.  My wife and I are going to have our first kid in November so right now that's my main motivation.

A new kid is a very worthy motivation! Congratulations on 359 days. ..Why did you stop drinking in the first place? 
Please don't do it. Please. You have come so far and done so well and I am so proud of you for that. Poison in a bottle is no way to celebrate. IWNDWYT 
Has it helped your depression?.Please keep going!!!
