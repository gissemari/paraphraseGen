I guess going from zero to eight with zero tolerance = getting really sick. Coffee Ground Blood sounds dangerous.  I'd go to the Dr. and find out what that was about.  Welcome back.  Do you remember what the trigger was after 8 months sober?  I won't drink with you today.  
I would definitely get checked out.
