Is it common to be very depressed after being sober for a while
----------immediate responses--------

I think so you may want to see if you can find some hobbies to give you a sense of purpose.  Whether it be something as simple as sketching a half hour a day or helping to cook a loved one a meal etc.  It is quite common for someone who is depressed or have depressive tendencies to use alcohol to cope.  Do you recall having any of these feeling while you were still drinking?
Crazy as it sounds an alcoholic lifestyle is still a life. You're used to it and was quite good at it...I had to find something to replace it myself.
I don't think it's uncommon 
I felt terrible after my first month! You'll get through it though. Remember drinking will only make that worse!
