I used to not like how AA was portrayed in Pixar's "Finding Nemo". I thought it was a way to poke fun at the program especially when Bruce the shark was relapsing and his friend said "he's really a nice guy. He just never new his father!" ..But there is some really deep meaning in Pixar's portrayal of alcoholism and addiction...First off Pixar uses sharks to represent the alcoholic. Sharks are demonized as the #1 creature to be fearful of in the ocean. They're mean and should be avoided at all cost. This is the stigma that our society has towards alcoholics. ..I find it beautiful that Bruce the shark approaches Nemo's dad and Dory because they were both lost and scared in the big ocean. He recognizes their fear and brings them to a meeting with other sharks who are lost and scared. Nemo's dad is very fearful at the meeting and obviously doesn't want to be there. One of the other sharks even brings a sick and scared green fish who is literally shaking with fear and eventually finds a way to leave the meeting just like so many of us in AA have done in early sobriety. ..When Dory is hit by the scuba goggles and starts bleeding Bruce's addiction is triggered and he falls into a relapse and becomes very violent selfish and uncontrollable. This is Bruce's pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization that is stated in the Big Book's "More on Alcoholism" chapter. As Bruce chases his new found friends further and further away from him he triggers an underwater mine that he had warned Nemo's dad and Dory about before the meeting even started. Once the first mine detonates it sets off a huge chain of destruction in his path. This symbolism hits very close to home for me...It isn't until the end of the movie where we see Bruce again. Nemo and his father are reunited and the movie starts to come to a close. We see Bruce who is look happy joyous and free as he helps Dory get to where she needs to be. Bruce finds his serenity by helping Dory through the simple act of working with others. ..For anyone who has read the Big Book this movie is a joy to watch and to take something from. I just wanted to point out these few things that are beautiful in such a charming film...Hope you're all having a wonderful weekend.

&gt;This is the stigma that our society has towards alcoholics...I find that when I self-stigmatize myself others do the same. Getting into recovery has shown me that I am POWERFUL and can take responsiblity for myself and my life...I also believe that the stigma towards mental illness is getting better at least in my neck of the woods. I also don't get angry or upset when someone stigmatizes me: I ask them questions about where their ideas come from.
