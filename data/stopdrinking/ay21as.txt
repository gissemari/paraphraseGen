I'm really struggling and I really didn't think it would be this hard. I know moderation won't work for me. Lord knows I've tried it in the past. All of the rules and stipulations that I inevitably ignore when I go passed beer four. ..Still it's tempting to think that maybe this time will be different maybe I will be able to control myself this time. I want my dive bar I want my bar friends I want my fucking miller lites. Why is it so hard to remember the shame and the hurt when the sun is shining and you are three days sober? Am I really never going to be able to drink again? What about  wine because no good night ever started with a salad ? ..I didn't think I was actually addicted I just thought I was kind of dependent or a general  problem drinker . But this feels a lot like quitting nicotine too much so. Especially the way that little voice is trying to convince me it's okay to have just the one more. Why do I want it so much? What did it ever *actually* bring to the table?..IWNDWYT but please send encouragement for tomorrow.

Ok pump the brakes on the struggle bus. ..First off it is totally normal to be struggling only two days in. Good for you though. Many can't get past day 1. This will get better but time takes time. ..The first week was the hardest physically. It's going to suck. So buckle down and embrace the suck. Own it and realize the suck is you beginning to heal. ..I was and still am struggling with the concept of never again. I'm getting there though. ..I had good success setting limited timeframes. I started with a 30 day challenge. Told myself I could drink again after 30 days if I wanted to. Turns out that at the end of the 30 I was in a pretty good place was really looking at my relationship with booze and decided to keep going. ..For the next week I had huge anxiety. I finally figured out it was because never again was so disquieting for me. So I set a new date of May 1. Will not drink before then. Anxiety disappeared and I'm right back on track. On May 1 I will reconsider my decision and decide again. Already know I am going to keep going. ..I find that having a plan with dates gives me a concrete goal I can break down into achievable steps. It's really working for me. Already thinking next date is 1 year. ..It's hard to see right now because you are deep in the suck but please believe that this phase passes quickly. The benefits are immeasurable. My life is 1000% better than it was 59 days ago. And all I have to do is not drink. ..Embrace the suck and get on with it. Gaining space will allow you to rationally look at addiction for what it is. You can strip out the nostalgia and addict think and begin to make positive life choices. ..Sorry this is a bit long but getting through the first 10 days is really important. It was for me anyways. ..Wishing you strength and resolve. ..Look after yourself and good luck. 
You mentioned "wine because no good night ever started with a salad".  Are you sure ?  How many bad nights started with a glass of wine ?  The point being is that you make a good night/day with what you do not what you ingest.  ..
