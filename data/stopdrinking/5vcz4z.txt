Hey Sobernauts..So I'm a 39-year-old guy in decent health (now) who had a particularly nasty drinking habit in the last few years. Let's say from mid-2012 to well December 2 2016 because that was the last day I took a drink...I've done this before -- the first time I got sober was on January 1 2010 which I managed to maintain until you guessed it mid-2012. When I got sober that time it was the end of a gradually but steadily intensifying habit that had begun when I was 19. But it was remarkably easy...This time I've needed a lot more help. I'm fortunate enough to have been able to afford a therapist to be on great insurance which has paid for a psychiatrist (to help deal with underlying issues) and an outpatient program plus Vivitrol. I even have a supportive and understanding wife. I understand that as far as all that goes I've got it really good...Anyway I struggled to get sober for months and then as I described it in group one day there was just a kind of "click" in my head one night. I'm not sure how else to describe it. There was a "click" (yes almost like a sound) and I knew that that was the start of me getting sober. Crazy right? I know. But after like nine months of fighting like a bastard and getting nowhere I'll take some voodoo bullshit any day...So now I'm 79 days in and I'm not going to lie this time has been much harder than the last one. I'm sure there are a hundred reasons for that ranging from age to intensity of drinking et cetera. At first I had the "pink glow" thing going for about two or three weeks. I felt great started exercising lost a ton of beer bloat yadda yadda. And then a big round of depression hit. Not "feeling sad" or "regretful about my drinking" but true depression: unable to concentrate feeling totally empty and so forth. And I got past that too...And now I'm in a weird and unpleasant "stage" that is unlike anything I've experienced before and I'm wondering: a) if anyone else here has experienced it b) if anyone has any explanation for it and c) if anyone has any advice or encouraging things to say about it...Simply put I'm having a hard time with my memory. I have trouble remembering names of films and filmmakers I *know* I know (I'm a filmmaker myself; films are the love of my life). I have trouble remembering what I was going to say. I sometimes even have trouble finding words. Like I ask my wife "what's the word for a milder form of worry"? "Concern."..I've looked at a number of the timelines posted here and elsewhere and I haven't found anyone else who's had this experience or who says it's typical. From what I've read in fact it seems like most of the basic cognitive issues are supposed to be gone by anywhere from two weeks to two months out. ..Any advice encouragement thoughts most welcome. Thanks in advance.

I've had similar issues - not always related to drinking or sobriety though - and without fail I've later realized I was either under-rested far more anxious than I realized or just sort of processing all kinds of emotional stuff in my sleep and unconscious that was both draining me and taking my energy. Are you by any chance especially concerned about turning 40 physical/mental decline or aging in general?
Sweet. Totally hear the "better some than none" idea. Thank you so much for engaging with me.
