I have always had a harder time struggling in the summer but this year it's been easy I'm grateful for that.  .However after over a year I have had 2 resets in the past 30 days. Both for Weddings.  "Normal" drinking behavior reserved for "special occasions". I chose to drink it was planned and intended but I didn't intend on being hungover the next day.  .I didn't intend on visibly shaking in front of my aunt the next day who said something about it.  Fuck that was weird and scary.  Mild DT?  .I'm working on my resolve and making new tools and plans for even special occasions now. Part of it is planning ahead not to drink.  Any other suggestions?  .Even when I'm tempted that it's a very special occasion and it hasn't caused a bender yet I don't want it to. I may be able to remember this feeling now and that will hold me.  .Otherwise not feeling guilty or sick nor angry at myself. Not going to beat myself up over this.  .Thanks for reading.

Knowing what my experience in sobriety IS--I feel bad that you relapsed after nearly a year and then once again if I understand you correctly.  As a relapser of 7 years duration after 15 years of sobriety I am NOT casting stones but I am telling you that time in sobriety yields amazing and ineffable gains that I intend never to sacrifice for ANY reason.  But I can only get there one day at a time.  Here's hoping that next year at this time we will be celebrating your 1-year anniversary.

For me it's easier to never drink than to decide which time is right or how much I'll have.  I miss it but having already made the decision to not drink means I don't waste energy on those decisions.  I've tried to moderate in the past and it sucked.  I just ended up leering at everyone else once I hit my preset limit.  Glad you set up your night without the driving that's good stuff.
