The past few years I have struggled with finding my identity after my divorce. Apparently all I found was the bottom of bottles. I'm here to say that I'm done with the wasted weekends spending nights crying in the bath because I got fucked up and lost the day.  3 am panic attacks are ruining my relationship .....I just can't do it anymore. I want to be present in the rest of my life. So today is day one and I will not drink today.

Welcome! My divorce was what finally enabled me to quit drinking. Well not right away. I guess to rephrase that my divorce made me drink so damn much that I realized I finally just had to quit...I'm here to say it's the best decision I have ever made. My mental health my physical health and my finances are much better than they've ever been. It's not all puppies and rainbows but there are way more puppies and rainbows than they used to be...Good luck and please keep us posted on your progress!
