Got the call from the Sheriff offices that my brother was in jail. Thankfully nothing too awful but the event was fueled by booze and fear and anger. 15 hours of hell figuring out how to get him out and he lives with me (for a while). And we start talking. We talk about my journey and how hard it was. We talk about what he is struggling with and the booze. He isn't quite ready yet I think but he is on the path to arriving at the realization that booze is bad for him and he drinks a lot. We all arrive at here from the same place. It takes some of us longer to get here. Some of us get here (at the starting line) and we have to cross it a few times before we begin our long walk towards a life of sobriety. Today my brother and I are not having a drink. We will choose to live soberly thoughtfully and in the moment. Join us.
