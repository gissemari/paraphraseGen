Hey guys!!! Happy Wednesday!! I nabbed this link after going through some past WuW posts but I hadn't seen it before and maybe you haven't either.  I think it's pretty important to laugh at ourselves sometimes.  [Eight Signs of Addiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-vyTE35EL0&feature=youtu.be)..WuW is where we calibrate our week check in and see how our SD buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety.  Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type with us!..**Triumph:** After really acknowledging the fact that I've been stuck in a loop of ups and downs and inconsistency I started to analyze what I'm doing and why it's not working.  I always like to suggest to people getting newly sober that if X doesn't work for them try Y because there is always another tool out there.  There's tons of solutions to life's problems but you have to put in the effort.  Well I'm taking my own advice and trying out some new medications for depression that I have been resistant to trying and making that decision feels good.  Part of it is letting go of negative past experiences and the other part is just being open to trying something that might work although I don't know if it will or not.  However how can I possibly find out if somethings works if I don't try?..**Struggle:**  I don't think I ever let myself acknowledge that a part of me that does miss drinking.  Largely for the last six months I have avoided social events that involve drinking and there's been no real reason for me to step inside of a bar.  This past weekend I was celebrating a birthday and ended up sitting in a bar for far too long.  I didn't think it would affect me so strongly at this point but I got seriously mad (and a lot of those old self destructive urges came up).  I got mad that I can't drink like a  normal  person.  I got mad that I have less reason to hang out in some of these establishments.  I got mad that other people can get silly relax and unwind with the aid of a substance and not go overboard.  All the while I was aware that the cons of drinking far outweigh the pros but a part of me felt like a very bratty toddler I wanted my bottle and goddamn it I wanted to scream about it...**General Chat:** Oh my goodness.  It has been raining.  Everyday.  A lot.  I don't typically mind the rain but the amount of water falling from the sky seems rather excessive even for this area's usual rainy winters.  I've put outside running on hold because I really can't stand trying to navigate puddles the size of ponds on every street. Instead I have been trying to do yoga inside (which my cats have interpreted as a new game called  attack the foot in the air! ).  How's the weather been shifting for you folks and how is that impacting your day to day activities?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I've been offered a job! That I'm going to accept tomorrow! That I think I will really truly like! AND they are paying me what I asked for. Holy crap. Sobriety and hard work does pay dividends...Struggle: The brewery I used to frequent in my hometown just came out with their Naughty &amp; Nice Ale seasonal. I know this because my brother and father liked their Facebook post about it and it showed up in my news feed. Every fiber of my being wants some when I fly home for Christmas to just get nice and lit when I'm home with my family and my girlfriend is here with hers (as in not with me what she doesn't know won't hurt her right?? etc). I can taste it. My family lives in western NY so in the winter the growlers go out in the garage or in a snow bank to stay cold...I can feel the cold on my sock feet as I go out to get a growler the glass in my hand....GAHHH STUPID BRAIN JUST STOP!..General Chat: I'm watching CNN Death Row Stories on Netflix as I type this and literally as I typed it up they talked about this one death row inmate's lawyer and how he had a reputation as a hard drinker...and how his ineptitude/drunkenness/lack of preparation directly contributed to this man landing on death row. Oh hi universe thanks for showing up when I need you. ..Anyway it's still pretty nice here - mid 60s sometimes even low 70s during the day. Hoodie weather. Thermal weather. I love it.
**Triumph:** I started a new job about two months ago had some holidays already booked. Awkward to take leave so early but what can you do.  Anyway I just got back from an amazing week and a half *(sober!!!)* vacation and my colleagues were so nice to me! I've never had a better reception back to work and I'm feeling great about it! Also did I mention I just had my first sober holiday including 4 visit to the airline lounges (free booze) 4 plane rides (free booze) and 60-99 baht cocktails trying to derail me. ..**Struggle:** I'm going through a bit of a crisis at the moment and I think it is just because of being on holiday recently. I just don't think the western way of life is right with me; I am genuinely considering being one of those people who quits their jobs to go off and teach english and travel or work as a divemaster or something. Scary to even think about. ..**General Chat:** It's pretty hot here in Melbourne but cools down at night so it isn't too hard to sleep. Going home to Canada for Christmas which will be cold cold cold! 
**Triumph:** Hm. Haven't fucked up anything at work too badly and business is picking up. My kids all seem to like me at the moment. I'll take it. ..**Struggle:** Making a living situation change in a separation is like a car crash in slow motion. Can't seem to stop the momentum even though it's painfully slow and I'm pushing the gas. Don't want to imagine how recklessly this would go as a drunk driver...**Chat:** I gave up coffee when I stopped drinking and switched to tea because I associated coffee with hangover recovery. I don't have drinking dreams very often and not recently but night before last I had a dream in which I relapsed--with coffee. In the dream I was upset and woke confused wondering if I'd drunk coffee and knowing it wasn't a big deal if I had but was kind of spooked nonetheless. Coffee. 
*Triumph* : I've noticed that when I'm dealing with anger sadness stress or other tough emotions having a drink isn't crossing my mind nearly as much. I was journaling about some argument my husband and I had and I got three pages into my journal before I thought 'wait i'm writing about being mad and haven't even thought about wanting a drink'. So yay me. ..*Struggle* : I miss the taste of wine. I always loved wine and cheese. Coming to terms with "just cheese" is making me sad. Also struggling with having to reallllly give up a big part of my social life and feeling left out of my friend group. I wouldn't change a thing about being sober but I hate feeling left out. Not sure where to make new friends. :(..*General Chat* : I've lost 13 lbs and sobriety has turned me into a great cook!! I LOVE to cook. Having fun discovering new interests for sure. It's starting to feel like fall here. Also I think I want to get a pet snake. 
Triumph:  I've be sober for 3 days!  I asked my wife last night (because I honestly can't remember) when the last time I went 3 days without drinking. She said I don't know maybe sometime when you were sick?  I honestly wonder if in our 12 years of marriage I've had 3 days in a row. ..Struggles:  I'm in my first week so I am bombarded with temptations. I find myself subconsciously walking to my beer fridge to grab one consistently. Until I remember to stop myself.  Work is very very hard for me.to concentrate and I just got this job and feel like I'm underperforming terribly...General chat:  the weather has been crappy and I'd love to see the sun!.
**Triumph:** I'm doing OK. Having to work at keeping things OK but that's why I have tools...**Struggle:** Reaching out. Opening up. Being honest with others about how I feel...**Chat:** We're having a good fall. First real snowstorm was disappointing at the house. Just enough for a snowball fight. Made for a really pretty morning before it started to melt.
Triumph: Made it to the gym wrapped up a huge project at work and am prepped for travel and holiday plans next week..Struggle: My kid is slipping a bit on his scholastic duties. My travels next week were all about rewarding his hard work this last semester but now he is starting to blow it off.....General chat: Really enjoying the fall weather
**Triumph** - Well I signed up for this community yesterday and today is my first check-in and a totally sober day!  I also signed up for a fitness class yesterday to give me something to do in the evenings besides consuming empty calories and then being bummed about it...**Struggle** - I don't even know how to express it. I never thought I would be this person when I was younger. I grew up in a small town in the bible belt and went on to be the first in my family to attend University abroad no less. I'm fairly successful well-travelled with a fun job and tons of opportunities. My mom knows I drink more than *she* thinks is appropriate but no way does she suspect I actually have a problem. And I really hope she never finds out. ..**General Chat** - I feel for you /u/pandapuddles. I don't know where you're located but I'm in Portland OR and yesterday was just torrential rain all day long. Today is bright and sunny though I woke up to frost all over my car - hoping it warms up in the afternoon so I can go out for some fresh air on my lunch break. :)
**Triumph**  My apartment is clean. I still live in the same apartment that I did when I was drinking and in the two and a half or so years that I had lived there up to that point I totaled the place. Piles of trash in the closet filthy carpet cluttered cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom dirt and grime on the walls floors everywhere. Plus my former roommate left a bunch of her stuff there (with my permission). She came to get most of her stuff a few weeks ago but left all the junk she didn't want in piles in the kitchen. Some friends from AA came over a couple of weekends ago and helped me get rid of her junk as well as lots of mine and helped me get started cleaning. And it's now clean and I have a daily routine to keep it that way. And those two friends are going to help me decorate it soon. Keeping my living space nice is a living amends to myself and it's so awesome to wake up to in the morning and come home to at night. I'm also in therapy DBT class and going back to school next semester. ..**Struggle** I still struggle with anxiety/PTSD. I had a pretty awful incident a month ago and ended up in the ER. Money is still tight (though it's getting better). Doing my job sober is an entirely different deal than doing it drunk and not really in a good way. ..**General Chat** The holidays are coming up. That's always a difficult time for me. Partly because of my drinking past partially because my very strained relationship with my family. I'm trying to change that by planning ahead. I set up my tiny fake xmas tree already with little tiny lights and little ornaments surrounding it (up high on a bookshelf so my kitten can't get to it!). On Thanksgiving a couple of friends are coming over then I'm going to an alcathon. I think on Christmas I'm going to a friends house. What are you all doing for the holidays (those who celebrate)?
**Triumph**: Being able to show up for my patients and be present instead of trying to hide my hangover.  Also walking through the beginnings of a breakup with my longtime boyfriend and being completely fucking unwilling to give up my sobriety...**Struggle**: Lots of thoughts about drinking crying spells and fits of anger. Not being able to manage my emotions in general. This morning the supervising doctor said that "AA doesn't work" because they don't supply their data about success rates. It took everything I had not to freak out.  If AA doesn't work I am truly fucked...**General chat**: The weather and the time change is really getting me down. It rains every day and the power has been out around here for two days. I'm really just feeling glum and blah and  depressed from the weather. I need to get in front of one of those full spectrum lights.  Ugh. Sorry this post is such a bummer usually I'm much more upbeat.
Triumph: I am still sober as I type this..Struggle: life is happening and I'm not yet used to all these feelings and the facing of my fears. .General chat: I'm just thankful to be sober. I'm having a rough time as of late but thankfully I haven't drank and don't plan on drinking thanks to all of you. Peace and good vibes to you all.
