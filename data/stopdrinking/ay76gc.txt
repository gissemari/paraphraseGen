550 one at a time and I've saved nearly $9000!  I took that money and booked a trip trekking in Nepal for two weeks with my family.  Its going to be awesome and my girls will remember it with a sober father.   For all of those struggling its so worth it...IWNDWYT

My month in Nepal changed my life. It will be so good for all of you. Have a great time and get sturdy boots with strong ankle support. The whole country is a staircase.
