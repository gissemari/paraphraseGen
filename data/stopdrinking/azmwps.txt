As of going to bed last night I have 21 days sober. This is the longest stretch that I have been sober in over 3 years. Honestly after going through my last withdrawal I am convinced my body simply will not make it through another. This one thought has made staying sober so much easier this time...With that being said even though I dont want to drink and have had little to no cravings (thank goodness for candy bars....they have been a God send) for alcohol I do not feel better. I instead feel numb I feel disassociated I have absolutely zero interest in talking or socializing with any and everyone...Even with all of those feelings or lack of feelings I still dont want to drink. That is something I am proud of because 22 days ago I would have had a bottle in my hand the moment I woke up. I know I will get through this I am dedicated to making this work those I call family support and cheer me on as I walk this path so I will make it...I just wanted to share my success and my struggles with people who I know fully understand what today means to me...I will not drink with you today.

I'm also at 21 days today and it's been the longest in I don't know how many years. Like you I don't even desire to drink anymore. Let's keep it up!
