I never realized how far downhill my life had gone until I woke up yesterday morning hungover for the tenth day in a row nursing my pounding headache with a bottle of Bacardi. ..It hasn't just been these past ten days though it's been since may of this year. I think I've been drunk at least 5/7 nights of every week since I turned 19. ..My family has completely given up on me. There was a point where I'd be gone for days at a time without so much as a call or text from my mom or dad- which is unlike them considering they are strict immigrant parents. My friends keep telling me I have a problem but I just cannot accept that fact. I deny it and get defensive. My only reasoning really is that  it's summer I don't have responsibilities  but that's far from the truth.  I'm not sure what my excuse will be once the summer is over but I'm certain I'll find a way to justify it to myself. ..I quit my job maxed out two credit cards on booze (and am currently close to maxing out a third) and missed all the Registration deadlines for my second year of university - so I won't be returning in September. I've had reckless sex with people whose faces i can't remember I've put myself in seriously dangerous situations with very dangerous people and have hurt myself in more ways than I can count on my fingers. ..I feel like I'm losing my grip on what's real and what's not. My reality and my dreams blend together at this point - I honestly and sincerely confuse the two and it sends me into a panic. I wouldn't be able to tell you what I've done in the last two months because I simply cannot remember. ..This is the first time I've been sober in a long long time. However as I type this I feel sick my head hurts and all I want to do is down another Mickey and wait for the buzz to wash over me wait for the headache to disappear into the bottle and let my mind forget my problems. ..But I want the desires to stop so badly. I'm beginning to realize at the rate that I'm going I'm going to end my life because of one bad night with the bottle or I'm going to do something *really* fucking stupid that'll permanently change my life. ..I don't even know where to start. I'm not even sure if what I'm feeling will be the beginning of my sobriety or the beginning of a life doomed to addiction. I'm really afraid to find out which it is. ..

I would reytalking to a doctor about how to detox and read the sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit. It has links to all of the major recovery programs and two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. ..Good luck. You don't have to face it alone.  I believe Alcoholism is a disease. It's not your fault but it is your problem.  
I spent my first few days binge watching This Naked Mind YouTube videos by Annie Grace.  She will hold your hand and also explain in great detail why you want to down another Mickey yet at the same time want to stop so badly.  Short answer dopamine chemical in your brain.  Dopamine will clear out.  It just needs time to leave your system.  Continue to be brave.  I am about two months in and was in a crushing depression just like you when I started out.  I also taped a picture of me when I was seven onto my computer.  I do it for that little girl.  I hold her hand and promise her I won't leave her alone in the scary place where dreams are real and real are dreams.  I won't drink with you today.
