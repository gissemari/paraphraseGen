I can't believe this is the longest I've gone without alcohol in my adult life.  I've tried to moderate before with limited "success" (a few beers a night) but I always ended up falling hard.  Now I know I don't need alcohol to cope.  I'm still struggling to find healthy coping mechanisms.  I still find myself playing video games and watching TV more times than I like but it's much better than destroying my liver or the rest of my body for that matter.  ..I know no one directly talked to me but thanks to those who stories helped me resist temptation and empower me...And to those still struggling to go even a week without alcohol keep on pushing and tell booze to go fuck itself.  Its an abusive partner that you can have some fun times with but will destroy your mind and body.  The bad will always outweigh the "good".

Congratulations! I look forward to seeing a 1 next to your name soon!
Good for you /u/tawded.  One thought though--moderation is not successful when you continue to fall hard.  The founder of Moderation Management fell hard and killed a family in a drunk driving accident.  Maybe it works for somebody but it never worked for me.  Like you I kept falling hard.  
&gt; Its an abusive partner.....True. It is also true that many people find it difficult to get out of an abusive relationship and even an abusive relationship can seem better than no relationship at all. This parallel may be more apt than you realize. ..I am glad to see you getting free of the abuse. You deserve all the love and respect that a healthy relationship can offer. Keep it up a day at a time.
