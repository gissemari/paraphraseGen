Hi gang.Not entirely new to sobriety. This is my day 1 however. I have been involved in AA as a teen and had one year under my belt. Since then I have gone to hell and back. I have been living in Milwaukee for ~2 years now going to school. I have no friends and no one to physically hold me accountable. I go for weeks sometimes months at a time without drinking. I always relapse and I am coming off of a 3 day binge relapse. Alas I cannot do this on my own. I need to be honest with somebody. I have no one I feel comfortable talking to. I need a meeting. I am very shy and looking for recommendations in the Milwaukee area..Thanks <3

I don't live in Milwaukee but wish you luck. I will not drink with you today.
