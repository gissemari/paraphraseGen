I wonder why I always think about destroying myself one way or another. It's really exhausting. Why its always about slowly trying to kill myself? Its always just one beer nothing happends so another beer and then another. Is that im boring or im bored of this world? I wanna keep drinking so i don't have to answer that question because i'm afraid of the anwer. But i'm a grown ass man i'm 26 and just can't keep relapsing. ..I just wanted to vent. I will not drinking with you today. Thanks.

Im 27 and in the same boat. How many drinks until i get fucked up. Good on you for not drinking today. Ill join you. Were here for you whenever you need us.
I needed lots of support to stay sober because I had no clue how to do it on my own. A therapist and support group helped me immensely.
I hear you.
