It's been 94 to be precise.  Amazing how time flys when you are stressed the hell out.  With everything on my mind right now alcohol is the last thing I need.  The vow I made to give it up for my kids is holding. It's a daily struggle I realize this.  I'm sure I would have broken my number awhile ago if I didn't have somewhere to vent in anonymity.  Thanks for the support /r/stopdrinking

Wow - congrats! I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry you're stressed the hell out and I'm sure I don't need to tell you how much worse that stress would be if you piled drinking on top of it...Thanks for coming and posting this - onward and upward!
Congratulations--that's a real good running start!
Congratulations on 94 days! Besides the stress is it possible that sobriety has become such an ingrained habit that you're not thinking about it as much?
There may be things you can do to mitigate the daily struggle - not that it is ever easy in the beginning.....If I may you might consider adding - giving it up for yourself to the list with your kids on it....  ..And then the term "giving it up" can be replaced with "getting over it" or "escaping the clutches"      ..in  very real way you are getting back into some balance with the universe at at least you are not trying to swim upstream through a pack of hungry bears...
Congrats!!!
