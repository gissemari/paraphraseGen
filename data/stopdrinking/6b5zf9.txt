I've been a long time lurker and even have been lurking through this sub during my first 7 days of sobriety. I cannot say enough how much this sub has helped me get through this first week. I definitely couldn't have done it without the openness and support of everyone here even if I was only lurking...Also reading everyone's recovery stories and posts about their struggles really helped me to feel less ashamed about myself for struggling with something that is so common. I've even had the courage to open up about my drinking problem with my two parents which I never thought would be possible before I came to SD. ..So in summary just thank you all so so much. We can all get through this together. I will enjoy not drinking with you today!!
