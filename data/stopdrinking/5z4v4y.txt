A week ago Saturday was the last time I had a drink.  I drank ... and drank ... and drank.  The next day 12 hours after I stopped drinking I found myself over a toilet throwing up.  I tried to go out to eat and just the smell of food made me want to vomit.  When I take a step back and look at it there has not been a single day in my memory where I haven't had a drink.  This one week streak is the longest I've gone without drinking and I am now 32 years old!..My girlfriend is also taking this journey with me which is nice.  It is nice to have her support through this and we aer both becoming better people...Can't say I really feel the positive effects of not drinking yet.  Right now I am more tired than I have ever been it seems.  Every day is a struggle to not drink AND stay awake.  I know there is a light at the end of the tunnel though...You are great people and I appreciate the stories that I have read on this site.  Thank you all!
