I've been reading a lot of comments here that say that relapses can be an opportunity to self-reflect and learn what not to do next time. So here's what I am going to do differently starting today:..1. Take a little time every day for self-care whether that is yoga exercise healthy eating meditation or just an activity I enjoy. It might even be just staying in pajamas and doing nothing all day once in a while. I just need to start checking in with myself more often and doing things that are good for my physical and mental health. ..2. Post here daily for at least the first month. This should hold me accountable and give me a solid support group...3. Pick something every day that I am grateful to be sober for..4. Read some books on alcohol use disorder stress management and sobriety. I hear a lot of people talking about This Naked Mind so I'm going to give that a try. I think it will be helpful to educate myself and put some more tools in the mental tool belt...5. Stay away from bars and situations where alcohol is present for at least the first 30 days. It is too easy to slip back into drinking when everyone around you is drinking and encouraging you to do the same. ..Recent relapsers of SD (and anyone else who wants to post) what are some things that you are doing differently this time around? .

Sounds good! I also just relapsed... definitely have to stay away from bars and friends who drinks the first weeks/months   I recommend the podcast Recovery Elevator! I listen to an episode every morning and evening.
Nice list! One of my changes was to simply take booze off the table for good. As long as I allowed myself to think that maybe one little drink wouldn't hurt I would fall. I will not drink with you today!
