I've been lurking SD off and on for awhile...I've struggled with my drinking progressively for 10-15 years (I'm 35) but its gotten really out of control the last 4 or 5. and especially the last 9 months.  War stories aside I'm really happy to be 7 days sober and finally starting to get it through my skull that I need to quit the alcohol and get healthier mentally and physically.  ..Last week was a little rough and I think I was doing worse at work with the withdrawals than I was when I was hungover.  Thankfully I didn't detox too hard went to a couple Lifering meetings. The hardest was talking to my boss and knowing all of the work and responsibilities I'm dumping on my coworkers by taking a week or two of sick leave.  But I'm starting to take to heart that my health sobriety and sanity are more important than a deadline a disappointed client or work in general.  If I don't get the help I need now things can and will get much worse...This weekend I started my first garden and enjoyed sitting outside reading not drinking.  Both points would shock anyone who knows me well...This week I'm getting an evaluation and hopefully starting a intensive outpatient and solo counseling program and get a physical and other tests I've been putting off. ..If this try is like my last few (dozen) tries at quitting or cutting back then I'm in trouble.  But for today /r/SD I won't drink with you.

Baby steps.  I've been on the same boat with you for about the same amount of time.  Let's not drink together.
Hey putting a Week together is a big!..You've got the recipe: Just Today.  Just make it through Today.
Sounds like a pretty solid plan to me. Glad you are getting help.
