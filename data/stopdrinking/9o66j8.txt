I am at the end of day 6 and ready for bed but today I have struggled it's the first day I actually thought about buying alcohol for the evening. This all started with my husband phoning me (He is working away) and shouting at me for asking a question it was just a general question but he screamed down the phone so I hung up from then on I was in a bad mood ( this is most definalty a regular occurrence with him) I set of out with my son and in my head I was thinking I'll buy alcohol on the way home my day kept going from bad to worse and ended up with me sitting in the car in tears I however set of home and didn't buy the alcohol and came home sorted out my son and here I am in bed having a early night after a horrendous day but I am happy I didn't give in tomorrow will be better

Well done you made it through the hardest part you didn't buy alcohol :) you should be immensely proud of yourself. Like you say tomorrow will be another day and maybe you could give yourself a little treat to celebrate how well you're doing (crumpets smothered in butter are my go to) x
this is winning. ..Just for today I won't pick up. If I don't pick up I can't get drunk.
