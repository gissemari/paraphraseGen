This has been sooooo easy for me. I have not relapsed since the day I decided never again.  I am forever grateful about this. I will never drink again. I do not look back on any of the last 100 days where I turned down alcohol and thought "Man I sure do wish I said yes to that drink." ..Even if I am passing by a group of people drinking and it's looks fun I realize i do not miss drinking. I miss having fun with friends. Any thought of my drinking is never entertained for more than two seconds (literally). it is only a fleeting thought...In the early days when an alcoholic beverage was tempting I would immediately grab a soda a water or a juice and gulp it down!!..Now that I can see I can let go of drinking I am encouraged to let go of negative "friends" in my life. This like drinking will be the pattern I set up for the rest of my life. No negative people in my circle!!!
