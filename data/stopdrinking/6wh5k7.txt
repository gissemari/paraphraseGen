.I've had a hell of a time lately finding supportive communities for much other than alcoholism.  Typical responses in /r/depression are "Yeah I'm sad too. Life sucks." Everyone seems defensive and angry in /r/relationships and I'm not quite sure what's going on in /r/mentalhealth but it scares me...This sub is great for alcoholics and people trying to quit drinking.  Like so many of my alcoholic acquaintances we have problems that extend beyond alcohol which might trigger a relapse or just make life miserable.  Where do you all go for help with other aspects of your life to help support your sobriety?

I have like 2 close friends that I can vent to. Sometimes they can relate sometimes they can't. Sometimes I just feel weird/awful and I need to be alone. I'll sink myself into any one of my hobbies where I can just turn my brain off and power through. 
I am so lucky that I have such a supportive girlfriend for one thing. No one in my family can really help as they don't understand so that sucks. Finding a sponsor was the best thing for me. He understands will help me with some questions and also validate all my thoughts and experiences.
