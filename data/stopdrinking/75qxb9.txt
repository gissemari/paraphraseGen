A lovely friend of mine comes into work often (I work at a bar) and is often so wasted he can barely talk and I struggle with how to cut them off politely. Last night I suggested he wait until I got off work so I could take him for a burger across the street hoping the food would sober him up. He orders a whiskey and basically eats the huge burger in three bites and there's no change in behavior. Almost like now he's worse because of a food coma. Then I'm starting to give up and he wants to go to another bar. It took all my concentration to eat my wings and Sprite and attempt to listen to his incoherent rambling over blasting bar music without ripping my hair out so I draw the line there and leave him at the other bar. ..So I'm not sure what to do because my neighborhood is crawling with predators looking for super drunk people to mug or beat up and I feel like his time is any day now. He's Asian and soft spoken. When he drinks he does not stop and literally stumbles home at all hours of the night alone. I once mentioned I was having financial problems and he drunkenly went to the bank and withdrew $500 cash to hand to me. I'm still holding on to it. Who knows I may need to repay him for some medical bills if he keeps acting like this. ..How do I say something or look out without embarrassing or insulting him? Should I recruit mutual friends? Unfortunately all of his friends are in worse shape. I've been concerned for a while but being sober makes it more urgent seeming.  .

Sorry to hear of this situation.  You come across as caring...Early in my sobriety I had to jealously guard my fragile state of being Unimpaired...I had to make Staying Sober my first and foremost objective.  Maybe you're not like me...I always remember I can give love without trust.  I can be compassionate without compromising my healthy boundaries...I hope you stay your course!
