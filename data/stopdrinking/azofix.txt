After I got unexpectedly let go from my job at the beginning of February I started spiraling. I had been struggling with my mental health for months and have also been a pretty heavy partier/drinker since high school. My father was also an addict and an alcoholic. All these aspects make for the perfect storm and this past month I was drinking ALL the time- even when I wasn't trying to get drunk. After a bad hangover last weekend I decided to take the week off. I was pretty successful and felt great so Saturday night at dinner I felt it was appropriate to indulge in some wine. Needless to say I went off the rails and I've realized I really struggle with moderating myself. Once I have one or two drinks it's like my brain says  fuck it  and next thing I know I'm in deep. I had the WORST hangover today and decided I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to be in control when I decide to have a drink.  The first step I'm going to take is to just to cut it out completely. I'm scared because I have a couple of friends birthdays coming up soon and NYC culture is really surrounding alcohol. If anyone has any tips for staying committed in the thick of it or just any tips at all I'd appreciate. I'm young and am pretty afraid of everything that this journey entails but I definitely need to find my control before alcohol controls me.

I'll share something I read here that I found ultra motivating:  I'd rather live my life sober believing I'm an alcoholic than live my life drunk believing that I'm not.  Kinda put it in perspective for me.  I won't drink with you today 
I know I have a fear of missing out... but I have to let it go and do what's best for me in the early days. If that involves skipping drinking events then so be it..You will get to a point where the temptation isn't as strong. But for me at least I need to take precautions in the early days - and not beat myself up for it!
