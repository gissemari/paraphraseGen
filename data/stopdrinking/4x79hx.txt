Happy to chat it out in the irc chat located at the front page side bar...If not I will say that people will deny alcoholism until they're ready to face it so maybe there's not much you can do...In regards to literature this naked mind has been favoured by people here and I'm halfway through and it's good but I doubt he will look at it in his current mindset.
In my opinion the most helpful gift you can give him is a frank talk.
Please post this on /r/askstopdrinking..It's for friends and family members..Stopdrinking is for those who want support :)
