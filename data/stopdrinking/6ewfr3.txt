I'm new here so forgive me if this just sounds like I'm trying to hear my own voice. But I find it really fascinating that it seems like my brain still associates any activity that involves fun more or less with drinking. For example I am still very actively going to hip hop shows or maybe to hang out with friends. I'm so used to doing those things drunk that it's almost like I subconsciously make time for the pre game. Like how heroin users say its the ritual that they miss it seems like thats what I miss about drinking. I miss putting on my own music taking shots from whatever bottle I got and then headed to my destination. That's literally the only part I miss. But I have no idea why because logically I would never do it again. Hangovers turned in to DTs and panic attacks. The peaceful idea of my own bottle with perfect background music turned in to drinking an entire pint. Aaaaaand finally the night out at the show I wanted to see so bad turns in to a blackout. I'm happy I remember the shows even though I feel the boredom in between sets and have to endure the obnoxious participants. I've seen more artists and comics than I could list...but I'd say 60-70% of those I couldn't recollect for you. Anyway. For whatever it's worth if anyone is missing the pre game or struggling not to drink I'm right there with you. It gets easier and waking up without the hangover makes it so much more worth it.

The ritual is a very real thing. Every time I go camping now that I'm sober I keep feeling like I'm forgetting important things from the grocery store when I pack the ice chest...because I don't need to buy 3 bottles of champagne (that was my camping beverage) and another 30 rack of Tecate for "just in case." There are countless other instances I'm finding where alcohol was playing a major role and I didn't even know!
I love pouring a glass of wine while I'm making dinner.  I love how it feels to sip it while I'm making dinner.  The fact that I can and probably will drink the entire bottle before bed is another story.  That's the part that isn't so much fun.
