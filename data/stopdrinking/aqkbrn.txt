My 1st Valentine's single and sober for 16 years I think. Been struggling the last week or two with the "voice" telling me you have done well so 1 night won't be so bad if you decide to get smashed. I set a goal to stay sober for 1 year and see how the year went. To ve honest I don't think I will last a year but you never know. Just say no right? Well anyway just here to say stay strong and I hope you all have a great day. IWNDWYT

You've drank for a year before and done it 16 times so you know what to expect. Why not see what a year sober brings you?
