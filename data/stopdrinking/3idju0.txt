I suppose it doesn't matter but I find it pleasant that this community is not androcentric (word of the day right there). Maybe some inner part of me was expecting it to be. ..It's been really great for me to just read about people from all walks of life struggling with the same issues as me. The honesty is and openness is very reassuring. Thank you everyone. I will not drink today :)

If you're interested there is this amazing [annual survey that tells you more than you might imagine about this community.](https://www.reddit.com/2oxmxi)
I like hearing from a woman's perspective on the issue because I think we don't realize how many of us are out there. It's isolating and we always have to try and be so perfect that when you're fundamentally messed up it's hard to face. I look at women in my life that I'd go to happy hour with and think...are you really going home and NOT opening up two more bottles of wine? Because I don't understand it. How can they not? What is wrong with me?
Chick here. :)  
I'm female. I just assumed most people here were men.
