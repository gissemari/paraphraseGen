I last posted here the day after my last relapse while in rehab. I'm now 37 days clean. I have an amazing sponsor worked my fourth step and got a perfect discharge date. I'm looking forward to going home and building a sober community...Thank you guys so much for your support in that first terrible day. It was the best thing that's ever happened to me.
