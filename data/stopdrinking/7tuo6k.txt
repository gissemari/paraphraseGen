I used to drink everyday. When you drink everyday it becomes your normal state of being. When I finally decided decided I wanted to stop it was because I was so physically unhealthy...So after 9 days clean I caved. The voice of addiction in the head is so clever and cunning and can rationalize drinking for ANY reason good or bad. And after one day slipping a second day can be rationalized away even easier. I drank 4 days in a row...But the thing I took away now back again and working on day two is that that when you drink everyday you don't have anything to contrast it to because it's the only state you know. ..And then having 9 days clean and really started to feel clarity and then going straight into a 4 day binge really gives you the perspective and evidence you need to really realize and be aware of the differences between the two states and for me it puts a lot of power behind this restart. ..Now it's not only getting rid of what I don't want but gaining back that feeling I had at 9 days and building from there...Onward......

power beyond your restart. heck yes. after 90 days last time i caved one day and drank every day for about 2 years. IWNDWYT.
Yes it's a fundamental shift to want to not drink as opposed to not letting yourself drink.  So great to think about it as wanting to feel sober.  Good for you!
