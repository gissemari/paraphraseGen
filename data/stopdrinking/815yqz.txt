I'm struggling with knowing the damage alcohol does on a logical level but I am unable to quell the emotional upheaval it causes. What is a good source for getting into meditation or gaining emotional control? Thanks.

Have you ever looked into EFT? There are some videos on youtube about it/that demonstrate the technique. :-)
I needed AA - it gave me that and a whole lot more...yeah I know - I am agnostic had ALL the issues.  But still it worked once I got over my issues....
I use Headspace for meditation and really enjoy it (there is a fee beyond the initial ten sessions). I'd also highly recommend The Mindfulness Workbook for Addiction. 
I use the Insight timer app on my phone it has a lot of different meditations on it...Also check out Refuge Recovery from Noah Levine it's a Buddhist based program for dealing with addiction.
I like Deepak Chopra's free guided meditations a LOT
