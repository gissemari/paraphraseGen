It's kinda weird yet exciting to finally get to the point where I'm willing to be honest about this and tackle it...My situation is only about 1.5 years old. I was accepted into one of the most competitive architecture programs in the world without having any design education in my background.  The first year was incredibly difficult I had next to no clue what I was doing and found myself competing with people who had 8 10 years of experience on me.  Making matters worse it is a very social program which is rough for an introvert like myself.  Presentations group discussions public reviews forums etc.  So not only was I struggling with the material I was essentially forced to struggle in a very public and humiliating way...As a result I used drinking to wind down after classes.  It was always  with wine.  It's easier to feel like it's okay when you are drinking nice red from a pretty wine glass than straight out of a cheap liquor bottle.  I don't even know at what point this happened but it became a daily thing.  And the days I tell myself not to drink I find myself extremely anxious and BORED. I don't get black out drunk but it's clear to me now that I either can't or don't want to stop.  ..It has sucked out my motivation my spark for life killed my social skills and social life.  I've also gained a lot of weight and look and feel a lot older all of a sudden.  I really miss who I was before this started.  I am worried about the boredom really worried actually. But I'm looking forward to finding myself again...Day 1

Day 1 here too!  Good to meet you and good luck - I'm sure this group will be a huge help especially starting out.  One day at a time :-)
Day 11 here. I love every minute of today. Everything about it is awesome. 
Welcome /u/lollygagme to /r/stopdrinking--I started finding myself by doing the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Simple sober actions.
This is my day one also! Cheers!
Welcome and good on you for recognizing that alcohol is costing you dearly and making the decision to quit...&gt; I am worried about the boredom really worried actually...That's understandable. Boredom is a very frequent topic here for a reason. If you find yourself bored (ha!) you could search this subreddit for the keywords 'boredom' and 'bored' and just read all of the search results :)..Two more things:.1) Feelings of boredom seem to be unavoidable after prolonged alcohol abuse. This means that even if you give in the boredom will be there the next time you try to quit..2) Boredom is unpleasant and annoying but it will pass eventually and it's not going to kill you. Alcohol abuse might. You probably know that but it's a useful thing to remember when you feel like you're bored out of your mind...Best of luck..
Allen Carrs "Easy Way to Control Alcohol" was a great book. I got it on audible and listened to it in the early sober days..Lots of great books and movies on the sidebar here..I worried about boredom a lot too. And I do get bored occasionally but it is worth it. It is SO much better than being too drunk to handle my own life. What the hell was I thinking????.Anyway.... That said;.WELCOME!
