Hi all - I've been on this forum since New Years and have really been appreciating it so first off thank you all very much! I have the goal of not drinking for a year because I did a  sober September  challenge last year and realized how much booze was impacting me. ..This weekend was the closest I have come to drinking so far. I found myself rationalizing ( just one drink  and  just tonight  sort of thoughts) and then thinking to myself that maybe I don't care about trying not to drink this year (f**k it type thoughts). I ended up remembering something that someone said on here: HALT (hungry angry lonely tired) and realized that I was hungry angry and tired! I ate something told someone that I was sorry about a conflict we had and had a conversation with her had some water and went home to bed. I woke up the next morning and was grateful that I hadn't followed through on those thoughts which are also all very familiar thoughts - exactly the ones I always have! ..As I am not dealing with the immediate consequences of frequent drinking it becomes harder to resist occasional drinking but I also am the kind of person who gets more and more benefit the longer I stay sober - my house is cleaner I get more done I feel like I think more clearly I have a sense of congruence with my values and integrity and I have more money and more connection with my emotions which leads to better problem solving. ..I hope I can continue to reap these benefits! I have an important fancy dinner coming up tonight and I'm hoping to be able to enjoy the food and company and not struggle so much as as I did the other night. Thanks for the support!

Keep up the good work.  Whatever chunks of time work for you as goals I'd say go for it.  For today....I will not drink with you.
Awesome that you heard AV but thought it through and took ACTION. Crucial steps. Crucial growth on your part. Very proud of you my friend...You got this. Do the same thing tonight at dinner. ..I will not drink with y'all today.
