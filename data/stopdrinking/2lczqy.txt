Good morning /sd! Do you know what day it is!?!..Once again /u/JimBeamsHusband invited me to help out with What's Up Wednesdays so here I am reminding us that the week is halfway over. Let's share our our triumphs and our struggles!..**Triumph**: I'm at an even 100 days woot! I'm just gonna leave that there and smile at it...**Struggle**: It's probably just detritus from the time change but I feel like I've been dragging and I find myself wanting to cancel plans isolate and just sit on the couch and stare at the TV. I'm not yet actually doing that but it's looking appealing. I have a hard time figuring out where the line is between allowing myself some down time and engaging in unhealthy behavior...**General Chat**: The only election I really cared about this cycle was in a race where only about 500 votes are cast. And my guy won the election by a hundred votes yay! Other US-ers are all of you going to be able to live with your local results?..Let's all decide to not drink today - who's with me?.
----------immediate responses--------

I'm with you cake_or_radish.  I will not drink today!

**Triumph:** I'm coming up on sixty days on Friday! I know we only have to worry about today but I have no doubt that I'll make it there with my sobriety intact. Started journaling/blogging again this week for the first time since college. I'm still getting the hang of it and figuring out what to do with it every day. I never realized how much I missed having that outlet all these years...**Struggle:** 60-70 days has been about the point where I've gotten tired of going alcohol-free before and start convincing myself that I can try moderation again. This time feels different. If nothing else my previous attempts at moderation are a clear reminder to me of how that works out for me. I guess I'm not really struggling with this but it is a pretty major milestone as I haven't cleared it since I was a teenager...**General Chat:** Going to the dentist here in a few minutes and I've got a meeting at work to give a status update on the projects I'm managing (spoilers: they're not going very well...). Despite all that I'm going to a concert tonight so I'm looking forward to that at least!
**Triumph:** Today is 60 days woot woot! I'm shocked and awed!..**Struggle:** I was losing weight pretty steadily from May until when I quit drinking by following a ketogenic diet.  Once I quit drinking I allowed a lot of cheat meals and a lot more nuts artificial sugars and dark chocolate into my intake.  So while I have only gained a few pounds (maybe 2?) since then I haven't been losing obviously. And with 75 pounds to lose I need to get back on track big time.  I know I need to exercise and track my calories and intake I just keep NOT DOING IT.  I gotta get on it.  Dammit...**General Chat:** The election results are fucking disappointing for me.  People just sit on their fucking asses unless it's the POTUS race and it drives me insane.  Ah well.  The older I get the more I hate both parties anyway so I guess it matters less to me than it would have years ago.  Plus I was not hungover this morning whereas every other election in the past was a reason to get sloshed.

Triumph: that is tough for me this week. I recently hit six months and 20 of the last 24 so that's something. ..Struggle: hurt my foot yesterday and by the end of the day was literally crawling around my apartment in my hands and knees to get around. Am working at home today and will assess whether a dr visit is needed. On the plus side a guy I casually know from a running club drove me some crutches at midnight which was super awesome. ..General chat: fuck daylight savings. I'm dragging this week too and I hate it getting dark at like 4pm!
**Triumph:** I'm in the process of becoming a volunteer for the Red Cross. I start orientation/training in a couple weeks!..**Struggle:** I've been in a little bit of a funk lately. I think I need some support that I haven't been getting so I'm going to take another crack at going to meetings to see if it helps...**General Chat:** My wife and I are going surfing in Costa Rica for Christmas really looking forward to that..
Triumph: 4 days sober no regrets...Struggle: My girlfriend moved out last night was the first night I've alone slept in years. It was rough but my dog came to bed and kept me company...General Chat: Starting a new job today I'm nervous as shit...I am NOT drinking today.
**Triumph:** Have a good 16 days which is really close to the longest I've ever gone. Feeling a lot more determined this time. Got through some big events sober like Halloween and my dads 60th birthday so thats nice. ..**Struggle:** Well my Grandma died yesterday and my emotions were already all fucked up so this has been real fun. I'm worried about the next few days and not drinking with all the "events" that will be going on. I'm mainly worried because my brother is coming home from Finland for the funeral and there are always a lot of dinners/drinks/night outs when he comes back. That's going to be tricky but I'll manage. ..**General Chat:** I've started Drivers Ed and although it is incredibly boring I am so happy to finally be doing this. Put this off for way too long. 
**Triumph** Just did a Step 5 with my sponsor this morning and went to a meditation class last night...**Struggle** Weight is creeping up gotta eat better and work out more. Excuses be damned!..**General Chat** A grateful heart will never drink again gratitude is my number one defense against taking a drink and daily contact with my higher power grows and nurtures my gratitude.
**Triumph**: I'm so glad cake_or_radish is helping with r/sd!  She's already made a huge impact.  I don't have much to say... life is great...**Struggle**: Tengo nada..**General Struggle**: I've got a lot of tennis queued up for the next couple days.  \o/
**Triumph:** For part of the year I work a 4 am to 2 pm shift. That used to be a chance to kick back and drink for a few hours in the afternoon light. Still doing that but now its soda tea or water. SO much better now...**Struggle:** My mindfulness exercise and diet suffered over the past month of depression. The meds or time are lifting me up. Now I need to get back other key parts back on track...**Chat:** The candidate I disliked defeated the candidate I despised. That's good I guess. I would not bring the water if [Washington were burning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06BFpv3g3W4).
**Triumph:** Got a bae on the line. Holy calamity you guys you don't even know. It's not just that she's a total smoke it's not just that she's got cool interests it's not that she's sober that she's of service to her fellow alcoholic that she understands what living a fear based life is like that she understands that I've got to take care of my mind spirit and body just like she does and that we cannot allow ourselves to backslide or become codependent. I mean it's all that but most importantly ***I've only ever been honest with her and she still likes me.*** This is a friendship that has leveled up which is how any good relationship I've been in has happened...Thing is this too shall pass nahmean? Like this ecstatic feeling I've got I've got to let go just like I've got to let go of them really low feelings. So I'm working on that through all the AA bidness I do on the daily. So my life is a little bigger but it's not a huge upheaval it's just another thing I have to deal with the same way I deal with everything else...**Struggle:** trying to 12^th step a friend of a friend who lives in my neighborhood. Well that's not the exact relation there but I feel like being vague for the sake of anonymity. I mean I've stuck my hand out pretty fucking far: Google calendar of all the meetings I go to my number the number of a woman from the neighborhood who has that fishscale quality sobriety and a standing offer to meet her at any time anywhere in this whole damned city for a meeting (since I'm always down to see a new meeting). She might be meeting me at my awesome Thursday night meeting. Tempering my expectations though...It's just hard to let go of these things. I just want to puke "you never ever have to feel like this again you can be a source of light truth beauty justice and the American way to the people who worry for you the fight is over if you let it end" at her but I can't get someone to want to get sober. It's just that this is the first person who's a friend of a friend so I want to help the friend too nahmean?..**General:** As confirmed by *Run the Jewels II* we're all gonna fuckin' make it.
**Triumph:** I'm 3 days into vacation visiting family and friends. People have offered me drinks and it's been really easy to decline them. I'm catching up sober with people I love and being present for every moment and it's great!..**Struggle:** These grad school applications aren't going to write themselves. And I'm not even sure if grad school is what I want to do next which is kind of cutting into my motivation...**General Chat:** I voted in person for the first time in a while yesterday! It was a beautiful day so the whole family walked over to the polling place to vote together. Go democracy!
Triumph: As of Friday November 7th I will have FOUR YEARS of sobriety!!!! Holy crap!!!!! I actually had to stop and think about if I had three or four years I really couldn't remember! Life is beautiful to me everyday! I am grateful everyday that I made this decision and stuck to it it changed my life that's for sure. ..Struggle: I'm in an accelerated nursing program...( something that never would have happened if I were still drinking) and my anxiety levels are pretty crazy. I know it's normal...but I wonder if I'll always have this anxiety being a nurse or if it will ever go away? Peoples lives are in my hands and that freaks me out sometimes if I stop to think of it. I had clinicals yesterday and I has to give seven medications to a patient and when I got home I laid in my bed thinking "what if I accidentally gave a wrong medication and harmed my patient?!?" I mean we triple check the meds and my teacher was there but still... It's those kinda thoughts that scare me! My friend who is an LPN says nurses always have some kind of anxiety going on. So I guess I'll just have to get used to it. I just can't wait until the time comes when I feel comfortable in what I am doing! I am only in my second semester also. I'm gunna keep on truckin on and do my best.....General chat: Feeling guilty because I didn't go out and vote. I don't pay attention to politics so I have no idea about what's going on. I live in Maryland and there's a new republican governor who says is going to change the state and everyone seems to be rooting for him. So well see. Maybe next time I will do research and vote? 
**Triumph:**  I'm on Day 1. This counts yes?..**Struggle:** I'm on Day 1 *again*. I'm going to a show tonight with someone I haven't met before and I'm not sure how to handle the "Can I buy you a drink?" question...**General Chat:** I have *so much* on my to-do list for today! I'm going to dive in and crank it out so I can play Diablo 3 before the kiddo gets home. :D Bonus: I plan on coming here often and lurking less...I think it'll help me a lot. Thanks y'all.
**Triumph:** 28! I have a 4 next to my name! :D..**Struggle:** I'm getting scared I'm going to relapse because I haven't been this far in more than 4 years...**General Chat:** Thank god the election is over! If I had to watch another bullshit attack ad I was going to puke.

**TRIUMPH**.I'm one of those alcoholics that is scared of my phone well maybe not scared but damned if that thing didn't weigh 1000 lbs right? Anyway I called two people from my women's group to get together this afternoon to do ceramics :) they both answered and look forward to it! ..**TRIAL**.Waiting for an acceptance letter to school is driving me nuts! I am so ready to get started...**GENERAL CHAT**.Ugh....the midterms are not doing much for my faith in humanity. I know some kids are taught that Jesus buried the dinosaur bones....civics is obviously leaving out that part about democracy requiring participation. If my daughter keeps on being the unifying force for good around 2040 for "Hannah in the House" campaign....you can say "I knew her when....."..Daddy Ben turned 45 Sunday :) http://i.imgur.com/1lSHySf.jpg 
**Triumph:** 90 days (3 months) sober today! Celebrated by working out. :)..**Struggle:** Handling stress. I've noticed that I have a hard time just "doing nothing" I get sort of anxious in my own company with just me and my thoughts. But I plan on starting with mindfulness to help me deal with this and help me with relaxation in general. Should not be fleeing my thoughts and feelings. Dangerous...**General Chat:** Finished a big project in time at school today. Feel proud of myself and getting the chance to be creative and artsy is always a nice plus. ;) 
**Triumph:** I feel like I am getting over the "30-day blues" that I had after reaching that milestone. I have been focusing on new things I can do in my next 30 days instead of doing the exact same thing. The biggest change is that I have begun morning meditation - it is helping me start my day with a lot of positive energy. I have also been shifting my focus from 60 days to 1 day at a time. That helps me feel less overwhelmed....**Struggle:** My husband is still drinking. He said some pretty mean things to me while drunk the other night. We went to couples counseling and he realized what he said was abusive and he apologized profusely after the session. Later that night he talked about taking a break from alcohol. He doesn't want me to think he loves alcohol more than me. He "can't" quit this week because we are camping this weekend and he knows he will want to drink. He doesn't want to go to AA. He has a "plan". He's going to start Monday... because he doesn't love alcohol more than he loves me... ugh. I can't be responsible for his recovery - I am barely managing my own at times....**General Chat:** For the first time since my AA journey began I am looking forward to my meeting today. I have enjoyed a lot of meetings but this is the first time I have been watching the clock in anticipation.
**Triumph**: Nice quit date /u/cake_or_radish.  I'm at 100 days right there with you and feeling pretty pleased with myself...**Struggle**: Candy.  I know that sugar cravings are normal and I was fine with letting myself indulge early on but it's been 100 days.  It's time to get it together with the diet. ..**General Chat**: I used to be a huge political news junky but I've taken a big step back during the last couple of years.  I stay relatively informed on local elections but the big national stuff I've let go of.  I'm Californian it's not like there's anything I can do about the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin right?  No good sense in getting worked up when people in other parts of the country elect leaders that I personally wouldn't vote for if I lived there.  
**Triumph**: I'm at 80! I was nervous about working from home yesterday but I stayed sober...**Struggle**: We're hosting a boozy night at the office tonight. I'm not worried about drinking in this case but I am irritated that I have to be there...**General Chat**: I really want to make a pineapple upside-down cake this weekend! I've never done it before. Does anyone have a good recipe?
Triumph: I haven't even been really having temptations lately.  .Struggle: I lied to some friends and told them my doctor says I shouldn't drink anymore but I don't care it's a convenient lie and my life is better.  .General Chat: Deer season is here but I still want to go fishing.
**Triumph** 3rd day sober and counting. Doing things other than drinking that I am happy to be doing. My mind is still determined not to drink and I'm going to keep that thought everyday  .**Struggle** Still not completely recovered physically I mean. Still low on energy and eyes are bugging the shit out of me. Decided to try and jog with my nephew yesterday and boy that was hard lol
Triumph:  Did a massive post this morning in another sub sharing for the first time the facts about the abuse I went through at age 5 and my slow recovery from PTSD.  I have never done anything like this without alcohol for assistance.  Today I have shaken thrown up wept dropped things bumpted into walls said weird things out loud in public and hidden under a large comforter for extended periods of time.  But I have neither drunk alcohol nor desired to.  I am a survivor.  Evil will not destroy me.  I'm going to be OK...Struggle:  Finding the balance between the past and the now.  I've had to give the past a lot of attention to get to this point.  I think I'm ready for a rest now...General chat: My cat is mashing her paws on my actual *belly* now.  Why is this good?  Because the fat roll *above* my belly has gotten too small for her to mash on.  Huzzah!
Nice work Cake!  And I enjoyed reading all of the posts.  Here is my What's Up Wednesday:..Triumph: On Day 6 and feeling pretty good about it!  Happy to sink into bed with a good book sober.  Plus I thought I'd be dreading my first meeting on Friday but I'm actually looking forward to it..Struggle: Work was a beast today.  I worked 12 hours and found myself with a lot of rage over things I couldn't control..General Chat: I ate too many potato chips and dip a few min. ago.  But at least I'm not drinking! ;)
**Triumph:** Got a sponsee (who actually calls) this week for the first time in over a year. (Long story short on the long gap: was living in a very small recovery community took a job that for ethical reasons meant I was unable to sponsor 99% of the newcomer men in the area. Have since moved to a larger area sill have a job with ethical restrictions but have a MUCH bigger newcomer base)..**Struggle:** Keeping on top of work school recovery and personal life. I'd say this is a good struggle to have!..**General Chat:** Snowboarding season is just around the corner here in Colorado! So excited to go back to "church" and get back to doing what I love!
**triumph:** making progress with my fourth step. Set a date to take my fifth (it may be next May but hey I set a date!) ..**struggle:** Isolating. Hard. Ugh. Everyone in aa is just too busy for me /pity party
**Triumph**: I'm posting... not just lurking! I made it another day. I was able to be there for a friend who'd been in a car accident. I acknowledged that my depression is back and worked on actual ways to combat it and stay sober instead of letting it consume me...**Struggle**: ."I find myself wanting to cancel plans isolate and just sit on the couch and stare at the TV.... I have a hard time figuring out where the line is between allowing myself some down time and engaging in unhealthy behavior." Yup me too. I'm also in dire need of getting my butt back into a healthy keto lifestyle and back into the gym. It definitely helps to know that I'm not alone in that though. Clearly many of us on this path struggle with balance in many regards...**General Chat**: Thank you all of you... I'm rarely in the mood to converse and I'm not a meeting person but this community has been a source of calm reassurance in some of the difficult moments of this journey. I appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you for helping me find the strength to make it one more day sober. Here's to many more! **lifts tea**...
Thanks! Are you asking if nursing is like how it is on scrubs the tv show then no haha. Much more intense!!!
