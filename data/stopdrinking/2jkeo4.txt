One of our most active SD regular's SO received some difficult health news this afternoon and the two of them are on my mind tonight.  While we rightly focus on our sobriety as a priority--we rarely take much time to appreciate the struggles of our close family and friends with life on life's terms.  Tonight I want to focus my thoughts and wishes for our collective well-being and especially for that of our close family and SOs who stood by us.

Hear hear well said.
Wonderful words /u/coolcrosby. 
I will continue to keep them in my thoughts.  This may seem a little odd but many times when someone or someone's loved one is struggling here when I do my daily lovingkindness meditation I will include that person as the "stranger" to direct those feelings/thoughts to. Today those were of strength love heath and peace...Thank you for reminding us that we are not on this road alone my friend. 
Perfectly stated. Count me in. 
Amen.
Well said very thoughtful as well.
