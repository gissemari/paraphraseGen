Hello to everyone.I am new here and a little bit scared but I want to change me and my life I am 60f from uk single and I live alone with my cat (cliche) my dog passed away last year from cancer and I adopted friends cat !.I drink a bottle of wine most evenings mostly because I am bored or lonely I can go for weeks with none but it's easier to get through evenings with some..I have been reading through people's stories etc and I think I will feel supported to know that others go through the same struggles etc
