Well i finally hit 1 month. which i didn't realize until coming here today. Which made me think a lot because last night i couldn't sleep and very seriously contemplated having a drink. I laid in bed for 2 hours internally fighting myself on whether or not it would be okay for me to just have one drink. I got up and got my roommate's/friend's bottle of bourbon out filled a glass with ice took the cap off ready to pour a glass thinking one drink couldn't possibly be that bad. I was thinking if it was just one drink then i wouldn't even have to reset my badge. Then i stopped myself. I went into my living room sat on the couch and went on SD on my phone. Just reading posts and comments from all you guys for 5 minutes changed everything in that moment. Then i started thinking why the hell would i undo all the work I've been doing not to drink with one shitty glass of bourbon. One comment in particular stood out to me. "relapse is like taking a lawnmower to your vegetable garden". It totally made sense to me. It wasn't worth it. So i put the bottle of bourbon away and filled the glass of ice with water and went to bed! I know it doesn't seem like much but to me making that decision in that moment was huge! Once i get out the bottle and ice its usually all downhill from there. I feel weird for being proud of myself for that but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't. r/stopdrinking literally saved me from a relapse last night. Thanks guys! I will NOT drink today!

Great job. Congratulations on a month.
Being on the verge of drinking and finding the strength to stop is a great victory great job. Remember that feeling and use it as a tool for future cravings! The feeling of success is infinitely better than the suppressed feeling alcohol causes. 
Way to take the SD support and make it real.  Congrats.
