And I'll be damned if I don't make it through it sober. The past couple weeks I've really been struggling. I associate this time of the year with heavy partying and it being my 21st birthday...well I think that's an obvious trigger. Deep down I know sobriety is what I want and need and my life has never been so good but that little voice has been eating at me. It blinds me. That urge has been back something I haven't felt since the first couple months of my sobriety. Its so easy to tell myself I don't have a real problem that I've got a whole life to recover I'm in college let loose you only turn 21 once etc...I love to glamorize and romanticism my past which is really dangerous territory for me. I have to remember that there are some very real reasons I got sober. I've understood from the beginning that my recovery will always be a work in progress but I'm learning what that really means. Life's been so hectic with work and school that I've pushed my sobriety to the side and stopped going to meetings stopped talking with my sponsor etc. I thought I would be fine but I can feel it. I feel disconnected and at a time like this I need a support system. My mind isn't where it should be but I've been to a meeting everyday for the past 5 days and I'm already feeling better. I got a new sponsor. I'm going to be okay. I can do this it won't be easy but I've come much to far to throw everything away now.

I really resonated with your justifications for drinking I have them too and I'm 38! So its not just an age thing it sounds to me like alcohol addiction...It sounds like you are taking some awesome steps. Good for you! How can you celebrate your birthday and Halloween in a way that supports your sobriety? If it was me I would definitely stay away from Halloween parties.
I complained once to my sponsor that meetings were putting a crimp on my lifestyle. He answered with one sentence: Everything you put before your sobriety you will lose.
