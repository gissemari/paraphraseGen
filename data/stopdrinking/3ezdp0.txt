I was going strong for about two and a half months and then I relapsed/slipped up and drank regularly for a month. Not as hard as I used to but alcohol nonetheless...Listening to Macklemore - Starting Over has me feeling all sorts of ways right now...Fucked up. But today today was a triumph. I fell into the shittiest of moods. I just hit the gym and tired myself out and came home and had a glass of milk instead. Now I'm ready to try and sleep at a decent hour instead of staying up late drinking for no reason other than to forget how I feel/that I'm alive...So Day One again here we go.

Hey man you got this. Im on day 6 and I got this too.
Yay! Now to the second day -- lather rinse repeat. 
It is not day one. This is something that really helped me. You are two and a half months plus one day. Keep adding the days but any days you abstain are yours. They stick.
Good luck man the first few days are probably the worst.
