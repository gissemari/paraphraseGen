Hi I haven't posted here before. I need some support right now though and I found this forum. ..I'm very discouraged and scared I can never truly quit drinking. I struggled to quit for a year then did quit for 14 months. Then a month ago I binged for 3 days. Then last week I binged horribly for 8 days. This last time I finally actually experienced actual true withdrawal symptoms hallucinations and shaking and mental confusion. I thought I had wet brain haha. My boyfriend was there with me for the whole binge and the whole withdrawal first crying and urging me to stop and then comforting me. It was horrible for him and I hate that I did it to him. ..Can people ever really quit forever? I'm so scared that this will happen again some day no matter what I do. Any reassurance or advice would be so good to hear. Thank you. .
