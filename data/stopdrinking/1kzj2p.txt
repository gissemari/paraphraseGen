So a little background. I've been lurking here for about 2 months I'm a 20 year old student typical frat boy ex college football player all that jazz. I just hit 8 weeks sober which honestly for the last 5 years was something I never would have guessed would happen. I used to joke about loosing weight if I quit drinking beer or being able to go to class hungover but I always told myself that was a joke and I just liked to party too much. I started drinking when I was 15 mainly scotch when I got to about 17 or 18 I learned to like beer and really for awhile was a bit of a beer snob. In college I spent two years drinking nothing but shit beer at parties but I really picked up on whiskey and would drink the nicest whiskey I could get my hands on. I came from a family that allowed drinking at any age we wanted as my parents didn't want us to go into the world with it being a new experience. While for awhile that was good I was not suited for it. I have a family history of alcoholics but refused to believe it. So much of my mentality was that I refused to accept I had a problem and blamed my drinking on the expected college behavior. .Over the last two years I got into way too many drugs. Coke weed lean oxys and hydros recreational adderall and any other study drug I could manage to get I used pre-workout to drink more; I did a lot of shit that I shouldn't have. Well drugs in combination with 5+ concussions from football mixed with a few years of hard depression over the loss of a few family members my football career ending and a fallout with my brother ended up being too much. 8 weeks ago I broke down to my parents admitted that I was doing God knows what drugs and considered myself an alcoholic. I spent last spring semester almost never sober. I would binge for 3-4 days at a time sober up for about 12 hours of sleep and then go at it again using drugs to stay awake and essentially party around the clock excluding the few hours a night I would sleep every other day or so. I decided to quit everything cold turkey (excluding tobacco) about a month after I moved from Texas to Florida. .My parents were of course shocked wanted to send me to rehab everything that comes with the typical addict reactions. Well We sat on it and I am still living with them going to school and am a college cheerleader now. If you're still reading this I appreciate it as I know it is a lot of background information. However in my 8 weeks of sobriety I've had several experiences I wanted to share and discuss how I cope as a 20 year old who can admit to people "I am a recovering alcoholic."..My first few days sober were the worst. Each day was a milestone. One day- first time sober in a month. Two days- first time sober in 6 months. Three days- first time sober in 2 years etc. I went through the withdrawals all that but Luckily I had a family and fraternity brothers who did nothing but support me. I decided on day 1 that since I was quitting for myself I wanted to keep myself accountable rather than have a feeling of just not wanting to disappoint those who were around me. My grandfather who was my absolute idol growing up quit in his middle age and was sober 33 years when he died. My aunt who lives about 20 minutes from me had all of his AA coins wanted me to carry one; I didn't feel as though I has earned one as I was just quitting. However his one year coin was the only one with a hole in the top. I decided to take it and now wear it around my neck every day as an aspect of personal accountability. I treat it as respect to him and something that I couldn't live with myself doing if I were to mess up. I'm not the type of person to advertise my sobriety but I get asked about it whenever someone sees my chain or I turn down a drink and it keeps me constantly accountable to myself no matter where I am or who I am with. So the point of my sharing this is to encourage anyone trying to quit that the biggest thing for my sobriety has been to give myself a tangible reminder of who I am trying to become. My goal is to wear my grandfathers coin until I have hit one year and can consider it my own accomplishment. Whenever I am tempted I have something to reach up and feel that reminds me that I am the one who doesn't want to be a drunk anymore...Many times I have felt the urge to drink again- maybe with my admission of being an alcoholic I can be conscious of how much I drink and just cut myself off. But I know that is the booze talking and once I start I never stop. So I've managed to continue my job as a bartender I go out I hang out with people doing drugs and drinking and envy that they can do the things I used to enjoy because they are able to do those things in moderation. My only other piece of advice other than finding something to personally make yourself accountable is to find someone to talk to. I am not attending meetings or taking part in a formal sobriety program but I still have a handful of people who I call just about every day. 2 days ago I was homesick depressed tired and knew that if I didn't talk to someone to calm myself down I would drink and probably do coke that night. It was as simple as calling my mother and best friend to tell them both that I felt that way regardless of weather I wanted to relapse or not. They reminded me that I was sober because I wanted to be not because anyone else did and gave a simple encouragement. I ended up going out for a friends birthday and stayed sober. Every time I go out about once an hour I walk to a gas station or something and back just to remove the temptation for a bit and then go back. My sobriety has been a constant fight; every day I have the urge to drink and every day I remind myself that If so many other people can successfully go sober than so can I- so can anyone that wants to. I'm just thankful that I stopped on my terms not after a DUI or killing someone or myself. .I don't know if this post makes much sense I apologize for rambling. I just for some reason felt the urge to write a bit of my story and at least try to encourage anyone who needed it. We can all do it dammit...tl;dr- 20 year old going sober shit sucks I can do it so can you.
