Hey all. It's the middle of my first week without alcohol in 3 years. I'm feeling a little nervous but good; definitely clearer than I've been in a bit. I've definitely had the urge to drink but the house is empty and so far I've resisted the recurring feeling that I HAVE to buy more. The weekend is looming which will be a challenge...Brief background: My husband and I got into a pretty party-heavy group of friends in our late 20s and now I realize there was a LOT of unhealthy behavior going on there. Fast forward 7-8 years and we had some pretty deeply ingrained bad habits of daily drinks and weekly binges. I managed to stop drinking when I got pregnant (so I know I can do it!) but the alcohol started creeping back in about 6 months after my son was born. ..After a full day of work rushing home trying to get everything done blah blah... I felt like the only way I could really relax was with a drink. And it worked sadly. For a while. But lately I've not been able to moderate the drinking. If there's alcohol in the house I'll start while I'm cooking dinner and keep drinking until bedtime. ..A big challenge for me right now is that I managed to convince myself for a while that I was a better mother when I was a little tipsy. I am a great "maintainer"... in my party days no one could ever tell I'd had too much and I'm a very functional drunk. I'm also very high-strung unfocused and introverted. It sounds terrible to say but playing with a toddler no matter how much you love them? Can be very tedious. Especially when you're an introvert and you have to be ON all the time. When I'm sober I'm constantly thinking of things I need to do and struggling to relax and just be in the moment with my son. Drunk? I'm able to spend 45 minutes making arts and crafts out of toilet paper tubes and actually enjoy myself. It's just the same way that I used to medicate myself with alcohol in social situations; it helps me dull the anxiety and gives me tunnelvision to help me focus on people. But I know the alcohol is a crutch I've been using instead of working through that low-level anxiety I carry with me all the time. And the fuzzy thinking the constant obsessing over whether or not I've got enough alcohol to get me through the day/week/weekend and the guilt of hiding this from my family are too much anymore. I can't spend my life like this. ..Anyway. Thanks guys. I'm glad you're here. I stumbled across this subreddit by accident and you tipped the balance in influencing me to make a change.

one day at a time:)..edit: I feel those little pulls every day. Hell I felt it yesterday and gave in. But you gotta keep pushing. It takes a lot to tell yourself you don't *need* those little things. I think the thing missing for me was actually admitting to myself that *I* have a problem. This is a problem. This isn't something I can do to please other people or lose weight or blah blah. It's a legitimate problem. And keeping that problem at bay is more important than having that tasty glass of wine with dinner or that beer with friends. Because guess what. It's never one glass of wine and it's never one beer. It is a problem. Also you should check out the "Request a Badge" link on the sidebar it helps you keep how many days you have :) Good luck to you
Just saying hi :) I'm on day 8 and I have a toddler too. Your story sounds similar to mine... ..When drinking I did find myself to be pretty impatient with my little guy in the evenings though. Being sober seems to be easier to go with the flow reading him books etc rather than stressing out about him just going to sleep so I can have a few more drinks and some time to relax. ..My afternoons/evenings have still been feeling stressful every other day or so but I hear it gets easier. ..
