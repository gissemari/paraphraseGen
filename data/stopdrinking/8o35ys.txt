I posted my last relapse here this morning . It started Thursday and ended yesterday . (.  From what I can remember )  A mess it was . I can't believe myself . I know I can't drink ! I know my only chance at life has to be sober . I know all the damage drinking has done . I know  I know  I know !!! But takes that minute to forget and It's another mess I've made . I couldn't even stand reading that post this morning  let alone have you all have to read that horror of a drunk story . I love SD and Ive been around here for almost 2 years . I'm not going to drink today  and all the best of life to everyone here who's joining me
