The cravings are immensely strong today. I have plenty to do today that I happily want to do sober. But I keep wanting to have a drink waiting for me at the end of the day. I'm doing my best not to give in. I knew the weekend would be my weakness. .Trying not to drink with you all tonight. :/

This is not an easy thing to do! Why don't you grab a badge for a little extra motivation??
Try to eat a big meal for dinner drink a bunch of water or something non alcoholic you enjoy. Play the tape forward and thing about shitty things that may be said or done. Go for a nice loooong walk if nothing else seems to be working. I am not drinking today care to join me? Stay strong . We are here for you!
Weekends are hard for me too. Mostly it's boredom so I try to plan activities and snacks that I can look forward to...I will not be drinking with you today my friend!
Can  you do anything totally out of the ordinary tonight? Random fun? Easy cheap? ..If you were here I'd give you this puzzle! 
Hang in there! I'm so glad I got through the first part. If I may recommend get lots of sparkling water to stay hydrated and lots of your favorite candy. The sugar got me through a lot of struggles.
