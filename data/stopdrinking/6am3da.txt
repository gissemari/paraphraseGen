I've been struggling off and on with heavy drinking for over a decade now (im 33) and I really need to stop for good. AA didn't work for me. Treatment helped...for a few years I was sober after but I can't go back for many reasons. I recently fell off again after 2 years sober. I'm hoping to find support and encouragement here so I can stay sober for good this time. My drinking is ruining my life and my business and it was only a few days this last time. I already feel like I've ruined my marriage and my relationship with my oldest daughter. I'm still physically not feeling well and the shame and guilt and self hatred do not make it easy to remain sober. But I will not drink today no matter what happens. Just for today.

You can do it!  I will not drink with you today 
AA was not for me either. SD has been my main support and it has helped me quite a bit so far. Have you ever heard of Rational Recovery? I just checked out a book on it and I am really digging it. In any case if you're not drinking today then I'm not drinking with you.
