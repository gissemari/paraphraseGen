 I walked home from the liqour store the other day crying over why I keep doing this to myself and I just couldn't lie anymore. I told my wife how bad I really am on Satuday. Im sick of lying covering my tracks and having nightmares about my daughter dying or feeling so anxious and sick I lose an entire day...I drank so much on Friday and Saturday night Im still not doing very well. I promised my wife I'd go to a meeting tomorrow. Today Im not sure Im even 100% sober yet and I know you have to make the commitment when you are. ..It always takes me a whole day to sober up and stop feeling like a mess. I am a really bad binge drinker going days without then going days with. I go long enough without to feel healthier again then I tell myself well you just won't drink as much this next time. You'll be fine. You don't really have a problem you can control it if you try harder. Repeat ad nauseum...I've been struggling with this for years. I had a period of two years sobriety and another period of six months but I keep rationalizing why I can drink again and manipulating my wife into letting me. I fucking hate it. I don't know if this is rock bottom but I feel so guilty it's overwhelming...EDIT : ..Thanks everyone for the kinds words and support. I went to a meeting at noon my time today and got my 24 hour chip. The last time I drink will hopefully be last Saturday...I never actually got a chip before I just shopped around for an AA meeting during one stint in out-patient treatment. So even though I've been in several AA meetings before I never really shared much.

Welcome...   .Hit a meeting just don't drink today...  .I need help staying sober I was working the wife over (planning a drink) yesterday as I felt cured for a few hours.. Ha! Cured... I mentioned it at my morning meeting and all the dudes were like "you should have called..." Next time I will... 
You are in good company. Dont worry about being sober to go to a meeting Pretty sure we know what drunk is...If nothing else it keeps us away from booze for a few hours.
Im familiar with what your going through for me its when I wake up and realize I just threw away several more hours of my life the previous night and for what? Some cheap laughs and whole lotta unhealthy? That's why im here you should quit with me too! 
Just think of a life without all the nonsense involved with drinking. Think of being a great father and husband who can spend his energy loving his family because he isn't drunk or hungover. It's a great gift and opportunity you have to make a change and stop forever. Follow through and do this! For you and for them...The hangover magnifies the guilt. But I don't ever want to forget what that hell feels like. I want to remember it so I can make the choice not to go back there...I brand new to this too. I quit for 16 months once and fell back into it. No more. Let's do this.
&gt;Today Im not sure Im even 100% sober yet and I know you have to make the commitment when you are...Man I disagree with this analysis.  People go to meetings all the time with alcohol still in their system.  I don't know where you are at but if there is a meeting still today....go.  I will tell you one main reason why I think you should:..Getting sober means doing the opposite of what our fucked up brains are telling us to do.  We think we are smart and careful by agreeing to wait until tomorrow to do something like going to that first meeting but in reality that is our alcoholic brain trying to trick us into putting it off another day.  Because if we put it off another day there is a chance we will change our mind and our alcoholic brain has won yet another battle...Whatever you decide to do goo luck.
&gt;I tell myself well you just won't drink as much this next time. You'll be fine. You don't really have a problem you can control it if you try harder. Repeat ad nauseum...I think many of us can relate to this...I know I sure can.  In AA they talk about "half measures".  ..Here is a quote from the book Alcoholics Anonymous concerning ways some alcoholics try to control their drinking.  .."Here are some of the methods we have tried: Drinking beer only limiting the number of drinks never drinking alone never drinking in the morning drinking only at home never having it in the house never drinking during business hours drinking only at parties switching from scotch to brandy drinking only natural wines agreeing to resign if ever drunk on the job taking a trip not taking a trip swearing off forever (with and without a solemn oath) taking more physical exercise reading inspirational books..."  ..I've tried at least 8 of those as well as other convoluted excuses and plans that seemed reasonable at the time.  My sponsor talks about the end of her drinking days where she was downing bottles of Listerine because she could rationalize that it wasn't really booze...it was mouthwash.  ...Does this mean no one can moderate?  Of course not.  Not everyone who drinks an alcoholic beverage frequently gets blackout drunk drinks to the point of sickness feels guilt and shame every day etc.  ..But I have a problem with alcohol...I'm an alcoholic.  One drink is never enough for me...how do I know that?  I've TRIED...over and over again. I always end up in the same scary scary places.  ..It sounds like you have accepted that you have a problem.  It sounds like you are ready for a change.  So...what is your plan?  ..
&gt;you have to make the commitment when you are...Not true.  AA requires absolutely no commitment to go to 'open' meetings and the only requirement for 'closed' meetings is that you 'think you have a problem with alcohol.'..A story - ..I actually spent close to a year going to AA meetings drunk *with a bottle in my car* for later.  In my old home town all the (State-owned) liquor stores closed at 9PM.  All the evening AA meetings therefore started at 8PM.  ..I certainly wasn't about to be caught high and dry without a night's supply of booze just in case the good folks at AA didn't 'cure' me of my alcoholism during the meeting so I got a bottle just in case telling myself I wouldn't drink it unless I really really needed it.  ..Once purchased  I couldn't resist taking a few swigs before I got to the meeting just for nerves you know.  After the meeting with an open bottle in my car it seemed prudent to finish it off so it wouldn't go to waste...I didn't this for close to a year confident that since nobody had called me out on my behavior I was getting away with it.  After I *finally* got sober and honest and told everyone what I had been doing they all told me that they knew all along and were just waiting for me to wake up to the insanity of my rationalizing behavior.  Furthermore they knew from experience that to confront me would just alienate me from going to AA so they were more than willing to have me attend on whatever terms I set for myself drunk or not...I had to go through that long ridiculous process before I could finally sober up but once sober I was able to draw upon the information I had gleaned from those interminable drunken meetings I had endured so I'm glad I went despite the seeming futility of the process while I was going through it...So don't feel like you need to clear any hurdles in sobriety before you go to a meeting.  Just go and listen to what gets said with as open a mind as you can muster...You can't do it any more bass-ackwards than I did and it still worked!
It's really quite annoying our disease. We spend so much time desperately trying to rationalize why it's okay for us to continue doing the very thing that is causing us (and our loved ones) so much misery. It's an insane cycle and we have all been there. You are in the right place my friend. I believe in you. Get to a meeting ASAP. Also if you don't like the first one you end up at keep shopping around. You will eventually hit a sweet spot where you just feel so welcome and loved and your feelings of isolation and shame will finally be lifted..You have nowhere to go but up!
1672 days ..The 'epiphany' moment for me was when someone said: If you never have the first drink you can NEVER possibly get drunk. .I needed to guarantee myself I'd never be that drunk person again so every day I never have the first drink. ..
It's hard to post it here. It's hard to say it out loud. It's even harder to admit it every time you wake up. Look at everything. Keep everything on the table. When solutions present themselves that make you or your family think "That makes sense; that's something we should look into" keep it on the table. If we keep all the ways to address our problem on the table we have no choice but to admit we have a problem every minute of every day. 
If you decide to join us consider doing what I did: [start here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)

Make a commitment to yourself. I will not drink today. Make a personal conscious decision every morning I will not drink today. Release yourself from the burden of guilt as it is so easy to be hard on ourselves. We all make mistakes but at some point we need to forgive ourselves how could we move on with our lives otherwise? This forum makes sense because we all share a common goal we all want a better life free from alcohol. Stay strong my friend and take care..
&gt;  I don't know if this is rock bottom..Why keep digging? Glad you're here.
The "so anxious and sick I lose an entire day" ... I have had so many of these days
I can really relate to your story man.  I had about a year and a half sober and I've been messing around with drinking and some other stuff and tonight I was looking for some inspiration to get back into sobriety and your post really helped me out.  We can do this.  It sounds like you know how good sobriety can be after you get some stability and I do too... so it's time to buck up and do it.
Start hitting meetings. Observe the people. Absorb what you see and hear. You may or may not go back out to try it again but you may find that exposure to sobriety in the rooms messes up your drinking. Good luck.
Guilt shame remorse fear helped sober me for a bit in the beginning and then it was replaced with anger but the one thing that stuck and carried me through to a better place was the final irrevocable reality that I was dealing with a **sickness** that I could not fix using my own techniques...I needed help I was desperate enough to go begging for help and beaten enough to accept anything and everything that was available...Once I admitted to my innermost self that I was **sick** sick in the body (certainly) but more so **sick** in the head and completely beaten I was no longer willing to listen to my own brain. That brain of mine was on the wrong track and wanted to die...I've since found a new way to live. When my brain offends I treat it like the sick patient that it is and try to be helpful and coax my brain to find a better way that will allow us to live in harmony. I forgive my brain for trying to kill me and I exercise my will power to align my brain with the path that leads to a better life...The way that I define the path to a better life is inventory. The inventory process that I learned in Alcoholics Anonymous freed me from the past (guilt shame and remorse) and shows me a way to proceed in life without anxiety (fear)...Now that I know what to do I have a plan for life that really works.
