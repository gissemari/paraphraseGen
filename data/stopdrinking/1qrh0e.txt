I'm so happy to be 30 days free of struggles with alcohol. The mental peace of mind alone is priceless. Thank you all for being so open and authentic about your lives and experiences. It has been of great help in re-orienting me.

Congrats on your star!  What are you doing to stay sober?
Nice job lady.  I'm right behind you!
Such a milestone. Congratulations.
Congrats and High-five to you!..I've also found that a lot of the confusion / drama / general BS I was dealing with evaporated when I quit getting drunk on a regular basis! That's not to say life is golden now...but at least I can deal with my challenges head-on and sober now!.
Congrats.
Hell Yea! So happy for you.. Do no pick up no matter what!.
Great job! Don't forget to keep your foot on the gas and keep moving forward.
CONGRATS! And what a beautiful star it is :)
Congratulations! That mental peace you're experiencing (perhaps for the first time in your life?) can continue forever to some degree as long as you don't pick up one day at a time. Life will keep lifing and there will be hard days but my worst days sober have still been better than my best days drunk. 
Congratulations! Keep it up!!
Congrats! 
Awesome.  Keep it up!
Remember sometimes it's "One Day at a Time"...Sometimes it's "One Hour at a Time"...And sometimes it's "One Minute at a Time"...Don't ever be afraid to ask for help.
Congrats!!!!
