It's that time of the week again.  The week's half over.  Time to share your triumphs and struggles...**Triumph**: I'm still kicking ass at tennis.  I'm playing so much that I hardly have time for much else yo.  I have only been on my bike twice this year.  I've only been out running (for about 1.5 miles) since the half-marathon in May.  It's been over a week since my last Krav class.  But I'm having so much fun on the tennis court it doesn't matter...As far as drinking goes I've been thinking about how different my life is now vs. 585 days ago.  I see how I handle stressful situations differently.  I see how I handle [celebratory situations](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/28vkbu/celebrate_good_times_come_on/) differently...Lately I've been staying up later than usual.  I've been watching (and finished) Breaking Bad bitch.  So my wife has gone to bed at her usual time (between 10:30 and 11).  Sometimes I've stayed up as late as 3 AM watching BrBa.  And I haven't had even the twinge of desire to go get myself something to drink.  That used to be my thing: waiting for her to go to sleep watching something she doesn't want to and drinking to oblivion.  The worst I do now while I stay up late is eat some sweets (and get way too little sleep)...But I'm glad I'm done with the show... I'm sorry it's over but at least I can get back to going to bed at a reasonable time again...**Struggle**: I've got nothing bitch...**General Chat**: I guess I'm channeling my inner-pinkman..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I went to my cities Pride event Saturday with some sober friends. It was my first time in a bar/party environment since stopping drinking and it was awesome. It showed me how much I've changed in the last 8 months. I found out that I can socialize sober and didn't feel awkward at all. The best part was that I didn't even think about drinking! ..Struggle: I'm in a loop of obsessing and procrastinating about school. Can't seem to stop it or manage my time correctly. .
Triumph: I've made it 2 weeks with only a few true cravings.  Made it to the doctor yesterday to make sure I was good to go for exercise.  Ran a mile each Mon and Tues and walked over 6 miles between the two...Struggle: Discovered by snooping my wife's phone that she has gotten her own apartment and will be moving out.  Realized that both kids and some of our mutual friends knew as well.  She held out on telling me for the past 6 weeks because she "didn't want to hurt me". Didn't work. I shall continue my battle with alcohol each day and hope she sees that I'm not a lost cause.  ..General Chat:  No Pinkman from me - that poor guy kept relapsing!!     
Triumph: I got a new job! I've had my neighbor offer me a job in sales (which is my gig) and as a 21 year old he is kind of looking for the next generation to take over his spot when he retires. ..Struggles: women. It's always the women. (No offense). I've been talking to this girl and now she's pulling away and it frustrates the fuck out of me but I need to remind myself that I don't control people places or things and that whatever is going to happen between us happens. For better or worse I will not drink over this. ..I haven't been very active in this sub for awhile and I'm coming back to join the legion of sober soldiers!

**Triumphs**: I'm lifting more and lifting better than I did when I was drinking. And there were months I wasn't lifting in there too. And it's more consistent. My second favorite thing is on Thursday afternoon when I realize "hey if I make it to the gym tomorrow morning that's another good-ass week in the books" following closely behind my favorite thing: eating breakfast on Friday morning having completed another good-ass week of lifting...My parents leave for their vacation tomorrow morning. The vacation my brother and I paid for. Pretty happy about that...**Struggle**: I'm getting sued. I was hit by a car while bicycling to work in 2010. Health insurance decided not to pay for imaging (what the fuck?) his car insurance decided that I was at fault and I got stuck with the hospital bill. Never paid it because what the fuck is the point of making money if it can all get  taken away in an instant due to taking a bike ride?..Anyways the suit started a long time ago and I ignored it and now the creditor has filed a "Motion to Reopen Reinstate and Enter Judgment Out of Time." I have no idea what that means I have no idea how to find a lawyer to help me understand it and it seems like I'm going to be paying what amounts to a fucking shakedown of $5.5K to get this monkey off my back. That's like ten pairs of very very good shoes. Or a baseball sized bag of coke...So I need to practice these principles in this affair because getting angry won't get me anywhere...**General**: Most anticipated summer albums?..* Hail Mary Mallon 2.* Run the Jewels 2.* Frank Ocean
Triumph: .Went on a date last night and had a non-alcoholic beer. Declined free office cocktails for our upcoming house-warming party...Struggle: .Lots of work coming down the pipeline that will cause some stress and a handful of events coming up with free booze. ..General Chat:.Discipline is a beautiful thing. As well as this community. 
Triumph: I'm a few days away from my two week mark but the cravings over the last few days have been major but I've been able to remain sober. In the last 5 years  I never went more than a day or two without drinking I'm really proud and surprised od myself for staying sober the last few weeks. ..Struggle: Tomorrow my company is having a benefit at a bar. I really want to go and see people I haven't seen in a while but I know the temptation would be too high. ..There is a guy I've been seeing off and on over the last few months but it hasn't been as often lately. Makes me sad but I'm trying not to stress out over it...I'm also very lonely.  I don't feel like I have very many friends and a lot of the time I send texts that don't get answered.  Most people (including family) only contact me when they need something.  Makes me feel like complete shit Ferris. I'm not sure how to make friends especially because I'm still trying to figure out hobbies or what I like to do. ..General chat: It's about to start storming here  I love me some thunderstorms. 
**Triumph:** Not really. Finished a half marathon Saturday with a buddy but messed up my Achilles as expected. The triumph is I don't think I messed it up a lot. Not a great time but I walked away. ..**Struggle:** Life problems sometimes seem to accumulate before a breakthrough the storm before the calm. Working on the breakthrough and looking for a little more comfort in my skin. ..**Chat:** Did a similar BB watchfest... It's only 2:15 a.m.... one more episode...
