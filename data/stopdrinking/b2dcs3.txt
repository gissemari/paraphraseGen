Hi everyone ..I've posted on here before and was doing really well but for some reason anxiety hit hard this week. It started with a few happy hour beers and ended with a binge session at a party. All my skills went out the window. I feel really ashamed discouraged and back at square one. Any idea on how to move forward and not let the shame drag me down a ton? Thank you.

Sobriety is only a date a lifetime last forever. 
You've broken the cycle before and you can do it again. Don't dwell don't feel sorry for yourself and identify what went wrong and address the issue. Giving in is easy it's why we have a world full of addicts.
Be kind to yourself.  We're all battling an addiction and that's super hard. It's so hard. ..I don't know many people who haven't slipped up. ..Tomorrow is a new day and a fresh start. I won't drink with you.
