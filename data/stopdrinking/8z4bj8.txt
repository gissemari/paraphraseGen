I'm a struggling alcoholic who at this point partially drinks to get sleep.  ..Disclaimer I have AVN on my hip meaning my femur is slowly dying. I can still walk and it isn't bad but I do limp. ..But at bedtime. It is the worst!  My left pelvis throbs and grinds and pops and just makes me want to cry. ..So sober me will take 2 Advil PM but that doesn't work very well. ..Is their anything I can be prescribed that might help? My wife told me as an addict I probably wouldn't be prescribed sleep meds.....Anything?

There are non-habit forming recovery approved sleep aids you can talk to your doctor about. I take Trazodone which was originally supposed to be an anti-depressant but the formulation causes extreme drowsiness. Trazodone seems pretty regularly prescribed to people in sobriety since it isn't formulated like Ambien or Lunesta which can have some problematic effects for some in recovery. 
In my sleeper meds not likely to be abused I have three: diphenhydramine (benedryl) hydroxyzine (Atarax Vistaril) and trazodone. ..Mirtazapine (Remeron) is also great with helping with sleep but it has a significant tendency to promote weight gain and metabolic problems. An underweight person might find mirtazapine ideal. 
I had a sleep study done and the doctor explained that alcohol and other depressants help us fall asleep but reduce the quality of sleep.  He said it would take time for my body to adjust to sleeping without alcohol.  I never took any prescription medication but tried various supplements like Zhou's sleeping aid (I honestly don't know if it even worked).  I would warn that reviews for supplements on Amazon are incredibly inflated because companies give free second bottles or refunds in exchange for 5/5 reviews.
You are in pain. Have you seen a DR? Have you been an abuser of drugs or only alcohol?
