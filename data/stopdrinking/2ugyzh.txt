I was in the program for 6 months and started dating a girl (who had 4 years).  We broke up 4 months later.  I relapsed.  I came back into the program 2 months later.  She now wants to be "friends" and still hang out.  I see her at meetings but the more I see her the more I realize how much I resent her.  I don't want to have a resentment but it grows bigger and bigger every time I see her.  What do I do?
