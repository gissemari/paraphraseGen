I struggle and I have no advice 
My favourite always remains to play the tape forward. Have never ever regretted a sober morning...IWNDWY this weekend!
You can do this!
Get out even if you just walk. Eat something (or lots of things) that are a guilty pleasure. Play the tape forward. Read this sub. IWNDWYT 
Walking helped me a lot.  It filled time provided peace and helped heal me...And if you feel like you are close to cracking you might post here.  Drinking for me is impulsive so I made a vow before I would drink again I would post here and wait for replies.  This gives me time not to make an impulsive decision and get help.  People here are always ready to help...You can do this! IWNDWYT
