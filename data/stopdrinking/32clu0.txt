Last Sunday I was sitting in a jail cell all day. After relapsing after 106 days I got a DUI and spent Easter in jail. Today I'm sitting back watching The Masters and eating sandwiches with all the windows open listening to the birds. It feels absolutely amazing. ..7 days sober today.

Good on you.  I am watching the masters too.  I hope Phil wins.  Can't make this Jordan kid out yet.  I think he is a robot...Definitely better than a jail cell may I add.
Congrats on your first week :)
I remember your post and I am really glad to hear this
