I've taken up biking since I quit drinking and have already logged nearly 1000 miles this summer. Yesterday I set a personal distance record of 82.65 miles and averaged 16.5 mph. .I encourage anyone that is struggling to hang in there because it does get better because life without booze is much better I promise. .

Wow! Impressive!      .Kudos for 138 days /u/JimiEmBee!
It is so much better. Me and the Lass went wall climbing yesterday. My worldview is so much more expansive without the booze. I'm discovering neat hiking trails and parks all around me...Do not miss booze whatsoever and I have a much more fulfilling life.
Congrats! I have also been exercising more than ever in my life. ..Nothing as impressive as yours but bike commuting and yoga classes feel great! 
I actually had a dream last night that I started biking. :) Better than a drinking dream I guess (I haven't had one of those yet).
Sweet!  I'm looking forward to getting stronger.  I won't drink with you today.
Nice JimiEmBee those are good numbers!  Nothing better than waking up early cranking out a bunch of miles followed by a post-ride feast!..Congrats!
That's some solid riding!
