Had 2 months in and have been off the rails for 3+ weeks now. Hasn't been a horrible relapse in terms of consequences but have been very disappointed in myself. I've been experiencing neurological concerns since August and luckily have a family doctor who didn't dismiss my reports of being cognitively impaired. She did treat me for sinus infection first which I did have but once that cleared up I still felt this  loopiness  . It's hard to describe the symptoms but cognitively impaired sums it up. I figured she was going to tell me it was physical symptoms of anxiety which actually would have been awesome in comparison. She didn't though she listened to me didn't discount what I was telling her and with legitimate care and concern told me she thinks it W-K. So yeah I've fucked myself up pretty good. I will have an EEG to check for lesions and have started a heavy course of thiamine replacement. Lucky I didn't have to be admitted for IV intervention but I'm a mom etc. She wanted me to go off work but I knew if I did that I would likely stay home and drink. Idle hands are the devils work? Is that the saying?.So with sleepy tea next to me my baby boy in bed and my dog by my side I am not drinking. I want to. I won't. I figured my liver damage would have been enough to scare me straight the dui 2 years ago or having a child. Nothing has so far but the very real possibility of dying as a vegetable god dam will. Anyway thanks for reading. I'm sad:( I can't really tell anyone cause I hid this relapse so well (I think I did but prob not) I just want someone to cry to but I don't have anyone. And its embarrassing to say I did this to myself.

Hugs  . You're doing the right thing. .
I'm sorry to hear about this. Hope you're feeling better soon!.
You're very brave to share this story.  Take care of yourself out there iwndwyt 
Best wishes for a steady recovery.  Sometimes my worst medical fears turned out to be benign.
Glad you're here and following a treatment plan...Everybody here "did it to myself"...That's in the past.  That's not important...What **is** important is what I do **next**.  ..You've got a lot to look forward to including that beautiful little boy!..I got an immediate support network with recovery meetings...Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
I'm no doctor but the quality of your post  and your writing indicates to me that you probably don't have W-K. I highly doubt folks who have drank themselves into that state would have the sense to follow the steps to come here and write something so well. .The first few months of recovery were certainly very  loopy  for me. It took over 16 months for me to feel back to normal after 20 years of hard drinking.    .I have faith you'll be OK!
