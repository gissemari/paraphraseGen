I am at 40 days right now. A little less than a week from the amount of time i hit the last time I tried to get sober. This time is different though... I can't say I miss it right now. I am not thinking about it and when I do I hope on here and read your tales and struggles with relapsing. ..Thank you everyone for your participation in this sub and here is to a wonderful Sober Friday!.

Yay!..I'll not drink to your 40 days if you won't drink to mine.
