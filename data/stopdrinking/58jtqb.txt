Just reset my badge to 6 days so the 41 listed now is no longer correct.  ..Getting sober is the hardest thing I've ever had to do hands down.  I'm able to get some time under my belt every single time but almost like clockwork I relapse every two weeks -3 months (or less).  I am still committed to recovery but it's hard to not feel depressed that as far as my drinking goes I'm right where I started last year...I have decided to commit to AA and build a community there.  I did that for a bit when I first tried getting sober but it was hard for me to fit in and make friends.  But I did get my longest stint of sobriety while I was doing daily meetings and working with a sponsor so I think it's my best option...The unfortunate truth is that I cannot be anywhere there is alcohol for the time being.  I might be fine at the time but it will get to me days later and I'll relapse hard.  ..I'm so tired of this so so tired.  I'm keeping my head down and will continue to charge through the storm but I just needed a place to vent so if you're reading this thank you.

I totally relate to the feeling of being too tired to keep drinking. I actually think charging through the storm is too hard to do. Sometimes it's just a matter of getting through the next hour or the afternoon. ..Do you have something else you could do to look forward to at the end of the day? I spoiled myself with takeout and ice cream the first few months. ..I will not drink with you today.
I'm glad you're here with us. You're among friends who understand how difficult this can be...A quote from Martin Luther King Jr. I read recently: "If you can't fly then run if you can't run then walk if you can't walk then crawl but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward."..
