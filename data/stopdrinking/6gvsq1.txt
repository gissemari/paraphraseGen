Today is 4 weeks out of detox for me 4 weeks not drinking.  At first I immersed myself in a flurry of distractions a flurry of busyness but now I feel the need for distraction has subsided.  My mind is starting to finish complete thoughts I'm able to recall things longer then five minutes ago but most of all I feel a deep calm. Everyday I find myself enmeshed in subtler and deeper forms of quiet.  As I'm turning in and looking at myself I'm confronted by a profound sadness and loneliness.  My therapist asked me if I was depressed. No it's more existential it's more like melancholy.  ..My father struggled with drugs and alcohol he stole from me he hurt me i lived through all manner of crazy things that with a decade of hindsight I can't imagine I ever thought it was normal that I ever thought it was ok.  He died suddenly when I was 23 and his death brought a kind of relief that I've often felt guilty for feeling.  ..Now that I've got I've about ten years of heavy drinking under my belt I can see myself more like him then I'm comfortable with.   Father's Day is coming up and with it these feelings have become especially raw and incredibly powerful.  What I struggle the most with is forgiveness and acceptance. Forgiving myself and accepting him.  Accepting myself and forgiving him.  They are both so wound together they are the same thing.  I drank to forget and the drinking made me hate myself for becoming what wanted to forget.  This makes me wonder if I can stop hating him will it help me stop hating myself?  I know the answer is yes but it's the thing I struggle most with letting go.

Well written and I hope you are right and it is true. Self loathing seems to be deep in the heart of many alcoholics myself included. I hope you can begin to forgive yourself and live comfortably with the flaws that all humans have. God bless. 
These are complicated issues. A therapist and AA helped. It took time work and sobriety to find resolution.
