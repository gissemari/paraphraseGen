I was forced to stop drinking 26 days ago I had surgery and the pain was unbearable and I can't drink while on my medication. That probably saved my life since I was heavily drinking everyday for the past year. .But I'll tell you what I'm scared. I'm scared to relapse when I stop taking my medication I still have the urge to drink after 26 days sober.

Why do you drink?  
Oh man you're lucky that you got these 26 days under your belt already!  Try to use this opportunity to stop for good.  You are 26 days in from your last drop of one of the most dangerous addictions out there imo.  There are some awesome books to read in the sidepanel.  Theres also AA groups and therapists.  Why not go to a therapist for a while and discuss the challenge that lays ahead?  There's no shame in asking for professional help.  It's your life we're talking about little is more important.  The big part is commit to not drinking.  you have to commit to it.  It will change your life for the better.  I'm convinced alcohol does nothing good in this world.  IWNDWYT
