I realized some things recently. I've been working at this for a long time but I haven't been successful in long term sobriety. The last 6 months I didn't even count relapses no badge just went about my weekly drinking. Sure It wasn't as extreme as before but I essentially gave up. After months of thinking trying to figure myself out I'm back to it now. I realized what has been holding me back. Every time I have tried to get sober the times where I really really really wanted this and thought I did EVERYTHING right (i.e talking here meetings sponsor) I always seemed to fall. I had to do a hard look at myself. I realized that while my intentions are good and I try to change this I don't do any other work on myself. I would spend my time wallowing in self-pity letting emotions get the best of me not reaching out to family friends not being honest with counsellor not eating well not sleeping well never ever exercising doing other harmful things to myself. That was a recipe for failure and a recipe for defeat. I realized I approach  many areas of my life differently and make positive changes If I'm ever going to succeed at this. I know I can. Slow and steadily reaching my goals. As of now eating clean on an exercise regimen taking care of my mental and physical health being kind to myself. Already sobriety is 1000% easier for me. In only a couple weeks I'm already seeing how capable I am of changing my life living the life I want and booze does not fit into that equation. I think whats most important is to design a life where booze could never fit then the demon is much easier to tame. Before my life felt shitty so why not pile some more on (my own irrational self destructive thinking) Anyways wanted to share that thanks for reading...IWNDWYT

Some good thoughts there. In the last 6 months I have started doing yoga for relaxation and exercise. Meditation for my mental health. These things then led to me making healthier eating choices getting to bed on time and getting a good nights' sleep every day. Even at weekend I am in bed by 10:30-11. I have felt better and more in control in this last 6 months than I ever have...It has affected my social life a bit though as my friends don't really understand when I don't want to meet up at 8-9pm and get trashed until 3-4am. I would rather go out early for a meal or a film or hang out earlier than that and maybe cook something nice instead of just hooking up for drinks...I relapsed badly on a work party last Friday and I know I now need to get back on track and sort my life out. I have conquered the demons of hard drugs weed and depression over the years. I have still yet to conquer my relationship with alcohol. Due to it being so socially acceptable and ingrained in people that events or hooking up have to revolve around getting drunk. Some people can drink in moderation. I cannot.  So I have to be strong and say no.
