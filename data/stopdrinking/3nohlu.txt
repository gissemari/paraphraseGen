I learned a valuable lesson last night. I've had a very vulnerable couple of weeks with a few relapses got to 4 days - and went to a friend's house to watch a movie. These friends know my drinking issue and always ensure they don't offer me any alcohol. So my friend Denise isn't feeling great and her husband Ben is downstairs putting the kids to sleep - so I volunteer to make my own cup of tea...I'm in the kitchen alone - and there I spot my nemesis. A bottle of red wine Italian relatively pricey - open (the cork broken on the counter-top). I took a sip. I took a second sip. And then I stopped. No one was going to know. I could always buy myself some more after the movie?..No. No I couldn't. ..I was disgusting. I don't think the moral ramifications were that high (although technically I was taking something that didn't belong to me) - but it was more the fact that I'd become the creeping disreputable creature I'd vowed never to be. If I had to be an alcoholic (the only scarlet A that I will ever have stitched across my heart) then I would be the witty funny classy one in bars and at reputable social events. Right?..Wrong...I realized last night in my friend's kitchen taking two swigs of wine that I was actually pitiable. I don't like that feeling...Needless to say my walk home was slightly longer (in the drizzling London rain no less) to avoid any off licenses. However my disgust was enough to cancel out any craving to drink. I'm not going to reset my badge for two sips - mostly because I've learned a valuable lesson from it. If disgust at my actions stops me drinking - then I'll let that be something that guides my steps.

The fact that you realised the trait which you despise is an important one.  Stay strong and take comfort in the fact that you did stop yourself and that you are starting to take control.  All the very best :)
We can be a brother and sister through this. I'm going on a "jog" at the moment where I have hidden alcohol on the journey. We can do it. Let's get ourselves back.
Secretly swilling from a bottle of wine classy--that was me too.  Fortunately I found an answer: [a bargain I keep with myself everday](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that restored my dignity and self worth and gave me HOPE.
I loved this as it resonated with me so much. I've done the same in the past plus the secret drinks in my own kitchen because my friends drank too damn slow for me but I still wanted them to think I was 'normal'. Thanks for sharing!
