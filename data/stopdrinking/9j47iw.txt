I am now sober three months and it has been an exceptionally horrendous period of time with only a few very brief glimpses at anything approaching potential happiness or relief. I'm both puzzled by and envious of those who after 12 days or so post here declaring they've unearthed a whole new mode of being are happier more productive etc. I can honestly say that I believe I was much happier optimistic less moribund and that my overall sense of being was generally better/lighter when I was drinking (wife would disagree). Not really when drinking per se but in knowing that it was there when I needed it. I'm just not experiencing the mental/spiritual/psychological benefits of abstaining (I do see the physical but even that is tempered as while I've lifted the burden of alcohol on my body and lost weight my motivation to lift weights has evaporated and I've lost a fair amount of muscle mass/strength and that makes me feel small and weak. Which of course I am. ..I've been medicated for depression/anxiety for years and I appreciate those underlying conditions could be a factor. But wouldn't the removal of alcohol allow the medications to work better by now? I'm sure it's situational too; I've been unemployed for over a year now and am fearing my professional career for which I worked really really hard is now over.  45 and ageism is a factor in my profession...Socially I'm living at our vacation/retirement home in a 'destination location' that is very remote and offers next to nothing in terms of social engagement routine normalcy etc. Being here compounds my depression as I now feel imprisoned in what used to be a purely wonderful place for vacations hopes and dreams for the future etc. Physically  I hike and walk a lot (will be skiing as well soon I hope) pray/practice mindfulness (somewhat) eat painfully healthy (b/c of wife) and have no other bad habits.   ..I quit by using Rational Recovery and I can appreciate that those in AA might call me a dry drunk as I'm not working a program or have any other outside resources/support beyond SD/friends/family. Additionally a big part of the reason why I quit was for my wife and I'm mindful of the general consensus that one must quit only for one's self to be successful. But deep down I don't believe those factors explain the lack of progress in my sobriety. Talk therapy/CBT has been tried and I have read all of the quit lit. Nothing takes hold. ..Unless caused by an accident my death would almost certainly have been and still may be be caused by my drinking had I not stopped. I guess not killing oneself by drink should be enough. And yet.

I like to fill the void of drinking with hobbies. You say you are small and weak can you start going to the gym? Natural good chemical release and working on something you feel down about? ..The treatment for depression if not working needs to be adjusted. Maybe the alcohol masked the effects or lack thereof...Can you start searching for a job or pursue training that will help in your search? Research other fields?..I get the sense from you that you are smart and capable but you've been living in this very small box of "this is who I am" and maybe don't realize that there are a number of pretty exciting possibilities out there waiting when you pull of the veil. ..I go back and forth in my head about drinking it didn't fix a lot of things in my life it wasn't a completely crazy problem but being sober made me deal with them and not hide from them. And it takes away the possibility of really screwing up my life by putting on the alcohol blinders. ..I think there is a tendency to tell ourselves or partners see I quit and it still sucks must not be the alcohol. I would urge you to be painfully honest with yourself and be open and teachable when lessons come your way...Sorry for the poor phrasing wishing you the best.
Getting sober is really hard. I regret hearing the term "dry drunk" when it's referred to others and I hope no one in AA said that to you. Shaming others is bullshit and not what any recovery program is about. ..I have heard the term form my sponsor as to why he needs to work a program. He used the cliche metaphor if you have a drunken horse thief sober him up... you still have a horse thief. I don't know anything about horses but I was a drunken self-centered righteously indignant misanthropic irresponsible cynical ass. When I removed alcohol I was still all those things. I needed to work on myself to become my truer self. ..It took some time before I started feeling spiritually connected and to see these traits pop up less. Probably around the 6-8 month mark. Working the steps helped me achieve that. I needed to examine what areas I wanted to be better at (4th) not isolate and share that with someone (5th) develop the willingness to let these negative traits go and not hold onto them as a defense mechanism (6th) and gain true humility where yes I'm not the center of the universe but I'm also not a terrible person. I'm a human that is going to make mistakes and I have accepted that. In turn I've come to accept and love who I am (7th)...These negative traits or defects pop up all the time. But now I can identify it and take action to make a change.  ..I doubt you need AA to do all that. It worked for me but I have no idea what would work for you. I have heard of people do amazing self work on their own. It sounds like you are doing pretty good work yourself. 3 months sober is great but it is early and a tough place to be at. Keep showing up keep up the effort and it will get better.
 *I've been medicated for depression/anxiety for years* ..Without alcohol in your system maybe these drugs are affecting your moods differently than before.  I'd discuss in depth with my doctor...&amp;#x200B;
I want to encourage you not to be discouraged by reading posts of other's "successes". I think there are many reasons why you see so many. To name a few a)people want to encourage others b)people are more likely/willing to share good as opposed to bad c)people are trying to convince themselves. It's good that they are there but personally I could never relate to the rosy positive posts myself either. I never had a pink cloud. For me getting sober fucking sucked. Actually being sober is actually not that bad tho. This stuff takes time and the progress is so slow and incremental we usually don't recognize it on a day to day. I've been where you are and I really hope you get to experience some of the bigger benefits of sobriety. I didn't recognize many of them until much further down the road.
