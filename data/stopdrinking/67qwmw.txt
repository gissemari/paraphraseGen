I can't believe this much time has passed. 5 months ago I got a DUI tried to kill myself survived and went to rehab. Then the doctors in rehab put me on a bunch of hardcore medications that I am still "withdrawing" from. I honestly couldn't have done it without my sponsor my faith my family and this sub. I try to make a point of coming on here and upvoting/commenting encouraging things at least once a week...Thank you all and for anyone struggling keep yo head up and just focus on getting through today!
