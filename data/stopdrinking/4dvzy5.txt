Well. Here i am. Again hungover and struggling to get ready for work. Almost got fired last week for this shit. ..I miss the year that I did sober. And frankly I remember it a whole lot better than much of anything else. ..I hated meetings. I hated AA. I don't believe in God.But it worked. ..I hate what I've become so much more. ..I'm ready for round 2.

Badge is a lie. I requested a reset
We're glad you're here. Dust yourself off. Find the strength to forgive yourself (really hard at least it is for me). If you cannot do that at least find it within yourself to be thankful that you know what you need to do going forward. ..But at the end of the day imagine you've come here to r/stopdrinking and I was here despondent about a screw up. I said I hated myself. What would you say to me? I'm serious. What would you say to me if I made a mistake? ..I bet you everything I have you'd tell me to be kind to myself. ..Please please be kind to yourself. Your mistakes are in the past. You're here. That's fantastic! ..We're all rooting for you. And we've all been where you are right now. ..I wish you the very best. ..-punnyboy 
Lets get ready to Rumble!!!
You don't need to believe in God.  I don't...You just need to believe in a higher power.   Something that is more powerful than you are.  Like the Universe...If anyone tells you differently in AA ignore them.   AA is spiritual not religious.
