I am 6 months sober today. I don't really have much to say this weeks been really busy. ..I remember starting out "hoping" for one month sober. The longest I was sober before this was just 25 days. ..It took me a year of "trying to get sober" to actually do it. I relapsed or started drinking again dozens of times. ..At one point I actually tried to hit rock bottom tried to drink recklessly enough to shock me into sobriety. ..You have to be ready but it is a simple decision to make after awhile. ..Thanks to all of you on here half a year!
