This is the longest I've gone since I was 15.  I am 37.  I was able to function but was drinking most nights.  I would drink heavily when I did though I didn't do the 1/5 of straight liquor thing.  I am a big guy and could drink many drinks over a period of time and never black out...I did however gain 40 pounds high blood pressure a red complexion.  The worse part was the anxiety negative thinking and lack of emotional peace.  Oh also the heart palpitations.  Drinking made my sleep very poor and made me very uncomfortable in my own skin...Today my blood pressure is normal.  My palpitations have stopped.  My sleep is good.  I've lost weight.  But the best part by far is the lack of anxiety.  ..I feel at peace...I believe that if anyone is struggling with any of these issues they will find relief in not drinking alcohol...I now see drinking alcohol as a choice but if I were to choose it I would very quickly re-experience those awful symptoms...Life is much better now...Peace is a better buzz.

Hey good for you! It's crazy how much better your health gets so quickly. 
Hiya. Congratulations on 60 days. I enjoyed reading your post. I can totally relate to all of the symptoms of drinking that you talk about. Im only on Day 3 but I already feel so much better. IWNDWYT.
Great to hear! ..And well done!
I'm in your camp. I have been going extended periods 10-25 days for 4 months only to go back into a period of drinking. Pretty big guy with very similar history and symptoms as you. I just feel so much better without and trying to stretch an extended period. The longer I pay attention to this issue and not slip back I feel like I will eventually be a non drinker or drink only on occasion.  Daily drinking is just not worth it. 
 Peace is a better buzz' is a good comment.
