I live in an apartment. When I drink- I binge 20-25 beers could go quickly in an afternoon and I'll wake up in full panic mode. Four O'clock in the morning and I NEED a drink to sleep I NEED a beer (or three) just to feel normal- human. I don't think in the dead of the night with neighbors upstairs that there is a louder noise in the world than cracking open a beer in the middle of the morning. ..I'm not too far from my last binge/relapse but I'm hoping I can keep this going. A lot of people talk about one day at a time but there's one minute at a time as well- and god I've been there too many times. Hoping to not reset the count any time soon. ..Hope you guys are doing well out there.

Congrats on day 15 keep up the good work !
Nice job on 15 days. The 1st 3 weeks for me when I quit this last time were the absolute hardest...What really helped me was to take walks. I know it sounds stupid but for me going on an hour to 2 hour walk would help me fight through the urges. I would time them around 4pm right around the time when I would be thinking about hitting up happy hour...And when I started waking up at 5am I would take a walk at like 6am a shorter one like 30 to 40 min but I would still do the evening walk every day for the 1st 3 months...
Congrats on Day15. As I was reading your post it was like I was reading about me. Resetting the count felt so disappointing. One moment at a time. Time is just snapshots of moments that create a picture of a day of life. I will not drink with you today. 
not drinking with you today!
You are doing so great!!!..Thank you for your vulnerable post.  We are proud of you. ..I'm not drinking with you today!
