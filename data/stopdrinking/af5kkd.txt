I used to be a bit of a fitness fanatic it helped me with my struggle against alcohol but the moment I'd stop working out work life etc I'd hit the bottle hard...This time I gave up alcohol I haven't worked out at all I wanted to stop drinking to stop drinking.I guess I wanted to prove I could give up without the crux of working out.Im not saying working out isn't a great way to get of booze it's just the moment I stopped I'd be back drinking everyday...I guess I finally feel like I can handle life without alcohol and I'm ready to go back to the gym not fearful of what happens if I can't get to the gym or my cheat day.

I can relate to this on some level.  I'm not a gym type but I would go through these all or nothing phases.  Quit smoking and drinking jog every day drink wheat grass juice and whole foods and make a lot of crafts and study really hard etc.  I'd burn myself out really.  Once I had an excuse for any part of my routine to slip I'd drop the whole thing like a cold turd and get right back to catching up on some vices.  ..I finally had to learn what was sustainable for me to incorporate and what was not.  For me quitting drinking was one thing that made all other goals possible because alcohol is something that damages my aptitude for achievement on any front. ..IWNDWYT
Exercise and booze seem to be on here a lot.  I have been going to a gym religiously for 6 years I have been sober 58 days of that time and I hope for 2 months come Monday.  My best beers of the day had been in my car driving home from the gym all sweaty and thirsty. I'd have 3 16 oz. can of Lite for the 7 mile drive and then I'd continue as I showered and settled in for the day. When I stopped coming home from the gym without a beer is when I craved alcohol the most.  I hope I am over it now but I have found I don't quite work out as hard.
