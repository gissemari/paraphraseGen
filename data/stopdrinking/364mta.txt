A lot of us are in AA here - I'm not. I have been very slowly reading the Big Book however and it got me thinking a lot about God. I know that an awful lot of Redditors are staunch atheists and that's cool. But I'm not asking the atheists here and I am not interested in wholly secular God replacements. I'm asking people who have found God or something like it within the framework of their recovery with or without AA: **What did you find and how has it manifested in your recovery and life in general?** I ask this out of genuine curiosity and hope some of these responses might help others struggling to make sense of the role of God within their recovery. I'm hoping we can share what we've found here candidly and openly without any offense taken on any side. I'll share my own answer in a comment here and look forward to hearing what others have to say.

I've always struggled with the God thing. Growing up Christian it seemed self-evident at an early age that the Bible was written by self-serving humans who wanted to control and profit from other less clever humans. Sorry Moses but you an Aaron have it pretty good in that tabernacle of yours. A crown really? This has always kept me out of Christian churches.  Despite these feelings I've always felt that there is something. There is more than our puny brains can fathom. I truly believe that human science and physics are really just scratching the surface of something much much bigger. That biggerness whatever it is and the awe I experience when pondering life and the observable universe is God to me. I don't question it much further than that other than to know deep down that it's SO much bigger than I am that I can't even fathom it. It's purpose direction and laws are so beyond me that it really is like a God. I do not believe that God is some personage who thinks and acts like humans - that seems to me a limiting and somewhat self-centered view. The whole notion of God individually tinkering with the petty affairs in the lives of humans doesn't resonate with me. That said I do believe there is something to prayer. I don't pretend to know how it works nor do I pretend there is some scientifically provable efficacy there. I just know that it works for me and for an awful lot of other people. It may be simple psychology or it could be something we just don't begin to understand. I'm OK with not knowing much in the same way many Western doctors are OK recommending acupuncture when they have no idea why it works. Despite the problems I still have with many (most?) parts of the Bible this experience has really opened me up to what all the religious people are in it for - something I never understood before. There is something to be said for feeling small and full of reverence asking God for guidance and finding that guidance when least expecting it..
I'm not atheist...but I don't believe in God...so to answer your question: No I haven't found God in recovery...Btu I have found peace with a more stable life more predictable interactions and a clear head...and that's been great!..
We just had a meeting about step 2 tonight...Yep found a conception of God in AA.  Read the big book.  Decided to give that specific conception a shot while working the action steps.  Was pleasantly surprised how it affected me.  The more I take that attitude toward god the less stress I have in my life.  ..T'was a good reminder tonight and pertinent to this post.
I would probably be one of those people who says that yes I found God in AA. Over time I came to an understanding that isn't readily described in words and is extremely difficult to discuss with someone who hasn't somehow come to that same understanding...I'm not a Christian although I was raised Catholic (sort of) and have a passing familiarity with a couple of Protestant denominations as well as a little knowledge of the New Testament. For better or worse religion seemed (and seems) like nonsense to me. The absurd symbology the downright crude conceptions of punishing dieties and the belief that not only were these not a weird mish-mash of 3000 years of folklore but that they were the *literal* truth. Not something that I a reasonable person was ever going to participate in...The God that I understand is the God that's the universe the God of Spinoza or Einstein. I don't pretend that it has any interest in me personally only that it wants what's best for the universe and for life. As a part of that universe (and I really always have been) my place is just to work to the benefit of those around me pulling the same weight. When me and the universe work together it goes much more easily. When I try to take the reins it's generally rougher and much more of a pain in the ass...I came to see what I do now by going through the steps of AA but also by reading a lot of outside literature particularly Zen writers but other faiths and time frames as well. Marcus Aurelius M. Scott Peck Thomas Merton Carl Jung. They hinted at where to look but it's only ever within us...I'm grateful to have a part in this to have some role to play because I'd never felt like I was a part of anything before. Today I see that not only was that mistaken that I am a part of a lot of people's lives but that even more impressively I'm a part of life itself. I can't explain but I think I get what the Jesus' and Buddha's of the world were trying to say.  
I feel God in my recovery lifestyle thru that which I read and those whom I relate with.specifically Buddhist teachings  
On the survey we asked the question: ..**Would you say that you have become more spiritual as a result of your sobriety?**..[Here are some breakdowns of the results.](http://i.imgur.com/0Ub6LnK.png)..[(You can do your own breakdowns on the survey site by clicking the "dig deeper" link beneath the question.)](http://sd.bot.nu/survey/2014/beliefs)..As you can see over 90% of those involved with AA answered "yes."  ..When we wrote the question I expected that 90% of *all respondents* not just those involved in AA would answer yes.  The reason I expected a different response is that many of the longer time sober atheists I've chatted with privately have reported becoming more "spiritual."  The word spiritual itself can be problematic for many and it's possible that some respondents felt *something* that others might term spiritual but declined to label it as such.  It's also possible that they felt nothing like that and that the results say exactly what it looks like they said.  There are other maybes and what-ifs...Also of note:  The sample size is way too low to draw any broad conclusions based on any of this anyway.  But it is notable I think that the AA folks nearly unanimously report becoming more spiritual...--- ..I would say that I've become more "spiritual" though I'd also be OK with calling that "more in touch with others' emotions" *and* "less concerned with myself and more concerned with the needs of others" *and* "less self-centered and more group-oriented" *and* a bunch of other things that I know I can't enumerate. Most people would probably call me an atheist and I'm certainly no believer in magic.  But I'm OK with calling it "spiritual." ..That's the way words like that work.  When we talk about "God" or "god" or "spirit" we're each talking about our own subjective interpretation of our experience with a component of (what seems to be) a universal quality of human consciousness.  Words are a terrible tool for discussing these concepts. That's not what words are for. We're each capable of being mesmerized by art &amp; poetry because words are the entirely wrong tool for the job.  In much the same way we'd be in awe of some guy who built an operable spaceship using only toothpicks and silly putty...Despite its many interpretations and misinterpretations and the many pitfalls associated with the use of charged words if we have to use words I can't think of a more concisely accurate English term than spiritual. 
I believed in God but I lost my connection with him when I was a teenager. I tried to reconnect through church but I dislike the institution and distrust Christians so that wasn't working. I was relieved to find that AA was spiritual instead of religious. I was explained to me very early that religion is for people who don't want to go to hell and spirituality is for those who have been there and don't want to go back. I still hold on to that today. In AA I developed a faith that is not defined by what I believe but by what I do.
Yes I have found God in recovery and it has given me someone to pray to who looks out for me is on my side and who has a clear head when I do not.  Prior to recovery I did not have a sense of God.
I've been going to AA meetings for almost as long as my badge says I've been sober and I am currently searching for God. The Big Book states that you can start with the crappiest idea of God and still use the program to reach a spiritual awakening so that's where I'm at. I started as an atheist who was open to believing in God but couldn't find an idea that worked for me and now I've got my crappy idea of God. I'm preparing to be awakened. Here's my story:..**PART ONE: PRAYER**..I had to open up myself to the existence of God and in order to meet Him I had to create a dialogue. It started around week 2 with prayer. I didn't have anything to pray to but I had a lot to pray for so I just went for it. I prayed for peace which meant I got down on my knees and put my hands together before I went to sleep and thought "Please let me just have peace." Then I thought *Hey that's kind of selfish* so I threw in my family members. "Let my brother have peace. Let my mom have peace. Let my dad have peace." I really focused on that idea and let it marinate in my mind. It felt good and I went to bed with a calm head. The next night I did the same thing. Repeat for a week. Then I started expanding the prayer. I got more specific. I prayed for people I'd met in AA. I tried to keep it selfless and beneficial (like not praying for a raise or anything else superficial). Basically I humble myself before the universe and ask for its assistance...**PART TWO: LUCK**..One night after I prayed for something to resolve itself the next morning it had. I got lucky. Really lucky. The thing is question was a threat to my sobriety and simply put I wasn't in the right place to handle it. I prayed to God for help and it got handled for me. Now here is where rose_the_wolf 50 days ago would have said "Pff so? You got lucky. It's a coincidence." But instead of blowing it off I thought *What if this was an act of God? What if that's all that luck is?* Luck is something that can't be credited to anyone at all so if I can pin it on God why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I see all the little coincidences and times of luck as signs that there is a God and that he's listening and ready to help? Why did I find the power to get sober in the first place? Why didn't I hit anything the dozens of times I drove under the influence? Why why why why why.....**PART THREE: READING SIGNS**..The one religion I always felt connected to was Taoism and in Taoism they often say not to fight against the river of life. Go with the flow of things. So I started reading into little signs and realizing that there is a direction to things. Like sometimes I'll be thinking something all day and then I go to a meeting and someone will lead with the exact topic I'd been thinking about. So what do I do? I listen to what others say about the topic and try to incorporate the ones that resonate into my thoughts. I feel grateful and humbled for this gift. It's easy to miss out on those little signals and not be grateful for them but they're there. Even this thread - this is a topic I've very much needed to talk about and hear others' perspectives on it so it's a beautiful thing that you posted it and I was able to see it. Who do I thank for that? God I guess...**THE STRUGGLE: MEANING**..For some reason I find it hard to believe that God created everything with a purpose. Like I can accept that everything has a flow and God is controlling the stream but I don't understand why the river is the way it is or that God made it that way on purpose. I'm not saying it isn't *true* I'm just saying it's the part I struggle with. I struggle with what it all means. Why are we even here? Why bother living? It's hard work so why do it? Looking forward to finding some answers :)
I use buddhism on and off to deal with my myriad of issues via meditation. Recently I've been trying to exclude any substance including Caffeine that alters my mind. Being mindful helps tremendously. I've created a baseline of calmness and whenever I have the desire to drink or get angry and remind myself where that baseline is and try to achieve it. It's of course a work in progress. 
GREAT question. I was really turned off of organized religion when I was young and today I tolerate it but I am not religious in a traditional sense. I am definitely spiritual and I do have a Higher Power. I refer to it as God for simplicity's sake...A big part of my recovery has been the awareness and understanding of what exactly my HP is. Today it is essentially karma. That conception evolves over time so this time next year who knows?..What I do know is my HP wants me to be sober and will give me help if I ask for it.
I found god while drunk on a rooftop in my early twenties.  God for me is an embodiment of human kind's ignorance of the universe.  God is that part of reality of existence which we do not yet understand.  Since then I've spent my life trying to kill god by working to understand some of the mysteries of the universe.  Lately in the past few years it got personal between me and god.  Starting 1199 days ago I've been working on killing god inside myself.  My sobriety began a part of my life where I am beginning to understand who I am without the filter of alcohol.  Alcohol was a force which dampened my understanding.  In that sense alcohol increases god and I no longer wanted to be a part of that trend.
I'm Catholic. Wasn't so religious in high school as some have echoed. I was "religious" to a degree while drinking. Since I've stopped drinking I've become more in tune with my faith and spirituality. I've found myself praying more attending His Mass more and just generally relying on Him more. ..Life is hard at times.  God isn't some kind of mental crutch; a mental abstraction is not enough to overcome the throes of addiction. That would be analogous to saying "well convince yourself and it'll flip the switch in your brain."  It doesn't work like that. It's a daily struggle and it is overwhelming at times. It is through His Grace I am able to keep on going. It is also a daily reminder that I am not my own either. .....I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. ..Philippians 4:13..
I have moved beyond atheism to embrace humanism it's a way more positive approach to life but is honest in its dealing with a lack of any kind of higher power. 
Fascinating thread with great posts. ..I try and be as spiritual as possible. But I dislike the word god and how it is used in 12 step programs...and even HP to one extent or another. ..I have seen no correlation between people's spiritual fitness and a belief in any type of supernatural entity or a power greater than ourselves that has any interventionist qualities. There are too many narcissistic bible thumpers in and out of the rooms to find the hypocrisy nauseating and not want to have anything to do with the word god. They confuse being spirited with being spiritual. ..I really like how /u/offtherocks describes it. ..&gt;I would say that I've become more "spiritual" though I'd also be OK with calling that "more in touch with others' emotions" and "less concerned with myself and more concerned with the needs of others" and "less self-centered and more group-oriented" and a bunch of other things that I know I can't enumerate. Most people would probably call me an atheist and I'm certainly no believer in magic. But I'm OK with calling it "spiritual."..
