Yesterday I walked myself to an AA meeting and I was really glad I did. I talked to my fiance about my real intention on changing as even I'm tired of my constant failure and relapsing. I let her know my plan- AA meeting every morning at 6:45 when possible mass and getting back to doing exercise. Oh and undertaking my past hobbies like playing guitar writing and researching my interests. ..Last night was bad though. I couldn't fall asleep and had night sweats all night. I'm also reading This Naked Mind and getting a different perspective. I mean I didn't always drink and when I didn't I didn't crave drinks. .. It might get hard but I'm set on sticking with my plan for not only my relationship but for me most importantly. I want to thank you guys for all the support and encouraging words...I know I'll get past my previous record of 9 days! .
