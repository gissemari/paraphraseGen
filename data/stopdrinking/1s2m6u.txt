*This is the daily check-in an opportunity to share your experiences and thoughts on each 24 hour cycle of sobriety. Grab a keyboard and join in!*..Today's question: **How do you deal with the fear of relapse?**..This is a controversial topic and I want to make it clear that I don't mean any ill will towards those in AA. One of the biggest reasons I decided against pursuing the program was because the concept of certain relapse without regular meetings was a theme I found prevalent in all those I attended. The last I attended I was nearly in tears the entire way home. People were making a point of not sitting near me on the tram I looked so dark...That fear dogs me quite a bit. It's taught me that I need to be active in whatever method of recovery I choose (for those just tuning in I'm pursuing spirituality and music in my own time time with a healthy dose of cognitive-behavioural therapy and gradual lifestyle changes) and not become complacent thereby fooling myself into thinking I can moderate... But it still comes up particularly this evening as I was quite tired and made the mistake of reading a pro/anti AA debate online...My answer to this was to stick to reading putting laundry on folding and putting away the clothes I'd done previously doing dishes reading meditation... I've been continuing to be as mindful and genuinely attentive and open at work which is where the mental fatigue came in. Changing your thoughts patterns in a familiar environment is bloody tough work! It's good though I can see more and more that people are reacting favourably to it. Even those that I don't normally speak to have been responding well to the increased confidence...Another factor is a conversation I had with a family member last night which ended up being a debate on when I started drinking an ultimately futile exercise particularly because she'd lose it completely if I told her I was drinking her booze when I was 11... Monkey see monkey do right? Even at 11 I was drinking in secret. I learned how to have just enough to feel different but not enough that my behaviour was off. Anyway. Left me feeling quite drained in a lot of ways. Thankfully I was able to steer the conversation back to positive things. It hurts hearing her cry but I can do nothing to change her actions... She sounded pretty drunk for 7.30pm. Defending the drinking when I was younger 'we got to work every day...' Doesn't remember the blackout arguments or any of the other shit that occured on a nightly basis. I shouldn't be writing this but it needs to go somewhere...Positive note to end this one my alarm went off I picked up my phone and read through the replies to yesterday's topic straight away kept my eyes open and was out of bed within 8 minutes. I can't remember the last time I was able to get out of bed straight away. That friends is progress. I had time to shower shave bring my crystals inside clean and arrange them (I cleansed them by last night's new moon like a good little quasi-hippie) and meditate for 10 minutes before walking rather than skating to the station getting there 5 minutes before my train. Usually I'm going hell for leather on the board to just make it to the platform in time. ..Til tomorrow yeah? And I'm sorry if this topic upsets anybody it's just been bugging the shit out of me. I feel that throwing it out there will provide some much-needed perspective.

You seem to be doing it right. Staying in touch with recovery letting emotions happen with out feeling the need to blot them out. Doing the next right thing etc. Is there more? If there is tell me and I'll do it too because I don't ever want to be drunk me again.
Well I relapsed after 8 days. I was very fearful of relapsing  after it actually HAPPENED I was like"meh". It absolutely positively made me realize that a drunk's life wasn't for me and not who I am. So now I don't fear relapsing my fear and dread is aimed at my cravings now which can really suck as we all know. 
Sometimes I catch myself having thoughts like "Well I've relapsed before so it's only a matter of time before I do so again." Then I SHUT 'EM DOWN by taking a mental inventory of all of the things I am doing differently this time such as:..* Accepting that there is no such thing as moderation for me.* Visualizing a life completely free of alcohol and constantly reminding myself to see the positives (oh so many positives).* Embracing the fact that I need a support system (this sub AA etc.).* Keeping a journal in which I write about my struggles and take note of improvements to my life that result from abstaining..I feel like in past pseudo-attempts at sobriety I've been treating my problem like a broken limb never using the available tools to set it properly allowing it to "heal" crooked and simply re-breaking it and starting over every time it causes me grief. I'm learning to do better.  
Keep my surroundings orderly. Keep my mind busy. Keep improving myself physically and mentally. Take one minute at a time. Know that I'm tough and definitely no idiot. Self medicating with alcohol is weak and stupid. I'm better than that. 
The first thing I did was to build up my set of tools for dealing with the desire to drink.  I read the Allen Carr book (in the sidebar) which I found helpful in removing that desire.  I used SMART Recovery this sub-reddit and one-on-one therapy along with a handful of AA meetings to learn tools others used to getting and staying sober...The second thing I tried to do was to not let that fear control me.  If you're constantly walking around waiting for a relapse to "happen" you're going to turn it into a self-fulfilling prophesy.  Let go of that fear and try to live life: that's what worked for me...Finally once I started getting comfortable being a non-drinker I began to address the underlying issues that caused me to drink in the first place.  I fought boredom by finding ways to exercise that I really enjoy.  I fought frustration and anger by learning (by reading and through therapy) how to deal with those situations better in life and with my marriage.  I fought depression by faking a positive attitude until I shortly genuinely had a positive attitude.  I fought a negative self-image by partnering my exercise routine with a better more balanced diet that allowed me to lose weight and feel better about myself...At this point I don't fear relapse.  I continue to make my recovery part of my life by participating here and in the webchat (also in the sidebar) talking about my alcoholism with my wife and my therapist regularly even though it isn't a "daily problem" for me anymore and I still read books on self-improvement to continually make myself a better person...---..Today is a pretty typical day work-wise.  I played tennis this morning (and last night).  I have a Krav Maga class at lunch.  And I'm playing tennis this evening too.

When I hear people talk about being in constant fear of picking up a drink even after years of recovery I wonder about the various different subsets within the broader term "alcoholic".  Meaning their (our) physiological makeup. I don't think that I am a special unique snowflake in that I can just say I'm putting down the drink and not pick it back up and never have to do another thing.  I know that I need to be on a consistent path of growth in my spirituality and mindset or I will grow complacent or stagnant which could breed discontent which then in turn could turn my head towards an escape.  But I do NOT feel like if I miss a meeting I will suddenly be driven to a drink.  I don't know if this is something that these individuals actually feel and have felt from the beginning or if that is what they believe from what they learned. If someone here could give me some insight on that I would love it.  The thing is I WANT to go to meetings because I like the release of being able to just lay it out on the table sometimes exactly what I'm feeling whether it be good or bad.  And I like to hear what others are doing to in their recovery to learn and grow so that I can learn from them.  ..So in answer to your question:  I don't fear relapse.  I have a healthy respect for the cunning baffling and powerful substance of alcohol and what it would do to me if I take even **one** drink. All I have to do is not do that!  
I literally say out loud the littany against fear from Dune:.."I must not fear..Fear is the mind-killer..Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration..I will face my fear..I will permit it to pass over me and through me..And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path..Where the fear has gone there will be nothing......Only I will remain."

I use the fear of relapse as a driving force and motivation to do the things I need to do to work towards a better quality of sobriety and spirituality. I am so terrified of the effects of the relapse though not the actual relapse itself. If I was to pick up again I would lose everything. My sanity My wonderful girlfriend my roommate and most of all myself. ...I have so much riding on staying sober I really just CAN"T drink. I haven't even been tempted though these last 11 days. Not saying that I am completely safe because that would be dangerously complacent. I am just saying the fear of losing everything to a relapse is a damn good motivator. And plus last time I picked up I had sort of a moment of clarity and started feeling completely different about drinking and alcohol after dealing with the aftermath.. I'm just happy to be sober today and I'm going to keep coming in here and participating in everything I can and maintain a high level of accountability and transparency.
I'm not afraid of a relapse any more than I'm afraid of cheating on my S.O.  Why would I fear something that I have complete control over?  If you don't want to relapse don't drink.  It really is that simple...Is fear of relapse keeping you up at night?  Is it consuming your thoughts?  Is it making you uneasy?  Spend a lot of time thinking about this:  If you never take another drink of alcohol in your life you will never relapse.  Get yourself comfortable with the idea of never drinking again and the fears of "but but but what if" will just melt away.  You never have to take another drink again.  Just like you never have to set yourself on fire.  It's all up to you.
Putting myself in the path of those that are newly sober. Works every time...This board and meetings allow that to happen. And I don't mean to sounds like I pull a benefit out of others' pain I try to offer what help I can; I just mean to say that it humbles me into a deeper sense of serene sobriety.
