60 days no drinking :)..I am very thankful for each and every person on this subreddit. I was going to say every 'Redditor' but that wasn't appropriate as yes this is reddit but you are all people people who have/are struggling with and overcoming drinking alcohol. Without each and every one of you I would most likely have relapsed. Thank you all for sharing your stories giving advice and opening your arms and helping a total stranger save his own life and in a way you saved my life. ..Stay Strong Stay Sober.

What I did today I will try to do tomorrow and then I will notch up another sober day.  Well done on your 60 days!
Thank YOU BluePatriot. You're an important part of an amazing team here...and what's cool about it is that we get to play all the positions thereby learning the game (of life) in far greater depth and detail than if we were just the quarterback kicker or tight end...Keep on keeping on brother and congratulations on the big 60! :-)
We're all in this together. Congrats on 60 days!
:)  Well done!!! 
Congratulations to you BluePatriot.. 60 is such a milestone number very well done!
Congrats [Keep up the good work my friend](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/its_working_star_wars.gif)
Thanks for sharing this. I've been avoiding this subreddit during my recent relapse for the last week or so. I've been checking in off and on throughout the day and haven't had a drink. Temptations but no drink.
