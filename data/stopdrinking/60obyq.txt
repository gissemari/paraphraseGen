Hello and good morning to everyone :)..I'm writing this post with a clear head and a steady hand. It's 10.30 am on a beautiful sunny Spring morning..Last week I submitted a post regarding an upcoming trip to NYC to celebrate my cousin's wedding on St.Patrick's day. Our re-unions generally involve a lot of hardcore boozing .(and we're actually Irish as in 'immigrant Irish')..I was also bringing my 6 y/o son to meet his family for the 1st time ever and as a single dad the idea of a 250 mile trip using public transportation was quite daunting. I'm sure many of you know what it's like dragging suitcases backpacks and a small child from one metropolis to the next. And to put the icing on the cake the scheduled journey was to take about 5 hours but ended up taking twice that (NYC traffic was un-Godly given last weeks snow storm)...Anyways we finally check-in to our hotel room and upon entrance to our suite there was literally a chilled bottle of white wine waiting for me in the fridge courtesy of the Bride & Groom. And so began the temptation. Did I cave? HELL NO!.The next day at the St. Patrick's day parade and the subsequent wedding reception (which BTW was F*cking awesome NYPD Bag-pipers open bar sensational food etc) did I cave? HELL NO!.In fact there were many opportunities to fall off the wagon over the course of our 4 day adventure. Despite an estimated 8-10 hours sleep combined over the course of those 4 nights I was still incredibly happy to wake up every morning next to my son HANGOVER FREE...Those sleepless nights were spent reading many many posts right here on SD. How happy I am that I found this forum it literally got me through The Perfect storm..As a result of not being hungover I was able to take my boy to the Statue of Liberty the 9/11 memorial and to the top of The Empire State building. I was also in a marvelous mood the whole time and not once did I make my kid cry (I'm a mean cranky ass-hole when hungover)...How different this trip could have been. I've often been to NYC for weekend getaways and have always viewed it as an opportunity to get wasted and f*cked up. The days are spent recovering inside the hotel room with curtains drawn and the nights are spent doing horrible things to my mind & body...The gratitude I'm feeling right now is worth so much. I don't have any anxiety or feel any shame/remorse. I was fully present and aware through the whole experience. My family aren't aware of my struggle (although I'm sure they have their suspicions) but I did manage to confide with my closest cousin the battle I'm facing and the determination I have to see it thorough...This was a hard test but reading a multitude of posts here on SD really got me through the long weekend. I cannot emphasize enough how beneficial it is to read your stories and recognize myself in your words and recollections...Drinking isn't for everyone certainly not for me and probably all of us on this board. I acknowledged 10 years ago that I have a drinking problem and have abstained before on a number of occasions for up to 6 months however this time feels different. I'm approaching the fight with so much more wisdom and submission. Your stories are stirring up memories within me and are giving me so much clarity in my thoughts...So to conclude we had such a marvelous trip from start to finish. My son went down a storm with the family I fully gave to him my focus and attention. We had a great time and got some awesome pictures to remember. His mom told me last night that he's still psyched about the weekend..Looking back I have been a monster towards him and my family. I cannot change the past or erase negative memories but I can change the future. My sobriety will be my gift to him and them...Have a great day to one and all..I will not drink with you today....
