I'm at day 15...and I've been here before. And somehow every time the remembrance of the "fun" party atmosphere makes me forget how good it feels to be sober during the weekend! I am and have always been sober during the week...but weekends used to be when my binges hangovers and shameovers happened. It's my second weekend since my last binge and I'm feeling so good physically and mentally...Yesterday I was a judge at a local science fair and it was a really long day (13 hours of science projects). There is no way I would have been able to stay there all day with a hangover. But it was fun and interesting and the kids taught me a lot! Today I got up and finished all of my paper grading for the trimester took the dogs for a long walk over to a friend's for a playdate. Worked on a grant proposal ran a 10k practiced yoga and discovered a new meal that I really enjoy (salad with white beans on top!). ..I'm just feeling really content and at peace with myself and where I'm at. Feeling this good makes the temptation of "partying" feel silly and unworthy. ..I'm writing this so I can look back on it probably in a few weeks when social pressure and remembering the "fun" times creeps back in. Also to encourage any of you who are still in the early days--the struggle at the beginning DOES pay off! Stay strong!..I did not drink with you this weekend!

Congrats on day 15.  Have you read This Naked Mind yet?  Link to free download in sidebar.  It really puts alcohol in another light.  I won't drink with you today.
