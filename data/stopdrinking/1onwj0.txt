I struggle with sleeping I lay awake thinking of all the things I should do or should have done. I get bored and then I get up and end up not doing much. It seems to be quite hard to sleep now... Before I would fall asleep in a minute and be able to sleep forever. I could wake up have some food and go back to sleep. Now sleep eludes me. What should I do? Skip sleep some nights? Lay in bed? Something else?

There was [a thread about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ommbq/wide_awake/) earlier today.
Try a melatonin supplement. 
Rubbing one out helps me.
Read Hello magazine.  That is what my doctor told me to do!
My sleep was fucked up for over a year. Slept differently every few days. Sometimes just a few hours then once 17 hours without a break. At day at night at noon. Very annoying. I must add that I don't have to work might would have been different then..For a few months I'm sleeping very normally about 8 hours during the night. I enjoy it very much. .It will get better is what I'm saying.
