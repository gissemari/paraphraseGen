I just turned 30. I started drinking as a young teen. I joined the army at 18 where I really started drinking. I made it through two deployments got out honorably. I hit the bottle even harder when I got out (7 yrs ago now) and managed to get my dream job (go figure). .I'm a closet alcoholic. My wife knows I struggle with it but I hide my booze from her and she rarely ever knows when I'm drunk but when she does it obviously causes problems. Other than her no one else has a clue. I only drink after work and days off. I've never drove after drinking so I guess I'm at least a responsible drunk..But when I drink I drink about half a fifth of whiskey or whatever is available. ..I drink because I always feel depressed I have PTSD I miss my army friends and I have a social anxiety issue. I don't ever feel normal unless I'm drunk. I don't feel like I can even function as a normal person unless I'm drunk. If you met me sober you would think I'm either rude or socially awkward. After drinking I'm more open more outgoing and want to actually socialize with people. ..I've been treated for depression anxiety and PTSD. I see a psych every month or two. But nothing has helped my urge to drink. ..I know there's a lot more to why I drink but I don't really want to write a book here. ..I'm here for support. I really want to live sober. I want to feel normal without the need to drink. I don't want to constantly think about drinking anymore. ..Hopefully I can find some encouragement here!
