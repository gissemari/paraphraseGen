Thank you to everyone for reaching out to me before i have been feeling a lot more motivated lately and am still putting forth the effort to work on myself I attend a support group 3 times a week as a part of my program and i decided to share with everyone my struggle with my self worth and negativity it didn't help much and made me feel awkward but i was glad to get it off my chest I worry that i may have fucked my brain up too much with the substance use or it may just be because of my lack of medication but every single day i think about death not about suicide but just about how much easier it'd be to just not be around at all I'm not really sure what sets these thoughts off but they seem to have increased once i got sober which i assume is normal but i still would rather not have to feel this way the other day my mom got a court summons for me in the mail regarding a public intox ticket i was issued back in my hometown quite some time ago it had a sentence in bold letters stating that a warrant would be issued for my arrest if i did not attend court in February which is troubling for me since i am now a few postal codes away and lack the transportation to get to my court date this is also piled on top of fines i already have to pay for the same charge and another court date i have to attend in march for a more serious and totally unrelated charge I think the penal system hates addicts like me I've been dealing with what i see as a systematic form of oppression since i was a juvenile I find it hard to exist in a world that makes it so difficult to accomplish the bare necessities in life i cant get a job due to charges i got when i was a juvenile no matter how hard i try the sober living facility i live in has been extremely generous and hasn't been making me pay full rent so i can continue to stay here i've resorted to living on free government assistance which doesn't make me feel any better i'm considering possible in patient psychiatric help since its almost impossible for me to keep my head above water when i feel everything is trying to keep me under in the depths of my addiction i had convinced myself that the government and the police were trying to get me to kill myself by making everyday life increasingly harder and harder i now realize that is preposterous but i can see where that delusion came from
