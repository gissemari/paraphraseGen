hello SD.  I'm excited to be here and pumped about taking control of my sobriety.  I've been lurking on this site for a few months and it has been so empowering and encouraging to hear everyone's testimonies successes and struggles.  I've been a heavy drinker for about 14 years and its starting to take a toll on my health.  I've been a slob of a husband son brother friend and employee.  I have three young children that need a father and not a drunk.  I'm ready.

Welcome and we're glad you are here! ..You GOT this! 
Good Luck! I would consider getting to some AA meetings if you haven't.  The local support is always super helpful.
Hello fellow parent! Welcome! Yes the kids deserve a sober parent and our spouses deserve a sober partner in life. This place is awesome and has saved me at least once already!
Welcome and good luck!
