[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I have started swimming again; this is huge for me. I found a clean bright pool in North Beach with a great view of Russian Hill. The value of making time to do something that I love and that also makes me feel great physically -- after years of feeling like total garbage -- cannot be overstated.  (A special shout-out to u/SoberSwimmer for encouraging me.)..**Struggle:** The back stairs from my apartment lead down to the street in the middle of the city. There is a small shelter at the top of the stairs and apparently several homeless people have decided this is a good place to camp out -- this means that sometimes I am in the bathroom and I see someone looking in at me through the window. (I have to tell them to leave or I will call the cops and I have had them get very threatening with me.)..**General:** After my boyfriend died when I was 28 I started to attend a grief support group. One of the counselors there asked us to make a list of all the things we loved to do no matter how silly they sounded. Then she had us put a check mark beside everything we could do for $5 or less and then a star beside everything we could do by ourselves without needing someone else to be available to go with us. Then we circled all the activities that had both a check mark and a star and we put the list somewhere prominent like on the fridge...The point of doing this was that we now had a list of things we could do cheaply and with no preparation. This was important because sometimes when you find that you have a little time to do something fun or the energy to do it you can't actually think of what to do. This is true when you are off balance from a recent death and I think it is also true when you get sober...The cheap and fun solo activities that I put on my list included browsing a pet shop or aquarium store taking a ride up the coast on my motorcycle and of course going for a swim.  ..What is something that would be on *your* list?..
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph**: Lost 14 pounds since I started dieting 6 weeks ago...**Struggle**: crushing feelings of loneliness and anxiety out of nowhere. Had a night terror last night in which I screamed leapt out of bed and injured myself. Wtf why??..**General**: I need to cut back on the coffee. I'm drinking a whole lot and I think it might be causing anxiety and/or messing with my sleep. When I don't sleep well my head gets all sorts of messed up.
Triumph: Better week at work than last. Boss's 3-week stretch of being an ass seems to have ended. ..Struggle: /u/sfgirlmary I totally feel your struggle right now. At my apartment we have a little separate building with our laundry machines. Homeless and/or addicts like to hang out in there sometimes (and the door locks so someone with a key is letting them in). I just put a load of laundry in and 30 minutes later I come back to find that someone is just hanging out in there with the door closed playing music. Need to finish my laundry but wondering if the confrontation is worth it...General: [My pupper is cute right now.](https://imgur.com/a/nZqD6) 
Triumph: I'm starting to feel alive again...Struggle: was yelled at by a co-worker with her own addictive and emotional issues yesterday. I hate being yelled at but i need to realize it's not me that is being hurt  but my ego which in a way can always use humbling. I also need to accept that others issues aren't mine and not to take it personal. ..General : one cheap thing i enjoy doing is going to the pier and just looking at the water and watching the birds fly by and the boats sailing. It's very relaxing.
Triumph:     The birthday parties and communion were amazing I had a blast!..Struggle:     I need to take a step back. Just because I'm over the moon with my sobriety doesn't mean that everything is perfect. I struggled with impatience before I drank when I drank and even now during sobriety. ..General:     I've been taking my nephew to karate classes a couple days a week - I find it amazing how much I'm learning from the discipline lessons alone. There's wisdom everywhere and it's up to me to practice and embrace it.
Triumph: I have lots of candy..Struggle: sometimes I wish I had lots of beer..General: don't do drugs
Triumph: Husband &amp; I just bought a house!..Struggle: To make sure we have enough for closing costs husband &amp; I are living off chef Boyardee the next two months...General: I'm a teacher &amp; it's almost summer. Let my heart rejoice! 
Triumph: last Wednesday I graduated inpatient treatment I'm doing the intake for iop today and I've gone to a meeting everyday...Struggle: job hunt isn't going well. I haven't worked since 2009 it was recommended I do volunteer work first...General: I'm no longer a coucher I get my own bed in this clean and sober house.
Triumph: I got back into the gym for the first time in years yesterday. My body is sore all over but hey it sure beats a hangover!..Struggles: It's mostly dealing with the lack of people I can hang out with on a daily basis and the loneliness associated with that. I used to buy conversations and attention with the bartender with my tip dollars so now I'm relearning not only what it means to be a good friend again but how to be happy alone and sober in the meantime. ..General: My new job at this local breakfast cafe has helped immensely with that "struggles" bit above. Being out and around people all day (while sober) has really begun to rebuild my confidence and it allows me this to sandbox what I'm really like as a sober co-worker friend and overall person. Also MegaCon Central Florida's super awesome comics and anime convention is right around the corner so I'm having a great time preparing all my various cosplays. Having all that cash I'm not wasting on booze anymore is a big help there!
Triumph: Every sober day gives me more data to support how much better a sober life is...Struggle: I am doing too much stuff and can't breathe...General: I'm doing the exercise described above (thanks!) and plan to spend an hour in my favorite antique store this afternoon.
Triumph: I have peace for the first time in my life. Quitting alcohol made me do my internal work...Struggle: I need expensive dental work done and have no money...General: I have it made loving husband great kids real friends I don't hate my job and SD to keep me focused on recovery.
**Triumph:** it's been a good week. Long term aspirations for building a network of folks who can facilitate SMART meetings in my city are developing. I've been an effective mentor for several of those folks...**Struggle:** They're all parenting-related. Sobriety and mental health wise I'm in a good space. That's amazing to type out...**My list:** Take the dog for a walk. Huge benefit for both of us and hard to do too much of it.
triumph: don't have so many naging thoughts about past failures anymore... I am here and now dealing with whats dealt little by little..struggle: can't find a job I would like. Maybe I am being too hopeful and just need to be back in school before dreaming big..general: started liking doing stuff again. creating music writing reading... life is good sort of... better
Triumph: I am down 24 pounds from where I was a month after I quit drinking (sugar cravings packed on a few pounds). I look fantastic. ..Struggle: I find myself getting angry at certain family members right now even though I know everyone deals with grief in their own way. I'm having a hard time keeping my cool. I want to grab my step mom and tell her to make the most of these last few days with my dad. But she is on her own path. I cannot change other people. ..General: my less than $5 solo activity is jewelry making. I didn't bring my stuff with me (I'm nine hours away from home right now) and I'm missing my mindless but satisfying hobby. Can't wait to get home put something fun on Netflix and make necklaces. 
**Triumph**: sober!..**Struggle**: I've been a bit loose with my health since the marathon: minimal exercise junk food. I'm feeling slow and chubby...**General**: the school year is coming to to a close. Free/easy stuff we like to do include going to the public pool strawberry picking geocaching and board games.
Triumph:  Understanding that just because they are family does n         mean they are nice people...Struggle:  I really need to get this sugar monkey offa my back!..General:  We are having such a wonderful spring!..
Triumph: My contract has officially been renewed for another year and I got a raise! It wasn't a huge raise but it's really out of the norm for a contract worker where I am to get one and it feels good to be recognized like that :) ..Struggle: We hosted a birthday party for my granddaughter over the weekend and some people decided to bring their own booze. There's a lot more to the situation and I'm trying to be understanding that people deal with things in their own ways. But it pisses me off that they couldn't just make two hours out of their day about the 3 year old...General: I need to get more active I keep saying I'm going to start walking when the weather gets nicer but it's been so rainy and cold here. Excuses excuses. 
Thanks for posting as always sfgirlmary. Sorry to hear about the homeless people camped out- hope that situation gets better...Triumph: I went to a new Sunday School class this past Sunday! Going to new things / new areas especially by myself is really hard for me and I'm really excited I was able to pull it off...Struggle: I've been really sleepy lately and sleeping a lot more then normal. I'm not sure why. I work from home most of the time and have been having to take naps during work which I hate to do...General: I like the list idea. Even though I'm not going through any grief lately I go through rough patches (like everyone does) and a list might help.
**Triumph:** Did self-care while visiting my alcoholic father: running meditating.  Had a lovely visit reconnecting with my 2nd mother. At 80 she is witty sharp as a tack and a tough broad. Such a role model! And she doesn't drink...**Struggle:** Watching my father suffer the effects of his drinking. I am worried he has ascites. I love him so but drinking has made him someone I no longer like and it's painful and sad to visit him...**General:** cheap and easy for me to do would include reading/browsing in independent bookstores trail running and hiking journaling in a coffee shop and exploring a new part of the state for the day. I got tired years ago of waiting for people to be available for fun things and started taking myself out to dinner and on outdoor adventures. One of the best things I've done!
**Triumph:**  Well even though on only have two full days under my belt I'm kinda kicking ass at work (and it's not going unnoticed) :)..**Struggle:**  Work aside I'm alone...a lot.  I have to maintain structure to meet my daily goal of sobriety...**General:**  I'm giving my body and mind a few more days maybe a week and then I'm getting back to the gym.  However I feel like I need this initial transition time to 'reset' so to speak.  Maybe that will cut down on the loneliness.  
Triumph: my brain feels clear I can think normally waking up is so much easier (and I actually want to get up) I got a new job I did a bunch of yard work ..Struggle: craving the sweetest possible things at night -- my body misses the alcohol..General: I want another tattoo
TRIUMPH: Bought a house  .STRUGGLE: The house is a beautiful mid century but a fixer upper and this is already causing me quite a bit of anxiety (but I still have the vision!)...GENERAL: On my list would be calling my parents...they always want to talk to me and I always feel so loved after I hang out with them.
mary it's rad that you started swimming again and it sounds like it's in a beautiful setting. what a treat!..**Triumph:** not only did my new job start but i'm having a bunch of freelance gigs i pitched for come through (of course! the timing! of course!). i'm a little stressed about time but i'm not going to complain about the money not for one second...**Struggle:** i've felt real fucking flinty the last couple of days--like i want to start a fight. i fully recognize this is steeped in some unresolved emotional shit and a pattern established by my family of origin--start a fight so you can blow up get it all out and then attempt for a superficially satisfying "resolution." it's not a healthy manner of dealing but i haven't quite figured out what else to do with this kind of feeling so i'm trying to sit through it. it makes me feel pretty ugly tho. ..**General:** SPRING IS FINALLY HEREEEEEEE. i'm ready to get my sundress-fueled flirt on.   ..as for things on my list: playing ukulele walking to the rose garden painting laying in the park with a book. 
Two days in (did my badge wrong) and I'm already seeing a small decrease in my shakes. Also last night I was around people drinking and said no!..I might be unavoidably around people drinking tonight and I'm nervous. Wish me luck!
Triumph: made it through yesterday without a drink. It wasn't nearly as challenging as I had thought it would be. I like repeating to myself: "I'm making a conscious decision NOT to drink today". ..Struggle: Taking it a day at a time... trying to focus on keeping that consciousness and visualizing what a new life might be like...General: I love dogs :) Dogs are totally and completely great!
T:  I called my doctor to get my antidepressants filled.  Depression is just so debilitating at times that doing anything besides laying in bed is an accomplishment. ..S:  School as usual.   It's spilled over into every facet of my life.  There is a high probability that I'm going to fail but I haven't given up yet.  Just to be in this position makes me angry and frustrated but I don't have time to dwell on these emotions cuz I've got studying to do...G:  I like going hiking.  I also like going to book stores and reading books and magazines about art (without paying for them!) evil to the core.   
**Triumph:** 1/2 through my first week of work and I am not dead. Intact I'm really enjoying it mostly. I am making friends? Not like "let's go do something friends" but "hey how are you  how's blah" kinda friends which is nice for a change so the ReHeaded[Hermit]Riot is evolving! lol..**Stuggle:** work is pretty physically demanding so when I got home to a destroyed house yesterday and family drama - I straight up cried.  So I need to work on grounding? Or figure out what it is I need to work on. ..**General:** My list would be walking/canoe/parks art &amp; driving with blazing music signing at the top of my lungs. 
Triumph: yoga is going so well and it's felt really natural to transition into eating loads of veggies and whole foods. Ditching the "fuck it" attitude I had towards alcohol has made huge waves in the rest of my lifestyle too...Struggle: my puppy is cute but holy shit he's so crazy and high maintenance. So much energy and we can't even take him to do the dog park anymore because he humps everybody. Truth is that life for our family would be so much easier without him but I'm trying to remind myself that if we stick it out it will be worth it. Lots of stress in the meanwhile though :( ..My list! Free things I enjoy are hiking playing albums knitting going on long walks while listening to podcasts cooking. 
Happy Wednesday guys! Thanks for staying sober with me...Triumph: I am halfway through my school program. At 35 with a family going back to school is fucking HARD but I'm halfway done!!!! ..Struggle: still battling a lot of newly sober sadness boredom and anxiety...General: I also can't wait to get back into a pool. ..Love to you all and I won't drink with you today. 
One day at a time 
**Triumph:**  250 days yo!  ..**Struggle:** That stupid voice is kicking back up saying "You're not really that bad.  You are going to want to drink a cold beer at the lake this summer.  You aren't really quitting forever are you?"  It's stupid and I just ignore it.  The idea of a cold beer is better than the actual thing...**General:**  I have a list like this that I made the first month I quit drinking.  I like making lists.  At the top of my list is bike riding.  It's something I really miss doing.  I lived in cities all my life and biked around tons.  When I moved into the country I stopped riding.   I figured out that there is a path that is mostly off the highway that I can ride to get to work.  It's just 7 miles each way. This week I bought a bike and I've been biking to and from work since.  I hope to do this nearly every day that the weather is nice.  And on Fridays I'll take my collapsible fishing pole and a towel and jump in the river on the way home.  Yay for summer!!!!!
Triumph: Hey yesterday was 90 days...Struggle: Interviewing for jobs sober is really hard...General: Avoiding politics and the news. Too stressful.
Triumph: I'm about to close on a house...Struggle: I am definitely struggling to get a promotion and it's discouraging...General: Life's good.
