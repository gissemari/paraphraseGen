I struggled this morning. My sister bought me a really thoughtful birthday present to use for brewing beer; like my favorite thing to do when I was drinking. I had to tell her that I quit drinking and can't accept the gift. She is awesome and loves me and supports me but I was so mad and embarrassed for "letting her down." Like how many times have I said "no more drinking"... but this time I can't even accept her gift. The thoughts were like "I wish I was strong enough to drink like a normal person so I could accept her gift." ..That was really tough to work through in my mind. I plan to talk with her give a heartfelt thank you and just tell her that I want to be sober because I am a better person dad uncle and brother. I know she will understand but it's just crazy how twisted my mind can get sometimes.

.Maybe she can return it for the refund and get a different gift. But also depending maybe try to photocopy the receipt first and use that as one more reminder. ..
It is crazy!  I'm sure your sister will agree that you being sober is most important and wouldn't want you to feel guilty about this.  My brain tries to make me feel guilty for everything right or wrong that I've done.  I've decided if it didn't happen today it's history and I refuse to let that voice berate me over it.  Congrats on 18 days of sobriety!!
