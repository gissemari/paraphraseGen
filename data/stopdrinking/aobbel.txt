Well I'm pretty proud of myself at the moment. I'm nearly 9 months sober coming off 20 years of daily drinking. I ended up doing a rehab program that I really learnt a lot about specifically myself and dissecting why I was self destructing. I was open to admitting my own behaviors rather than always looking for someone or something to blame. So the last time I relapsed 2 years ago I accepted that it was my own undoing from getting resentful and angry and not expressing it. I've just had a pretty significant difference of opinion with someone close and instead of keeping it to myself I was completely honest and faced the problem head on. I feel good because we managed to face the issue and talk it through. I would have drank on those emotions in the past and nothing would have been solved. I'm happier sober than I ever was before I really hope everyone else has such significant growth in their sobriety. I will not drink with you today!
