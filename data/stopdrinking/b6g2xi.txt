Except I haven't had any booze in 2 weeks. But I did have a lot of dairy and sugar last night and I woke up with the horrible 'I'm never drinking again' hangover. Which just helps remind me why I should stay on this path. Today makes 2 weeks and I'd been struggling with the urge for the last few days. So my junk food hangover pretty much came at the right time.

Maybe having a lot of sugar before you went to bed kept you awake. 
Phantom hangovers can be just as distressing as the real thing.  Take comfort in the fact it wasn't caused by alcohol probably did far less damage to your body and won't last as long or be as emotionally taxing.  IWNDWYT.
