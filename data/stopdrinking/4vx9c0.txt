[It's. that. day. again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** Had a good conversation last weekend with a friend who thinks that he might be drinking too much. I just listened and let him sort of go through his thought process about his drinking habits and it was nice to be able to be there for a friend like that. We talked about moderation and fully quitting and he is gonna see what works for him. ..**Struggle:** Besides the ongoing battle with sleep been sort of a decent week for me which is nice. Work isn't too bad got to enjoy a relaxing weekend and it's getting slowly closer and closer to my vacation in October. Still wish I could feel more well rested when I wake up some days it feels like I didn't sleep at all. ..**General:** I love a good tune and there are some songs that always remind of me of certain times places and events in my life. Any time I hear [this awesome song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0hr2HWOohM) I'm immediately put at ease and reminded of the awesome time I had with a special person at the concert we went to a few years back. Instantly calms me down to hear those first organ lines. ..So SD what's one song that's special to you and why is it special?

Triump: Being sober is starting to feel like the norm. Yesterday I was the chauffer for the day running my daughter and friends to various places for her birthday.   That was very cool - thay had a great time. I was the calm and collected driver...Struggle: Having the same circular arguements with my oldest boy who needs to flee the coup. He spews this poor me victim attitude that I instilled in him. Struggle to change the situation. Time has come to part ways and let him deal with his own monster...General: You know it all seems better overall but there are no hurrah or eureka moments to show things are getting better. Is this ball of anxiety in my stomach getting smaller am I getting used to it or am I getting better? I'll keep working all the skill builders but wish for more wind in my sails.
Triumph: I went to a meeting yesterday and opened up about what has been going on with me lately and that felt good. .Struggle: Been thinking to much about the future and what the rest of my life is going to look like and I can't really picture anything. Kinda don't know where I'm going in life but I just know wherever that is I have to get there sober. .General: Just trying to focus on today and not allow myself to feel to depressed or sad. I'm alive.
Doing the math.  It's just not worth it. We all know that drinking doesn't make anything better. The brief escape from life only brings us regret. In contrast not drinking brings us a great sense of accomplishment pride and the love and appreciation of those around us.
Triumph: I have the tendency to white knuckle things to keep my emotions private and to avoid being honest with myself and others. This week I have let go a lot partly due to a magical new therapist whose instructions I'm following rather than trying to make all the decisions myself. It has been a huge relief to trust someone else and float down the river. The floating has brought me to day 11...Struggle: I have trouble speaking to my biological mother who has addiction issues and an untreated mental illness. Interacting with her is a trigger for me but I also feel guilty not responding to her constant texts and not opening her letters. It just makes me sad. ..General: I'm on my phone so I can't be fancy and embed a link but this song is important to me - http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gzCR-LY26VY because the lyrics are so closely related to my life situation. It's comforting. ..Like the widest river like the brightest morn.there is hope where you can't see it. .There is a light after the storm. But won't you help me to get through it? I've been flailing like a child. My mistakes they are so many for my lovin heart is wild.
**Triumph:** Cooked dinner for friends and had a lovely alcohol-free evening. Can't remember the last relaxed happy time hanging out...**Struggle:** My relationship to time.  ..**General:** After this last purchase and consumption of a bottle of wine followed by dark despair followed by seeing the way again  I have been pretty centered and happy. Not drinking has moved from a "should" to a "want" and I know now that no matter how smart I think I am how on top of life I think I am the deeply encoded *habit* of drinking is ready to awaken if I drink just one drink.   In the past five days I've done a mountain of yard work rejoined my local Y listened to and practiced lessons in Mindfulness Based Addiction Recovery spent two days in the jury selection process for a murder trial (dismissed thank god!) and have otherwise been occupied with both necessary and pleasurable activities. .
Triumph: Despite not really enjoying it at all I'm totally starting to get better at yoga. Not dreading it so much and I do feel the benefit of it. Also had 5 fruit and veg each day for a week now. ..Struggle: I really do think i have to put my parents out of my life. They are a constant drain of everything and through talking with a therapist I keep getting told that my happiness is important and to box off that part of my life but it's so difficult. ..General: Gonna have steak for dinner. 1 month 2 days until I'm a full time Stockholmer. ..
Triumph: I found a potentially major medication error in a patient while I was working. I find myself missing ICU nursing where my interactions had a direct impact on patient care but this was a reminder that I can still make a difference...Struggle: I am feeling more and more restless and trapped in a life that I don't want but I have no feasible way of escaping except by removing myself permanently...General: Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd. I overdosed and almost died when I was 12. The first thing I remember after coming to in the ICU was my brother singing this song to me.
**Triumph:** Things are ticking along pretty well. I like this as my new baseline state...**Struggle:**  I've got big projects and hard deadlines looming. I'm not making as much progress as I'd like towards them and getting stressed. I have to manage myself carefully because a round of depression or a bunch of cravings will not help...**Music:** When I stopped drinking I went through a puberty-like flood of emotions. I played the hell out of the Heartless Bastards and [No Pointing Arrows](https://g.co/kgs/BDh1t4) was one that always hit me hard.
Triumph: Last night ended a dysfunctional codependent relationship very gracefully including confronting her about cheating on me. mutually agreed to give each other lots of space and begin our sober paths separately and expressed hope for being friends in the future with the condition that sobriety is the absolute top priority even over future friendship..struggle: facing the uncertainty of the road ahead the coming challenge of reevaluating my choices values and current "friends"..general: glad to be back on sd and looking forward to reclaiming my life.
**Triumph:** 30 days. A while ago I would have said this was impossible...**Struggle:** I'm having some trouble with my physical health. I may have anemia but I won't find out until the doctor who ordered the tests comes back from his vacation. I almost hope there's something wrong with me because if being this tired is my new default I don't know what I'm going to do...**General:** There are so many songs I'd like to share! I have trouble picking just one. The first that comes to mind right now is [Twenty One Pilots' "Hometown"](https://youtu.be/pJtlLzsDICo) which came up in my shuffle the other day and listening to the lyrics it suddenly took a new meaning to me. ..The song is originally about God but to me it became about turning away from addiction and turning to what life has to offer. The chorus ("we're were from there's no sun our hometown's in the dark") made me think about myself and the people I've met in AA meetings and on here. We were born in a dark place self-destruction is kind of our default setting. But that's only where we're from nothing is stopping us from leaving for somewhere better.

Triumph: I think I hired a new chef for the restaurant. This will be a huge weight off of my shoulders not to mention the stress/burden it has put on my kitchen staff..Struggle: Having a real hard time motivating myself to do much of anything other than go to work which I'm hoping will change now that my staffing issues are under control. I'm eating like crap because I don't want to cook not going to the gym enough not doing much of anything really. A lot of internet and netflix. It doesn't feel like depression more like ennui. Thankfully there aren't any cravings for booze involved but maybe I've lost my pink cloud?..General: I'm supposed to go visit my sister in New York next week which I've been a little anxious about. Most trips to NYC for me are nonstop restaurants and bars. My sister knows I'm not drinking and I'm planning on not really letting anyone else know I'm there and keeping it a pretty low key visit this time around. I mean there's gotta be something else to do in New York City other than drink.....right?
Triumph: have been having to have Difficult Conversations at work. I'm not done with them but as I struggle with them I know they have to be done and why I have to do them. I've been going through fear anxiety and doubt but getting through both the conversations and emotions nonetheless...Oh- and I have another day without drinking...Struggle: Patience. I've someone in my life who's been injured for a long time not doing very much to help themselves. They aren't afraid to lean on everyone around them but then go off to cause themselves more harm. Not my problem but I hate seeing someone I love hurting themselves and the anger I feel though real isn't useful. They've recently made some changes in their life that should help. Fingers crossed. ..General: Listening to Chuck Mangione's Feels so Good right now- it's a good song for this beautiful morning. 
**Triumph:** Really sticking to not drinking this time around and reaping the benefits of not being hungover. Breaking the chain!..**Struggle:** There's 2 big ones. One is that I've been abusing food like I abused alcohol which means binge eating on the weekends. The other is I don't make enough money as in I don't know when the shoe is going to drop and I'll be... homeless? I'm not sure sure what happens when somebody "runs out of money". Maybe I'll just have to be one of those working poor types who uses the food banks...? I should stop buying the junk food...**General:** Feeling ok this morning. The long weekend just passed and I felt like garbage yesterday morning. I hate the idea that I can't handle a day off...!!! Wtf? I'm that bound to routine?
**Triumph:** Only a couple of weeks in and I'm barely even thinking about alcohol. Committing to sobriety is *so much easier* than trying to moderate my drinking...**Struggle:** My doctoral thesis is due in three days! Feeling the pressure...**General:** Went to the doctor yesterday for a checkup and found out I gained 15lb since my last visit. There's the beer gut. Time to ramp up the exercise and start counting calories.
Triumph: Checking in on this forum for the first time. Sounds small but a triumph in my book. Usually my desire to be sober stems from an embarrassing episode but this time I woke up Monday just so tired of feeling like shit. Enjoying not feeling like shit for the last 2 days has been such a treat...Struggle: heavy social drinking for 15 years but the last 3 have clearly morphed into big problem drinking. Getting through the evening without the usual 5-7 drinks seems interminable. I have a career and a family and I am not used to doing the post work domestic grind sober. It's hard. ..General: Listening to a lot of paul simon bruce hornsby and marc cohen. My dad was a functioning evening drunk too and and he died at 50. These songs make me think of him all the good and bad and the reality- I could be dead at 50 if I don't stop poisoning myself every night...
Triumph - Tried a new yoga/acupuncture workshop at a new studio.  Was more honest than usual with my SO about my drinking habits instead of being defensive agreed it was a problem and took the words out of his mouth by describing it as *really scary*.  ..Struggle: Worried I'm gaining weight as I'm not regulating my diet at all and I'm not exercising to compensate and I can't quite gather the motivation to get crackin'.  In due time.  And my finances are a disaster. ..General: In January I signed up for Talkspace (online therapy) and quit my job.  In the last 6 months now looking back I can see there's been a lot of progress not as linear as I might have hoped but I'm trying to trust the process and know if I keep doing the work and not drinking all my other problems diet finances etc should work themselves out.  I used to have fatalistic tendencies - but am learning that I can change and I am. ..One of my favorite songs is Sinnerman by Nina Simone. 
**Triumph**: Honestly at this point the triumph is I'm no longer in that state of questioning whether or not giving up alcohol is the right choice. At the beginning I had such strong doubts about whether or not it would make me happier or make my life better. Now? I'm very certain that I've made the right choice. That has brought a lot of peace to my mind...**Struggle**: Anxiety depression and a lack of a romantic interest. I've always had a girl in my life it seems. Or multiple girls. I guess I like it that way to keep my mind off other things or to keep me happy. Now I'm forced with making myself happy and not having to rely on others. I think this will be for the better in the end but right now it is a struggle...**Music**: Guys check out this song. It's called Spirit Cold by Tall Heights. Fantastic stuff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqoiWxQsNSI
Triumph: My interests are coming back I have interests! I had this really strong desire to make something the other day nothing in particular but I wanted to follow instructions and make something with my hands. So I downloaded a new knitting pattern and broke out my needles and yarn. It's been a couple years since I knitted but it scratched that itch to do something. ..Struggle: When I was about a week in I got rid of or donated all of my bar swag. One of the benefits of being a regular I guess but I had tons of stuff pint glasses t-shirts even chap stick with a breweries logo on it. All except this one shirt that I can't seem to get rid of. As I was folding laundry last night it popped up again because it's still in my rotation. Why? I tell myself it's because I really like the shirt it's green it fits well it has a cute goat on it. But there's so much more behind it it's like letting this last one go would mean I'm done for real. It means I won't be drinking 12 packs of the beer this shirt has a logo for come spring time. I don't know I know I should have just put it in the trash last night and been done with it but instead I folded it and put it in the drawer...General: I heard [Ain't No Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz0JXbwNUk8) by the Avett Brothers on the radio the other day and it really stuck with me. It's become like my sober theme song lately.  
Happy Wednesday!..**Triumph:** I am exercising losing weight and eating healthy again after an extended foray into laziness and eating too much and too rich. Also I have been stepping up my self care game which is something I could never keep on top of when I was drinking...**Struggle:** My dad (who is an active alcoholic) has decided to leave the country and I am experiencing lots of mixed emotions as I help him wrap things up here. On the one hand it is a good choice for him he will be with family and his money will go further there. On the other hand I will have no one from my family in this country anymore and I kept holding out hope he would get better and be a dad to me again and a grandpa to my kids. I know this is for the best. Just...feelings...**General:** Here's the song I'm obsessed with right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZlbahhoEIo
Triumph: I passed an extremely difficult teaching pre-certification test to get into an alternate teaching training/program. I've wanted to become a teacher for years but never felt brave enough to do what it would take to get certified. I'm just waiting on transcripts to get started! This time next year I can be a teacher. &lt;3..Struggle: I think the "pink cloud" is wearing off. I don't want to drink but am finding myself sad that I'm not like "normal" people. I have to remind myself that everyone has their shit and that tomorrow Friday five years from now aren't worth worrying about. I'm sober TODAY and feeling good...General: I made overnight oats for the first time and they're delicious plus incredibly easy to throw together. New healthy breakfast in rotation!
**Triumph:** I hosted a fundraiser at my business in response to the Orlando shooting.  We raised hundreds of dollars which we donated to an organization that supports gay and lesbian Muslims.  Everyone worked hard some people got a lot of sh*t for it but they did it anyway.  I was really proud of everyone...**Struggle:** I hate my day job and have used alcohol as a coping mechanism for many years.  It serves as a nice filter when things get stressful...I've almost never been hungover at work but when I drink the first thing that goes is me caring what time I get to bed.  So I'd show up to work too exhausted to even care about all the stress and drama going on.  Now that I'm feeling a bit more energized and less sluggish I've been getting more stress and anxiety about the day-to-day stupidity of my job and I'm having a tough time dealing with the emotions without the alcohol to shield me from them...**General:** This isn't as hard as I thought it would be.  Since we seem to be on a musical bender I love metal.  Another Reddit user recommended [Nine Treasures](https://ninetreasuresband.bandcamp.com/) to me and they're freakin amazing!
Triumph:  I'm on day 29 now been able to hang out with my friends who drink the past two weekends with only a moment or two of weakness. ..Struggle: Grandma was in the hospital over the weekend wasn't able to visit which bummed me out but she got out monday and is doing better. ..General:  [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovtpawjxo1g) song (Withered- Dark Lotus) is always one of my favorites to relax listen to and get a little sad.  I have a special spot in a pine forest I like to go to and think about things when I get the chance.  It  reminds me that life is ever changing and that can be good or bad.   My favorite verse from it is:.."I'm all alone again no one to talk to..Nobody wanna be the friend that i want to..I thought you could come through and help but instead you just left me to wither in hell..Now how can i tell the rest that I'm leaving and the cause of death is the season..I change up and i wither away resurrect in the moon when the sun turns grey..When i watch em all turn away there's not a thing i can do except watch it all change..I can listen to the trees speak to the weak leaves as they fall like soldiers in war..As they form a pile right in from of my eyes..All praise to god for these other four"
Triumph: My wife and I meet for dinner on Monday night. We were awkward at first but it went really well. She noticed how great I look and couldn't keep her hands off of me. At the end of the night we were laughing and enjoying each other's company again. It was nice to show her I've changed...Struggle: I'm not sure if I'm capable of a relationship right now or ever will be. I ask myself everyday if I want to make our marriage work. I'm a recovering addict and life with me will not be easy. We've always wanted to have children but now I feel if I eventually have a child. Should they have to go through life with an addict as a parent? It seems very unfair to pass that burden on. ..General: This song reminds me of the crazy that was my life and the yearning to be stable. In the past 115 days for once in many years I feel physically and mentally stable again..https://youtu.be/h8ljNixuCwc
Triumph: I'm studying again! And it's going pretty well...Struggle: Feeling like I don't know where I belong in the world. I realized I'm pretty lonely insecure unsure and even when things are going ok I tend to see everything in a negative light. I'm taking the necessary steps that I know will help me feel better (i.e. being sober losing a bit of weight socializing with people) but at the end of the day I still feel empty. I also started smoking again which I really want to quit asap...General: Mr Robot introduced me to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhB6Lb7_kN8) and it just makes me feel a bit calmer and happier about life. 
Triumph: I woke up sober today and earlier than usual without an alarm. I'm excited to think that my biological rhythm might shift to something more normal. ..Struggle: yesterday (day 2) I bought la Croix to have something to sip on while cooking and cleaning. I didn't have cravings but I wonder if this will be a struggle (uncoupling wine-drinking from cooking and cleaning). I sipped the La Croix at the same rate I would wine; it was a bald substitution. I don't know if that's a good idea but if it helps for now I'm going with it. That's how I quit smoking way back yonder by substituting sunflower seeds to keep my hands and mouth busy...General: this is all very new and I'm happy to have you SD and your stories. I have a dinner tonight and I imagine some will order a drink but I'm not going to and it's going to be fine...Edit: [a song I love.] (https://youtu.be/h6wnrEaL_7Y) I think this will be a good sobriety theme song for me. It's a little dark but so is the struggle right now. I'm too old to die young sounds grim but it's also an honest admittance that I'm done glamorizing the idea. I'm giving it up. I can find beauty in the demons being exorcised and still say goodbye forever.
**TRIUMPH**  ..I hit 100 the other day and just kept cruising asking. My choice to not drink is becoming common place in my family which is great. No one asks about it or treats me any differently. It just IS. And that's all I want.   ..**STRUGGLE**  ..We decided to foster a pair of litter mate kittens despite me being really allergic. See we want a dog. We're dog people. But we just don't have the time to devote to a puppy right now. So we decided to try a cat out. They make hypoallergenic breeds that I've had some success being around. We got in touch with a breeder met his cats even got a bank check for the  500 dollar deposit on a 1200 dollar kitten...and then just felt so frigging guilty about not going the shelter route. SO we decided to foster thinking fostering isn't permanent and if I really can't handle the allergies then no real harm done and we can check off the shelter cat box and move on to the pure breed. One thing I did not expect : I'd fall wildly in love with [Ellie's sweet and vulnerable face](http://imgur.com/HxQungt) or Dean's [needy curiosity with everything you're doing and his insistence you stop it and pet him](http://imgur.com/css51iQ). I think it's hilarious I know know know I can't rewire my brain to have a healthy relationship with alcohol yet am expecting to rewire it to not attack pet danger particles. Do we ever really learn?   ..**GENERAL**  ..My boyfriends step mom seems to think she knows all there is to know about my allergies and has not wasted time in letting ME know. Well. She may not be wrong but she'll never hear that out of my mouth. These little guys are pretty much family. So eat shit Donna.

I guess this is a struggle/triumph/general all-in-one but I realized that my cravings for booze really come about between 6-8pm during the week. That's the time I get home from work making dinner unpacking the kids stuff etc and I just want to have a drink to relax. One drink leads to two and so on. So anyway I found if I can get through this 2 hour-ish window by like 8pm the craving is gone and I don't wanna have a drink at all just not interested. As I beat back the habit I suspect it will get easier but being sober and having a clear head I see my habits for what they are now it's a night and day difference...I'm not drinking today :)
Triumph: I am kicking ass in school (finally nearly graduating after 7 years). Prospects of grad school look great. Some pieces of mine will be published this month! Oh and I recently got 4 months!..Struggle: Went on a couple of dates with a girl. Things were great but I guess I was more into her than she was into me. That's fine I still she thinks an awesome gal. Unfortunately my coping methods are still developing so I was pretty down in the dumps for 3-4 days. Today is better though. I hit a morning meeting and it really helped me regain some serenity!..General: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8nbzBkxAJQ since we are kind of doing songs this tune was really important to me in early recovery.  
**Triumph:** Nothing specific.  Just the fact that I've been sober so long is good enough for me.  ..**Struggle:** I've been wanting to talk to my ex again lately.  That in itself is bad but she's also kind of a train wreck.  Having her in my life would make for a hell of a struggle to stay sober.  ..**General:** This is a new account.  My old one that I've done all my /r/stopdrinking posting under is /u/NotRye.  I honestly prefer my current username so I'll be posting from here for now on.  And that reminds me I'll have to set up my badge.  And is there a way to delete a badge so that it doesn't reset?
Triumph: I tried Muay Thai boxing for the first time. I kind of sucked but it was so much fun. I am definitely going to try again. And after I finished as I had my trainers at work I ran all the way home. ..Struggle: I realised I am very unhappy in my new job and tomorrow I have to pluck up the courage to quit and then I plan to move nearer to my parents to start working freelance. Something I could never achieve while drinking. ..General: The stopping drinking has also had the nice side effect that is that I haven't smoked in two weeks either. And that means I can run better and stronger. Feeling good today. .
Struggle: Cycled to a friends for company and entertainment. A glass of red wine was poured.  I felt ridiculously uncomfortable and scared. I took one sip and was lost. So much for 3 days sober. I know I shouldn't be too hard on myself but I really want to lose this intense connection with alcohol I have but I feel too weak. Good news though I stopped at two glasses. 
**Triumph**: Finally bought some brogue wingtips to go with my evolving style since I quit drinking and care aboutwhat I look like. I also dead lifted 305lbs yesterday and have gained 15 lbs of muscle over 8 months.....**Struggle**: Girl I was recently seeing says she isn't ready for 'real stuff' as she just came out of a recent marriage about a year and a half ago. Basically ended when she got the hint I wanted more than FWBs.......**General**: I really need to find some friends and get out more often.
