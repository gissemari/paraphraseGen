I made it to 20 days in October &amp; relapsed also ended up buying some mdma &amp; went on a 2 day binge. Could barely work today. I feel so full of shame about it &amp; so frustrated / angry with myself. I just don't trust myself any more

stop beating yourself up accept you messed up learn something from it and apply to the rest of October then continue on with the rest of your life &lt;3 Takes the same amount of energy to berate yourself and feel bad as it does to turn it into a positive [High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) for coming back. I had half a bitch beer two nights ago but I dont think I am gonna reset. I think the shame and puking were enough punishment lol. Lesson learned. You are not alone - we don't shoot our wounded here.
I understand it's hard enough regaining the trust of others but trusting yourself is a whole different battle. It's hard when you don't trust yourself because you can feel like you're loosing control. But if you get back on track it will come with time. Self loathing and frustration are what caused me to continually relapse. It's hard not to beat yourself up and to move on but just start today and try to say clean as long as you can. Once the farther you put this behind you the more you will start to trust yourself again. That's the best advice I can give you. Best of luck with your recovery and stay strong my guy. 
Glad you came back...Have you thought about attending AA/NA meetings?
