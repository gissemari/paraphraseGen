I just broke up with my girlfriend and considered a post here to restate the fact that I'm not going to drink over it...Then I decided that that wasn't needed. Drinking isn't part of my thought process or response to any life event anymore. I left all the paths that lead me to a bottle to the elements and now they are too overgrown to walk down or even see...Anyway. I just wanted to share how amazing it feels to face challenges without even a thought that you might relapse. Keep going because one day you'll feel like this.

Sorry to hear about your breakup but awesome thought process. I am also noticing after certain things happen in my life I think how I would have drank over them and the thought didn't even occur to me until afterwards. That's huge progress eh?
I'm sorry :(  ..I broke up with the person I was dating when I got sober and met a man that doesn't yell fight lie or fall down stairs.  Hasn't gone to jail ONCE in 10 years.  (and neither have I now that I think about it!)..Kudos to you for sharing this and noting that things like this are not an excuse to do something that can only hurt you worse. ..GOOD JOB! ..

Great analogy I like that :)
I am in the same boat. Just ended a relationship and drinking is the last thing on my mind. It sucks and it hurts but these are my emotions and I refuse to drown them...Besides every time I thought I was drowning my sorrows it turned out I was taking them for swimming lessons.
