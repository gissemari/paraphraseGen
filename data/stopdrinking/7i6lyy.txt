Two weeks ago I realized that I needed to get sober otherwise I probably would have taken my life. I constantly still think about alcohol and try to convince myself that I can manage just a few drinks.  I have not relapsed but it's a constant battle.  Any advice on how to continue strong?  I need help and AA just isn't for me.

You don't need AA to quit. But recovery groups can help as sharing and the exercises can act as power ups. ..You might look at Smart Recovery or Refuge Recovery as groups that use a different set of principles as AA. ..Also just be easy on yourself. It took you a long time to become good at drinking. It will take some time to get good at being sober. ..I will not drink with you today. 
Have you looked into SMART or Refuge Recovery? A therapist might be really good too. Addressing the possible causes of the internal pain might "bookend" the practical work you're doing and lend it greater meaning and purpose. I know it would be difficult for me to maintain momentum unless I put my sobriety into a context with the whole-person healing I need.

I wasn't really a fan of AA either but counseling and medication seems to be helping me I was a dual diagnosis patient and I needed professional help. 
I had help reading a book on Rational Recovery and using SD. I understand the constant battle you are facing. Personally I am glad I don't have to fight it nearly as often anymore. If you're going through hell just keep going!
