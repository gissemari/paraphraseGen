I got sober in 2004; 5 year relapse that escalated into blackout drinking. Had about 3 weeks at the end of 2012 but was not really serious...Been thinking too much just need to stop. After a moderate drunk Thursday and an ok yesterday today is the first time I have felt fairly serious about staying sober. Here's to today...Thanks for being here and hope to see you lots in the near future.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step...Welcome and just a reminder one drunk to another:..Sometimes sobriety is not drinking today...Sometimes it's not drinking this hour...And sometimes it's not drinking *this minute*...Hang in there.  We're all pulling for you.
Good to hear! For me it's always been easy to put the plug in the jug - I just keep taking it out again when I feel shitty. I find talking to other alcoholics keeps me from feeling shitty. I'm finding this sub a lot of help this time around.
