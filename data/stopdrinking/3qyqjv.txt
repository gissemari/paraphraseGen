I am 41 years old and I don't think that I have ever been sober as an adult on Halloween. I just want everyone who posts on this subreddit to know that your insights and the window to your struggles have really made it easier for me to look at my behavior with some perspective. THANK YOU!!! I have been attempting to get sober for years with varying degrees of success but have always found myself back at the bottom of a bottle. Drinking hasn't gotten me anywhere and I don't want to do it anymore. Happy Halloween new sober friends! Does anyone have any ideas for celebrating Halloween sober? I will not drink today!

* clean out your place of all those empties.* dump out any that aren't empty.* bake cookies to fill the house with a pleasant smell.* eat said cookies.* send frumious some cookies.
Eat lots of candy and watch the Shining!
Here are my plans:.. - I am about to catch up on some work for the end of the month;.. - I will go exercise for an hour or so;.. - I am driving 3 of my son's friends an hour to the state field hockey championship to root on some of their friends.  My son can't go as he is directing the school musical but these girls wanted to go and no one else would drive them.  I guarantee in my drinking days I would have had zero interest in this... - I am coming home right after that to take my daughter to watch her favorite local college soccer team play their last game at 5 tonight.  Now I would have done this in my drinking days but I would have snuck liquor in a coffee mug to get me through it... - After the game I am coming home to chaperone my 3rd child's halloween party with his good friends while my wife takes my daughter to her own party.  I would have done that in the past but been drunk and a useless chaperone.  My wife would have had to worry about another parent coming to our house and smelling vodka on my breath etc... - At 11 my sober head will hit the pillow and I will be thankful for all the opportunities I had to be there for other people and the wonderful experiences I enjoyed.  None of which would have been possible with alcohol in my life...YMMV
