I'm at the beginning stages of trying to get sober.  Are there any meetings that have more younger people than older?  I am kind of hoping to make some new sober friends at meetings as I think sober friends will help me achieve sobriety.  Most of my friends drink and I struggle with being the sober one at the bar party etc.  I'm a 26 year old female living on Long Island but I work in the city M-F so I would ideally try to attend a meeting after work or maybe even during lunch when I get comfortable.  I work in Midtown West but would be willing to venture elsewhere for a better meeting.  Thanks!

I am not in NY but my experience is that good meetings are a lot of trial and error.  Even when there is an error you are learning something and thus a win anyway...Have you been to any in your area yet?  Do you know how to find them?  If not google search your zip code with AA Meetings and that should get you started.
Hey the N.Y.U Bronfman Center hosts meetings that I know usually cater to younger people. That's all I can really think of other than a couple in the East Village...EDIT: they only meet the first Wednesday of the month though.
I was literally trying to research the same thing. I'm a 29 year old male at 2 days. I'll be keeping an eye on this thread. How old is too old for a young person's meeting?
I'm jealous. [There are a shit ton](http://www.nycypaa.org/meetings/)
NYC has a lot of meetings.  I like the agnostic AA on Bowery and Houston where they meet once a week...There are really way too many meetings in the city so go to a few and I'm sure you will find one that will stick.
