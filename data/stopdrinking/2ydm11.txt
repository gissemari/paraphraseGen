I've been to a handful of meetings before but none during this 71 day stretch of sobriety. But I came so close to relapse Friday night that I realized I simply don't have the tools available to succeed on my own. Personally I know that I need more than just online discussion. ..I guess my point is this I've used every justification I can think of to avoid AA. But why not walk into that meeting with an open mind and see what happens? What's the worst thing that can happen?..You sure can't beat the price.

Allowing others into your life is never easy but was the best decision I ever made. Succeeding on my own has come to mean "what have I done for others lately" which is critical in my opinion for maintaining sobriety. All I ever did was think of me and that's why I stayed drunk. Once I focused on others the magic started to happen. 
I sometimes refer to AA as "freehab"
Wow. Good for you for having an open mind about AA...AA has its faults; it's definitely not ideal but what is? I've been able to make it work for me and to find people who understand me which is invaluable. 
Post how it went. I want to go this week also
...There's free coffee... You cant beat free coffee.
