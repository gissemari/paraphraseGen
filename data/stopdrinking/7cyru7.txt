After making it a couple months I've been struggling on and off the last 3 weeks. Out of the time i've been drunk maybe 10% of it has been fun.  You would think 90% shitty would be enough for my brain to go "maybe let's not do this."  Nope...The problem of course is that I romanticize drinking. When I think about grabbing a drink right now I don't think about what really happens to me I think about the best case scenario when everything is awesome and I wake up with no hangover and no anxiety and life is grand.  Except that doesn't happen. Ever...So last night I was watching the new season of Shameless and there is a character named Lip who is in recovery from drinking. He is really struggling with it. And watching it I thought to myself that it was really cool his struggle it seemed worthwhile. So that's part of what I'm trying to do today. I'm trying to romanticize my recovery because that actually is awesome and not do that to drinking... which sucks.  If it didn't suck I wouldn't be quitting!..Just wanted to share this sorta-epiphany.

"If it didn't suck I wouldn't be quitting"..Best thing I read all day. I'm going to keep this one in the back of mind. I to romanticize it lots but of things in fact. Rather then what is so clearly right in front me. Deep lessons we are learning. ..Keep it up! Best to you!..
I really like that approach: ..&gt; romanticize my recovery..Thank you for this!
Nice! I had to stop watching Shameless because I saw myself too much in the characters and oddly enough it made me drink more. Glad to hear at least one of them is turning themselves around!
