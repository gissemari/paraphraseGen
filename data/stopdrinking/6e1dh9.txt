I recently lost my job and heard about a job fair at my local VA hospital and connected with the Vocational Rehab program...I went to my first meeting with my counselor and while talking about obstacles I have to working I kinda had a bit of a moment and told her that I'd been drinking a lot for several years and it was starting to take a toll on me.  A bunch of stuff just kinda flowed out and she stopped me asked if I thought I needed some help...I told her that I did and I'm not doing so hot.  She sent a message to one of the psychologists and she took me into a conference room and I was able to let out a lot of stuff I had been keeping inside.  I have a lot of trouble talking honestly to friends and family so to be able to talk to someone was really helpful.  ..The past several years have been pretty dark for me and suicide has crossed my mind several times.  I decided I wouldn't actively kill myself but I quit taking care of myself in hopes that my body would fail me because I didn't want to saddle my family with the burden of feeling like they could've stopped it if they had only done x or y or z...They asked me if I felt I was a danger to myself right now and I told them honestly that I had no intention of harming myself.  The counselor then offered to set me up with a social worker to work through why I might be abusing alcohol and I said I thought that was a good idea for me...I met with my social worker for the first time on Friday.  I can honestly say I feel like there is some hope in my life for the first time in a long time.  I'm only about 36 hours into sobriety with a goal of staying completely sober until my next appointment.  I got a job making pizza and started yesterday to stop from getting behind on bills and looked up Master's degree programs for the first time since I graduated college.  ..I feel hopeful today and for the first time in a very long time I'm not dreading tomorrow but instead I'm looking forward to actually building a future for myself that I can be happy to live...So if you are out there reading this and you can used the VA and are ready to make changes there are lots of wonderful people there that can help.  Don't think that you are alone in your struggle because you aren't...I'm not drinking today and you are welcome not to drink me as well.

Thanks for sharing.  The VA has had so much bad press it is good to hear a good story.
That is very great to hear!
