I am having a hard time. This depression that I feel is pretty crippling. I'm not sure this is the right forum but I do believe it has to do with drinking. I've been trying since January to do better for myself in many way and one of them is to stop drinking nightly. There's a lot of stops/starts but one of the constants whether I'm drinking or sober is depression. ..In my current streak this is day four. And I feel like it's a pretty good streak even though it's in it's infancy. I feel as though I have changed and I don't want to drink. I feel like I've finally gotten through to myself. It's just now mastering my body's and my mind's desire. ..But the depression is real. And I've struggled with it throughout my life but it's pretty intense right now. It's so intense that it's driving other people away. No one knows what to do to support me. And I don't know what they need to do either...But I also don't feel like it's my burden to tell them how to support me when all I can do is try to figure out how not to hurt them by being depressed. I can still do all the things that I need to do in a day to take care of other people so It can't be that bad but I can't fake happiness anymore. I feel so selfish for not being able to take on everyone else's burdens like I used to. I feel like a crap human being for being unable to tell people how to help me or support me or what they need to do. ..Why can't people see that I'm just trying to take care of myself so that I can take care of them better and longer?..My resolve to master my drinking issue is pretty high. But I wonder how long the depression will be. Like I've said to other people it takes time for the brain to adjust and I understand that too but I am impatient for it to figure out how to deal with everything sober again. Just like the weight I put on from drinking won't leave my body in just a couple days my brain can't heal from what I've done to it in just a couple days. Intellectually I know that but I need some kind of break from this depression...Does anybody else feel this way early on? Does anybody know around about the day week month as a priority that the depression is lesson where that the brain heals enough to be able to deal with the hundreds of thousands of things that come at you in any given moment?..I get the whole  embrace the suck  thing but it really fucking sucks sometimes and embracing it is difficult. ..I really appreciate this sub Reddit I know that community is a big thing and I appreciate being able to know that there are other people posting about him commenting about things that I go through too. The world is not compassionate enough but I'm happy that this group seems to be some of the most compassionate people around...Thanks for reading. I just needed it to be out there instead of stuck in my brain like everything else is at the moment.

A couple of things. Alcohol is a depressant and can worsen an underlying depression. 4 days isn't really enough time to start feeling better. At day 30 if you're still feeling depressed seeing a doctor or therapist might be in order. People stuck in chronic clinical depression can't just  snap out if it . Sometimes they need a little help.  ..I've been there. Have hope that you will feel better again. Not drinking is a best first step.
