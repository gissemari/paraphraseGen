I've been struggling to get sober for about a year now and I've known I should be trying for at least 3 years. .7 days is not my longest run without booze but it's my longest without substituting weed or benzos in place of it. This sub has been a huge source of inspiration along with some people I've met. .Much as I realise it's not for everyone AA (well actually CA) has been a huge help and I already feel like a different person. If you're new and struggling reach out and talk to someone who's got some sober time. There will be hard days but it's so worth it. For the first time in years i go to bed looking forward to getting up the next day and that's a pretty special feeling..Thank you guys...IWNDWYT

Legit!!! Way to go. IWNDWYT
You're amazing! Thank you for sharing and congratulations on 1 week!!  
you are kicking some ass!! the first week felt like the seventh ring of hell for me so you have all of my respect on your massive achievement...not drinking with you today.
A week is a big accomplishment! You should be proud.  Keep on truckin'! IWNDWYT 
Welcome that first week is HUGE!! I agree that reaching out &amp; developing a multi-branched support system is huge. I visit SD almost daily go to meetings several times each week &amp; am lucky enough to have a couple of sober friends who truly support me in this journey. Stay strong!  I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace
It's nice to come here and read a couple threads when my mind starts trying to justify drinking. 
Congrats on one week!!
