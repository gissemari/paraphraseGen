Many people never experience addiction up close. They never have to go through an intervention for a friend or family member they never play with fire themselves only to realize much to late their mistake. ..Many who do see it either don't make it out or are never able to fully comprehend the extent to which a drug alcohol and even marijuana included (IMO) can grasp hold of a life and rip away everything that was once so important. ..Those who do walk away walk being the important verb and maybe more accurately is to say crawl are changed forever. Even those who have walked through hell with a close friend come away from the experience with an entirely different outlook on life. ..In my opinion they emerge stronger. They are not weak for having fallen or damaged for having been beaten down. In a very real way they materialize as a new person a person who for many unknowingly crossed through the gates of Hell. ..The lucky few or maybe those with a stronger support group stopped in limbo where many still remain to fight a losing battle akin to the myth of Sisyphus which maybe isn't a myth at all. ..Some found themselves stumbling into a circle of lust yearning after their drug of choice in a way only comparable to the gravitational attraction of a black hole. ..Others reached gluttony taking their abuse to heights that even they never could have fathomed there decisions would deteriorate to. ..Even further down there are those that plummeted to greed most of whom damaged good relationships many to unrepairable levels. ..Few even still spiraled all the way down to treachery not only damaging relationships but lighting them up in the same fire they used to burn their own souls. ..The only problem with the analogy of Dante's circles of hell is the implication that you stumble plunging into the great depths. The insinuation that one simply falls relying on some greater force pulling downward misses the truth of addiction. The journey to reach each new circle of hell is a paradox in itself as the struggle to achieve entrance into each circle is only trumped by the struggle to escape. ..All who escaped were in for the fight of their lives quite literally. A fight that anyone who has been through would tell you they would not wish it on their worst enemy. .. So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past.  ..And we emerge stronger better a daily struggle a daily reminder but one we should welcome as we attack each new day with the ferocity of the last. One day at a time. ..

How's your sobriety?
I see where you're going but in my various readings both in and out of translation I never a sense of falling or immediacy in the journey down. It sucks and drags more like a mudslide than a pit. I also don't know that there are disparate layers of suffering in sobriety I can be in the first and fourth circles at once.
