So I slipped up again for basically the whole month of December. I was binging almost everyday and passing out every time. Went to a NYE party last night and got grossly wasted. I even ended up doing cocaine (which I vowed I'd never do). I got home around 6 am and don't remember leaving the party although I know I got a ride with some friends. My boyfriend who I live with is upset with me because I always forget to respond to his texts when I've been drinking. So he didn't know where I was. I woke up today with such high anxiety and a terrible hangover. Here's to day 1 (again) hopefully this time there won't be a relapse. IWDWYT!
