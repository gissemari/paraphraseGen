Even though I don't check in as often anymore today marks a milestone I never dreamed of hitting...Thanks to everyone on here for support and encouragement as I wouldn't have gotten through the first part without this subreddit! ..I know its still a long road ahead but things are starting to get easier even the bad days don't seem as bad and the good days are great!..To anyone who's struggling I hope your journey makes you a stronger person!
