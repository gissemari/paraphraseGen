And right now the urge to drink is so strong. He knows that I have been struggling but didn't even seem to care. The worst part is I don't think it was out of malice just that he doesn't know how to care and is so oblivious to everything. ..I am telling myself the only thing I have to do is not drink. I am going to buy junk food (which isn't the best choice because I am trying to lose weight) and book a massage .....But I am still really struggling and could really use some support.

I'm sorry that you're struggling which is entirely understandable. I say screw the diet and focus on your self-care however that looks right now. Hang in there and IWNDWYT.
That sounds really hard. In my experience I find dieting can come easier  later when you're more secure in your sobriety. One thing at a time is better for me and IWNDWYT. 
Have the junk food and book the massage; it will help you physically and mentally...Just don't pick up the first drink...and this too shall pass ;).
Been there under different circumstances but definitely been there. Take care of yourself by treating yourself. I highly recommend Haagen-Daz Vanilla Swiss Almond...
