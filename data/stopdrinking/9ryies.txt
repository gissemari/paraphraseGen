For the past few hours the craving has been slowly growing. The internal monologues have been incessant. Back-and-forth. Pros and cons. Lot of hanging of my head followed by clenching fist and powering through the minutes the hours. ..Today is the day of an annual Halloween bash that my wife and I have thrown every year for the past seven years.  We go all out with decorating and intricate themes and costumes and games.  It's just my wife and kids and their friends who show up.  But every year I've been like the big attraction --- I go all out on a custom costume take on a creepy role and I drink a lotta beer. My biggest beer drinking night of the year usually and possibly one of the reasons I got hooked so hard years ago.  And each year one of my kids' friends will say "Is your step-dad gonna be drunk again this year and let us throw eggs at him?"  And "Your step-dad was really scary at first but he's so freakin awesome!"  ..Yes sadly that's the reputation I'd gotten among my kids and their friends for these Halloween parties.  ..And today has been hard.  ..Part of it (maybe most of it) is just tradition.  It's what I've done on this night every year for so long.  Some people drink heavy on New Years or whatever -- but Halloween is mine.  ..And I know I can get through this.  I know I can not drink.  Oh but it's been so hard.  I was so close only an hour ago!  I'd gotten to the "I'll just have a few and won't get drunk so it won't be bad in the morning and then I'll just not return to my old ways and that'll be that."  ..But I know it's all lies.  It's the addiction talking to me.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm just worried that I won't have a good time tonight because I'll be too busy fighting off these cravings.  The struggle is going to monopolize all my time.  ..&amp;#x200B;..How do you make it through a social gathering like this where you're usually one of the biggest drinkers? ..This isn't a physical craving. I know I can do without it.  It's a "what do I do without it?"  kinda moment.  And I'm actually getting irritable and frustrated cause I can't let it go.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I swear IWNDWYT!

I just had a big family gathering a few months ago and it's always all about the wine - and I'm usually one of the biggest drinkers in that crowd.  I told them I was on antibiotics and couldn't drink (which was actually true - I WAS on antibiotics but usually I'd just drink anyway).  ...Nobody batted and eye.  I actually kind of enjoyed the party once I got past the initial anxiety of not knowing how to be sober at that kind of gathering.   And I really began to notice how some of my family acts like idiots when they get drunk.
