It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** Like many other people here at SD I am haunted with regret over things that happened back when I was drinking. A few years ago I passed out at the end of the evening (as usual) and I was so unconscious that I did not hear the phone ringing all night long. In the morning I saw that I had sixteen new messages. They were all from my brother who really needed my help but I wasn't there for him...**Triumph:** At about six o'clock in the evening last Wednesday I was in my apartment in San Francisco looking at what a disaster my apartment was and thinking about how I needed a shower. My phone rang and it was the police from Sarasota Florida saying that they had found my mother lost and disoriented one hundred miles from her home...By eleven o'clock I had taken a quick shower thrown some clothes into a suitcase and was sitting on an airplane that was taking me to Tampa so that I could drive to Sarasota pick up my mother and take her home. She really needed my help and I was there for her...Every time that being sober allows me to do something better than what I did in the past it helps me forgive myself a little...**General:**  I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you.   Joyce Meyer..

Struggle: In the early days again (Wednesday will be my 4th day sober) functional alcoholism stopped being fun AND functional Sunday when I went into hypertensive crisis because my body was so messed up from the rollercoaster of drinking. Actually its been progressively less fun and functional for a long time now..Triumph: I dumped the rest of my my ever-present box-o-wine down the drain Sunday morning finally feeling better and hopefully through the worst of it. I watched some dumb Netflix comedy special and laughed so hard tonight that was nice. There were 3 (husbands) beers in the house today and I opened each one and poured them out immediately this morning knowing I would have trouble resisting the temptation later in the day (this is pretty good self awareness here and totally worked tonight as I am still sober!).General: Drinking every night after work was like trying to make an outdoor mural in a rainstorm. Nothing ever stuck or was in focus. I am looking forward to what I can start making out of my non-working time now.
*Struggle:* General depression and stress compounding and I don't have a healthy outlet. I haven't had alcohol in 2 weeks. Haven't had THC in 5. I am losing sight of the point or purpose. Worried I am going to lose it all tomorrow. 
Struggle: I keep thinking about the warm weather and not drinking. Will I make it? A lot of people say stuff like 'and we can hang out and drink beers in the sun!' I don't think I want to but maybe I do? How will it be hanging out sober with all my Friends who can and will drink (responsibly)? .As you can see my struggle is thinking to far ahead and worrying about things that haven't even happened yet...Triumph: I had a lot of fun at a party the other day. Nobody was bothered that I didn't drink and some actually thought it was pretty cool of me. Also: I didn't make an ass out of myself!
**Struggle:** There s a huge cleanup at my former job investigating my boss/ex best friend for bullying and manipulating employees into resigning and long term sick leaves one of them being me. I was interviewed by HR on Monday met him casually Tuesday and he acts as if he s the victim of a childish prank. It s surreal to say the least. I began to see through these things when I stopped drinking and stopped blaming and feeling sorry for myself and ever so slowly began to use some common sense...**Triumph:** I got a new job! I ll be working for the local branch of a major non profit organization doing social work for children families and the elderly. Also this goes perfectly with the new design business SaintMarge and I are launching. I just have to say that I am so very very proud of her. She s not only kind and beautiful but also so talented! Yesterday I was at a local convention with several potential clients and our work was showcased as a superior alternative to the usual material and I was interviewed briefly to explain the idea behind it. After two years of nothing this is a dream come true. This would *never* happen if I was drinking!..**General:** Every season has its wonders. These days every single sunrise is cascading in red and pink. I m so happy to be up and present to see and appreciate it.
Struggle: I can't seem to get motivated. I used to be super motivated all the time and got tons done exercised  worked like a fiend  rode my horses at night school. Now every day is a struggle.  I thought I was using going out to dinner and having a few drinks to avoid all I had to do was what was keeping me from being that motivated person.  Only I haven't had a drink or been out to eat in 6 weeks and all I'm doing instead is working and coming home and sleeping.  I need to shake this off. I did great this weekend through sheer effort but work week started and all went to hell again. ..Triumph: I can't think of any.....General: I leave for Iceland for 8 days tomorrow on vacation. Maybe this will shake me out if the blahs. But I'll be with my sister who drinks heavily so that will be fun staying away from wine...

I like that quote Mary - you and I are *living* it!..**Struggle:**     I had a potential-patient come into my office directly from the bar last night. Bloodshot eyes I could smell the whisky a mile away slurring... It brought me back to my old life.....**Triumph:**     **3** years tomorrow!..**General:**     One of the best things about sobriety is to *help* my fellow alcoholics...the patients my friend that had a stroke...it helps me more than they will ever know....
Struggle: I didn't crash our spectacularly this relapse so I have a voice in my head saying I can moderate. I have to be very careful these next few days..Triumph: I am off my sleeping meds and didn't crave a drink today..General: I am feeling much better after getting off my sleeping meds. That stuff was making me depressed. I cannot be complacent now. .IWDWYT 
I wish every new person who is struggling with shame issues could see this post Mary. It's so true; there's no easy fix for getting past day but building up a lot of incident-free sober time of being present for your own life and family and community eventually heals that I think. ..**Struggle** I still have tennis elbow from shoveling snow on Dec 30! It hurts a lot and is stopping me from doing a lot of the upper body work I want to do in the gym. ..**Triumph** Getting through another week at work and not having a nervous breakdown from the stress! Also I've subbed Tuesday night spin class at my gym 2 weeks in a row now and I've gotten pretty good at teaching spin again something I didn't see ever happening when I started back up teaching group exercise. ..**General** Psyching myself up for a sober long working weekend in NoLa. 
**Struggle**: January 3rd I didnt want to be alive and seriously thought about killing myself for the first time.  February 8th my life partner of 3 years admitted to lying to me everyday about his emotional and sexual affair with his best friend. It predated me actually they've been toxically codependent for years it turns out. **Moral of the story is that I allowed him to convince me that I couldn't trust my thoughts feelings or gut were. I used alcohol to numb my mind and escape my feelings because I knew all along. I almost let alcohol kill me**. That night I had 2 beers and a bottle of wine. The next morning I had another at 7AM.  **Triumph:** the next day **I went to the liquor store*and realised that there is nothing in here that I want** and walked right out. Instead I went to the grocery store and bought $80 worth of juices. I know I drank excessively before him and I have my own problems but **I can trust my feelings I can trust my mind and I don't want to hurt my body anymore with alcohol.** I am beautiful intelligent and funny. I am a loveable weirdo deserving of love and respect. Now I get to focus on loving myself again and figuring out what I want from life and finding out who I really am again without alcohol.  **General**: Its only been 4 days I don't expect it to be easy but I know **I have found the right reason to not drinking for the first time: me.** You can trust your gut trust your mind and be kind to yourself.

Struggle:  I made some stupid decisions last week that caused me regret on the same level I used to have after drinking. Quitting drinking didn't completely cure me of my stupidity. ...Triumph:  I made one excellent decision every day and it's the best of them all. I wouldn't undo the stuff from last week if it meant I'd had one sip of alcohol.  As long as I didn't drink  is something I can always be happy about.   Not that it means I shouldn't work on these other things. But I'm able to look at these issues I have with more clarity and I see solutions. (one problem I realized I have is with saying no).  I'm being proactive rather than drinking and making things worse. 
*struggle:* I'm sick and working anyway because I feel guilty about taking vacation I'm contractually entitled too I'm such an American cliche ..*triumph:* hey my life is filled with abundance I should slow down and appreciate that more. ..*general:* remember something like thirty percent of adult Americans haven't had a drink in the last year. Even if you feel alone you aren't. IWNDWYT 
Being there for my family and friends is one of the best gifts of sobriety in my opinion...**Struggle** I changed jobs at the start of this year turning my part time chef instructor job into a full time gig and leaving the restaurant I worked in. I love my work but I have these long breaks every day in the afternoon and I'm struggling to find productive things to fill them with. I'm not good at being still. I did a lot of damage to my financial well being over the years of drinking and it's taking time to get bills paid back and caught up and unfortunately that issue weighs on me a lot during those long afternoons...**Triumph** I've got two months of sobriety and I haven't had the compulsion to drink. Any momentary considerations have been easily dismissed and I feel very good about continuing to stay sober one day at a time. My blood pressure the day after my last drink was 149/98 and yesterday I had my second reading on a row below 130/80 and I'm 18lbs lighter today than I was back on day 1. So even though my financial health is taking a bit longer to come around my physical health has improved dramatically...**Musing** home made carrot cake is da bomb(dot)com..C
Happy Wednesday! ..Struggle: I've got a wicked cold &amp; my whole body is sore from chopping ice/shoveling my driveway &amp; it's supposed to snow more tomorrow. Temps have been below zero for over a week with no relief in sight-this time of year is always hard for me. I become a complete hermit &amp; have no motivation to do anything more than work &amp; go home. ..Triumph: I normally spend these cold winter nights home alone drinking a 6pk+ of Shiner Bock every night but not this year! I also finally got the courage to go to an AA meeting the other night! I fought thru the beginnings of a panic attack calmed myself down &amp; actually listened to everyone's stories. The last 2 days I've done alot of journaling on Steps 1 &amp; 2 &amp; its felt good. I dont know if AA is for me but I plan on going to another meeting this weekend! 
That's scary about your Mom glad you were able to help her!..**S:**  Tried to do too much over the weekend and it started a train wreck.  Hopefully things will turn around today but yesterday was awful.  Daughter decided to hide the remote on me and to not clean her room or do her homework.  She also decided to hide the toilet paper roll holder.  Still trying to figure out what possessed her to do that...**T:** I'm in the process of filing for child support.  My daughter's Mom is going to flip out but oh well.  She gave my daughter a puppy that wasn't fixed with two different type of worms and fleas that got transferred to other dog(which is also her dog).  Doesn't offer to give me a cent to help out with treatment. Called DCFS on me over some bull$H!t.  And is able to have open availability for work because I have our daughter all the time.  Furthermore she lives in a homeless shelter because she spends all her money on Ubering to go out to eat hair salons and cigarettes.  That's what happens kids when you start drinking vodka before noon and are high 24/7/365!..**General:**  I had to let my puppy out at 2:30AM.  The wind speeds were over 50mph.  That was interesting.
Struggle: oh man this might be stupid. But I'm stuck in a Whassap group with some friends and some former friends and I don't know how to leave without it showing everyone. ..Because we're classic Brits no one is even acknowledging we fell out - and I'm not even sure who knows! It's mind bogglingly stupid...Everytime I see a message from one of them it makes my brain go a bit haywire and take a trip down guilt fuelled lane. I've archived it for now so shouldn't see anymore notifications...Technology eh? ..Also on a similar vain I'm trying to avoid above persons but have no idea if they are or aren't going to certain things. It's a bit of mind fuck at the moment. Hope it settles down...Triumph: I've been really enjoying meditating and have successfully done it four days in a row so far. I've also been reading a bit about buddhism I'm a skeptic but I am finding a lot of good stuff that I can apply to my life and helps with those guilt trips!..General: I'm playing my first ever dungeons and dragons game on Sat and I'm pretty excited! I've always wanted to play and now I've got the chance. .
Struggle:..I'm going to have the house to myself for 2 weeks here soon and I'm flipping out D:..Triumph:..Still sober lol

**struggle**  trying to learn how to deal with the shame and self-loathing I have in regard to drinking. I'm trying to learn how to love myself every day in sobriety but it's hard. I feel like I don't deserve it sometimes. I'm having a hard time forgiving myself ..**triumph** I got pulled over last night and let off with a verbal warning. I had been hanging out with friends and it was late and I was clean sober and bright-eyed. My car was free of empty bottles and lingering aromas of alcohol. Honestly I felt smug like I *wanted* to be pulled over and show off that I had nothing to hide. ..**general** I've learned to enjoy cooking every night and experimenting with new recipes. I want to save the money I would have spent on alcohol and buy a new set of kitchen knives! 
Struggle : my birthday was Friday and my manager offered me a glass of wine which I took justifying with it's just one glass! Fast forward to last night when I slipped up and told my boyfriend which led to a huge fight and further diminished his trust in me I really thought he was gonna break up with me last night bc this isnt the first time we had this fight..Triumph: I haven't been drunk since October even with the cheating I've done at work ..General: I haven't talked to my mom in a long time because part of me blames her for the struggle with the addiction along with resentment for the neglect in my childhood. but in all honesty she would probably understand the most out of anyone.. 
**Triumph:** In the late fall my therapist suggested I start tracking my moods and emotions. That echoed advice friends and mentors gave me years ago. I finally started in December. I've now got 2+ months of data. Several things are apparent. One is how dependent on exercise I am  for stabilizing and improving my mood. The other is how my baseline of joy and fun has shifted--OR I am having more fun and being more aware of it...**Struggle:** It's been a busy and stressful period both at work and at home. Most things are going well but when I'm feeling stressed it's easy for me to focus on the the things that AREN'T. I am aware of that tendency and can catch myself before I spiral too far down. But I have to catch myself.
**Struggle:** sobriety &amp; not working &amp;&amp;&amp; duck cramps..**Triumph:** my education and health across the board..**General:**  "If the PLAN doesn't work CHANGE the plan but never the GOAL."
I threw out the rest of my wine yesterday. Today I keep thinking about getting more and drinking today. Fuck this is so difficult.
Struggle: I've pulled eight hours of overtime because of the snow and it's leaving me feeling physically drained and my meditation sits have been feeling distracted by all of the tiredness. I need the some solace and some refuge from some of the difficult feelings I've had to work on the last several months and moreso over the next couple of days as there is an upcoming anniversary of my twin sisters' birth and deaths. An event that I've always blamed myself for even though intellectually I know that it is not the case. I was very sick my stepmother was very sick with something else and they had to induce labor early and they did not live long...Triumph: A close friend of mine said I made her day simply by doing my job helping to clean up the mess that the Seattle Snowpocalypse left our store in...General: 16 Stephen King books left and I'll finally have completed the goal that I set out to finish when I realized I had read 20 of his books. Just finished the Colorado Kid on the way home from work this morning.
I moved into my new apartment and it feels incredible!!! Now back to the reality of school. &gt;.&lt;
Struggle - Getting through my dad's dying days death burial family time and acute grief without drinking...Triumph- I have kept me sobriety intact by not drinking.  The family is getting along even though everyone is and was drinking.
Struggle: Although I feel so good for having other 300 days other forms of addiction and obsession keep sneaking into my life (phone interwebs browsing songs constantly stuck in my head). ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: Just found out I won an award for my graduate school work. I still can't believe it! ..&amp;#x200B;..General: Woah?! What's going on here! Why is Usher stuck in my head? 
\*Struggle\*: I need to continue to straighten out my bills and whatnot after moving but I feel really overwhelmed with the details. I feel like with every problem I solve another one pops up. Most are small but add up to a lot of little items that just cause more anxiety as I try to dig myself out of my own life. ..&amp;#x200B;..\*Triumph\*: I have made at least 10 minutes for myself every day since January 1st to either work out or meditate. I've worked out most of those days with meditation saved for days when I was not feeling well to the point of being unable to workout (only 2). ..&amp;#x200B;..\*General\*: Cravings for alcohol are waaaaay down. Cravings for sweets remain constant. 
**Struggle &amp; Triumph:** **I'm turning 4 weeks sober** this Sunday! It's so amazing to be sober I feel good I sleep well I'm more organized than before. However I also start to question my sobriety quite often I start feeling like I'm missing out sometimes like I deserve to "let go" sometimes. I hope I'll stick to the occasional weed here and there because alcohol is just a whole other level of bad...One month is definitely the hardest and easiest part. It definitely feels like the first major checkpoint and repeating this into several months is definitely the hardest challenge I've never passed the 2-3 month mark and I really want to get to triple digits this time! I think this is the moment I need to remember why I am here and why I should stay here...I don't need alcohol to be creative - Yeah I don't mess around and find crazy inspiration but now I am super constructive with what I do..I don't need alcohol to be sociable - Yeah I might be better at talking about certain stuff when I drink but it doesn't really balance out with the crippling anxiety I have feeling down and depressed (many days after drinking not just when I'm hungover). It also doesn't balance out the fact that sometimes I make a fool of myself...&amp;#x200B;..**General:** I really need to face external pressures those are the only things that endanger my sobriety I am internally fine (most of the time)...&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: every dumb cringey drunk night is coming back to accuse and haunt me I notice the pull to drink to numb out these feelings of shame and guilt...Triumph: I am exercising the ability to allow myself to be in the moment with my feelings instead of escaping them. I understand the thoughts I have are just thoughts and I don't have to add fuel by pointlessly beating myself up...General: I will not drink today
Just checking in I got my antipsychotic shot today so it's important that I stay on it by not drinking liquor. Liquor decreases the benefit. I'm staying busy and that's my way of dealing with the addiction which is hard. Wish you all the best of luck stay skrong 
Struggle: today's my day one. I am tired of making poor decisions that threaten my future my relationships and myself. I struggle with depression and drinking gets my mind off it until it turns on me. I am not going to use my addiction as a crutch. Today is the first day and it can only get better from here.
