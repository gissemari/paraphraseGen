Woot Woot Wednesday! [Happy Hump Day folks](https://ametia.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/hump-day-image003.jpg?w=595)! ..Let's hump it out. Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. ..Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I feel like at eight months I'm starting to do a little better when it comes to trusting my instincts about people and situations. For so long I could never trust my gut because it was always somehow secretly trying to get me back to drinking or I knew that all the decisions I had made in the past had been bad ones. Now I have some solid good decisions behind me and it's helping me feel more confident about the choices I'm making. Not being able to trust your own intuition is terrible and scary and it feels like I'm emerging from that place slowly but surely. It's pretty exciting...**Struggle**: I'm sick and cranky. Combine that with being super busy and responsible for all kinds of events and work-related things it's been a tough week. I miss just being able to totally zone out but now my calendar is full and people are counting on me so I need to step up in ways I didn't need to when I was drinking. I'm struggling with a little resentment about that so I'll try and deal with it this week. ..**General Chat**: April showers bring May flowers right? And what do May flowers bring? (All together now... PILGRIMS!) I've been on a bit of a [dad jokes](http://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes) kick lately. What are some of your favorites?..So how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

My girlfriend and I gave up drinking this year.  I gave it up because I didn't like where my drinking was going she gave it up so I wouldn't have to do it alone...Triumph: we made it through a dense patch of birthdays holidays dinner parties and other special events this week...Struggle: a lot of people have been bringing their own alcohol to our house and leaving behind whatever they don't drink.  I know I could have a glass of wine and nobody would know...General chat: I went to the zoo the other day and all the enclosures were empty except for one it just had one dog in it it was a shitzu.
**triumph** asked for some help in something I'm dealing with. Feeling vulnerable but good. ..**Struggle** 6 exams in 5 days next week. Three big assignments due tomorrow. ..**general chat** Portugal this summer! Weeeeee!!!!!
**Triumph:**Work has been going well.  I have passed my last two tests which is huge.  One more test to CCNP and I have my CCDA now.  My two cats are starting to get along. [Here they are laying on the bed together not fighting.](http://i.imgur.com/LRU9bAF.jpg)  Also only one more Group Therapy session for Tuesday and Thursday and only have Wednesdays now.  This helps get me to meetings on a more regular track.  Also I've been reading the big book a little bit more.  I think I am 4 or 5 chapters in.  Just got over the chapter to the agnostic...**Struggle:** I have to watch soft skills videos for work and they are horrible.  Also this whole not being able to drive thing makes it very hard and stressful.  I forgot how it feels to be so dependent on other people. But 45 days isn't the worst I guess.  I also have my sentancing coming up.  I am kind of scared for this...**General Chat:** Never figured I'd be a cat person over dogs but I am really starting to love my two little fur balls.  [Batman](http://i.imgur.com/99Zmdn2m.jpg) and [Cairo](http://i.imgur.com/62a4EKcm.jpg) are really starting to get along and it's been one week since we adopted them.  I will be making a roast for dinner tonight and looking forward to that.  I also saw the newest hunger games movie.  It wasn't as good as the first two but more of a lead up to the final movie.  I haven't read the books so not sure how it compares to those...  But you know what **I will not drink today!**
**Triumph:** I'm not feeling particularly triumphant this week but I am sober so I'll count that.. .**Struggle:** I did something to my back that has put a damper on my workout regime this week. It's getting better every day but it still kind of sucks...**General Chat:** Have you heard the one about the dyslexic agnostic insomniac? He stayed up all night wondering if there really was a dog.
Triumph: I've done three sets this week at open mics and my material on sobriety/alcohol is going well. I've been drinking diet Coke and I'm happy to be remembering my sets! ...Struggle: Depression. No matter how much sleep I get it's never enough. At least I'm sleeping and not drinking? Sigh....General: My allergies have basically been like OH WHAT UP YALL WHERE THE PARTY AT so I think spring has finally returned to Minnesota. 
Feel better Cakes!  Being sick as the weather gets nicer is no fun at all...**Triumph**: Life is great.  I feel like all parts of my life are clicking right now: marriage work tennis Krav Maga.  I've been able to balance all of my responsibilities along with getting enough sleep and eating well.  At the end of my drinking I knew it was time to quit because I felt like all the parts of my life were chainsaws I was juggling and I was starting to lose control of them.  Being sober I feel like I'm cheating.  I feel like it's just so easy to maintain a good balance.  And the it's like the chainsaws are all off and all small enough to fit in one hand (while I use the other hand to hit a monster forehand winner down the line to take the match from Cakes!)...**Struggle**: I've been having that same old drinking dream again.  In my dream (which I seem to have a continuation of pretty regularly) I'm successfully moderating by drinking one or two beers but I refuse to reset my badge (and I wake up feeling so guilty).  I'm not going to read too much into it though.  I have no desire to drink at all...**General Chat**: My parents are in town and I'm going to take a half day to play some tennis with my dad.  I can't wait!..Speaking of dads and dad jokes my dad is the KING of dad jokes.  I just wish I could remember one of his best ones.
Triumph: I didn't drink yesterday and I cleaned my house some more this morning. ...Struggle: This has been much harder the second time around. I stopped drinking this past December and it seemed so much simpler back then. ..General Chat: my cat is fabulous and I have formed an obsession with 1500 in England. I have been binge reading the Boleyn Girls history and moved onto documentaries about that time period. I can't get enough. They are better than reality tv. 
**Triumph** I've been dating a pretty awesome girl for a couple months now. This is the first healthy relationship I've been in since god knows when and things are continuing to look up..**Struggle** Work is a chore lately. I'm sick today. But I'll get through it and I won't drink...**General chat** Spring is slowly but surely arriving! And that makes me feel so alive!
Hey Wednesday what's up? .Triumph: have been on time to work every day since I got reminded that I'm supposed to be there ya know on time!  I am still surprised at how good it feels to be responsible/on track with things like that. Also had a productive convo with a family member about enabling someone else's drug addiction. Wasn't expecting it to go well pleasantly surprised that it did. ..Challenge: It looks like I'm getting some funding to finish college but I really have no idea how I'm going to swing work/school in the fall. Luckily there's still time to figure it out. ..General chat: As a new homeowner with a new YARD having fun thinking about how to make it better. Researching perennials and ways to kill the blackberry.  Good distractions from more serious thoughts for sure.  Happy Wednesday!.
**Triumph:** I'm back on the hill of the roller coaster. Amazing how working to address your problems makes them improve even if they don't go away...**Struggle:** See above. Not feeling like much this week. Working on my relationships. Lots to address there...**Chat:** I am a failure at dad jokes. But I'm awesome at tickle fights!
**Triumph:** I got a sponsor someone I admire. I tried to talk myself out of this at first but now the relief is ineffable. The bad news is that my mind is overflowing with memories and issues related to drinking but it still counts as a triumph because I finally have a safe channel for all this shit. It has been a long time coming and I've pushed back a bunch of crap so this is good. My hand hurts from all the writing. ..**Struggle:** I need a break from work. Not all my work like teaching but a break from research and dissertation writing. I think 6 weeks will do it. I'm ahead of schedule to graduate anyway. No research is getting done in the next 6 weeks whether I admit it up front or not. I have to tell my advisors. If I tell them exactly why at this point I recognize I might be stating the obvious. My gut says they would be relieved to hear it from me anyway. But even if I dance around the details I have to announce a break. ..As soon as I got this idea my anxiety shrank three sizes; I know it's right. I will replace weekly meetings with my research advisors with weekly meetings with my sponsor and substitute math research for counting to 12. I already made a color coded schedule and everything lol. Still scared to state this to the folks "in charge" of me. Not the scariest thing I've done these last few years though. Ugh. Afraid and embarrassed and exhausted. This is the only way through the cleanup though. I am grateful that I am afforded such flexibility in my work life...**General Chat:** Planted some herbs in my apartment. Have been talking about it for 3 years. The whole project took a mere 3 hours and 80 bucks and one car trip. Flowers are everywhere outside too. :)
Triumph: After I dropped my kids off at school this morning I went for a run instead of taking a nap like I usually do. I'm tired now but happy. I haven't run in weeks and it felt amazing...Struggle: I posted about this elsewhere but I am having more difficulty at night than I anticipated I would. I didn't drink every day so I thought it would be easy the first several days. But it's not. My brain is running me through my paces...My favorite dad joke (told to me by my actual dad): Why did Mickey Mouse have Minnie Mouse committed to the insane asylum?..Because she was fucking Goofy!
Triumph: made it though a couple of gigs this week without drinking. I was drinking previously at these gigs so it took some extra resolve. It paid off. I haven't picked so good in my entire life...Struggle: I'm at a work conference for the next three days. Free booze all three nights. I made it through last night just fine. Tonight and tomorrow night are long 3-hour dinner and band functions. But I've talked to my bros and wife now I'm telling you I'm not going to drink at these events no matter what...General: It's Masters week! I'm looking forward to a homemade egg salad sandwich since I again couldn't find a coveted pass.
Triumph: I will hopefully have a year of sobriety at the end of the month. Am trying to figure out how to milk it for everything. lol. (Coin plus both the IOP and rehab I went to offer their own stuff if you come back with a year of sobriety.) I am disappointed about the lack of monthly reaffirmation that I am kicking ass after a year. ..Struggle: I think I am the only person whose health has GOTTEN WORSE with sobriety. I have seriously and possibly permanently messed up my stomach with drinking; when I was drinking the liquor physically numbed the pain/nausea but with that gone I am losing whole days and even weekends to godawful nausea. I get kinda resentful/angry/bitter every time someone mentions "oh it feels so good to not wake up with a hangover anymore." I wake up with a "hangover" more days than not. I am getting re-scoped in July to see if anything that my GI doc is trying is actually helping...for a while I was having more good days than bad but now it feels like it has flipped again. ..General chat: Has anyone seen the trailer for the Mad Max re-make? I am looking forward to it!
Triumph-made it 100 days. I was really happy to celebrate it with my fellow SD sobies!.Struggle-I'm so tired this week. I think I'm fighting a cold. My kids have been sick and it's catching up to me..General chat: I love dad jokes. My hubby is getting pretty good at them.
Triumph: After looking for resources and ways to cope with my not drinking during the day at work I finally found this sub and love what I see!..Struggle: I work the AA program and have been coming to the rooms for over three years now. I'm seeing a lot of my friends lately relapse which is definitely hard for me. The best I can do is tell them to keep coming back and support them without letting it affect my day to day...General: What do you call a fish with no eyes? A fsh.
**Triumph** I quit smoking cigs a few weeks back and I feel pretty good about it. My budget suddenly has about 30 extra bucks a week in it. I didn't do it cold turkey though. My doc scripted me a supply of Nicotrol to satisfy the cravings. It's an inhaler that you draw off just like a cig tastes like medicine but it helps. If any of you are trying to kick smoking I highly recommend asking your doctor about it. The first week was rough but I got through it...**Struggle** Depression I guess or envy. Sometimes I have a hard time dealing with the fact that I'm giving my life a hard reset and I view myself as being a fuck up with nothing to look forward to. I let myself feel bad when I see other family members with their shit together and succeeding at life...**General Chat** I just finished watching The Wire. Holy shit! Best TV show I've ever watched I get why it gets such rave reviews.
Triumph found out that my son and I are spending the summer working in Yellowstone! So stoked...Struggle- since my daughter was born I've lost 80 pounds and have nothing that fits money is TIGHT and I have a wedding on the 19th...General chat-hang on newcomers. When those promises start coming to fruition.....wow!! My first few months everything got objectively worse. Now? No words can describe how much I love my life sober..
Triumph : went to a bar with friends and spent the whole evening with them not drinking..Struggle : regular drinking partners calling again and again. I am sleeping well but have developed flu like symptoms and body aches... don't know if this is withdrawal..General: Planning meetings work related and some professional contacts seem to be happy to hear from me
Triumph: "On the twelfth day of soberness my recovery gave to meeeeeeeee: TWELVE DRUMMERS DRUMMINGGGGG!" ..Actually I got a library card. Seriously it's nice to now have the time and energy for small simple things like that. I have a long list of books to check out and it will be a nice way to spend evenings when I am by myself. ..Struggle: Dealing with my Mom's alcoholism especially as it relates to my sobriety. I feel like she's taking my efforts as an affront or as a message directed at her. Which it isn't the case at all. I'm concerned for my Mom but my drinking is / was also out of control and needed to be addressed. I want to secure my own oxygen mask before aiding others. So I feel sad and guilty that she's in a bad place. I'm not sure how to handle the situation with compassion towards both of us. ..General: My cat has taken to climbing into the (empty) bathtub and meowing until I come and find her. She'll do this several times in a row. Why?
