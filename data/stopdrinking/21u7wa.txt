i lost my gf i relapsed to drugs because i started drinking again. i tried to quit weed i couldn't. but weed is not an issue. instead of facing my problems i drank then talked shit to my gf and she was done. i tried quitting drinking 5 months before this when i relapsed again. i couldn't do 3 months i eventually started binge drinking again and when things got rocky with my ex i relapsed to coke. three weeks ago i told myself i was done then a week after i did it again when i was with my friends drinking and just wanted to forget everything. i just miss my ex. then this weekend i didn't want to drink i knew i couldn't do coke ever again because of my previous struggles. then i took one sip and I was in the zone again fiending for drugs. like a switch responsible me goes way partying me comes out and doesn't care: drinking turns off my intelligence and takes away the need to be responsible. i ended up drinking a lot doing coke and at the end of the night i snorted xanax. i am really shocked at my behavior at the same time i feel nothing. i was a huge coke head before struggled with it a handful of times last year and now i did it 3 times in a month. i feel like i'm lost i don't trust myself anymore. i was sober from coke for 5 months and now all the work was for nothing. even though i didn't run through an eight ball or something i still have the cravings like no other. i am scared. my ex helped me so much and now i have no one. this is the first time i am thinking about going to NA meetings i feel alone lost and hopeless. i need to stop drinking but i feel so weak. i want to get away from the heartache. drugs ruined my relationship i couldn't be calm i was a selfish asshole. if i can have coke i don't need no one. that's my attitude right now. i'm missing my love and coke gives me the feeling that i feel better for a minute. but i know that's where i am where i am. it's so evil. i don't want to fall back again. it's creeping up on me.

You have someone...in fact you have many people who are there for you.  They are not going to come to you though.  You have to start being proactive and go to those people and ask for help.  I suggest you go to them now.  ..Going it alone sucks.  Good luck!
Do the NA meetings do AA meetings.  Whatever it takes to stop TODAY.  ..I want to thank you for sharing this the image you lay out about the first sip of alcohol sending you back out is vivid and important illustration why we should be deadly serious about avoiding the first drink.
