As a sit here sipping my lime lacroix I can't believe where the time has gone...A year ago at this time it was Saturday. I drank some beers after I got of work I went to dinner and drank a few glasses of wine then went out and turned the contents of my wallet into as much whiskey as I could. While it definitely wasn't the worst night I've ever had drinking it ended in me stumbling my way to an Uber making a series of horribly embarrassing calls and crying myself to sleep. You know the usual...A year ago from tomorrow morning I woke up and decided I couldn't live like this anymore and got myself to an Aa meeting. It took me the entire day to work up the courage but I made it. Though I only continued with Aa for several weeks i am so thankful for that first meeting. It was terrifying but for those first few weeks the fear of not wanting to walk up and pick up a second white chip in front of everyone was enough for me to hold on too. ..Tomorrow present day is my wedding shower. I am marrying the love of my life. And I'm so beyond grateful for this year of clarity. It hasn't been easy and I am still struggling every day coming to terms with things I've done in my past and dealing with mental health issues i had suppressed with alcohol for so many years surfacing. ..I still am taking this a day at a time and know that sobriety is a marathon not a sprint. Every day that I'm not drinking is truly a blessing. ..I will not drink with you today.
