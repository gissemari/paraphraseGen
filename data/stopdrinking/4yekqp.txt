Back to day 1...If anything good came out of relapse it was that I realized one of my triggers and excuses...It is an ironic one as I really want to stop drinking so my wife will not lose me prematurely. But I really use her as an excuse to drink...What I mean is that I blame her for my drinking. If we have a disagreement it gives me an excuse to drink. If she is happy I should celebrate!..It really is an awful thing for me to do to her...I am the one who is addicted to alcohol and tries to find ways to justify it. ..I am the one who drinks...This is on me...Day 1...

Good start! 
One of my favorite sayings is from Henry Ford: "Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently."..I'm sorry to hear you relapsed but the fact that you're back here with wisdom gained ready to do the work is what really matters.
