I think I've come to terms that I can't stay sober if I don't take it 100% seriously. I've been going to bars with friends and going to events where drinking is present and it's ALWAYS led to me returning to alcohol. I realize that I've been romanticizing drinking and as soon as I get sober and start feeling better I begin to plan my relapse in my head. I'm going to start going to meetings again and get a sponsor this time. ..The one thing I don't know if I can come to terms with is telling my family that I fell off my horse. They think I'm 100% sober and I'm worried they will lose all trust in me if I tell them.

Trust yourself.  You are doing the right things.  People that are not familiar with addiction don't understand the things we go through.  If they are interested in learning provide them information.  Have them go to an open meeting where there is a speaker. We have all been through relapses it's part of the learning curve.
This really resonates with me. When I joined this sub I was finally ready to get serious about sobreity. For years I tried to quite but I was so half-assed about it that I wouldn't even say I scratched the surface of even understanding what it meant to live and be sober. ..It's actually surprisingly fun getting to know myself and my normal thought patterns again. I'd always thought I was stormy and moody but I'm not. I'd always thought I was perpetually melancholy but I'm not. There is a lot to be said for embracing the change wholeheartedly. It's interesting to read that same shift in your post...Also sober people/sober places has been one of the biggest game changers for me. I am not constantly reminded of what I am missing and I am not tempted; I just don't spend any time around alcohol. And that makes things so much easier every day.
