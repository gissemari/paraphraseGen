I feel like I'm finally doing it right this time. Last week I approached a guy who I was nervous about approaching at AA someone who had basically foretold my relapse and admitted to him he was right. He was very gracious and helpful and gave me some tips on "putting the plug in the jug." He told me I also needed to share my relapse with the meeting at large and get a sponsor...This morning's meeting was from the [Daily Reflection](https://www.aa.org/pages/en/daily-reflection) and included the quote "*We want to find exactly how when and where our natural desires have warped us."* I was a bit nervous but toward the end of open share I raised my hand admitted that I had 12 days sober and I really wanted to get to the bottom of where my natural desires got warped. I had a couple guys come up to me after the meeting and one volunteered to be my sponsor and we're going to start doing steps tomorrow...Every time I've tried to get sober before I half ass it don't do any work don't attend the number of recommended meetings and I don't listen to anyone's advice. It was really uncomfortable to take that first step today of listening to what someone told me to do and raise my hand in the meeting. My new sponsor said that willingness that I showed today is the key to sobriety and I need to hold on to it...Let's make today a masterpiece! IWNDWYT

I remember the point where I really gave in to needing support from others and admitting I had a problem that needed to change truly was a huge first step to me. And it wasn't when I kinda believed it or knew I needed help it wasn't until I actually Felt this truth deep within me that I was able to start to focus on real change. You're ready you've already begun making your daily masterpiece by writing a very significant post to all of us. Thank you. IWNDWYT
Masterpiece!
