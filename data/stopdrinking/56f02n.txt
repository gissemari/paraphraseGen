Good Morning/Afternoon    .  .Over my time being sober I have reengage with people not in recover and legitimately don't need to be. I still don't go to drinking establishments and still don't hang out with people while they are drink but my lack of presence at events and places has come up and I am at a point where i can address it comfortably.    .    .When I explain to someone who does not have a drinking problem I use an analogy. The analogy is below:    ..    .Imagine I hand you a bag of Skittles/M&M and tell you you can have one and set the bag down a walk away. Let's be honest if you take that one you will probably want more. Even if you stick to that one it will be on your mind and maybe even get to a point where you get obsessed with wanting more or wondering why you want more. Maybe even to the point of wishing you never eat that one skittles/M&M bc it's not worth the obsession of wanting more.    .That is how I am with alcohol if I drink one I will obsess about wanting more. It is possible to drink one and not drink more but just like eating only one skittles it is highly unlikely; And if I don't want to eat one skittle I wouldn't go hang out at the Skittles factory. That's why I don't hang out at drinking establishments. All that being said I would rather make the changes/effort in my life to not drink than drink one and battle myself to not drink more which I know I would lose that battle most if not all the time.    .    .That is the best way I have learned to explain it in a way thay is more understandable to a person that doesn't quite get our struggle. I hope I helped someone.    .     .Be safe this weekend.    .   .I_N_Y.

I like that analogy. I myself know I don't have any kind of eating disorder but eating one M&amp;M would be hell. I think that would make a lot of sense to a lot of people.
That is similar to how I explain it. I also include that unlike most other guilty pleasures alcohol affects decision making and the "off switch" gets harder to flip.
I just sheepishly say 'I'm too good at it'...This is a rather long analogy that could be reduced to something much briefer like 'I can't control my intake'...
The absence of such details might empower you more.  Perhaps try saying less or using blanket statements.  "I don't drink anymore". Like if someone asks me why not ? I look at them and laugh.  Like are you really asking somebody why they quit drinking ?..Feel like I've mastered the art of making people uncomfortable or to look like an idiot to probe or push me on drinking...Then maybe own it ... Much easier ... Most people know someone or struggle with alcohol personally or can relate to "hey I was making bad decisions" or "the hangovers just hurt too much"..Like you can still relate with a person that's still drinking about the downsides if alcohol and even joke about it .....
I usually just say "I don't drink anymore."  If I get pressed on it I say I have an allergy to alcohol that made me break out in handcuffs(or something similar) or I hated the hangovers.  
that's a good analogy...yes it does help. i'm still afraid to tell those i work with about it. especially when there are company functions and i find it difficult to be there and stay off the sauce.....i have told a couple of other people and got less than optimal support or understanding in fact they said stuff like "i don't want to hear it." " Oh come on nobody is perfect." "just one will be okay here have mine.". .Grrr! I'm still not drinking for today though.
I've found the most powerful statement to be 'I don't drink'...'You don't drink!?!'..'I don't drink'..End of subject/ conversation
This is a **great** analogy!..In fact a long time ago it was the Lay's Potato Chip marketing campaign at this link [Betcha can't eat just one!](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YyHkcxL7rbo)...Normies are likely to understand your version!..Thanks!..That's why to day I **forgo** ONE drink -The First One.
I say I'm taking a 30 day break from drinking then extend that a bit and then everyone including me gets so confused that I don't get asked any more.  ..Of course it's very easy if I have my car to say "No thanks I'm driving."
The analogy I use is comparing it to being a passenger in a car and having to pee really bad.  You have no control over when you stop the car so its literally all that is on your mind.  "When will we stop?" "I really have to go to the bathroom" etc.  This is how i explain it to friends/family that are trying to understand...For aquaintences who don't know and offer a drink.  I just say "No thanks.  I dont drink."  Noone has ever pried after that.
I haven't been asked to explain myself yet. I do have to confront this with my spouse though who admits they can't understand. My sponsor advises me to not bother; that's why AA and my own network there is important.
