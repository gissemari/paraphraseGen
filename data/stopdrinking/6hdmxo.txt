As a young 22 year old I KNOW that I am an alcoholic. I've been going to AA for 5 months now putting together short strings of 3-7 days and once even a 27 day period. However I just keep relapsing I still am having trouble remaining sober. As I relapsed yesterday yet again I need and I want to keep a sober life and I'm reaching out to this sub as an attempt at that. As an older member of my group told me "if you want to quit drinking you need to first stop drinking" it's so simple yet so true. Here's to my hopefully last day 1.

Honestly I probably drank almost every weekend in my 20s until I was about 28.. I always knew it wasn't a good thing and I started going 2-4 weeks at a time without a drink went 2 months at one time as well.. Always felt so damn good to do so too but I don't think I was ever fully committed.. The illusion of "moderation" always threw me back into weekend binge drinking just doesn't work for me.. One is one too many one more is never enough it seems.. Finding this place has helped very much not sure how long you've been browsing here but the support here is beyond amazing! I wish you the best you can do it! I'm very glad you want to quit at a young age and you realize these things.. You'll save so much money and really spare your body a true reaping..
