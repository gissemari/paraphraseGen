Im just staring at it right now because my addiction and my sanity are battling it out in my head. Fuck. Why did I even buy more of this shit. I was so proud I made it to 50 days and now I'm probably going to relapse...Edit: just poored it out. Thank you guys so much for the support. It means a lot to me. IWNDWYT!

I felt like this tonight (still do for the most part). Instead I ate dinner and am in my comfiest pajamas. I don't want to drink. I don't want to feel like crap tomorrow. ..Is there something you can do instead of drinking? Did you buy the alcohol for a reason? Have you played the tape forward to later tonight or tomorrow?
You have come so far already!  50 days is amazing!  You will feel so much better in the morning if you can hold on. 
Play the tape forward. It's not worth it if you are anything like me it will not end well 
You don't need to relapse. Trust me it isn't worth it. All you have to do is dump that shit and take a nice walk. You'll get back feeling much better. Stay strong! I will not drink with you today. 
I'm proud of you for getting on SD and posting! You don't need that poison. It's never done anything but mess up our lives. IWNDWYT
I had a case of the  fuck it's  yesterday. We're about the same days on our sobriety. Understand that this will happen. Remember why you got sober! Remember that if you drink that it's not going to be worth it! Think about how you feel in the morning depends on your choice tonight! If you can type something out that's a good enough reason to drink... hell I'll drink with you! 
You don't really want it. If you did you wouldn't have posted here. Dump it out and wake up feeling good tomorrow.
Awesome choice. You can do this persevere and then win.
