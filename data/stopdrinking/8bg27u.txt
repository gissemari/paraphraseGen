I honestly thought I might not make it on Monday. Even if I made it through the day I suspected I might wake up on Tuesday making plans for my next drink. Instead when Tuesday arrived it felt like a new day. The dangerous thoughts and cravings from Monday were gone. I need to remember this on my next bad day. If you're struggling today try to push yourself through to tomorrow.

Thank you for the reminder! I had a bad Monday as well but now those problems seem so small. It's good to remember one day at a time or even just one hour at a time when things are rough. I will not drink with you today! Have a great Wednesday.
IWNDWYT out there have a good day 
I'm so with you. Right when I think I have things going better the rug comes out from underneath me. It's up and down. I'm ready for extended sobriety to mellow the peaks and valleys out. Hope you have a great day. IWNDWYT!
