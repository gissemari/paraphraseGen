Hello friends!..I am pleased that the month marker is behind me. I celebrated with shopping and then dived back into the grind. A few notes on my journey:..Physically I am better than I was last month but I still have a way to go on my journey to healthy mind-body.  Cutting such a toxic element out of my system makes it easier to see where I can continue to improve...Sleep returned around Day 25.  I used to have troubling dreams (at best I was out of my element; at worst horrorscapes) and those have disappeared. My mornings feel more refreshed also...I am struggling with seasonal allergies despite medication and preventative measures so I took NyQuil on days 3-8 and on day 24. When nothing stops the deluge of grossness I need the medicine to help me sleep. That said a dosage when all else fails hasn't made me feel like I am at square one the following morning...My partner works with spirits and he feels badly every time alcohol comes up. I am not affected and just want to move on with the convo (I know  about alcohol history and mixology) but he just repeatedly apologizes; I don't know what to do!..I still want a drink sometimes. I keep a jar of olive juice in the fridge for when I crave a martini. This weekend is my first sober travels; any advice or questions are welcome. Again:..IWNDWYT
