It amuses me to recall that in recent years I would give up white wine for Lent. I could still drink as much red or beer or vodka you name it as I liked; it's just that I preferred white so it felt like some sort of deprivation. Struggling through Lent without white wine poor old me!..How much easier and how much more rewarding it has been to walk from alcohol entirely. As this year's Lent begins I'm thinking-- it's also Valentine's day. So love yourself. Never mind anyone else at this precise moment. Buy *yourself* a rose. Get yourself a nice card ...  just be kind to yourself out there   ..Did that sound a bit preachy   sorry that wasn't my intention LOL

Happy Valentine's Day! I will be going to 7:00AM mass receive ashes light a candle for all of us here at SD and make a delicious dinner (and dessert!)...Be **KIND** to yourself today you deserve it ;).
Our Church's pastors will administer ashes for us commuters who have to work in the parking lot today!  Definitely no wine for me the next 40 days.  Happy Valentines to you too!   .
I bought me and daughter a bunch of roses on impulse - just because. I hope you are being kind to yourself also..
I love this post Happy V day! I single like normal and going to take your advice I need to go to the store tonight anyway and I think I'll buy myself some nice chocolate instead of drowning my singleness in a bottle of wine.
