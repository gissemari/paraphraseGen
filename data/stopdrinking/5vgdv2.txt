**SUPER LONG POST AHEAD**..I am a 22 year old male who attends a large public university. ..I drink every single night 4-8 beers on the weekdays and more on weekends. ..Several adverse affects have come about as a result of this:..1. I gained a significant amount of weight. I was always skinny (5'9" 140lbs going into Junior year of college). Fast forward about a year and I gained 50 lbs almost solely from drinking. It sucks. None of my clothes fit and I have a visible gut and look bloated...2. The weight gain has impacted my active lifestyle further driving the weight gain. I have always been a fairly active person and love being outside and playing sports. Throw 50 more pounds onto my frame and everything gets a lot harder to do. Running jumping etc. There has been a noticeable decline in my physical abilities. In short I kind of suck at my hobbies now. ..3. It has adversely affected my relationship with my SO. She has called me out on my drinking multiple times and we fight over it. She has distanced herself from me and our sex life has diminished. I have tried to remedy the situation by not drinking around her and then drinking after she goes to bed. Obviously that's not a healthy way of dealing with the problem. ..4. My finances are depleting. Drinking a case of beer every couple of days even if it's cheap beer adds up over time and I am without a job at the moment. ..I came to college only having drank on a handful of occasions in high school. Once I got there drinking and partying were of course all the rage and I started drinking on the weekends when I would go out to parties. Occasionally I'd have a beer or two while doing a reading assignment but all in all I had things very under control. ..School got more stressful sophomore year and some life stuff came up that made me more stressed out. I started drinking more and more to the point where I was drinking not just on the weekends but on the weekdays as well. I would drink before classes and go drunk. I was getting out of control...However after the school year ended things returned back to normal and being home I returned back to not drinking very much if at all. ..My junior year I turned 21 and was able to easily buy booze. My drinking skyrocketed practically overnight. Before as an underclassman I had to text someone I knew of age to go and get it. It was sometimes an ordeal to do and put an artificial cap on my drinking because sometimes I didn't know if my source could get any for me so I wouldn't drink Wednesday and Thursday to save beer for the weekend etc. ..But now if I was running low I could drive to a gas station and buy as much as I wanted! It's normal to drink a lot on and around your 21st birthday. The thing is my "celebration" period kept going on and on and on. ..I started drinking every night. Fast forward a year and now I drink when I write papers to take the edge off. I drink when I'm watching Netflix. I drink when I'm out with friends at a bar. It's my new normal. Most nights I drink to the point where I forget parts of the night before and wake up slightly hungover. ..When I try to stop I literally salivate thinking of beer. I've noticed some other red flags when I've tried to go sober. Anxiety heart racing sweating shaking hands inability to fall asleep etc. Nothing crazy like seizures or anything but definitely things which lead me to believe my body has developed at least a slight physical dependence on alcohol. In the past year and a half the most I have gone completely sober for is three days and that was hard...Addictive tendencies definitely run in my family. Grandfather is an alcoholic father was a drug addict etc. ..What boggles my mind and scares me is *even with* the weight gain depleting bank account relationship issues and reduced satisfaction in my hobbies I still come crawling back to the bottle despite trying to stop multiple times. ..Part of what makes cutting back/quitting challenging is in the college environment drinking is **EVERYWHERE** and drinking heavily is encouraged. My friends can see me drink several beers at a party and be totally fine and be impressed but they don't see me alone in my room drinking to the point where I stumble into bed on a Monday night. ..Most people who have drinking problems that I know are older and it kind of sucks not having any peers to talk to. I'm sure there are people at my school who struggle with this but people aren't exactly eager to share that news. ..I really need to make a change of some sort but I don't know how. Also I just needed to get this off my chest. ..**TL;DR College student who drinks every night and is trying to cut back/quit altogether but can't.**.

&gt;What boggles my mind and scares me is even with the weight gain depleting bank account relationship issues and reduced satisfaction in my hobbies I still come crawling back to the bottle despite trying to stop multiple times...Isn't it amazing how powerful (and frightening) addiction is? It's insane behavior. You'd think that all of those negative consequences would be enough to stop drinking. When I think back on all of the negative consequences I faced I feel shocked. Losing jobs? Losing girl friends? Hurting family members? Totaling a car? Getting a DUI? The list goes on and on and I still wanted to drink.
I don't have advice on the withdrawals because I personally didn't experience any but all I can tell you that all it takes for you to stop is YOU to decide to do it and YOU HAVE THE POWER!!!! That in itself is so liberating- alcohol doesn't control you dude. Alcohol doesn't own you. YOU can be in control of your life again and all it takes is the commitment in your own mind and heart to say "I will not drink today.".I have a looooong lineage of alcohol problems as well- my mother went to rehab twice and just celebrated 3 years of sobriety. It is possible and it is absolutely within your control. And I will tell you life is so much brighter without alcohol. You will feel better look better have more money...you'll have a clearer mind better relationships- there isn't a single negative thing that comes from living a sober life..I understand in college it's reeeeally hard to not drink. I graduated in May so I totally understand living in an environment where it's not only normal but acceptable to get fucked up on a Tuesday. I will tell you tho that events nowadays with those college friends are just as fun (no more fun) sober. It's a common idea in our society that we NEED alcohol to have a good time. Advertising alone tells us how glamorous it is how fun it is how much we need it etc etc. It just aint so. .I can go on and on with encouragement my own testimony scientific fact whatever- but at the end of the day the only thing that will end the torment of alcohol abuse is you deciding to quit. Take it day by day man. I bet you as soon as you get past the shakes and sweats maybe a week or so you'll be really happy with your decision. Good luck! And don't hesitate to reach out on SD any time you want to- we won't drink with you!
I would try to get this handled now because once  you leave it gets so much easier. My intake was bad in college but it wasn't daily. Once I left there is a freedom that no one can or curtail for you. ..I managed my drinking in college by seeing a counselor. I had a drunken incident in college and was referred to an addiction counselor who I saw for a few months. That helped. They also offered free therapy and I saw her every week for a few years. That helped me as well. I ended up having to quit my sorority so I can graduate and hung out with sober people. I hope that advise helps but you need to stop now and you might need outside help to keep you accountable at least in the beginning. You can also try an AA meeting. There must be one on campus 
Hi I've drunk every evening for 20 years or more quite often it was lovely cold champagne I was very sophisticated drinking one! I also had an incredibly happy content childhood no reason to be addicted to alcohol.  BUT am addicted to alcohol and didn't just have one drink I drank all evening til I went to bed every single night.  I never woke and wanted a drink the reverse actually...I always wanted to not drink again.....but 20 odd years later (and for many many years Pryor)  my liver was getting damaged my once beautiful hair was thinning my teeth were rotting my depression and anxiety huge. My blood pressure was really high had palpitations constant diarrhoea gained 60lbs turned gray always felt ill and depressed but how sophisticated was I with my glass of champagne or cava or vodka.....I had all the sophistication of a lump of poo.!..I drank 12 to 20 units a night and was killing myself and knocking years I'd not decades off my life..I've never been able to moderate so can't help you with that I tried to moderate every night for 20 odd years. I couldn't because I was addicted to alcohol...Challenge yourself to maybe 30 days sober to get fit save money for a month etc. It's worth a try trust me it's really worth a try...Good luck..
Hi there.  When I was at college I point blank refused to admit I had a problem with alcoholwhich is sad because my drinking had all sorts of negative consequences for me - my health finances hobbies and relationships all suffered and I ended up dropping out. I remember seeing a couple of my peers quit drinking and they made some real positive changes. I wish I had done similarly instead I carried on denying I had a problem for a long time. I even told my counsellor that I couldn't possible stop drinking until the end of the academic year because then my peers would think I had a problem.... messed up thinking now I look back on it!..This really struck a chord with me:..&gt;What boggles my mind and scares me is even with the weight gain depleting bank account relationship issues and reduced satisfaction in my hobbies I still come crawling back to the bottle..Alcohol was casing me all sorts of problems too yet I'd protect my drinking habit at any cost instead I blamed my problems on bad luck depression other people etc. However I did start to build an awareness of my problem and lurking here helped with that. The day I decided to stop I told a loved one of my problem and also visited my doctor for extra accountability...My main regret is not having quit sooner - I wish I could have my time back to explore my studies and hobbies more thoroughly. I've since caught up and completed my studies and am enjoying my hobbies now but I wasted a lot of time and opportunity getting here and put my health at undue risk.
I was you - didn't drink in HS started spring of college freshman year &amp; ended up flunking out of upper tier engineering school as sophomore because of it.  Obviously I failed (literally) to control it &amp; am just starting to get control 30 yrs later so I can't tell you what worked for me (b/c it didn't) but in hindsight I wish I'd have done a few things:..1.  separate action from identity - hating myself &amp; thinking in "I _AM_" terms only fed the downward spiral!  drinking is an act a habit - not an identity!  this may not be a popular idea here but I reject the label alcoholic not out of denial but b/c I've rarely found thinking in terms of labels/identities useful in changing behavior.  I _DO_ things some of which are useful &amp; some of which are harmful and I work on doing better things than harmful ones.  I deeply wish I'd have forgiven myself for what I couldn't change (what I'd done) &amp; spent my energy on what I could/can(/WILL) do going forward!..2.  tell my parents!  I know how terrifying/humiliating this sounds but having two early teens now myself (part of why I'm finally getting control - setting example) I now get that parents really do MEAN it when they say they love you &amp; would rather hear it &amp; be able to help than find out when it's too late (like mine did).  as humiliating as it would have been to tell them/ask for help I can't believe it would even approach the humiliation I felt &amp; hurt that I caused my father by failing out of his alma matter.....3.  take bigger/bolder action earlier - I don't think I ever got to the point of physical dependency (never had physical withdraw symptoms) but I wish I'd have taken more decisive action earlier even if that meant taking a quarter off going to counseling or even supervised detox.  one lesson I've found that consistently applies to most facets of life is among the dumbest things you can do is 90% of the minimum required to achieve a goal.  far more often than not early decisiveness pays in the long run &amp; while it may be hard to fully understand this in college life is a LONG run!..You _CAN_ do this!  that you haven't yet isn't a reflection of who/what you ARE it just means you're still struggling with learning what you need to DO and executing it!  That you would post this is clear proof of that!  (&amp; frankly speaks positively to who you ARE as well!)
Hey so I started just like you. In college at 19 drinking every night. ..I never thought I had a problem until I was in my late 20s and didn't even try and quit or cut back until my early 30s. So you are ahead of the game...There are a ton of resources to help. The book this naked mind this sub aa meetings your doctor...Addiction is sneaky. It convinces you that you are doing OK even when you know you aren't. Like your brain says "I know I should stop". But your subconscious says "maybe tomorrow I need just a few more tonight" and this can happen indefinitely...You aren't alone and your situation is unfortunately very common. The great thing is is that you recognize there is a problem. As cliche as it sounds that is the first step...Whatever you do just keep trying and accept any and all help offered. Good luck.
