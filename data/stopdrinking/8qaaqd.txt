I subscribed to this sub about 6 months prior to my sobering up because it's remarkable. The support here is like nothing I've seen elsewhere on the interwebs. ..That said this sub did indeed lead me to test the benefits of sobriety. With exception to the occasional slip up I doubt I'll ever go back to being a booze hound. The benefits are simply too strong. ..As a consequence of my sobriety I wrote a sci-fi novella about a pyschic alcoholic who struggles to regain custody of his daughter. It has since been published on Amazon. It probably wont ever make the New York Times Best Sellers List but I'm proud of the story I wrote. ..I just wanted to say that you to all of you for helping to create a community for people like me who don't receive support from friends because they don't understand.
