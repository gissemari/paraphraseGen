Well it's been 4 weeks (again). I made it a little over 30 days last time but relapsed. I was struggling some last night......I am sure my evening cravings will be the last to go since that's when I did most of my drinking....after work and doing all my chores like cooking dinner and doing laundry. I am making it BUT I have no energy what so ever. I do pretty good in the morning but by the time I get home from work I could care less about doing anything! If I had my way I would crawl in the bed and not move until morning. My depression is pretty bad....I am on medicine but I find that I do not like myself...at all.....not that I am suicidal because I am not. I don't want to hurt myself I just don't like myself if that makes any sense. What I am noticing is that my anxiety has decreased I am early to work every morning now I have lost about 8 lbs (need to lose a lot more) I am a lot sharper mentally at work......One day at a time I suppose.....hopefully the depression will decrease like my anxiety has :) IWNDWYT :)

This is me too.  I am almost at 100 days and my biggest issue is depression.  This time of year is hard for me (dark and cold and wet) and I find myself Wanting to crawl into bed and just sleep it all away.  I have not lost any weight I struggle to find the motivation to exercise and eat right.  For so long I was just concerned about not drinking that I would give myself permission to eat all the ice cream or sit on the couch all night.  I have high blood pressure that I was so sure would go down once I quit drinking but it is dropping much slower than I expected.  I guess I am not being very helpful here I just wanted you to know that you are not alone.  I know that drinking will not improve any of these issues so I just keep on keeping on and I try to do better each day.  Today that entails taking my dog out for a walk even though it is dark and cold and wet.
