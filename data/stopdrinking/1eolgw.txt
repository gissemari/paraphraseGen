It's not much but I'm one day sober after quitting in the Summer of 2012 & relapsing in January.  While my buddy & I were grabbing food tonight the first options were closed and the only close option was a place that served drinks.  Buddy had one & I didn't.  As I watched him drink the beer all the neurons in my brain starting firing & I began a light sweat/shake.  ..As the waitress came over with the bill & asked if we needed anything else I was ultra close to grabbing a beer when I thought of the one day badge just given to me by the mods in this thread.  For what it's worth thanks guys.

Since I stopped every day i've found a new reason to be glad I did. Way to go chief!
There's something about the smilie little fella and not wanting see that number reset that adds that bit extra motivation hey.  ..Looks like we have the same number of days - good travels see you at double figures shortly :)

Hell yeah! I tell you that badge really helps! Congrats on Day 1. Now for another 24.
Congratulations! The "morning after" temptation always feels SO good when I don't give in. I bet you felt this too. I hope your success continues and you are able to stay away from giving fuel to the "other guy."
