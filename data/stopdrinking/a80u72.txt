Hey everyone it's been a while. I've been struggling again recently to get sober I just can not seem to get beyond day 1. ..Every day lately has been the same routine. I wale up and feel bad tell myself this is the day I stop drinking. I keep this mentality most of the day but by late afternoon thoughts of drinking begin to creep back in. After work I stop of at the liquor store on the way home get drunk and go to bed. The cycle starts over the next day. ..Anyways I'm posting here again for a little bit of accountability. It's nice to chat with a community going through similar issues. ..Let's not drink today!

I used to do the same thing.  Exactly the same thing.  I just could not stop the 5pm cravings.  Every day was stopping for a 12 pack.  It is tough to break that cycle.  It can be done.
I hear you!  Every morning I told myself I wouldn't drink. ..Then every afternoon my brain had decided that I could and it would be okay. ..6pack of cold ones off to sleep and then repeat tomorrow.  ..Now I wake up and pledge not drink.  Go to work and actually get excited that I'm sober.  Leave work and go home to hang out with my fur babies.  ..It feels better than I thought it would.  Thanks for that post. It was very relatable. ..IWNDWYT
