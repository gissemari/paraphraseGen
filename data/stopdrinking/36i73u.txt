I read someone's post earlier where that person making another attempt after relapsing asked "what more can I do?"..**It got me thinking there are literally countless things you can do for your sobriety and recovery!!!**..So here is my challenge to this community:  I challenge you all to  list right here just one thing....**One proactive thing you can do today to assist in your recovery.**  And before I get a bunch of "don't drink todays"  I am challenging you all to:..1) think deeper than simply not drinking today because that in and of itself is not always recovery for people; and ..2) Do not repeat what anyone else has said!!!!  If your thoughts are listed already fine but I would love to see a super thread where each thing is different and there is only one thing per poster.  I will start:..**Today I can forgive myself for my past and make peace with that thus allowing me to live in the moment and move forward with my life and recovery.**  WHAT IS YOURS?..Good luck!

Saw this here a while ago:..---..Just for today I will try to live through this day only and not tackle my whole life problem at once. I can do something for 12 hours that would appal me if I felt I had to keep it up for a lifetime...Just for today I will be happy. Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be...Just for today I will adjust myself to what is and not try to adjust everything to my own desires. I will take my luck as it comes and fit myself to it...Just for today I will strengthen my mind. I will study I will learn something useful. I will not be a mental loafer. I will read something that requires effort thought and concentration...Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways I will do someone a good turn and NOT get found out. If anybody knows of it it will not count. I will do at least two things I dont want to do just for exercise. I will not show anyone my feelings are hurt they may be hurt but today I will not show it...Just for today I will be agreeable I will look as well as I can dress becomingly talk low act courteously criticise not one bit not find fault with anything and not try to improve or regulate anybody except myself...Just for today I will have a program. I may not follow it exactly but I will have it. I will save myself from two pests hurry and indecision...Just for today I will have a quiet half hour all by myself and relax. During this half hour sometime I will try and get a better perspective of my life...Just for today I will be unafraid. Especially I will not be afraid to enjoy what is beautiful and to believe that as I give to the world so the world will give to me. 
Today I will take a bite of that elephant! That elephant needs to get eaten and putting it off is only causing me anxiety. One bite today. ..(credit to /u/ink_spot_masterpiece )
Today and every day I do little things to reward/pamper myself for keeping on track! It's kind of self encouragement for me. Nothing big just little tiny things to make me happy and relaxed like taking an extra long hot shower with a good smelling body scrub and lotion afterward. Another thing I like to do is go for a nice walk before the sun sets and then when I walk back in the opposite direction I can enjoy the colors and just have some nice quiet time and enjoy nature. :)
Today I will befriend a goose.
Go to an AA meeting.
Pick up a good habit that you've always admired in others whether it's a certain type of exercise being more careful or conscious with finances or doing something new and fun with your kid every single weekend. Just choose something and decide that you're going to do it every day. 
Transcendental meditation for 20 minutes twice today (already have one down).
Today I will be grateful for **everything** I have in my life and try not to take **anything** for granted no matter how small.
Today for at least 3 minutes I will:..*Close my eyes.*Breathe in deeply breathe out deeply repeating.*Take note of my own weight of the gravity holding me in place.*Allow my fingers to lightly brush a surface. Focus on my fingertips..*Scrunch up my shoulders all the way to my ears then fully relax them..*Keep breathing.
Today I am going to express gratitude to others in my life starting with you Nika -- thank you for taking a meta-view of the currents moving through SD and inviting us to go deeper.
Today I will replace "**can't**" with "**can**" and then **do** it!
Today I will remember the woman I was before with alcohol in my life with a clear and firm conviction. I will not sugarcoat or diminish the daily pain and suffering I felt. I will remember the ups and downs of how far I have come in sobriety and know that the only way I can continue to receive the blessings of the hope and opportunities I have today is to stay the course no matter what.
Today I will dip back into an old hobby.
In the morning I look at the day ahead and plan how to factor my sobriety into the day. Where might I come across alcohol today? How will I manouver around it? Where might I find myself bored with nothing to do? What can I fill that time with so I'm not sitting thinking about drinking? What do I need to do to get my sober head on a pillow tonight?
Today I will make time for myself to go to the gym. Always helps me physically and mentally &amp; helps me build respect for my body. 
Well aren't you clever. I was going to say don't drink today. ..Today transform your toilet into the cleanest toilet this side of Stonehenge. ..No I'm not joking Daniel-son. Just do it. ..
Occasionally I'll dwell (briefly) on the negative force alcohol can be in people's lives...Thinking of these things:...- embarrassment.- lost productivity.- ruined relationships.- DUIs.- self-loathing.- blackouts.- poor health.- jail time.- lost jobs.- etc......reminds me why it's important that I not drink; a quick inventory of the good things in my sober life contrasted by their absence - or replacement by negatives - in a drinking life..
Make my bed...Honestly - I do this EVERY DAY to remind me that Chaos and wreckage starts with me.  And this small step of productivity sets the pace for the rest of my day.    
Make a To Do list of the things you want to accomplish today and make an effort to get them all done. Smile when you cross something off that list! 
Today I will smile no matter what... and if my mouth will not form a smile I will shove a pen into my mouth and bite down -_- like so to force a smile on my face.
Today I won't drink. Instead I'll be bitter angry and empty feeling. Just like I have been for the past 679 days.
I will exercise for 20 min in the morning.  I will not eat 1500 calories of chocolate before bed
Call or text a sober friend. Be honest about yourself and take an interest in them.
Enjoy the little things in your day. Mine is looking forward to hearing daddy! when I get home.
This evening I will not allow myself to reddit on my ipad until I fall asleep. I will perhaps watch a movie play a board game or do some other engaging activity *with* my fiance instead of just doing separate things while next to each other.
Call a family member that I haven't spoken to in some time out of the blue while watching the sun set.
Today I will do what I couldn't have done today if I were hung over or drunk. I will use the time that I would normally spend drunk to actually accomplish something useful.
I have and will continue to work on my art to gain back my sense of self-worth that I have lost oh so long ago.
Today I will try not to interrupt anyone...I will actively listen today.  ..Even if I have the BEST and most awesome relevant story or personal anecdote... I will let the other person finish and if my anecdote is no longer relevant well that just means I still have it to tell some other time.
Today I will do 20 minutes of yoga...Yoga integrates the mind and body and encourages mindfulness exercise and self awareness.
Today before I go to bed I won't be mean to myself &amp; think "I should've done this I shouldn't have done that" then proceed to beat myself up. I'll permit myself down time play some fruit ninja then read.
