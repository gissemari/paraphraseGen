It takes a lot for me to get drunk these days. My tolerance is pretty high. And when I'm drunk I just feel tired and depressed unless I have enough caffeine to counter-act the alcohol. But then why even drink alcohol if it's the caffeine doing all the work? Well caffeine is no good either. It makes me anxious so I drink to counter-act the caffeine. So it's kinda pointless having caffeine either...Weed used to be fun but that too turned on me. Major anxiety and paranoia. Worse depression. I've had a few panic attacks while high where I thought I was dying...I gave up weed ages ago. It was a struggle at first but the negative effects got so bad I just couldn't take it anymore...Giving up alcohol I'm still struggling with though. I think it's partly because of the alcohol/caffeine combo. If there was no such thing as caffeine I just don't think I'd drink anymore because the tired depressed feelings would be too overwhelming. It'd be like weed where I just couldn't stand it anymore...That leads me to a question. Do I try and give up caffeine first? It might just make alcohol so unbearable that I can't drink it anymore.

Caffeine is just as bad as alcohol for me it makes me anxious and gives me major mood swings. I've been caffeine free for a few weeks and drank last week and didnt have near as bad a hangover as usual and didnt crave more drinks as bad as when I drank a lot of caffeine
