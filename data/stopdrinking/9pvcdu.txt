So disappointed in myself!  I went 6 weeks without alcohol. Then last night I was exhausted and feeling like my life is all about everyone else's happiness and so I thought sod it. Well today I had to struggle volunteering in the football kiosk.  Brain wouldn't work and felt embarrassed at being bleery eyed.  Then wasted the afternoon sleeping.  Stomach hurts. It's just not worth it. But that 6 weeks of happiness has taught me about what I want (and don't want) who I really am.  IWNDWYT

I hear ya. I have slipped many times in the past. But my last one really put the effects of alcohol into perspective for me and my desire to drink has slowly but steadily dropped off since. For me nothing good comes of it. Don't beat yourself up and pick up where you left off. Best wishes to you! 
HALT = Hungry angry lonely tired. For me every trigger I have is rooted in one of those things. Usually it's a large build-up. Dissatisfaction in my personal life frustration at work and home decreased appetite difficulty sleeping...these all chip away at me and before I realize it it's like I can't go back. In comes the fear and the pain and it's like I'm fighting with both arms tied behind my back. I lost before I realized how heavily under attack I was. ..I do my best each day not simply to avoid these common and normal issues but to snap into action when I recognize I'm having them. I understand more people have issues with overeating but I WON'T eat when I'm not mentally well. That makes me physically tired but I'm so keyed up I won't do anything about it. ..It's so easy to just destroy myself that the disease doesn't have to work very hard to break me down.
