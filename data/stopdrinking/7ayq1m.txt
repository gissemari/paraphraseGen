Nearly 4 months ago I went through the worst breakup of my life. I ended the relationship but only because I had to accept that it wasn't ever going to stop disappointing me and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I drank a lot to cope couldn't eat couldn't stop crying. A little over a month ago I started therapy and now it's been 28 days since I had my last drink...Last week was hard. I was emotional stressed out and feeling like everything was hopeless. I didn't know what to do to feel better but I didn't drink despite really wanting to. Yesterday I woke up feeling like things were going to be okay. Last night I was bored and lonely again but went to bed early after reading some materials from my therapist. This morning I woke up feeling a little better. I started a load of laundry walked the dog made myself coffee and oatmeal. It's all starting to come around. Every day is still a struggle not always with resisting alcohol specifically but with going through the motions of all the things I know I should be doing. I'm still not perfectly on track; I bought a pack of cigarettes the other night after 3 weeks without and I'm still smoking them. I haven't started working out again like I keep telling myself to. I'm still behind in school. I still wonder what my ex is doing constantly. But... I'm not drinking and every morning I wake up without a hangover and regrets it starts to feel a little more normal. A little more like this is who I am now. A little more like I'm taking care of myself and clearing space for the things I want to do...I'm not ready to say I'll never drink again. In all honesty I probably will one day. But I won't drink today and I'm so grateful to be feeling at peace right now. Tonight will probably be a different story and that's okay...Thanks for always making me smile SD :)

You have perfectly captured what it's like to be going through the transition and growth that we're all going through. I am right there with you going through the motions. Therapy has changed my life. The road is winding but it's still moving forward. I will not drink with you today. 
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. Take it one day at a time focus on one task at a time. Changing EVERYTHING at once is how people fail. Be kind to yourself you deserve it. Keep up the good work! I will not drink with you today!
