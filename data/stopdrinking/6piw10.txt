This last week I feel like I've completely regressed and I've almost given in and drank a few times.  Somehow I clawed my way out of the shit and ended up distracting myself enough to be able let it pass and taken it literally a minute at a time.  I have no idea why this is so tough right now.  My parents are visiting from back east in a few days and they dont drink.  I've never been so happy to have them coming out here.  I know thats 2 more weeks that I am completely accountable and not alone left to my screwed up alcoholic mind.  I just keep telling myself how much it will suck if I relapse and thats all I have right now.

You got this!.It gets easier!.I will not drink with you today!
"this too shall pass" I remember my instructor in the police academy telling me this right before getting  pepper sprayed as part of training. He was right. It still sucked but he was right. Keep up the good fight. 
I had my strongest cravings to date around your mark...They came out of the blue and I felt blindsided and out of practice!  I posted here and it helped. I'm so glad I got through them because for me the real benefits have only been noticable for me as more time has gone by. The fact that you posted here too is a good sign in my book! Wishing you all the best as you move forward.
