We are all different in how we do this - beyond a few basic similarities. And I'm coming to understand my own way a little better. ..I visited my best friend this weekend who struggles with drugs intermittently. We only talked a bit about addiction but I realized that I've never felt like I needed meetings or readings or whatever after the first few months. Even SD slowly petered for me over year one and is very intermittent for me. ..The muscle I've needed to build has been one of acceptance. I know I can never drink again. I know I could well kill myself if I did. I know I don't want to. I know I never ever miss it anymore. But I am still practicing - and frequently - keeping an eye on my mind so it doesn't try to invent new paths to trick me. ..Like yesterday I was telling my friend that I never missed booze but that the bigger lesson for me was that now I understood the kind of tricks my mind used to play compulsively - ie "Since I don't miss it any more and no longer feel such affection and mystique for it I should be able to use it without compulsion." I just refused for years to get my head around this kind of thing to just let the obvious be obvious - that the case is closed and that no matter what on earth should happen I simply will not ever be able to drink. ..It's simply so bizarre how non-resistance my mind is to that now and how little interest the thought even generates anymore. ..If you still drink and you recognize yourself at all in this meandering little ramble - one of the few self-indulgences I allow myself these days - former drinker navel-gazes like this one ;) - have hope; it took me *years* to give up on winning that mind battle. I think I always thought I'd outsmart the obvious. And now thank god I see that actually by getting sober I outsmarted myself.
