Relapsed for 5 days but I'm back. Had a solid streak going of about 65 days and I was quite confident of having quit forever. I felt like completely hopeless and done with everything and as opposed to all the times before I relapsed. I would just do it once then twice then trice... Luckily I didn't drink the past 3 days so let's give this another go..

I am glad you are here.. I know the hopeless feeling you are referring to. ..THIS is what is keeping me sober. I don't want to "feel" that "feeling" anymore...IWNDWYT
You can do this! Welcome back. I will not drink with you today!
Welcome back!  IWNDWYT 
Welcomed back. I've fallen off the wagon twice.  Not in a spectacular way  but enough to see  nope alcohol had nothing for me.  Working my butt off then getting drunk and not being able to enjoy a day off next day. What's THAT about?
