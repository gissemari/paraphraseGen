Hi folks  I m really struggling at the moment with little work and money . I think I read somewhere on SD that the is a free download of The Naked Mind in either PDF or audio book format . I cannot find it in the side bar on my laptop or in the Reddit Andriod app on my mobile . Can anyone help me with this issue . many thanks

There used to be one but I don't think it's been around for some time :( .Try [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnebBmScAlQ)?..Maybe someone else has a link to the book.  
Annie Grace has also created a podcast by the same name.
