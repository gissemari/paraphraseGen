"After a lot of consideration I want to apologize to anyone affected by my addiction. It has caused me to turn into a person I don't even know or want to be.I pushed away the one man who has done nothing but make me a better person and given up his whole life for me time and time again. I was the one who did him wrong--he never abused me mentally or physically. I lied to make others feel sorry for me because I'm scared to confront my issues. I cheated multiple times and hurt him badly and tried to project my issues onto him when he did nothing wrong. Time and time again i've been selfish and hurt him for my own ridiculous reasons. As of today I vow to never hurt him my children or anyone else because of my shortcomings. It's time to face the music and confront what i've done. Dan has never done anything but give me the world and I shit all over it. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I will never pick up a bottle again. I'm done lying to people about who I really am..I'm not a good person and I intend to fix it. I've gone as far as steal pills from his mom manipulate others into getting me alcohol and I'm done being selfish. ..To anyone who has worried about me or been affected by my issues I'm truly sorry. Most of all Dan--who didn't deserve anything i've put him through..the cheating lying and stealing..I'm done with it all...I'm back at home with my kids sober where I should be. Where I belong. I'm lucky enough to have someone like Dan to rescue me AGAIN for the final and last time...Thank you for reading. As part of my fresh start I thought I'd come clean about everything."I'm two days sober and I feel great..I have a good feeling it'll stick this time.
