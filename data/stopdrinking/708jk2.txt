Hi everyone..First of all mods I don't know if this is against the rules or not but I thought I'd post it anyway for some feedback. I've attached some screenshots of the early build of the site and would be interested to know if anyone thinks this is worthwhile?..If so I'd love to hear more ideas from anyone who is interested!..This is likely to sound demented but I'm trying to create an alcoholic version of LinkedIn where people who want to quit drinking can come and post about their drinking truthfully and understand why they drink and have relapsed in the past...The core of the site is based on a profit and loss sheet. People can click on benefits and cons and add them to their profile to understand why they drink. The idea is that if one  pro  remains on the benefit side then they'll be likely to drink. ..http://alcoholismeffects.com/1.png..The  LinkedIn  part comes with sober periods. This site is different from most stop drinking sites in that it rewards total sober time altogether and not just consecutive days. It will take your number of sober days and then do calculations based on how many alcohol calories you roughly consume a day to show you how your life could be better...http://alcoholismeffects.com/2.png..This next bit is where the user can really understand the impact of their drinking and the quality of the sober periods they experience. They will be able to create photo galleries inside each  sober period' to show pictures of themselves thriving...http://alcoholismeffects.com/4.png..These sober periods are powerful as they can be associated with Lessons Learned and Triggers in the event of a relapse. This will appear on the profile so that if the user comes back to try to stop drinking again they can see how bad things can get and what to avoid...http://alcoholismeffects.com/5.png..There's also an SOS update facility where people who are in danger of relapsing are able to do Facebook style updates that will appear in real time on the front page of the site. A logged in user will then be able to message the person in trouble for advice...http://alcoholismeffects.com/6.png..The whole idea of this is to gamify recovery and to make a sticky site that maps the journey many people take to recovery to help provide a blueprint for others...If you have any ideas for it I'd appreciate hearing back from you...I'm hoping to go live properly with it by the end of September
