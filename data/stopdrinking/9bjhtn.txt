I always fancied myself as a night owl but was it just the alcohol talking? Last night my SO went to bed at 10 p.m. ... and so did I. After a good night's sleep I was up early making breakfast for the fam and answering work emails. That's quite a shift from past behavior when I'd torch myself with vodka for 2-3 hours go to bed at 1 a.m. and spend the next day trying to function at half-speed. Instead I've earned a happier more rested productive day today. I'll have the energy to run a few miles after work too. Thank you SD I read about your struggles and victories every day and take it all to heart. IWNDWYT.

Happened to me too! It's crazy right?
Same here. I feel like I was playing life on hard mode!
All awesome! Keep it up. 
Same here!  I just LOVED staying up late!  Or so I thought? Once I had kids &amp; wasn't out late with friends for my weekly Friday all night happy hour I decided I deserved to stay up late a night or two each week at home &amp; do  adult stuff  like watch the late show which always turned into staying up well past the late show binge watching tv or mindlessly surfing. Just once or twice a week. Then another night each week... eventually it is almost every night except the nights I am so exhausted I can't stand it. ..So many mornings going to work in a fog. So many mornings staying in bed as long as I could by turning on TV for the kids &amp; on the weekends sleeping 2 or more hours after they are awake or saying  I'm too tired to get up to exercise I don't know how people do it!  Why was I willing to rob myself of sleep for alcohol but not for my family or exercise. My priorities were just a little backwards.  But we are here now onward &amp; upward!
