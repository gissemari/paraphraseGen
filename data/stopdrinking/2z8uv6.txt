Yesterday I woke up again in hell. I'm actually grateful. I haven't been taking my sobriety seriously and I've been serially relapsing for that 16 months...No more of this shit...My sobriety freaking matters. It's important: to me my wife my kids my job my family my fellow alcoholics...My longest continuous sobriety was 3.5 years. It was a great few years. No more messing around with my life...I will not take a drink today. No matter what!

Good for you not drinking today that is a great place to start.
What are you doing to make that happen? Do you have a plan in place?
Welcome and congrats on your decision..How were you able to not drink for 3.5 years in the past?
Mate how did you get sober for 3.5 years the first time?..What happened to knock you back into the cycle?
Yes.
I woke up feeling like shit each and every day promising myself I would not drink that day.  Then the afternoon came and I would be at the liquor store...I finally took it serious and have been dry for almost 2 weeks.  I will NOT drink today.
That's what I'm working on. Just don't drink. Do anything else within reason like a hobby or sitting down with your wife and kids whatever it takes to take your mind off the urge.
I'm on the third day it got a little easier about now...Blame it on being stubborn. But they say "I will not drink tonight". And I'm not. Plus think of the amount of money you're saving!
That's it dude! You can do it!
Hoorah! I wish you all the luck in the world. I feel you. I've been serially relapsing as well. The longest I've been sober in the past nine years was one month. This time I ain't playing! ;)
You can do this :). I was once told "Be prepared to lose anything you put before sobriety." Helps me keep focused and remember my priorities!
