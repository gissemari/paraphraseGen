wow great post. thank you for your encouragement...i'm still a baby when it comes to my journey to sobriety. every day that i can fight through the haze resist temptation and be clean is a huge victory for me right now...i had a huge temptation earlier today. my 2 youngest are typical teenagers: rude argumentative and disrespectful. i'm a single mom trying to do my best but sometimes coping with their attitudes (as well as everything else) puts me right over the edge....but today even though i was on the edge-I DID NOT DRINK
How have you handled hanging out with friends/family members/a significant other that drinks?..And congrats! I'm happy that tou were able to make it to a huge round number.
Hot damn! Nice digits :) 
Anything? What the heck is an 'nd' and why are you a fan of it?
