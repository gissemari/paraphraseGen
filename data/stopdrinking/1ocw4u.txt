Earlier this spring/summer I made it 58 days without a drink!  That was the longest I had gone since turning 21 I am 32 now.  I was working out running up to 4 miles and generally feeling amazing.  My drinking never really hurt me or others around me significantly but I had just gotten to a point were I was tired of being hungover ALL THE TIME!!!!  So I decided to stop.  At day 58 I started again.  I thought I could control myself one or two drinks here and there it would be no problem.  WRONG!  Now I'm back to my normal routine drinking semi-heavily during the week (2-3 drinks a night my drinks are usually half whiskey/half coke in a 6-12 oz glass.)  Then drinking heavily on the weekend half a bottle of whiskey Friday night the other half on Saturday.  I would keep drinking on Sunday but the stores are closed in my state on Sunday.  Anyway I again am tired of being hung over all the time.  I am going to stop again and my short term goal is 100 days semi-long is 365 long term is stop for good..I continue to struggle with my problem.  I have a good life married kid good job things are good and so far my drinking has not really stopped me from doing anything although I know if I stop drinking I could do so much more!!.Thanks SD I will be visiting often.

You know what your real short term goal is? TODAY. You make it through today you'll make it through tomorrow and off you go! Good luck!
Please read your own entry. You feel great when sober you have proved that it is possible for you to live in sobriety. You have also proven that drinking doesn't work well for you at all. Why not just live your best possible life one day at a time for all the days of your life?
