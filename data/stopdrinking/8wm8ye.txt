I'm kicking what my life was meant to be in the teeth daily and i'm not sure how to get out of this. I am as drunk as I can be and I'm sitting here crying at my keyboard. I don't want help. I should be able to do this myself. ..I have been drunk for years. Literally years. Why didn't someone stop me?
