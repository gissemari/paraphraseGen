This has got to be it this time. I haven't had cravings until now but they are kicking in. Trying to do the following:..1. Read over step 1 consequences lists etc..2. Reading the stories on this sub of people who have relapsed and people who have been sober for a long time is immensely helpful. .3. Gym take care of myself..4. Stay hydrated .5. Urge surfing ..Just frustrating because historically cravings are the first step to a relapse and I've got to get off this fucking merry go round. It is killing me. ..

I have found the same. I started listening to the audio of This Naked Mind yesterday and it really helped me. I had heard bad things about it and her sing-songy voice annoyed me at first. But then she got into details about how we relate to alcohol and it already helped me be more conscious of my thinking in a new and helpful way. ..IWNDWYT. .
You have come so far you can do this. Try to stay busy I posted my go-to list of things to do when cravings/boredom arise which may be useful to you: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/a5diws/what\_do\_you\_do\_instead\_of\_drinking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/a5diws/what_do_you_do_instead_of_drinking/)  ...I read somewhere an idea that the cravings we feel or the anxiety or the urge to drink are created **by** alchohol. People that have never consumed alchohol simply do not experience these feelings which means that these cravings are just the final throws of that chemical leaving you and exiting from your future. Stay strong fuck the merry go round you can do it. You're not alone. Good luck.
When you're feeling cravings remember they will pass.
