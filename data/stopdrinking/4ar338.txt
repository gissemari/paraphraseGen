Hello I have been sober only since Sunday.  I find myself very cranky!  I have tried to quite drinking before in the past but only lasted a few days.  This time I hope I can stick with it.  I never drank too much on work nights maybe 3-4 glasses of wine. On weekends would end up drinking one and a half bottles of wine on Friday and Saturday. Did not drink every day took a couple of weeknights off.  I am glad to find this group so I know that I am not alone in my struggle with alcohol.  My hubby joins me in drinking so we are trying to do together.

Welcome.. Stick with it it gets easier! Good for you to have your husbands support and participation! Lots of good support here! I will not drink with you
Being cranky is normal. I'm so much better than last week when I wanted to rip everyone's throat out (maybe literally). You will feel better and better each day. Starting over on day 1 sucks.
Yeah I felt quite angry in the 1st and 2nd weeks then a few days in the 3rd and now maybe once or twice a week. I presume some anger is a normal emotion so it's to be expected as part of the range of emotions.
