Hi just a rant and I feel like I need to get this off my chest...I don't see myself as an alcoholic but I think I am.   I don't need to have drinks to get through my day nor do I hide alcohol.  I don't keep alcohol in my house because I know I'll drink it.     BUT..... when I drink I have many drinks!    Looking back I can see that drinking has caused most problems in my adult life.  I've had a weight problem a loveless life I'm known as 'that guy who loves to party' or that 'drunk friend'.  ..I need to stop and I want to reach out and get help from this community.    HOW DO I STOP?   Does cutting down even work....would this lead to a relapse?   My biggest fear is I won't enjoy my life's passion which is food and wine.   I have completed my level 1+2 in sommelier training thus I am also known as that classy wine guy...Last night was my tipping point.   I'm a sales guy and sales people are known to be notorious for drinking.   I'm at writing this post at a sales conference in NYC and last night I drank more last night than anyone at the conference.   I don't remember getting to my hotel room and I woke up this morning in a pool of my own vomit.   I've hit rock bottom and I need a change.  I feel like I'm heading to an early grave.  My Grandfather died from the bottle and I fear I'm following in his footsteps..Any help or insight would be great.

How do you start? You already have by acknowledging that you desire to change. You don't even have to be an alcoholic or admit to being an alcoholic to decide that alcohol is affecting your life in negative ways...I started by stopping! Incidentally I didn't know that I was an alcoholic until I tried to stop.....Over in the side bar you'll find lots of resources to help you on your journey to a healthier and happier life. One of these resources is a free book called *This Naked Mind*. This book changed my worldview on alcohol and why I drank like I did. I highly recommend reading it. Did I mention that it's FREE? And AWESOME?..I came up with a plan. Then I worked my plan. When my plan wasn't working then I reassessed it reworked it and continued to move forward...I wish you the best and I will not drink with you today.
