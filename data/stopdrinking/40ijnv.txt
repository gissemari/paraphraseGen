Lurker here.  This is a nice subreddit I only recently discovered it.  I'm new and struggling....haven't drank for a day or so.  Whenever I get a few days together and feel good I figure I can drink small amounts.  Then I'm right back in the crapper.  I feel hopeless alone and.....other stuff I don't want to mention right now.  Just putting it out there....somewhat cathartic to do that.

For a long time I was feeling very depressed. I mean I still feel depressed sometimes... good days and bad you know? I was feeling hopeless and alone even though logically I knew I was far from alone. Objectively I have a very good life. I'm so fortunate. And it just completely boggled my mind as to why I was depressed. I realized that it was just the alcohol talking. Even when I wasn't drinking the alcohol was still there bringing me down...So it may feel really crummy right now. And it may feel really crummy for a while. But you're going to be fine. The alcohol is a vicious cycle. We drink because we're depressed but we're depressed because we drink. It's natural to be sad sometimes because then we get to feel happy other times. But it's not natural to drink ourselves into a depression. And I just can't do that to myself anymore. I know it gets better and I feel better every day that I don't drink...I hope you're stick around here. It's a great place. You can do this.
Welcome /u/insideoutsouls -- if you've been lurking I'm pretty sure you've seen the [Baby Steps link](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but it was through those simple actions that I found myself again.
It took me 18 years to learn that drinking doesn't work for me. That I can't garantee my consumption let alone my behavior. ..One day after about 18 months of drinking against my will I found I was done. ..Posting here is a great start. Stay close. 
One of the biggest turning points in my relationship with alcohol was when I realized that I can't moderate. I'm either an all in drunk or not drinking.
