Drinking does *not* help with mental health and does *not* make me feel better. As I already suffer with depression and anxiety the last thing I need is the withdrawal and depletion of the  happy  chemicals my brain already struggles to make lol.  ..Iwndwyt.

I wish I was right there with you. Right now I just want to be numb (divorce) and I'm not sure how to deal with it. The depression is (seemingly) more crippling.
