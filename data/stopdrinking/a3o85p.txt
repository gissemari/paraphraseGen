Remind me again why I shouldn't go to the bar tonight for "just two beers". Remind me that my dream girl won't be there and never has been. Remind me that the truly positive life changing events don't happen at a bar but actually happen in the absence of alcohol and away from a bar. Remind me that after two beers at the bar I invariable grab a six pack on the way home and drink it alone. Remind me that one night drinking leads to three nights drinking and a renewed struggle to get back to where I am now. Keep in mind when reminding me of these things positive events have happened to me at bars but those times are long past. I'm expecting the text message later in the day that reads: *Going to grab a beer. See you there?* I am confident now that I will resist but I'm not confident in the 6 o'clock me. I haven't drank all week and I don't want to start now. I really really don't. Thanks for the reminders.

My reminder is always a simple one.  I can't break a drug addiction by continuing to consume the drug.  ..And for your dream girl there are hotter girls at the gym than at the bar.
Sounds like you're already starting to play the tape forward for yourself! ..I find it helpful to remind myself how my drinking inevitably progresses and to think beyond what those first couple of drinks or that first night of drinking will look like. The initial feeling of relief that I'm looking for doesn't last more than an hour or two and results in increased depression and anxiety the next day. Even if I'm able to control my drinking on some occasions it invariably results in compulsive desperate binging. Even though drinking can seem like it's socializing at first I ultimately end up isolating...I found it incredibly helpful to make alternate plans for myself in the evenings so I wasn't tempted to fall back into old patterns and I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.
*Going to grab a beer at the bar.  See you there?*. Nope!  Not today my friend not today.  IWNDWYT

"&gt;" I'm confident now that I will resist but I'm not confident in the 6 o'clock me...I can relate to this so hard that it made me laugh. Sometimes at night in a blacked out depression/moment of clarity I'll resolve that I'm quitting in the morning. But even wasted me is aware of 6 o'clock me. So I wake up in the morning to find post-it notes hidden all over my house on my car steering wheel in the fridge on the bathroom mirror etc. all saying "Don't drink today you stupid fuck!" or "You promised you're not going to drink today!" or "Don't be an idiot this time!" It almost never works but whatever it's the thought that counts :-) Seriously though good luck to you AND to 6 o'clock you! All of my me's will NDWYT!
