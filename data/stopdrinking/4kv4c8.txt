While drinking it was  easy to convince myself I did not have a drinking problem. The lies became ever increasing and more cunning as my drinking grew. I was finally able to admit I had a problem and have focused on quitting. Although I am able to admit I am an alcoholic my brain is still trying to convince me to go back to drinking. The funny part is its no longer thoughts of "drinking will be so fun come on you can just have one".  I cannot even trick myself into thinking drinking will be fun anymore or that I can control it. Nevertheless the thoughts still come up periodically. I fully know I have no control over my drinking and one thing I  believe more than anything in this world is drinking will only bring misery and pain to myself and those around me. ..I am happy to be celebrating 8 months today and wish to continue on this sober path I have started. All the relapse shares I have seen lately have scared me. But it is the scare I need to continue to stay sober.  I thank you all for your stories as they have helped me immensely.

Bravo for eight months /u/FIFOdatLIFO. Thanks for sharing. I'm glad you're here.
Grats on the outstanding last 8 months! That is definitely something to be proud of and it is obvious that you value your continued sobriety.  Something that has helped me along the way is to really understand my addiction. [This](http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/highway-to-addiction-how-drugs-and-alcohol-can-hijack-your-brain) might be helpful to you in understanding why you continue to think about drinking even though you know you don't want to.  Keep it up....it does get easier as time goes by.  :-)
