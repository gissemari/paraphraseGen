[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** Last week I got through Thanksgiving sober. (SOBER Son of a Bitch Everything's Real!) It was tougher than I expected but I'm proud to say that I stayed the course.  ..**Struggle:** I had a bad few days around the holiday. Some years ago I was working with a very successful minister on her book and she wrote  Sometimes I am going along doing fine and then suddenly I feel like I have completely lost my way. I kind of panic and think that I no longer know what to do. But then I tell myself no that's not true. You *do* know what to do. You just need to go back to the basics. ..I do the same thing now when I feel like I am headed off-course as I did last week: I go back to the basics. And for me the basics are reminding myself that each and every day when I hit the pillow without having had a drink is a great day no matter what else happened or did not happen...**General:** Someone else on this site recently came up with the word  refat  and I have been cracking up about it ever since. I think we should publish an *SD Dictionary.* One entry would be:..&gt;**Refat:** (verb) To lose weight through quitting drinking but then regain through excessive ice cream and candy consumption (esp. used of a sobernaut). *Example of use: I can't believe I refatted the thirty pounds.* [Etymology: from the Latin  Ego potest non prohibere manducans  or  I can't stop eating. ]. .
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I didn't drink for a whole 2 days! ..Struggle: I have zero interest in everything. Whether it be netflix the gym friends my finals exams I should be studying for. I don't know that I'll ever feel good. ..General: I turn 30 next week. Yay? 
Triumph: handling a rocky dating situation as smoothly as humanely possible. ..Struggle: work motivation has been waning since a few days before thanksgiving. I'm starting to count down the days until I can turn in my notice and either move to Austin for work or move somewhere (or possibly stay here) for grad school. Of course I still need to apply to school which means I still need to get a LOR from my boss which means I can't afford to slack at work  ..General: I'm the king of refat. Walked smooth past the beer aisle today and bought two half gallons of ice cream. I live alone. Those half gallons might not make it until next Friday. 
ReFat wasn't that an arch criminal on the old Hawaii Five O show?
Triumph: No drinking this work week counting Sunday night. Staying on top of work house chores and keeping myself healthy. Feeling like a human being instead of a human being tired..Stuggle: It is Tuesday night here. Too early to call the work week a successful one? I am a serial badge resetter but hoping this one sticks..General: Have been lurking here for a long while and awhile back I read something (in regards to participating in SD before bing successfully sober for weeks at a time) like  if you hang out at a barbershop eventually you might get a haircut'. Hope so!
T:  Cleaned my room front room kitchen  daughters room...  not perfect but much improved. ...S:  I feel wierd when i don't have a sense of overwhelming impending doom.  It doesn't happen very often so I'm not really going to worry about adjusting to it.  ..G:  I lost a lot of weight.   Then i gained it back.  Then i gained 10 more pounds just for good measure.
Triumph: My skin looks amazing and I've almost completed my CV for cold-emailing a potential PhD adviser (if anybody has any advice/experience on this front hit me up!)..Struggle: Dentist tomorrow for surgery  ~ ..General: I have the opposite problem of refat in that I can't gain weight even though I really need to. My friend got engaged though! We're going out for lunch Saturday so I hope I can convince her to have a penguin ring-bearer lol
Triumph: 2 weeks today. Nuff said. ..Struggle: Getting through this week at work has been hard and it's been the greyest of greys for the last 3 days where I live...General: I feel fucking great. ..I will not drink with you fine souls today :)
Triumph: quit drinking Saturday and went to AA for the first time. Had one sip of G and T right after and wanted to barf gave to husband. Made it through drunken family meal Sunday without deinking. Went to two more meetings Sunday and Monday. Such relief grace and awe. No words for it...Struggle: I'm a fucking alcoholic and man do I have a lot of work to do. ODAAT...General: feeling major blaaaaaaahs. Think I'll call some AA members today...Thank you for this sub. Love to you all.
**Triumph:** I didn't hurt myself today. Holy shit did I want to and not just by drinking. I have never been so upset with myself in my entire life but at least I am *still here*...**Struggle:** I don't know how to describe it but not-drinking makes me feel so... bored basically? I don't know what the deal is but everything I'm doing seems sort of duller and all the drinks I try to use as substitutes just seem almost insulting. I'm glad that good ol' cold water remains as quenching and lovely as ever when I'm actually thirsty but the stuff I'm drinking as a pacifier is really starting to tire me out. Beyond that though the boredom above seems like it probably has to do with me just being used to being at least buzzed all the time before. I have to get used to what it's like to not be that way all the time or ever again...**General:** Moving up from ginger ale to ginger beer has been a wonderful choice if only slightly more expensive. Still while it's not alcoholic it does have an absurd amount of sugar in it and I don't want that either. Come on world!
Triumph: Started a sober December already two days in! Also ordered l-glutamine and a B complex to help...Struggle: Bored with life. Easily irritated with wonderful daughter. This will probably get better in a couple days but the boredom won't...General: I hope I can get a good deep sleep sometime soon.
Triumph: My work is on point today. I cranked through a lot of "boring but necessary" stuff for my business to run straight. #likeaboss..Struggle: I used to do that with a bottle of pinot and it was a lot more fun. Need new hobbies pronto. Eating AKA refatting not an option I was already a pretty clean eater. Bowling? Bank robbery? Help...General: Pretty sure it takes me longer to groom my beard than my GF to shower dress put on makeup and make breakfast. She still loves me it's pretty incredible.
Triumph: Finished all my Christmas shopping. In November. Like a playa do. ..Struggle: Heading home for the holiday and not really feeling I belong there anymore. Sweden doesn't feel like home Ireland doesn't feel like home. Petty identity things that needle at you when everything else is fine. ..General: I love gals in pencil skirts? 
Triumph: I wrote an article for a magazine and the editor who always makes me edit and elaborate for hours but who also is a brilliant man who *always* makes my work better was thrilled at first try. I had to pinch my arm...Struggle: The above mentioned is part of trying to get back to work after a full year on sick leave due to exhaustion. It s encouraging to see that my body (and mind) is beginning to work again but it s kinda hard that it s still reduced to a fraction of what it used to be and not knowing if I can ever work full time again. That would suck like big time. Oh well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you when you think everything's okay and everything's going right and life has a funny way of helping you out when you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face... :-)..General: We were going to take our two year old to kindergarden after two days of puking and two days of being fit as a fiddle (containment requirement). Then at breakfast out of the blue he puked again. Oh well. Funny little guy though.
**Triumph:**    Successfully put up all the outdoor and indoor Christmas decorations ladders and all (think *Christmas f'ing Vacation* here gals and guys*). So far no Cousin Eddie sewage issues squirrels in the tree or bonding with a projector in the attic then falling through. (Umm big case of the "Yets" here lol!)...**Struggle:**    Sis is going through with her new house which is 45 mins - 1 hour away from Mom. Meanwhile K and I are 45 mins - 1 hour+ (gotta love f'ing NY traffic especially during gridlock alert days) away from Mom. I've slowly moved up here but still sleep at Mom's to help her out and for dialysis duty. Getting up at 2:00AM and commuting isn't very pleasant - but right now I need to practice my Serenity Prayer ;). Otherwise I'll start waking up u/Dartaga and u/Possibilitarian2015 to hang out with me at that ungodly hour!..**General:**    u/sfgirlmary: when I saw that post about "Refat" I *lost it*! Coffee-coming-out-of-my-nose-lost-it! Positively *Brilliant*. I know there's "Refat" lurking when I slowly switch from perfectly fitted "new-sober-Lisa-jeans" to my old black stretchies :/. What the actual **F**?! Gotta lay off those damn powdered almond horn cookies FFS ;)...TL;DR: Long Term Lurker First Time Refatter... :/
Triumph: Feeling productive. Getting regular exercise. Feeling happy about not drinking. ..Struggle: To-do list is growing instead of shrinking. Need to learn to be ok with not doing some things perfectly or at all. ..General: Post-refatting Ego potest non prohibere manducans (I can't stop eating) but am at least tracking everything I eat! (with about 80% honesty) 
**triumph**  ..Went out to eat with my fianc  the other day and had my sober-stretch usual: a soda water with lemon. I was dreading it because the bartenders at this place (we've always and continue to be bar people for dinner. Which is fine)  had gotten to know us to the point where he knew my fianc  would have a beer and me a glass of wine. So I was expecting a lot of shitty ribbing. Our last favorite spot at our old place would do this. But not even a second glance! And my drink even had a lemon!    ..**struggle**  ..I think it's my allergies maybe but I haven't been sleeping well lately. Yesterday was the worst. I dragged myself through the day till 5:20 or so (tech start up. Our hours are usually ~ 9-6) before giving up and going home early.   ..**general**  ..Noticing with dismay that despite our wonderful culture at work that our Slack (online digital instant communications software. Think chat rooms essentially) channels are a bit sexist. It's nothing no one does on purpose. Just....the dynamics of online chats or certain parts of reddit are presenting themselves and it's a bit sad. I love my teammates and when we hang out we have a lovely time....its just online that lack of face to face empathy plus it being a mostly male work space makes me feel pretty unwelcome in that space.   it's whatever. I'm not going to go get drunk over it by any stretch. Just realizing I likely won't ever feel really welcome.
Triumph: I lost weight during thanksgiving by having small plates sharing meals and exercising. Not drinking is accerlating weight loss. I'm 33 and am feeling like my early 20s again. Tons of energy sleep is great. ..Struggle: integrating back into society. I don't like our society at all. Mostly because of alcohol. I think our society's obsession with drinking is part of why I started drinking. Not an excuse but it's a serious resentment I have. I haven't been to aa during this sober time but think that's where I need to be soon (I don't like the serious smoking in aa it is counterproductive to a sober life imo). ..General: I look forward to sleeping everynight because I get knocked out almost instantly. What an incredible change from the 4 hour sleep I used to get fueled by nauseous episodes and dread. I burn about 600 calories during sleep too so I wake up feeling healthier and I love it. Then coffee and I give thanks and meditate with a clear mind. I'm loving life right now...Iwndwyt
Triumph: I joined this site today..Struggle: I got embarrassingly drunk Saturday following 1.75L of Jack Daniels. I couldn't control myself and my friend actually called my family to come pick me up because I was such a bad example in front of his kids. I'm divorced because of drugs and alcohol and have lost so much. I have hit rock bottom yet again. I have not drank since Saturday and plan to end this permanenantly.
Good morning boys and girls!..**Triumph**: I am 90% moved into my own sweet little house with my pup.  Not an extra stick of furniture will fit so I planned well.  My clothes are unpacked my art is hung my [new vintage 3' light up plastic Santa](https://imgur.com/CEqmrUS) is looking out my front window...**Struggle**: I'm exhausted and battling a bit of a cold.  Unlike /u/sfgirlmary's dictionary definition (which is hilarious) I keep *losing* weight and it's getting a little disconcerting.  When I got sober I was happy to lose the 65# I had gained drinking but I've lost another 15# without trying.  Assuming it's stress and once I establish my routines here that I'll steady out again...**General**: My SO's and my divorce took -- count'em -- *4 days* to be finalized. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it and he's having a harder time but won't talk about it (hmmm...isn't that one of the reasons I wanted a divorce?).  Regardless I am holding that he our son and I will be family forever and I got [these pendants](https://imgur.com/WaBlLnd) made for Christmas to commemorate that (back side has "Family Forever" in the center and our names around the outside.

Triumph: two days strong..Struggle: I hate my job still and want to drink every time I'm done but with no alcohol in the house I just have to not drive to the liquor store after work. It's going alright. ..General: new video game expansion to look forward to in order to keep my mind occupied.
**Triumph:** My family's Thanksgiving visit was a success! We did the food at my apartment did a bunch of stuff around the city and got to enjoy some quality time with family...**Struggle:** She's not interested in me. That's disappointing; I haven't been this crazy about someone in years. Still I'm not super surprised. Now I get to live with it maybe end up as friends. ..**General:** It's my birthday today! 
Woohoo this thread keeps getting better!..Triumph: This is my 3rd day and I'm tired but feeling really good. I'm not irrationally grumpy or rude to my girlfriend and am focusing more on work and actually accomplishing things! ..Struggle:  Breaking the habit of having a few drinks while driving home and/or as soon as I get home. Everything I did had alcohol involved.  Trying to replace that with positives. ..General:  Work has been rife with some big money decisions and I'm going to have a difficult meeting with my business partner then go directly to the gym then I'm going to make some seared salmon with a light shrimp cream sauce  sauteed spinach and some roasted fingerling potatoes and go to bed sober for the 3rd night in a row. ..I will not drink with y'all today. ..also... how do I get a badge?  I'm 32 years old and can count on 1 hand the number of times I've gone 3 days without a drink since I was 18. I love this group. Thank you all. 
Triumph:  Received a very good job offer last Thursday...just before the end of the business day. Definitely celebrated that by NOT drinking on Thanksgiving. I start tomorrow. ..Struggle:  Step 4.  The moral inventory is painful. So many repressed memories to sort through in this process. I know I will it be able to correct my character defects without this step so I will continue to push through it. Still struggling to forgive myself for the stuff I did. Can't seem to apologize to those I hurt with a clean conscience until I forgive myself. ..General:  This group is awesome. Thanks for sharing your struggles and successes. Very helpful for me. ..God bless all of you!
Triumph - Spent the Thanksgiving holiday with my husband whom I am separated from with no really fighting..Struggle - This time of year I struggle to prioritize things.  I feel like a over commit myself and then end up freezing and not finishing any of it. .General - I need to address all my Christmas cards to mail - a task which always required a glass (bottle) of wine to accomplish.  IWNDWYT
Here's what I'm telling myself today. "You matter you deserve a life free from alcohol"
Those holidays really do bring out the stress and challenge. I'm glad you had some wisdom to draw from to give you strength. ..**Triumph:** My triumph is also making it through Thanksgiving particularly the days leading up to the holiday when the stress of cleaning and preparing piles up.  I made sure to get outside and take the dog on a hike every day so that I wouldn't implode...**Struggle:** I have another licensing exam coming up.  I feel like I should have spent the past weekend studying but of course I didn't pick up a book since I had family staying with me for the holiday.  I'm trying to spend every evening after work cramming and hoping I can prepare enough. I still have a few days left at least...**General:** I wish I had no idea what "refat" was like.  I lost a total of 14 pounds but I've only managed to keep 8 lbs off.  I'm still about 20 pounds overweight.  On the other hand I'm 2 months cigarette free (been struggling with quitting for a couple of years and I finally feel like I'm there) so at least I didn't end up with a net weight gain over all.  I really need to buy an exercise machine for the winter since I live about an hour away from a gym and daylight hours are spent working.  
Triumph: I feel very awake today. As if a fog has cleared. And looking forward to an active and busy week and weekend which has not been the case at all in the last several months. I have a 5K Saturday a systems upgrade at work Friday and am trying a new recipe tonight. ..Struggle: Worried about my dad. After five years of treatment for Stage 4 colon cancer he was down to a few mets and they cleared him for radiation. It would mean an end to constant chemo at least for a while if it works. He finished radiation and gets the results of his first post-radiation scan tomorrow. And I'm working from home tomorrow. Being home alone is triggering for me in drinking. But I'm here and working at it. ..General: I'm not going to have to worry about refat as I started chubby and an only getting more so. It's only been 4 days. And I've eaten enough candy to stock a store. I'd have told you that I didn't even have a sweet tooth. Plus I started eating breakfast again (good thing there). 
Today is Thursday so I'll not drink with you tomorrow  
Triumph: I haven't had a sip of alochol in 3 days..Struggle: I have lotta stress from work and am working late today.. and tomorrow. Theres other things I should be focused on too my big brother left this turd in my pocket god bless him..General: I cant wait till the next time I work out. I slept great. I have cravings for redwine. I'm happy not going to the store though. 
Triumph: I'm still here today..Struggle: It's been really rough the last few days..General: Been using the last few days for self care. It's a good feeling.
Triumph: Last night I went for an evening run on the treadmill which used to be my favorite thing in my last year sober. Last fall I was running 6+ miles almost every night and felt great. Got out of the habit when a chronic illness flare hit me hard in the spring and lost all of my stamina. Last night I ran 3 miles not particularly great but not too bad! Best of all it felt wonderful and I was reminded of why I loved running so much...Struggle: Only four days in since my last relapse and I'm already struggling with the thoughts and cravings. Usually I'm fine for a few weeks before it hits me but not this time. ..General: Found some good podcasts and books about living sober and feel like it is helpful to immerse myself especially now with cravings.
