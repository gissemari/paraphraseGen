....recently at a meeting a new person to the program was telling his story of woe.  He was talking about how his wife was threatening to leave him if she caught him drinking any more so he told her he would quit.  He loves his wife and kids.  Surely he could quit for them?  All the alcohol was out of the house and he told his wife about all the places he hid bottles to be accountable.  A few days later his wife to her horror caught him in the garage trying to kill himself by drinking gas straight out of the gas can!!!!..Turns out he wasn't drinking gas at all.  He had come up with the idea of buying a brand new gas can and keeping his vodka in there.  No way his wife would check the gas can for alcohol...So why am I insane almost 4 years clean and sober and no struggles at all on a day to day basis?  Because my first thought when hearing this story...**my very first reactionary thought** was "this is a brilliant idea!"  ..Yep only insane alcoholics would think this way.  The good news?  I am no longer a slave to my reactionary first thoughts.  I have the ability now to think things through.  Moreover I don't beat myself up over thoughts.  Thoughts don't mean anything.  It is my actions about which I need to be vigilant!  :)..**EDIT**  This has turned into somewhat of a thread of people telling insanity stories they have lived or heard at meetings.  I think this is really good especially for newer people it confirms that you are not alone or unique in your actions and that there is hope to get better.

Nope. You aren't alone. I just thought "Shit! I wouldn't have ever thought of that one!"..It would suck if the SO tried to pour it into the lawnmower though...
That's awesome! I love hearing stories about the crazy shit we do that seems perfectly reasonable - clever even -when we're in the depths of our disorder...I have a friend who talks about doctor-shopping for pills near the end of his career. Most addicts have done this to some degree but this guy really topped himself by getting prescriptions from a vet! Basically he was stealing his dogs' meds. Like the guys says in Spinal Tap 'there's a fine line between clever and stupid.' I know which side of this I eventually ended up on.
Well in your defense it *is* a pretty brilliant plan.  
That is genius...Crazy fucked up addicted brain brilliant...With all the combined years we've pickled our noggins we could have figured out that whole world peace thing.
haha Insanity runs deep. You're not alone.
&gt;I am no longer a slave to my reactionary first thoughts. ..Amen to that.  I think that's a very good way of describing recovery.   Congrats!
The other day my mom asked me to kitten-sit for her this weekend and my kneejerk first thought was "unattended liquor!". Catch up brain we don't do that kind of thing anymore! 
New one to me too..Did once hear a guy qualify that he did drink  gasoline - mixed with fresca of all things  ..If you collect bad bottoms that's one
LOL; but I didn't need proof that you are insane.

A guy here said that he had convinced his wife that although vodka should be kept in the freezer it evaporates there very quickly and that's why the level is always falling in the bottle.
Unbelievable. That was my first thought too. 
Last week someone at the meeting said they had tried acupuncture to help them moderate...I had never thought of that.  Crossed my mind that I might have left a turn unstoned...
Ain't it the truth! My insanity reared it's ugly jerk off head within 3 weeks after I had Hannah. So pissed off that those feelings were flooding my brain after everything I had done and been through I was stunned. It reaffirmed why I chose adoption I still have a lot of work to do to become the mother she deserves. I knew 4 months pregnant that I wouldn't be ready or have enough trust in myself to take on parenting. The battle never ends but it's getting easier. My eyes are on an amazing prize.

I guess I'm insane too because the first thing I thought when I read that about the gas can was "why didn't I think of that!?"..Thanks for the laugh today!
As a female the garage was not safe hideout territory. But I must have I drank some "cleaning products" and possibly snorted some "cosmetics".  When I would find myself gulping hidden vodka over the washing machine it felt like I was in some bad made-for-TV movie. I became a literary clich  the drunken desperate lonely bimbo housewife. Ugh...Happily sober now and in a much better relationship I read your post to my 17 year sober SO and paused before your final paragraph long enough for him to interject eyes gleaming "That's brilliant!". Twas my first thought as well. ..Then I read your almost verbatim reaction. We laughed heartily at having survived another lost opportunity.
Brilliant.
no  nooo.
So this guy is qualifying at a meeting a while ago and he's discussing the method he'd devised to keep his drug use from interfering too heavily with his work habits:..If he had a small project to complete for work he'd take his stash and bury it in a nearby park so he couldn't get at it so easily in this case Prospect park in Brooklyn NY. If he had a medium sized project he'd bury it in Riverside Park which runs up the west side of Manhattan. If there was a whole lot on his plate he'd drive to the Bronx and bury it in Fordham park which for those who don't know is really really far from Brooklyn. Of course this never really worked out and just meant he often found himself digging holes in public parks in the wee hours of the morning...My first thought upon hearing this "Man this guy has a much better work ethic than I do."..Epilogue: Dude's a reverend.
Really happy I read this because I felt like I've been slipping (mentally) today. Actions &gt; thoughts. 
HA! You want proof I am insane?..In rehab I was jealous of people who had drank longer than I had. .."Oh you've been drinking for 20 years? You're so lucky. I only really had 5 years of hard drinking."..W..T..F
I heard one guy explain how he tricked his wife into thinking he was "moderating". He would only have a glass of wine or two in the evenings but what his wife didn't know was that he was spiking the wine with straight up grain alcohol. Wife thinks he's just having a glass or two of wine but in reality he's getting a mighty buzz on drinking a few shots worth of grain. Lot's of people replied to his story with a hearty "why didn't I think of that??" haha.
I knew a guy who carried around a half completed police officer exam so if he was ever pulled over while drunk he could say he was applying and try to get out of it.
I was in treatment with a guy that would fill his hose with vodka so on Sunday mornings when he did yardwork he could get drunk instead of watering the flowers. The gig ran out when his wife vodka'd the garden
To be honest objectively speaking it is a brilliant idea. Kind of like the guy in the news recently who dug a tunnel from his bedroom to the local pub. It's not the way I'd handle the problem but ... it's fucking brilliant.
This.  So much this.  Today while taking a nice fall stroll with my dog I was thinking "Hey I could finish off a pint before my SO gets home and it would be okay!".  This line of thinking coming from my brilliant brain who was  4 days ago was detoxing in the hostpital and is on their fourth attempt at recovery in less than 2 years.  ..I came to the realization that I will never understand this about myself.  I won't know why.  And I have to let that go.
At my ex GFS house when we were still together I used to hide a bottle of vodka up in the ceiling that was drop ceiling. So id go in the bathroom lift the square and the bottle would be there. It was perfect because I could lock the door assuring no ones coming in cause "im going to the bathroom" also she was too short to check inside the ceiling. I used to have to hide alcohol from my dad not cause he would get mad but because he would end up drinking it before I got home I hid a case of beer under the bathroom sink and it just so happens he was cleaning out the bathroom that day and I came home to all my beer cans empty on the table with music playing and him gabbering on the phone.
I'm so happy you brought this up. ..Not too long after I quit drinking a couple buddies of mine paired up and honed their drinking and football watching game. Each had added a small 6-pack cooler with ice to their arsenal. So once seated they had cold beer without getting up. ..I was literally angry that I could not participate. Still am I think.

I used to fill up water bottles (with vodka) and drink them in plain sight. Right in front of my wife. She never knew. ..Looking back that was grounds for divorce. So wrong. 
I know a woman in AA who had a STILL (just like on M*A*S*H*) behind a wall in her basement! Imagine never having to go to the liquor store or running out at 3:00am. Even though I was in recovery I thought that was the best idea in the world!
I took insanity to new heights. ..Bought a new windshield washer reservoir and hoses. Installed and ran the new hoses through a hole I drilled into my [dash storage](http://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mUKwjgXnporhlxUq-GRjjKA.jpg). Filled the reservoir with vodka and when I wanted a drink I'd put the cup in the storage and use the windshield washer function shoot booze into my drink.
As I was reading I also thought "why the fuck didn't I think of that??" ..I sewed plastic flasks into the bottom of all the drapes. ..
My most insane story was drinking so much I got picked up by detox and taken there and even though I blew a 0.32 an hour after I stopped drinking still being lucid enough to beg for my phone because I was seriously going to call 911 to report my kidnapping. ..Ive also drank a liter of E&amp;J blue label to myself in one sitting literally without getting up over like 3-4 hours. ..I also stayed up drinking until 11am when I worked at 5pm got sent home because one of my buddies is a manager and sent me home "sick" at like 8pm when he noticed I was still drunk...Ive also perfected the art of drinking on the bus and just in public in general. ..Also I fell on my face and got a bitchen scar for life that looks badass actually I got really lucky I didn't die because when I woke up noticed I bled THROUGH my pillow like it was still soaking and crusty on the edged and I bled all over and my sheets were all red and I had to throw away the pillow...Also I crashed my bike again on my head on my way to work an overnight shift in a parking garage and I woke up in a pool of my own blood and a superviser asking me wtf happened. I just was totally honest except I left out the drunk part...I also left my backpack full of like 2k$ worth of magic cards on the sidewalk and walked away and luckilly it was found my my GF at the time and scooped up because she was worried and looking for me. ..God the list goes on and on and on I have a million stories. SO glad I don't drink anymore I was a ticking timbomb for self-termination! 
I am sick too. Because that is genius!
Yeah talk about insanity... we all have those types of thoughts.  :P
