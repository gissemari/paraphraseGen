Hi everyone!..I mega slept in this morning. I don't usually set an alarm for Saturday because my usual meeting isn't until 10:30 and my cat usually has me up before then. I was up pretty late last night. Not doing anything fun I just made a tactical error and drank a huge peppermint mocha at 6:30pm because I was excited about the return of peppermint-chocolate combinations not really thinking about the coffee part of it...I met up with some sober friends last night and we went back to the meeting I'd been at a couple of weeks ago where anyone can suggest a topic to discuss. No one else had a topic to suggest so I suggested dealing with unmanageability in early sobriety. ..Step One of the twelve steps is:  We admitted we were powerless over alcohol that our lives had become unmanageable.  I'm on board with being powerless over alcohol. Once I start drinking or have been drinking recently I'm powerless. I drink more than I plan on and I drink when I don't plan on it and when drinking could cause me problems. My drinking becomes compulsive and I am so focused on what I think that drinking is doing for me that I do all sorts of mental gymnastics to justify my drinking to myself...The second part of that I didn't really understand until somewhat recently. My last time around I understood it to mean that drinking had made my life unmanageable. I saw all the ways that drinking was causing me problems and creating unmanageability in my life but I still thought that the root problem was drinking. I thought that I was screwing things up and making poor decisions just because I was drunk or hungover...If that were the case just quitting drinking should basically solve the problem right? Well my experience has been that it sort of does but that there's still a lot of unmanageability in my life. I still don't know how to live a life that's manageable. My life still feels chaotic and a bit out of my control. ..I got a lot of useful feedback at the meeting. Some people mentioned that dealing with unmanageability is an ongoing thing. Several people talked about going to a lot meetings and how they would hear other people in meetings talk about things that they were struggling with and they learned how to handle it from what those people shared. ..Someone said how important it had been for her to share honestly in meetings about what was going on with her because that would bring people to her who knew how to deal with whatever she was struggling with. (Much like making a post on here with a very specific topic will attract responses from people who have dealt with that particular issue.)..Someone talked about how helpful the slogans had been for them.  First things first  which means deal with your sobriety first and prioritize what you're doing.  Easy does it  which means you don't have to throw yourself into things excessively you can do things is a slow and easy manner and they'll still happen. ..Someone talked about how useful the Serenity Prayer was because it's all about categorizing things into things you can and can't change and then changing what you can and accepting what you can't. And some people had feedback on how they'd learned to do things like pay bills on time and how to break down and prioritize tasks...Several people said that it was something that takes time and that I should trust in the process. Staying sober avoiding picking up that first drink or drug and working on the steps with my sponsor would help me discover how to deal with my problems in an appropriate ordered and manageable way.  You don't work the program the program works you. ..All in all it was an extremely helpful and supportive meeting. There are so many people who I've met in AA who have been willing to help me and share what has worked for them. I'm so glad that I have it as a part of my life. ..I'm going to go to a meeting this afternoon because I really enjoy and appreciate the support that I get there and it helps me keep my head in a good place. I can go without meetings and not pick up a drink or a drug for stretches of time I've gotten sober before and done it on my own. But it's such a better journey with others...And that's me. I hope that you all are well and finding support and manageability in your own lives...Ginger_Sprout Out

Thanks for your post Ginger_Sprout.  There are areas in my life that I'm not managing particularly well but I'm not sweating it.  I'm sober have clarity and peace of mind.  I'm present for others.  I'm liking me for the first time in a long day.  Improvements come daily little by little.  This journey is so much better with others who understand.  Have a great weekend.  I'm leaving this Chicago snow behind and heading to Tampa tomorrow for a week of vacation with my wife.  I'm thankful.  I would have been divorced by now if I hadn't quit.  Keep doing all those good things you do and I will try and bring back some warmth from Florida.  Take care
Hello!.Those sound like excellent meetings with really dynamic discussions. And such a supportive atmosphere. ..If it's helpful one way that I've grown in my application of powerlessness has been the consistent present of intrusive thoughts and impulsivity. For me there are two layers of powerlessness. Before drinking and after drinking. ..Before drinking and in life I can have endless intrusive thoughts. They are a part of how my brain is wired and managing them with healthy approaches (my autocorrect first changed that to  healthy appetizers  which sounded delicious ha). There's a part of me that's powerless over my brain wiring the subsequent intrusive thoughts and the constant urge towards impulsivity. I can easily surrender to that. ..When I drink and after I drink in some way - I have acted on and empowered those intrusive thoughts. The spiral of unmanageability escalates rapidly. At best I am not addressing my underlying issues. At worst I am actively sabotaging my essential work to work through the intrusive thoughts impulsive acts and stability. ..This has been an approach that connecting the dots within my mind. If it's helpful please apply or share and if it doesn't click no pressure to use or keep it.
