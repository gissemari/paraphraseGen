Night time would be my secret drinking time and this week I have not had anything to drink. I found that reading all the posts have made a huge difference. Reading about the struggles and victories have really helped. Thanks

We're in the same boat from a day standpoint...but I'm scared the only reason I've made it this far is because my parents' house is a dry zone. I'm heading back to my place this afternoon couldn't be more scared. Your strength on day 6 is inspiring. This Reddit community is a very helpful resource.
Great work to you -- I won't drink today with you!
