[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I get up at five in the morning to teach a class before the day has ended in China. As a drinker I wouldn't even have gone to sleep yet; I used to go to bed at six in the morning. I thought I was a night owl. It turns out that me staying up late was just another excuse to keep drinking. Now I love the early morning. I am up before dawn with a cup of coffee while the rest of the city is still sleeping. It is a quiet private moment to myself...**Struggle:** I had an unwanted message from an ex-boyfriend from England that I cut out of my life in my early twenties. I do not want to know this person and hearing from him stirred up a bunch of old painful memories that I had buried. I've heard it said that the good thing about getting sober is that you get to feel your feelings and the bad thing about getting sober is that you get to feel your feelings. Well I'm feeling mine...**General:** I am thinking that squirrels should be the official animal of /r/stopdrinking. (Obviously La Croix is the official drink.)..What about you? [Whatcha thinkin about?](http://i.imgur.com/A2sE7m9.png)..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I've put my sobriety first again...turning down invites out. I have been alert and present for school. ..Struggle: I get mad anxiety from my problems with perfectionism. I am scared of failing. I want to pull out so I can't fail. But that is essentially failure in itself too. ..General: I'm grateful for this sober journey. I might try an actual meeting this week. We will see!.Also..I need to stop grinding my teeth. Anyone have solutions for this? 
**Triumph:** Day 2 is officially over! I'm house-sitting for a friend with their full bar practically in my face. No problem. His brother came in unannounced and poured himself some scotch while I continued to guzzle down sparkling water. Winning!  ..**Struggle:** I went in to work tonight off the clock to network with some alcohol industry folk and was made fun of by my bartenders for not drinking. :) I skipped out on an AA meeting for those no-showers. My time is worth better. I need to prioritize my well-being over relationships that probably won't even matter by the end of the year...Squirrels are the best! Check out my neighborhood squirrel- the first time i saw it I thought it was a beaver. Excuse the poor camera work: https://imgur.com/a/SJ7NK
Triumph - today I make it to double digits for sober days first time in over 17yrs.Struggle- I know come dinner time that desire to have a glass of wine while cooking will be all consuming.General- where I used to live we had a black squirrel that lived in the garden
**Triumph:** Last weekend I essentially gave into temptation and went to order a glass of wine in a restaurant. My normie boyfriend reminded me casually that I was doing dry January and order a soft drink himself. I'm so happy that I have him and also that he's not much of a drinker himself. ..**Struggle:** Yesterday I treated myself to some mussels in garlic sauce. The serving suggestion was literally "with a glass of cold white wine". Its like salt in a wound! Associating a good meal with a good accompanying glass of wine is always where i trip up.  Every quitting attempt has ended with me "moderating" after week 2/3 with a glass of wine at dinner then drinking excessively for a few weeks and then deciding to quit again. Rinse and repeat. Pray that this time is different. No more mussels...**General:** My dreams have been CRAZY recently. 
Oh my goodness I love this!!...Triumph: that I have not drank a drop in three days and I have attended four AA meetings in three days! I have actually never tried this hard/actually committed to quitting drinking so also even just trying to stop and make improvements in my life is a huge triumph for me. I am feeling so excited for my journey in AA and I feel like I totally am right where I need to be. ...Struggle: at the end of the day when my body is overly tired and ready for rest is when I crave drinking. But I will not drink today! And that is all I have to worry about. My progress sobrietyand hangover free mornings are now more important to me than my evening beers. ...General: in general I feel pretty fucking amazing and proud of myself. Enjoying my honeymoon phase of sobriety. Everything is clicking. Also I love squirrels :) 
Triumph. Still sober  relationships are improving  physically I feel a little better. ..Struggle. Mentally and emotionally it really is a struggle.  Anxiety is through the roof  sleep is very difficult and stressful emotions are raw. ..General. Dihydrogen monoxide is my friend. 
Triumph: One week sober and I got a nice round badge :)..Struggle: Finding out I have goals again and feeling overwhelmed thinking about how to get there and how to do it without being drunk. Fridays are hard too. Getting impatient now to move on...General: I am starting to feel like a person again. Not a half-drunk zombie dreading the future. It's like coming back to the land of the living. I am noticing more stuff. I want the future now instead of dreading it. My SO is really proud of me. 
Triumph: I went out last night to the theatre wasn't tempted to drink even though my friend had a glass of wine had a great time..Struggle: My digestive system is staging some sort of revolt and using every single weapon in it's armoury to make it's disgust with the new arrangements VERY clear .General: Feel a bit like my productivity is starting to improve
Triumph:  it's my 3rd day with no booze and my first day posting something (hope I'm doing it right)..Struggle:  My mind keeps playing tricks on me like you'll never get thru that situation next week without drinking so you might as well throw in the towel now. .General:  I've got to take it one day one minute at a time and I know I need your help (please). I will not drink with you today. 
*Triumph:* Even though I'm only two weeks in (this time) I was clear headed enough last night to have a heartfelt conversation with my twelve year old daughter.  It really felt like we connected on things that we have never really discussed before.  I am a single father so I finally felt like being sober is the right step for myself as well as my daughter...*Struggle:* I haven't quite gotten the fire back for work yet.  At times my job is challenging which I really enjoy.  At other times it can be dull and monotonous.  When I was drinking I couldn't stomach the boring tasks so I would get behind in some of my responsibilities.  Now I need to focus on what needs to be done even though my heart isn't all the way back into it yet...*General:* Being a part of global communities like this one is amazing.  I was able to spend some of my adolescence abroad and I really enjoyed experiencing other cultures.  As I get older I get more and more disillusioned about what it means to be American...
Thanks for the encouragement!  I needed it. 
**Triumph**: I just generally feeling optimistic. Today is my birthday and I am giving myself the gift of sobriety. Cheesy but I like it...**Struggle**: I am out of town for work and away from my family; it's hard to sleep in a hotel. My schedule is packed so I'm trying to schedule exercise and self care while having enough time to get good sleep...**General**: the plane I flew in to get here holds only 8 passengers and has a propeller on the nose. I've never been in such a small plane. It was terrifying and exhilarating.
Thank you. It feels right to be here. 
Triumph: haven't drank for something like 65 days and that is way longer than I have ever gone. I've told mostly all of my friends and am very confident I'll never drink again. I also read back over some of my old journal entries I keep about some of the horrible experiences I've had with alcohol. It makes me so relieved and happy I'll never have to go through that again. ..Struggle: I still find myself having trouble getting motivated. Procrastination and getting distracted is still a big problem for me. I've got to work on this. ..General: Things are going pretty well. Looking back on how things were with alcohol makes me feel a lot better. I've had zero hangovers. I used to be depressed for two or three days after a big binge and I never have that anymore. I'm just a much better person without booze and I plan to keep it that way. So happy I decided to not drink. I don't mind other people doing it at all it's just not for me. 
Triumph - Had my first day of classes for the semester and was able to attend and be 100% present thanks to sobriety. Struggle - I work right after class at night and not sure if I'll be able to finish the semester with this job due to lack of sleep. General - I like squirrels. 
Triumph: Woke up at 6:15 this morning. Unheard of! Then I looked in the mirror and kept touching my own face in disbelief at how soft/smooth and moisturized my skin looks compared to a couple weeks ago. It's INSANE...Struggle: I know I shouldn't be getting ahead of myself but it's hard not to think about the future. I'm preemptively fretting over two upcoming weekends I'm spending with friends. None of them will pressure me to drink but they are such fun goofy people and I do enjoy having a night of beer games with them once or twice a year. I know I can get through it with seltzer. I just have to determine how committed I am...General: I replaced a lightbulb this week and felt handy/self-sufficient as hell about it.
Triumph: I managed to keep up on all three of my kids' chore charts for two weeks now. I was able to calculate their allowances (husband helped me on that because even sober math has never been my strong point and we're dealing with decimals here people.) and make sure they received any bonuses for extra work. (It's the little things right now.)..Struggle: I'm on day 25. I vowed sobriety for 30 days while going through steps outlined in the 30 Day Sobriety Solution and while I feel stronger this time and like I have a lot of tools this time I'm also a little too aware of Day 30...General: I woke up with two cats on my chest at 5 AM looking at me as if to say "Where in the fuck is my food lady?"
Triumph: I've casually added my not drinking into conversations about my vacationing last week. Not one person reacted badly about it or even tried to take the conversation further. It was such a non issue I don't know why I had played it up in my head so much that it would be a thing...Struggle: I have land sickness!?! Who knew this was even a thing! Since waking up on Saturday I fell like I'm constantly swaying back and forth while on solid ground. I'm also nauseous headachy and can't think straight. It's like having a mild hangover and it sucks :( ..General: [Squirrels](http://imgur.com/HpUlxt7) it is! 
**Triumph:**I'm now over the month mark and I am so proud of that. My kids have noticed and they're commenting on how I smell good and look "fresh"..**Struggle:**My relationship with my SO is still rocky and I'm pretty sure he's hiding his drinking when he's not outright being belligerently drunk. One day at a time focus on me I guess. .**General:**Work life and home life are more tolerable. I increased the frequency of my therapy appointments and go tomorrow to talk more about my disastrous rock bottom night. It's a relief to have that support. 
TRIUMPH: this may be small but last night I vacuumed under my bed washed the base boards and flossed my teeth. I am certainly a 'neat' person but dig a little deeper when in the throes of my addiction self care was not a depth for me. Felt really good! ..STRUGGLE:  I am a skilled in the IT profession but am grossly underpaid again due to my addiction I was a few flashes of brilliance and then I would mess up somehow like not there on important days because I'd have to lie and stay home too hung over for life and build it back up. With that inconsistency I didn't feel I deserved more. Now I guess I need to find that balance and it is a struggle.  Much less so when sober=fact! ..RANDO thought: I pay far too much attention to television voice overs and often imitate voices to keep my own company.  (Yes I do have friends don't worry too much friends). ..I will happily not drink with you all today! 
Triumph: Sleep. Glorious sleep. No 2 a.m. wake up no drinking glass after glass of water because I'm so parched..Struggle: I'm looking at a business trip 10 days from now and wondering how I'm going to get through that not to mention the inauguration..General: Squirrels suck! ;-)
Triumph: Woke up to a big beautiful 3 today! My husband has stopped along with me and has remarked that I've been generally nicer to him lately. ..Struggle: Kinda kills me that booze was turning me into a meaner person. We never had any shouting matches or crying fits but I bet it was just making me more irritable in general...General: Someone mentioned a specific type of beer yesterday and I found myself struggling to remember what it tasted like. That's a struggle I quite enjoy!
#Triumph:  197 days not doing to bad still get an urge here or there but other that I can't complain..#Struggle: Was supposed to go to a friends surprise bday party last weekend it ended up getting cancelled I messaged him to see what was up turns out he'd been drinking and texting people he shouldn't be.  He told me he's ready to get sober and I hope he does we ain't that close but he's still a friend I can only hope for the best for him.  ..#General:  I was voted "Squirrel Master" in highschool and I approve. 
**Triumph:** That much closer to double digits and if I am honest it has been that much easier to avoid the temptation to buy alcohol when I am also honest with myself about how much I was spending. I am using an app to calculate the money I "saved" and later am going to treat myself to PSVR. Going to get my buzz by going to **VIRTUAL REALITY** (dun dun dun)...**Struggle:** I will be attending a family friend's wedding with my spouse soon. She knows I am not drinking and is fine with it (I told her general money and health reasons and she agreed especially to the former as we are trying to save for a house down payment as well at the moment)...She and others will surely be drinking there. I am unsure if I just want to take it head on and tell people I am not if someone offers champagne etc. or just stay quiet and use a decoy sparkling water and lime drink.
Triumph: Nine months ago I had a severely compromised liver. The specialist doctor said if I drink ever my liver will bleed and I'll die. Yesterday I got the blood work report saying my function is doing quite well. It's surreal having gone from a doctor telling me there's a very good chance I'm going to need a transplant which I wouldn't qualify for due to my addiction. He said I would have to manage 6 months dry to qualify for a waiting list. Six months seemed a lot longer than forever to me. I felt so sorry for myself that *I* couldn't drink anymore. How dare him. Whew!..Struggle: Starting a new job this week. I still have a hard time with stress. I can manage my day to day stress and a few larger things but when I become overwhelmed I start having drinking dreams and intense cravings. While unpleasant I'm aware of this so I can stand strong...General: Life is good. I've reconnected with those I hurt and started the process of bringing them into my recovery. Nobody wanted to abandon me but I really left nobody a choice with how horribly vicious I'd become. When I stopped fighting so hard and accepted reality and that I couldn't escape it 24/7 things got a lot easier. I absolutely love not waking up with radiating pain from hangovers and being able to remember things again.
Triumph    ...Out for drinks with my fianc s brother and his girlfriend and he (the brother) orders a round of tequila shots to celebrate our new engagement (woo!) and he didn't even bother ordering me one! This is the guy who tried to get me to drink champagne on my birthday earlier this year by having a round to toast brought to the table. I commented on it saying  I was so glad he hadn't bothered and he said at this point he respects the hell out of me for feeling so strongly about something.   I laughed and said I totally appreciate the gesture but I wouldn't have taken it anyway. I can't imagine how vile a shot of tequila would taste at this point. I imagine I'd vomit immediately.  ...Struggle   ..I had a glass of wine in the Bahamas a little bit ago to celebrate aforementioned engagement and it tasted like straight nail polish remover. despite it being just the one glass I still woke up at 2 or so that morning unable to sleep mild headache and slightly upset stomach. It used to be back in my drinking days that wouldn't happen until more like 4 glasses. I thought about making a post about this but just don't feel like it's that big a deal to really write out but it's been on my mind ever since. We're back to business now though and I'm glad. It's much simpler going out or whatever when I don't have to constantly monitor and evaluate myself (and others). That stupid glass of wine didn't make my night any better and it made my morning a little worse.   ...To me alcohol is alot like a motorcycle or power tool or any kind of inherently dangerous recreational thing. My kitchen aide mixer doesn't care about my hands' well being. If I fail to treat it properly it *will* snag my hand into the bowl and mash it to a bloody broken pulp. It's not evil it's not malicious. It did only what it was made to do and it was me who failed to understand and respect it's power. (I saw that happen to a classmate once the mixer thing. It's brutal) ...General   ..Weddings are expensive holy fuck. If we can get in under 30k I'm going to call it a victory. 
**Triumph:** Traveled again and did a customer presentation that went very well. Very comfortable situation which still seems strange to say. ..**Struggle:**On day 199 I sat outside of the grocery store doing the proverbial self pity and justification for drinking argument in my head. I get ahead of myself in trying to figure out where I go from here instead of just being. Just being OK is enough...**General:**I fly back home in a few and will feed the squirrels so Stimpy can attack them thru the window while they sit on the hind quarters and stare at him. Good times. 
Triumph: I am alive and hit 8 days! Also I had a friend give me a thank you gift of a bottle of Cuban rum last night. I am a bourbon gal so it really didn't tempt me much. I stored it away and will probably re-gift it down the road. I don't see this person but once a year so I didn't want him to feel bad that he bought me this bottle. I will tell him that I quit but not today...Struggle: Sleep. It still takes a long time to drift off. I had a weird dream last night that I was playing Russian roulette. I didn't put a gun to my head but I kept spinning the cylinder like it was a toy. Maybe the gift of rum bothered my subconscious enough to bring on this dream it was very strange. ..General: I think a squirrel is a great mascot but it would need a tiny hat lol...:) Btw don't forget Jan 20th is a big day in the USA - IT'S NATIONAL CHEESE LOVERS DAY! I'm going to turn off my TV and bury myself in a wheel of brie.
**Triumph**: I've now gone 2 full days without a drop of alcohol. This is the first time in 10 years that I have gone even 20 hours without alcohol. ..**Struggle**: Feeling a bit weepy in the mornings at the drop of a hat...**General**: In general the last 2 days I've felt like a goddamn ~~unicorn~~ pegasus.
Triumph: this is the start to day 3 and I am so very grateful for it. I read stories to my children lastnight and put them all to bed. I wasn't drunk so I didn't rush through it to get back to my beverage. It was so enjoyable. Afterwards I sat by the fire and read scripture. It was great! Oh and also I am not hungover this morning!!..Struggle: I constantly catch myself thinking about having a drink. I have seen how good I can be at making up reasons for drinking. I guess I am some sort of excuse master. Also the sleeping....I cannot sleep right now. It seems nights are a wrestling match between semi sleep and full on being awake. I look forward to this ending. Finally I am pretty on edge emotionally. I feel like anything small could change my attitude for the worse my wife has been great but I'm pretty sure I have been a jerk towards her with a lack of kindness and zero tolerance for any kind of imperfection.
Triumph: Yesterday was the ten year anniversary of my dad's death and my fianc  is on a business trip. This is the first time I was alone for this day. I was able to stay in the right path even with that going on. ..Struggle: well kinda same as above. Being home alone for 8 nights is hard. That leads to my brain being mean. But I have my cat Omar to help me stay sane. 
Triump: I woke up sober and clear minded...Struggle: It's the start of day 2 and I feel lethargic.  I am torn between taking it easy and healing and telling myself to "suck it up and get your ass in gear."  ..General:  I feel great that I'm clear headed and not hurting from last nights' binge.  When thinking of doing the things I would do before I turned to beer (an average of a 12 pack 5 nights a week) like going to train at dawn I realize that as mentally exhilarated as I am  I need to pull off the throttle some.  So I'll train later.  Or I won't.  But I'm without a doubt eating and drinking nutrient dense foods (aka healthy) all day.  Fuck beer and booze.  Hello life..
**Triumph:** There's a 4 in my badge! 4 weeks completed! Woo hoo. Looking forward to my star next. Also I'm getting back into my pre-Christmas workout routine...**Struggle:** For over a year now I've had trouble setting boundaries with a particular individual in my life. Recently this individual called me out on never accepting invitations or reaching out to them. I finally laid it all out to them -- why I'm not reaching out why I don't think we can be friends and so on. Now I'm blocked on Facebook. Awkward but oh well...**General:** Not drinking allows me to focus a lot more on my other health and fitness goals!
Hi :-)
**Triumph** - I'm still sober on day 133. ..**Struggle** - The struggle is real my online friends. I haven't been this depressed since I was drinking every single day. I snap out of it for a half day or so but then it's right down into the pits of misery. ..**General** - I can't believe we are swearing in the biggest idiot of all time to become our leader in 2 days. This lying bag of shit is going to be the downfall of this country. Even if he's impeached the people right behind him are just as bad if not worse. I guess this is another struggle.
Triumph: this would have been day day sixteen but I fell off the wagon hard over the weekend. It's day three instead and I have lost 7 pounds since quitting. I physically feel great and my newly sober husband and I are really connected. I've joined smart recovery...Struggle: still beating myself up for stumbling over the weekend and even though I had a terrible hangover and felt guilty and emotional I still can't convince myself it won't happen again. I'm stressing about this weekend the constant battle of will I or won't I or should I or shouldn't I is causing me to feel insane. All of my energy is going to this battle. ..I'm afraid my husband will get bored with me now that we are both sober..I'm afraid It will never really stick and I'll be sick forever..I know it's normal to lie to yourself and romanticize it but I don't think I have good coping skills yet..I have this image of me and my girlfriends visiting from out of town just drinking wine and relaxing in the sun but I can't seem to combat that with an image of me puking or hungover or guilty. I want the war to be over I want to surrender. But I am still fighting it. My resolve won't stick. I need better coping skills...General: start school in three weeks which was my initial motivation to quit so I can be focused. Excited.
That squirrel!  How adorable!  Yep all of the feels here in sobriety land.  It's crazy how after over a year and a half sober I'm still learning how to deal with them.  But in retrospect I spent 20 years pushing some of them away so patience and acceptance Juls patience and acceptance...**Triumph:**  Got through most of my funk and got myself signed up for a winter adventure race.  I've been kind of waiting for someone else to get me back into my outdoor adventure lifestyle and finally stepped up and chose something fun to do.  Time to accept my life as it is and that right now I am the sole motivator for outdoor activities in my little world.  Looking forward to an Abominable Winter Adventure Run!..**Struggle:**  Finished a book on habits and I want to change ALL THE HABITS right now!!  Working on just choosing one keystone habit and getting up early every morning is the one.  Honestly all of this self work gets tiring sometimes and I just want to be a kid and play.  Waaah...**General:**  Anyone else out there doing a Womens March this weekend?
Triumph: lying in my bed last night with my oldest son next to me doing his homework and I was sober not frustrated by his questions or pissed that he was interrupting my wine drinking. I hate that I was this half-assed mom for so long but am grateful that I'm a sober and present one now. .Struggle: my husband travels next week. When he's away I fill the loneliness with booze. Will e first time he's away since I stopped drinking. I've got an AA mtg on the books for Tuesday and will reach out to a sober friend to cope on Monday. And check in here each night - it really does help. .General: in all honesty I'm not a squirrel fan bc they eat all my birdseed even the "squirrel-proof" feeders don't work. But when not eating my birdseed they are pretty cute. 
Struggle - I got an OWI New Year's Eve and my truck was impounded. When I was released from jail the next day I walked straight to detox and was then admitted to a 28 day residential treatment program...Truck is sitting in impound still accumulating fees each day and I will have the money to get it back on Friday but the staff has yet to decide whether or not to let me get a day pass to retrieve it. If I can't get my truck back I won't be able to afford the fees when I get released in February. This is putting a lot of stress on me...But I'm hopeful that it will work out.
Triumph: Staying sober.Struggle: Staying in the moment.  Worrying about dates that are 2-3 months away.  .General: What is up w everyone's love of La Croix?  Need to check this out!
Triumph: I'm clear headed and sober to support my nephew's mom wife &amp; kids after he attempted suicide early this morning..Struggle:  Definitely feeling my feelings right now...alcohol will not make anything better.
Triumph: inspired by /r/stopdrinking's La Croix enthusiasm I bought around 15 different kinds of flavored sparkling water. Did not find La Croix but discovered some other great drinks!..Struggle: we've got drinking friends coming over tonight  for the first time. I'll offer all kinds of drinks with and without alcohol and we'll see what they choose. In any case I won't be drinking any alcohol!..General: feeling lower on energy than I was in the first week. Probably due to having a cold and being on a mild diet. But my sobriety pride level is still soaring!
Triumph: Over 14 days sober and every day I feel better than the previous one. I'm back on track after the holidays and vacation to lose more weight and save money and I'm super pumped to have both of those goals boosted by zero alcohol consumption and purchasing...Struggle: Family vacation started with beautiful national parks in Utah and Arizona and ended with 2 nights in Vegas. The stark difference between the natural splendor and an artificial city of lies was too much to handle. The flashing lights all the people all the drinking and gambling. I never was one to drink with family anyway because it was weird but I was in a sensitive spot because I'm trying to cast everything Vegas represents out of my life and I was being barraged by it. Didn't have fun and I stayed in the hotel room for the whole time LOL...General: I saw an Abert's Squirrel in AZ... he was huge with cute tufts on his ears.
**Triumph** Enjoyed a sober trip to Yosemite with family and friends.  It was beautiful snow covered mountains and rising waterfalls after the storms...**Struggle** Having a hard time with my partner right now.  Just trying to figure out how to make things comfortable.  He is such a slob and clutterbug. I am realizing how much this really gets to me...**General**  Time to buckle down and get to work.
Hi :-)
Triumph: started this yesterday!.Struggle: work dinner tonight may cause pressure for wine. .General: made a goal journal for this year and spent a couple hours on it making weekly plans to track sobriety health etc. hopefully knowing how long I spent making the damn thing will help motivate me. 
Triumph: I was more open and honest with co-workers about my situation and bonded with a few people...Struggle: I am NC with my dad but I switched over to a new messenger and a text he sent slipped through. "I'm going on vacation tomorrow I need to talk to you." Aka I need validation that I am in control before I go relax on vacation instead of dealing with my problems here."..General: I am being my authentic self for the first time ever and I am realizing that EVERY conversation has a little aniexty in it. I don't need booze to get through that I just have to accept the emotion process it and let it pass.
**Triumph:** 17 days since my last drink and not counting the few week I drank between Christmas and New Years I have almost 3 months without alcohol and 17 consecutive days...**Struggle:** Have a cold and almost didn't make it to work. I did though and am finishing a project that needed to get done...**General:** I got nuthin'..
**Triumph:** Today it's all y'all. It's great to scroll through and see all the people making those early steps and early successes...**Struggle:** I'm over caffeinated. A colleague brought me another coffee. Now I can't type. Yeah thats my big issue for the day...**Squirrels:** Over the past week at work we've been classifying problems as squirrels or trolls. One is noticable but not a longer term issue. The other is hard to spot but could blow up if not addressed. Hmm there might be a life lesson in that.
Day 1 and I will not drink with you all today! 
[removed]
Not drinking today!.
Triumph: I am beginning to sleep until the alarm goes off in the morning instead of staring at it all night and turning it off ten minutes beforehand...General: We have LaCroix here at work! Going to go get one right now.
Triumph:  I've discovered healthy ways to comfort myself and they are starting to seem more natural to turn to now than booze...Struggle:  Dealing with some depression issues....  I know it will get better it alway does its just hard to keep the healthy momentum going with little to no energy...General:  Flying squirrels?  If there's an option to fly you should always pick that option.
T:  I'm making progress in meditation...S:  Started class yesterday.  Late yesterday  was a half hour early and still end up late!  Late today again.   Slept in.  Daughter late as well.  Had to battle with the 5 year old to get her to go then I couldn't get her back pack to close! !!  Making great impressions!   Yeah...  ..G:  Those squirrels have been going crazy!  Running around in my head and chattering at me.  I'm seriously upset about being late two days in a row and those squirrels are bitchin at me. 
First post ever!!! Been around here a lot the past year and decided to get involved to help myself out. .Triumph - Day 5 alcohol free! My first day sober was being DD for a group of friends to start my journey with solid perspective. It worked the bar was ugly for the first time there sober in a year..Struggle - I work in the wine business making wine and live on a vineyard/winery. A lot of people in the industry are life long alcoholics..General - Jimmy Herring is one of my favorite guitar players of all time(He has always been alcohol and drug free!)
It's been almost a week now - before this I hadn't been sober for more than two days for almost a year. And even that period of sobriety only lasted for 2 weeks. Anyway I went to a 6.45am Pilates class this morning first time I've been productive before 10 am for ages. (It's thurs morning in Australia) Feeling good and definitely not drinking today! 
I assume this is the check-in thread so I'm checking in. Not having a great day. Not having a bad day. Just trying to get through. Seems a little harder today for some reason.
Triumph: I've been a better partner to my loving fiance and feel no guilt or shame about drinking the night away while he remains sober. I can tell he appreciates the bonding time too...Struggle: My energy levels have been just awful lately. Any suggestions/ideas to why this may be happening? ..General: Work is good home is good future looks bright. What's not to love? .
**Triumph:** My sleep has gotten better. Even though my dreams are really weird at least I'm having them. ..**Struggle:** I haven't come up with good responses to people who ask me out for booze events and I'm not yet ready to tell them what I'm going through as it's enough for me to handle just getting through each minute at this point.  I was hanging with my BFF over the weekend and she asked if I had Monday off since she had it off but her kid would still be going to day care and "we could totally do a boozy brunch!!!"  I was like "oh yeah brunch sounds good... or maybe we could walk through that (totally alcohol free) greenhouse we keep meaning to go to."  In any case we didn't end up doing anything so I didn't have to deal with it but I will soon and I should be ready to talk about it.  Fluh.  ..**Minor Struggle:** While my priority is to stop drinking I was secretly hoping to see some weight loss as I was drinking SO MANY CALORIES.  I know 9.5 days isn't a long time and it could be water weight but I actually went up a pound from when I started.  Bummer.  ..**General:** I also love squirrels.  My favorite new shirt has a totally sweet squirrel pattern.
Triumph: quitting for me has been much easier than moderating. I mostly get bummed thinking about future events without alcohol but I think of the many more benefits from being sober. I've been doing a lot more art and personal projects that before had no energy for. ..Struggle: still very tired this week. Been sleeping in later than I normally would. Leaves less time for personal stuff before I go to work in the late afternoon. I finally gave in today and think I just need to let my body rest. ..General: life is good. I'm still a pessimist but I'm far less grumpy than I use to be. ..Thanks SD! Won't drink today
**Triumph:** Today I took a step to give up alcohol and stayed sober all day. I think I had maybe 5-15 sober days last year. Its been on my mind to give up alcohol for awhile now and after reading and watching videos on peoples' success stories on how much more productive you can be without drinking I decided to try to quit. Wish me luck. .**Struggle:** I play sports many times a week and the guys like to have beers after games. I think it will be difficult to say no initially so I am preparing myself for that..**General:** First Reddit post. I've been a long time lurker. I hope to learn to communicate better through reddit. 
**Triumph:** Well it has been a week so far and I haven't had the temptation once yet.  Hit every workout this week too and cooked up a storm...**Struggle:** Went to one therapy appointment trying to book another. She seems good but so far has i) called me 2 hours late for the initial consult ii) was 10 mins late for the first session iii) no show for the second.  That's a frustration when i wanted to keep on track at the beginning.
Triumph - Didn't drink when I cooked this evening usually I drink a bottle of wine as part of my Wednesday night routine.  ..Struggle - Ate way too much candy today need to start addressing the sugar cravings and be mindful with my eating.  ..General - That black cat in the moon keeps yelling at me to take out a credit card and buy it moon treats.
Triumph: Almost to day 20! Getting easier and easier to go to bed early. ..Struggle: Still fighting off irritability. I'm starting to think it stems from something not related to drinking. Also my ex boyfriend decided to end his silence and try to coax me back. This was highly upsetting and brought back emotions I didn't want to feel. That was a hard night. ..General: My attempts at learning how to snowboard are going well. I am only falling a few times now. My buttbone is going to be super strong by the end of the snow season. Or super broken. 
Triumph: I'm quitting again..Struggle: I had a rough 4 days in Vegas and lost 2 years of sobriety...General: I'm back in this for a good life.
