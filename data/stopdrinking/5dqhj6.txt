Day 6 and first really hard cravings.  Just super stressed out and anxious and my mind is screaming tequila and cocaine. Firmly planted on the couch. Thank god for Netflix.

You got this I won't drink with you tonight!
Hi - here to support you...congrats on getting through this! You can do it!
I recently discovered that the old Bob Ross show "The Joy of Painting" is on Netflix. Definitely a stress-lowering show there.
Hang in there. Take a deep breath and enjoy the Netflix. And take comfort that you'll remember what you watched tomorrow. I've rewatched too much to count due to forgetting what the hell I watched...I'll be here watching TV and not drinking with you.
Stay strong! What are you watching on netflix? I can't settle on anything.
Same! Netflix &gt; waking up tomorrow regretting things 
the longest i went sober was 6 months in 2015. and 6.5 months in 2016. What works well for me is exercise at a gym first thing in the morning. Even if I get to the gym and can only do 10 min of a workout.  I do it anyway. You have to have rituals.  Gym is just one of many.  Also stocking up on vit D and b6/b12. daily. no compromise. .
