Hey everyone..I would like to thank every single one of you for helping me out these past 40 days (45 days if you include my early relapse). I will be doing it on my own from now on. Making this decision is scary but I'll be able to handle it! Especially thanks to all the nice people on IRC (if you haven't been there go there!) for coping with my madness...Goodbye..IBurnAngels

Why are you leaving? You will be missed :-(
You never have to do it alone.
You're always welcome here no matter what.    
You're welcome back anytime.
You're always welcome back if you find it gets at all tough or just want to vent! Or even just swing by and say hi.
Well here's a suggestion. You don't have to come to this subreddit every day nor do you have to go to a meeting every day. (you don't have to go to either if you don't want to). But staying connected I believe is a good idea. Don't become a stranger. Either way good luck in your adventure. As people have always said come back if you need to no matter what.
Why anyone would choose to do this alone is beyond me. It doesn't make you stronger it doesn't make you smarter. I was just glad when I emerged broken there were still hands there to help me up.
