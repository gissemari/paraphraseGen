I'm stubborn.  I want to solve my problems by myself.  This is one of the bigger struggles I've had wiggle trying to quit:  admitting that I can't do it alone.  ..Earlier today I heard someone talking about needing his brother's help in sobriety.  They work  together as movers and he pointed out that they help each other there all the time....And what he said really resonated with me...I have a couch.  Great one it's all mine and love it...But I try as I might I can't move it alone.  It's big heavy and if I try (I actually have) I might move it a bit but I'm just rearranging the furniture not getting it out of my living room.  And if I insist on doing it alone I'm likely to hurt myself.  ..Frankly I need someone to grab the other end and help me carry it...And that's exactly what dealing with drinking is:..Sure it's my problem my burden.  But I need help carrying it.  I can pretend that I'm moving it but in reality I'm just shifting it around in my life and might make things worse...It's not a weakness to bed help crying a heavy load.  Whether a couch or q drinking problem...And that was eye-opening to me...
