Ok  so it's only six days but I have noticed my skin is already improving. On the down side I feel permanently tired and am struggling to concentrate. Is this normal?

I don't know about normal but I was tired and vague for the whole first month sober. Glad to hear about your skin improving!
At least based on my experience it is totally normal.  Those first several days were the worst sleep and concentration-wise.  I've gone around and around on this thing too many times to count but each time around 7-10 days I finally started to sleep better--falling asleep faster less anxiety staying asleep for (most of) the entire night.  Once I got there the concentration energy appetite (for healthy things) all came back strong.   I know this can vary for different people but hang in there--you're definitely close to turning that first corner! :)
That happened to me.  I'm 31 days in and I was really exhausted for about 3 weeks.  Took 3 hour naps etc.  Had intestinal issues as my system was thrown into a new normal.  Also irritable (probably from the aforementioned problems!).  I'm still tired off and on but have definitely noticed the brain fog lifting as I continue the journey.  Hang in there!!
Similar here very tired in the morning almost like I'd been drinking the night before but ok by midday. The lack of sleep has contributed 13hrs total in 4 nights! Small price to pay considering the positives - clearer head not constantly thinking about when it's alright to start drinking getting my shit in order and really thinking about the way forward! Oh and my pee was unusually dark on day 2 an indicator of how many toxins my body couldn't deal with as it was always dealing with the booze!
Yeah it took me like 6 months to stop oversleeping for work and things like that. Look up post alcohol withdrawal syndrome
