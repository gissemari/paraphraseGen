It's been months since I had a sober week. I am going to keep going. One thing a few relapses one after 2 years of sobriety have taught me is that it's just as hard to get sober every single time I relapse. It's never easy and in fact I think it gets harder to quit every time I go back to it...My brain likes to tell me I can just have a few one night and I'll be fine but it always ends the same way -- drinking too much all day and destroying all my relationships...I'm ready to get better and be the best I've ever been for myself. I'm really proud of my one week because it is just the beginning.

Congrats!  That's great!!.IWNDWYT
Great job!
If you can do one you can definitely do two right? Bang it out!
That's great.  I'm on day 35 of sobriety this time around.  Been 'giving up' for nearly 13 years now - been weeks months and years in the past.  The one thing I've learnt is that I simply can not have one drink  - my brain is not wired that way and it's not my fault.  Everything will be better today because I will not drink today.  And I won't drink with you today either !..Thanks for sharing and courage to you on your journey ahead.
One week buddies! Proud of you too. :)
