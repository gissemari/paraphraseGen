I'd love to hear from some "old-timers" that once would've characterized themselves as chronic relapsers. I've had multi-year sobriety in the past all while working the Steps know full well the consequences of just one drink attend AA meetings every day have a good sponsor could probably teach a class on addictionology and yet here I am at almost 60 days weighing the pros and cons...I pray/meditate 2x a day I'm extremely physically active eat relatively well am probably too active on /r/stopdrinking just got an amazing job but again here I am justifying drinking as a "treat" or something I've earned. I lost my drinking privileges many years ago I know that. But for whatever reason I am still having these thoughts. I'm doing everything "right" in the traditional sense of recovery and yet I still feel vulnerable to a slip...Like I said would love to hear from some old-timers specifically. How did you go from chronic relapser to old-timer? Am I merely experiencing recovery fatigue and need to grow up and get over it? Thanks in advance.

 No such thing as too much time on SD  ..I'm not an old timer by any means but I am a 30 something whose life was wrapped up in a party lifestyle since I was 14.  Some in my friend circle are starting to die off from years of substance abuse. ..I felt like I was starting over when I quit drinking and in many ways I was. It was scary but I'm so glad I did it and I thought about stopping or attempted moderation for years. It just didn't work for me. ..Every moment you work on yourself and come here to post or pick yourself up is a golden moment and you should be proud. It's soo fucking hard. IWNDWYT 
I'm an old-timer in that I've been drinking consistently for the past 25 years. I have not attended AA but I have tried various methods of cutting back moderating and otherwise managing my drinking. Nothing has worked for more than a few days with the exception of pregnancy and breastfeeding and those are no longer options for sobriety for me. ;-)..I do know what you mean about that feeling that a drink is a treat or a reward that becomes engrained in us. That's how I've always treated drinking--a reward.  I turned a corner last weekend and have since come to realize that drinking is not a reward. NOT drinking is a reward...I do a lot of things in life for the reward--exercise eat healthy work hard raise good kids drive carefully watch my finances and so on. All of these actions have led to tangible rewards so I keep doing them...But for some reason I viewed drinking differently. It was my reward--but what was that reward? Hangovers feeling like sh\*t undoing the benefits of an otherwise healthy lifestyle regret missing out on life setting a bad example for my kids etc. ..I'm changing my perspective. If I have a really good productive day my reward is NOT drinking so that I can get up tomorrow and have another good day. ..This is only Day 4 of this round of sobriety (after many many attempts over the years). But I'm changing my thinking about drinking. I woke this morning clear-headed refreshed less bloated... this is my reward for NOT drinking last night. I will remember this tonight and work toward the rewards of not drinking.
