After yet another night of poor sleep and waking up way too early it's time that I got this thing under control. And by under control I mean no alcohol whatsoever. I'm physically and mentally tired of the struggle and I know the longer I put this off the harder it will be...So here I am starting another Day 1. I've poured the remaining alcohol down the sink and put the bottle in the trash. I'm going to download the Reddit app on my phone so I can look in throughout the day and stay motivated by all the great people here...Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.

Welcome back!  Sounds like a plan.  Be kind to yourself.  Let time work.
Hiya.  My new mantra is 'I don't drink' kindly suggested by another group member - it's taken away the flexibility of  'trying not to drink' !  IWNDWYT
You got this! I've found that after the first bit this whole quitting thing has been a humongo weight off my shoulders (the occasional craving has nothing on that long-ass time I spent struggling to actually stop). IWNDWYT!
I'm on another day 2.  I feel you. One suggestion is maybe starting your day in a different way tomorrow than you usually do. For me it was getting up and going to the deli for breakfast ( which I haven't had in ages because I'm always hungover). Or plan a new experience for the evening to look forward to. Go to a movie after work. Anything to change it up and see life differently. 
Day 1 again for me to IWNDWYT.
Right there with you friend
