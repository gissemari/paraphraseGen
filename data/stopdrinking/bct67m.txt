Companion mentioned something about it not being as fun maybe we should do something different since I wasn't a drinker. ..Me: "Yeah but the food will be amazing..."  ..And the thing is - totally natural response from my 876 day sober brain. Not a lick of "missing out" or wishing I could drink. ..I'll definitely pack my 5% fierce-piety about avoiding relapse but I don't think I'll even need to take it out of my bag.

I went to a birthday party last week.  A couple people looked at me sadly because I was missing out by not  being able to drink with them.'  I it didn't feel that way to me though... I've accessed a higher plane of experiencing existence now.  Everything feels wonderfully different than it did while I was drinking.  That vineyard will possibly be more beautiful to you than it will be to almost anyone else.  I hear what you're saying.  I won't be drinking with you.
