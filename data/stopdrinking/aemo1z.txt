I am 22. I am on Day 1 again. I'm really trying to make this work. I hate drinking. I hate the person it turns me into- but all of my friends seem to love drunk me. She's loud and funny and promiscuous and fearless. But I hate it. I want to be courageous and funny and charming- but I don't want this life that keeps drawing me back in. I know I need to start thinking about my future but it seems so overwhelming. I don't have a degree and I really don't know what I want out of life. I just want to be happy healthy and financially stable. ..I've already disconnected from all social media because I felt like it enabled me and was an easy way for people from my past to contact me. I constantly think about how amazing it would feel to cut out all of my friends change my number and just start fresh. Just work on myself while I'm going through this transition. But I feel like my lack of a sober community always ends up making me feel lonely and then I go and reach out to those people again- the ones that like the other me not sober me. Has anyone experienced this? Early sobriety is just so lonely that's where I always end up slipping up eventually leading to my relapsing. And I've tried AA I just never really took to it. Always felt out of place. Should I try it again?

I was going nowhere fast getting sober "my way" on my own. ..Having a community of sober folk is so crucial I believe. I come here every day and participate when I feel I can add something. In my early days I was here all the time. Also reading up on recovery and addiction doesn't hurt... AA can be a turn off but not every single one is the same. Try out a few different ones till you find one you groove with if you like. ..I will not drink with you today  
I had to keep going back to AA until I got it...Until I overcame my terminal uniqueness...Try a variety of meetings. They vary in topic and temperament
