There were moments in those past few days I was certain I wouldn't get through. I struggled with enormous sadness helplesness feeling overpowered. I felt tired and I am still tired because I work too much I was hungry. You can understand that every possible trigger was fired. I wanted to stop feeling shit SO MUCH I wanted just to harm myself. ..I managed to do something about it. I mean I managed to partially resolve my difficult life situation wich was causing me so terrible pain. ..Today I got up in the morning the sun was shining birds chirping and I breathed air like I was a newborn baby. Yesterday I laughed for real for the first time in two months. It is enormously good feeling to have that weight off. It's not over but it's better...My thoughts are this: the hard times could come but they ALWAYS pass. Life is like a sinusoid you need to just wait long enough or do something constructive. I had a choice deal with a problem or go and get hammered. If I got hammered problem would still be present but additionally I would have to deal with hangover and shame...Now I have half of a problem and no hangover and it's magnificent. I am proud of myself because I'm real warrior! If I could do it and survive so many triggers at once you can do it too. I'm literally no different than you are and I did it. ..In fact I was the most unconsistent person I know of. But this time I sticked to it and I believe you can stick to it too. ..I won't drink or smoke today!
