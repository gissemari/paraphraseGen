I know it's going to be a struggle. Drinking has been so many things for me. A way to stave of emotions and depression lubricant for the rusted gears of my confidence in social situations. The list goes on. But one thing drinking has never been for me is a way out. Morning always comes and with it the wave of memories and emotions and things I was very happy putting away at the bottom of a bottle. ..I've never hit a rock bottom. My wife and kids prevent me from reaching that point but one day the strength of my responsibilities as a parent and husband will be outmatched to a 40oz and a pack of smokes. ..This is day one. This is the day I decide that I don't need beer or wine. It's the day I take back my life. ..Fellow redditors join me as I check in (I plan to once a day). Help me. I see the success stories here and the support and love. Be there for me as I'll be there for you.
