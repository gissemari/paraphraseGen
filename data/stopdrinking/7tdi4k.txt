I've been pining for a brew and smoke lately so this post is a reaction. Would it count as a relapse if I poured tall cans on my head and had someone blow smoke rings up my nose?..I play in a band and go to dinner with friends never being hungover I find I enjoy myself more socializing. My anxiety is manageable and I can look people in the eyes. When I get the urge to drink I have to remember all the blacking out shame crashed car personal inadequacy wizzed on the couch raging out etc...A relapse would put me back in the body of a guy who was raging on the inside even while sober. The booze was not just a one night a week party it changed who i am everyday. It made made me a sad blame everything on everybody chump. Fuck that!..Okay. Thank you off to the gym!.

Ha I am finding hilarious the image of you under a waterfall of Steigl surrounded by a plume of ciggy smoke. I often inhale deeply when walking past smokers I don't know; I have been known to stand downwind from those I do. Sad sad state of affairs. ..Sounds like you've got a great handle on your urge on what a relapse would mean to you. I will not drink with you today!.
