When you are living with alcoholism it becomes the primary motivation for everything you do and whether we realize it or not everything else in our life becomes secondary to the cycle of fulfilling our dependency. And because nothing else can ultimately fullfil this need  our life becomes a perpetual struggle to input satisfaction that it cannot achieve in all other areas.  All other inputs are subservient to the addiction whether it be emotional fulfillment material possession food sleep sex etc they are all under the control of the addiction and your life is never ending struggle to input satisfaction that it is blocked from getting. In this cycle you can never be the person you are truly capable of being. It's been slow progress but recently about 7 months now I'm starting to turn my self outwards again without constraint where the functions of daily life can be enjoyable because I can give myself fully to them without the perpetual underlying motive to drink. The veil is finally starting to lift. I'm  beginning a real outward relationship with life again and it feels pretty ok.

Awesome! IWNDWYT. 
Beautifully said...One of my motivations for stopping drinking is that one day I woke up to the fact that I was spending a lot of time thinking about "when can I drink?" when I scheduled activities or thought about doing things.  Drinking such a demanding demon...I will not drink with you today :)
Thank you. Saving
