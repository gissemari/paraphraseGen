With being SO CLOSE to 60 days I wanted to give an update. I have still just been busting my ass to stay busy and to not let the loneliness consume me. This is a complete 180 from what I would normally allow myself to do. ..The cycle would be like this:..My brain: "I am sad because my [enter reason]"..My brain: "Life sucks because[enter reason]"..My brain:"I am the worst human ever because[enter reason]"..Me: Well this fucking sucks. Stop doing all the things...My brain: "Can't."..Me: Well fuck you then. ..My brain: "Yeah so Johnny Walker tonight?"..Me: ...Yeah. *proceed to liquor store and buy a 12 pack for the night and a $50 bottle of liquor*..Life would be okay but then.....*72 hours later* (Spongebob Narrator Voice)..My brain: "Hey so like... we didn't do ANYTHING this weekend we've GOT TO GET OUR SHIT TOGETHER..Me: My head hurts leave me alone..My brain: "But like... ALL THE THINGS"..Me: *proceeds to bar after work doing none of the things*..My brain: "Okay yeah but like eventually....we'll have to do those things"..Me: *Passed out drunk in bed it's now the weekend again and my life is a blur*..**Cut to 60 days in the future**..I now listen to my brain when it tells me things instead of shut down. I listen to my heart too. I listen to the advice people in AA give me I listen to myself when it tells me I need a break or to relax or to eat ice cream(in moderation). I'm writing more I'm reading more I'm exploring more and taking [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/geXpeVR) I'm talking to new people I am getting out of my comfort zone and not feeling so small and insignificant like I used to. I am learning SO MUCH about myself and the world and it's beautiful. ..There are hard moments but instead of isolating I am talking about my struggles. And people aren't angry at me at the end of the night for being a drunken asshole(I never want to be that guy again)...I still miss my ex. I still miss my friends that I had even though I know how superficial their friendship to me was now). I still have moments where I don't feel like I deserve to have a good life a good job love or ambition to do or be better. But instead of staying in those places for days or weeks like I would with alcohol I just let those moments happen and beautifully they stay moments. They don't destroy my tomorrow anymore. ..Just quitting drinking didn't do all this. I have been working so hard at forcing myself to get involved and it's paying off. And working this hard is MUCH EASIER WHILE SOBER. I started with just telling my story on here and asking for help. Reading everyone's stories posting asking for advice it's all helped me get here...I am forever grateful to this community. Thank you for reading...IWNDWYT...
