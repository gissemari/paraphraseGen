One of the big pieces of my journey to sobriety these past 80+ days was learning to speak up for myself and how I felt.  After a recent visit to my parents house this past Thanksgiving I found it much harder to find motivation to do things.  I am not sure what brought it on but I found myself constantly dwelling on how much time I had lost keeping up with them due to my drinking. I would think on constantly about past mistakes I made with my wife and had choices I made as a result of drinking.  I was a smart person but I began to struggle and be overwhelmed with what should be easy decisions about things.  My mind constantly leapt from one idea to another and another.  I was irritated about simple things like plan changes.  I eventually decided to take some time off work and went to see a doctor and got prescribed some anti depressants.  I also plan to begin seeing a therapist.  The sad thing is I think I had been that way for years but just chalked it up to who I was and felt like I needed alcohol to turn it off and deal with it and now I realize I dont...I won't drink with any of you today.  Happy Sunday all.

Good for you...I'm looking at stuff -- feelings relationship issues my own inner assumptions about things -- that were hidden beneath an alcohol haze.  Things aren't perfect often even uncomfortable but I realize I need to learn how to tolerate that discomfort reframe my thinking.  ..And irritation about plan changes!  I don't know why that makes me so crazy but it's something that pushes my buttons.  I'm glad you mentioned that it's a relief to know I'm not the only one...Happily not drinking with you today!.
