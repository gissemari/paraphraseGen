You guys are just great. A pat on the back to everyone for making this community what it is. When I'm struggling (everyday) I have a read and occasionally post there's always someone to distract my mind which is trying to trick me into drinking again. Thank you to each and every one of you. Long stressful day ahead I will not be drinking with you all today though.

Hi.  I won't be drinking with you! 
Congrats on 3 weeks! Thank you for being here.
Congratulations! Keep up the great work. Will be right here not drinking with you. Have a great day :) 
You're doing great c'mon c'mon c'mon! Today I'm not drinking with you :o)
Congratulations on your 3 weeks!  r/sd has been a big part of my recovery. I won't drink with you today. 
Yes this sub is great.  I've learned a lot by reading all of the stories.  No sense reinventing the wheel or having to make all the mistakes myself. I won't drink with you today
Well done!  I'm getting close to there myself.  I'll not drink with you today
