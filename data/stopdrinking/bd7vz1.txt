But did not drink. ..Have read made tea hung out with hubby and snuggled dogs. Have still had cravings. ..Have reminded myself that one of the reasons I am quitting is to be able to read longer books and regain my attention to detail. Didn't stop the cravings. ..Have been checking out this sub and out of all the things I've tried today it has helped the most - but still have had cravings. ..But still: IWNDWYT. As difficult as today is to get through IWNDWYT. ..Perhaps this is silly but I've set a timer on my phone until Game of Thrones starts at 9 - every time I get the urge to go buy a beer I remind myself that it will be better to watch sober ....

Right on. Keep fighting. It sounds like you've got some great things in your toolkit to survive the cravings and you're using them. That's not easy when our nature is to grab a drink. ..The cravings won't always be this bad. I had horrible cravings at first but they became less frequent the longer I've been sober. Every time you beat the cravings you're doing work to take their power away.
Thanks - I've heard of people breaking it down as well. So far (today) it is working !
