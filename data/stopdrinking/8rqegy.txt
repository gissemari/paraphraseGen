Hello SD me again. I'm back for what I hope is the last ever post about a relapse I've relapsed more times than i can count. I've decided to do things a bit differently this time rather than stick to what I normally do at night  (night time  is my biggest trigger) I've decided to take up a hobby for two reasons..1 to alleviate the boredom (boredom is another trigger) and 2 to just simply occupy my mind with something other than thoughts of booze. I've bought some colouring pens and an adult colouring book..I've heard nothing but good things about these and how they can also help with stress...So that's my plans for tonight hot bubble bath some dinner and to start on my book. I'm hoping that this time I can get past my cravings and kick alcohol once and for all...Wish me luck...I will not drink with you today.

Great job having a plan this always helps me. I'm bubble bathing today too maybe watch some cartoons while in the tub. IWNDWYT! PS don't feel bad about the snacks it's really handy to have around in case a craving strikes.
