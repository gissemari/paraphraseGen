Happy to say I made it to the 6-week mark which I haven't done in over 6 years so though it is a turning point in my struggle to be sober and stay sober I haven't eaten more kitkat's Mike and Ikes and all sorts of candy like my 9yr old daughter dreams of doing on Holloween..! It's crazy. I occasionally work out but work hard everday burning calories but I just keep eating and eating and eating fast food cravings &amp; kit Kats... anyone have advice for the sugar cravings..? Though I am psyched I have no cravings for drinking with you today I would meet you for a few double burgers &amp; choc Sunday... :)..

Yeah go keto. Google it for more. This high fat low carb diet takes some time to get used to (maybe a week?) but it has helped loads with my sugar cravings. The fat keeps me satiated and energetic. If you can keep away from the sugar for about a week you will feel like a new person!
I made an effort to change from "industrial sugars" to fresh fruits. More filling more nutrients less calories :-)
Yeah those sugar cravings will kick you right in the tush early on! I like the suggestion u/SaintHomer had about the natural fruit sugars. It helps your craving and you know fruit is healthy...I personally gave into my sugar cravings for a bit while my body stabilized out. It gets better with time.
I started juicing with fruits and vegetables.  It's so good .
You've probably heard this but you're craving sugar to replace the alcohol your body was used to. Alcohol is full of sugar. It's pretty normal and should fade with time. ..I've found fruit to be a great substitute. It has lots of naturally occurring sugars. Grapes melon apples kiwi strawberries.  Make a big fruit salad and snack on it when you get cravings.
