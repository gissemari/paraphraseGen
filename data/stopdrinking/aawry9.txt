I feel like its a milestone. Just this past Friday I had some serious tension and realized I was on the brink that would have been the exact moment I would have taken that first drink...I went to a meeting instead. I realized that although I'm sober now sobriety should still be my first priority and goal. With all this free time I got into fitness and the stock market thinking about taking some more classes to progress my career. But all of that is secondary to staying sober and I still have a LOT to learn..To all of you struggling out there to put the drink down I hope that sharing my experiences can provide some hope. Its still a one day at a time method but the days are becoming blurry now and it feels great! It IS possible to do this and with every downfall is another reason to stand back up again. I hope you all have a great New Years and I will not be drinking with you!

 Nice work on 50 days. That's awesome. Like you my sobriety is an absolute priority. It's still a learning curve staying sober when anxiety and cravings hit. I'm getting there and so are you. Have a great 2019. Let's sober on friend. IWNDWYT    Katherine aka Divvydend  
Well done on 50! ..I will not drink with you today
I think I am day 52 (Nov 8) and I feel the same way as you do.  Sometimes I have to hold the arms of my chair tight so as not to get up to get a drink. So far so good. IWNDWYT
