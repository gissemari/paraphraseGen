I guess I wasn't really sure I'd make it this far again but here we are and hey it feels pretty good. I wake up before my alarm every day my apartment is comparatively tidy I might be imagining it but my face *feels* like it's thinner. If it isn't lie to me. I'm a vain vain boii...I am struggling though to fill the time that available to me now that I'm not logging into a computer game with a box of wine next to me set for the next 5 hours. I've been doing some bedroom exercises but neither the motivation nor the confidence are there to get me **out** and doing fitness stuff. Similarly I marked myself "Interested" in attending a lecture at a local university yesterday but when the time came I didn't go. I just kind of watched Youtube until I fell asleep. I've been sleeping a lot. Whereas I've read in others' accounts that sobriety translated into a newfound energy and ambition this hasn't yet been the case for me. I recognize that this is something that isn't automatic and I need to help myself reap the benefits of sobriety but I'm curious on advice on the baby steps to getting there. I WILL NOW BE ACTIVE just isn't this chunkster's style just yet...Now the other thing and I'm sure I'll be posting about this more... is that I have a trip planned and it's been planned for months (friend's birthday) to Las Vegas this weekend. Laaaaaaaaas Vegas. Lord had I only foreseen a test of this magnitude so soon in my journey. Pray 4 ya boii...More soon. &lt;3...[IWNDWYT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjecYugTbIQ)

&gt; I WILL NOW BE ACTIVE just isn't this chunkster's style just yet...I was hiding out in early sobriety largely because my friends were shitty about me quitting and because I didn't trust myself around them.  But when I quit there was a gaping hole where 'drinking' used to be because it was my only hobby.  I had to fill that hole and I forced myself to do so because it didn't come easy to me.  That was the difference to me between 'not drinking' and 'living sober'.
