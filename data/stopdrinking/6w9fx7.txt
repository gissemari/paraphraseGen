For anyone that is thinking about going to inpatient rehab I just wanted to say it's a strange kinda scary totally worth it experience. I just realized it's been a year since I left my 30 days stint in rehab and it changed my life immeasurably for the better. I had gone for shorter stay kicking and screaming earlier the same year hated it and fought it every step of the way. This lead to a pretty quick relapse. The second time I committed to it because I needed it and never wanted to be in that situation again. I worked my ass off in there and it worked. It's not magic it's just a place to work hard to address issues and work on yourself. It was like hitting a reset switch in my life. I'm so grateful that I did and am so happy with my life now. If you think you might need it do it. I used it as a means to improve myself and to help me save everything in my life I love.
