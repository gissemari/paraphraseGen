After an extremely and I mean EXTREMELY tense and uncomfortable day at Disneyland I am so so proud of myself that I didn't reach for any alcohol to soothe me...Not going to lie - it came into my mind not once but twice - but I remembered my battle was with the first drink.  So I didn't drink it...I had emotional flashbacks to being a child encountering her drunken rages reminded of my early 20s where I was struggling with anorexia that she wouldn't let me have a relationship with my father since I couldn't be the daughter she wanted to now where I'm a horrible person and she wishes she didn't have to deal with me - reason? I told us where to go at the park and tried to make sure people had a good time...But I am thankful today.  Thankful for the resolve to not drink poison.  To not be the Mom I had because that was the path I was on.  I snapped at my 5 year old I'd be irritable until I had a drink I'd be drunk and ignoring her as I zoned out...Today I am facing the toughest battle - not to have that first drink.  I will overcome it...Thank you all for listening and responding.  It's hard to battle your mind alone sometimes and sharing and interacting helps me stay strong.

Sorry.  Nothing like a bad memory to kill a good experience.  I think it's great that you're trying to use past experiences to better yourself.  Great job on not reaching for that drink and I won't drink with you today!
We are all proud that you didn't reach for that drink as well!  Congratulations!  Memories can be very hard to deal with.  Just do something to make a new memory with your 5 year old that is awsome positive and will make you smile.   I will not drink with you today!
Little ones prefer us sober. They prefer us with our feeling full on. you got this.
