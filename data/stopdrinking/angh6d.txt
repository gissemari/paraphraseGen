Last week was my first week of attempting sobriety. I've struggled. I have been far from perfect. But I'm trying very hard to discard the black and white thinking that has contributed to my addiction shame and cycle of self-harm...For the first time in years I didn't use substances daily. In fact I had four sober days. When I did drink or use weed I wrote about how I felt. I noticed my body pain mood tiredness hangover levels mental health changes over time etc.  I especially noticed my triggers (social anxiety being the number one thing for me. Boredom being second). ..I reset my counter on my app this morning and my goal this week is to not drink or use substances at all. I'm going to take it day by day. Moment by moment if I need to. ..I greatly appreciate this subreddit. I log on to look a couple times a day read your stories celebrate with you empathize with your struggles. I'm looking forward to reporting back that my week was successfully substance-free.
