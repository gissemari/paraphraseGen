I just wanted to share my excitement at breaking my previous streak of 139 days which I set a few years ago in my first attempt to control my drinking. I relapsed but decided to give it another go and I'm proud to report that life is objectively better without booze and that I'm getting better at planning ahead and playing the tape forward. It doesn't hurt that I'm getting a bit older and have stopped agonizing over what other people think as much. At the end of the day I'm the one that has to sleep in my skin. ..As we approach Thanksgiving I'll say I'm thankful for this sub it has been a critical piece of my journey and I appreciate all the positivity and support. ..If you're just starting out or trying again please keep at it. It can be done and it has been worth it.
