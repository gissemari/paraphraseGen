Hey guys..So I just stopped drinking a few days ago. I'd started taking kratom for back pain saw that a lot of people used it to quit drinking/using opiates. So figured that if I was taking this herb anyway I might as well try out if I could stop drinking while on it...Wow...I'm so impressed with myself...but at the same time struggling. On the one hand I've managed to go to A BAR and also to a weekly cards night with friends without drinking anything. (Wow. Like really. Wow.)..On the other hand it's hard dealing with my feelings every night rather than being able to  turn it off  with a glass (our three) of wine...Like a lot of people here I was a nightly drinker. 2-3 glasses of wine every night. Sometimes more. Always had to drink when socialising in the evening. REALLY had to have that last drink alone before bed...I dont know what the future holds. ..My mom is an alcoholic now. Her mom was too. Part of me is worried about getting  hooked  on kratom. However I KNOW where alcohol leads. ..I know it because I've watched it cripple the women I've been closest to...I dont know where kratom will lead but it's got to be a better place. At least it will be a place that's DIFFERENT from being alone in pain and angry all the time. ..Anyway looking for support. Encouragement. Because this isnt exactly the type of thing you can talk about with friends...As for my family...when I visit them I may have to buy some alcohol-free wine so I can  pretend  to drink. I'm pretty sure they'll take my lack of drinking as a personal attack. (At least my mom will.)..Ugh. Intergenerational addiction is a bitch...Anyway thanks for being here. ..&lt;3.
