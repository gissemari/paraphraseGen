28 days sober today and i couldn't be more grateful. I almost didn't make it through my last relapse. I took a really bad fall that lead to bleeding in my brain and a subsequent 4 day stint in the intensive care unit. Luckily I made it out with no obvious lasting effects. Long ago alcohol stopped doing things for me and started doing things to me. I will not let that happen again.  Just for today i will not drink or use any other mind altering substance.
