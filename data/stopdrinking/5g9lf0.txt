So I have been sober for 5 months and then I relapsed for a week. The new plan is that my last drink was yesterday. I need to stop again drinking makes me sick and I know pretty well that moderation is a unrealistic sooner or later I would get horribly drunk and do something stupid get sick loose all money fuck up my work feel like shit... You know. ..But I wanted to discuss something else. I don't know if anyone else feels that way but my drinking is strangely fueled by my libido. I am in late 30thies happily married to a beautiful wife with lot of sex all things considered. But sometimes when I am watching a movie at night where a beautiful women lits a cigarette and downs a shot I can feel how the devil himself just sat on my shoulder. And he whispers into my ear: Remember all the fun you used to have? All the bars? All the lovers? Dirty dancing sweet flirting? If you go and open a beer you will be young again hell you are young! Do you see all the girls on the street on Friday night going to the clubs? Drink drink and you will have fun again they will laugh at your jokes they will smile for you oh they are so beautiful that it hurts to look! Drink and you will be alive again! Good old times merry memories girls at the dorms beautiful bodies and incredible stories freedom! Anything can happen everything will happen tonight but you have to drink because alcohol is a fountain of youth and you are missing on the life if you don't drink! ..Obviously it is all fucking illusion - drink and you will be just another miserable patron in a bar full of sad man staring at them girls. The funny thing is that I actually never cheated on my wife except in my head :D it is all just a very powerful illusion. This is a different phase of life now and alcohol will never bring back (I don't want to!) the merry old times that were actually not that merry at all :D. Does anyone feel something similar?

Absolutely as a 39 yr old married guy I get those same illusions. While drinking they are exponentially more potent though which can lead to bad decisions. I too have never cheated but that devil does whisper in your ear and alcohol only makes his voice louder.
