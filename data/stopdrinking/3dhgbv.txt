17 days sober cold turkey. I was drinking 6 - 10 units a day for almost a year. Fortunately I'm in my early 20's so stopping wasn't a problem. I've tried to stop a few times before with AA and therapy but I could not make it past a week...I can't sleep right now and I want a drink so badly. Almost went out to buy some but instead I blindly tossed my ID into my boyfriend's car. But even without my ID I know there's always a way to get a fix. ..Almost crying because the craving is so strong and I just feel alone. Just want to chat with somebody. Not on the AA hotline though..

Need to chat? There are other SD folks here right now:..https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/..I'm glad you're making efforts to stay sober. It's a good sign. It shows that you want sobriety. I wish I had quit at your age. It's only become harder over time. Make it stick.
I just want to say congratulations on the 17 days. I am right there with you and I am not drinking today. 
If we don't feed them cravings are short-term emotions. They will fade with time. You just have to find some ways to cope with those feelings for now...Early on substituting sodas for beer helped me. That satisfied my urge for a cold fizzy drink. I also cleaned A LOT. It was a task I could do for 5 minutes at a time any time and kept my hands busy.
Update: thanks for all the encouraging PMs! I didn't give in that night. Going on 19 days now :)
