The weekends are always the hardest for me. Can you guys share what's helped you make it through a weekend what maybe made you relapse or maybe just a happy story about a puppy.

I find that going to bed sober on a Sunday night is the greatest feeling ever.  The sleep is so relaxed thinking about what you did over the weekend not waking up with your heart racing at 3am or feeling wasted as you get ready for work wondering if you should burn a vacation day and stay home...I also find that Fridays are fine after the first hour or so and Saturdays are better if you keep busy.
Gotta have a game plan for the weekend; and yes you can game plan in some down time as well. Tonight I will be doing a fitness bootcamp at my local park. Tomorrow I have a birthday party for one of my daughter's friends at an ice-skating rink. Go go go. Sunday is my day of relaxation. I have some books downloaded and ready to read by the pool and the fridge stocked with snacks and Frescas. I've blown off a happy hour invite and a beach day invite that will include lots of alcohol. Not my thing. Pick and choose how to spend your time that is true to your values and you will find the weekend to be a very enjoyable relaxing and rejuvenating break from the work week. Hope its a good one!
I've made it through three weekends so far by making plans to do fun things that don't involve alcohol. Hiking. Watching Netflix with my husband and enjoying the time with him. Going to the movies with my daughter. If I keep myself busy I don't have the chance to get squirrely and pace around the house itching to go out and drink.
