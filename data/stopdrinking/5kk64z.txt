This is a really long post so I don't expect many to read it but going into a new year I think it is important to summarise the key points of 2016 in writing so I don't forget....So 2016 was the year I decided to quit - 100% determined to do so and I would accept no failure! Alcohol had controlled the last few years of my life at this point and I was close to rock bottom unless I did something drastic. I was drinking at least 8 500ml beers a night and I worked from home in a dead end job had gained a tonne of weight lost all my friends and could see my end. It has not quite worked out how I wanted but compared to 2015 has been a hell of a lot better....January 01- Started with a clean flat binned all traces of alcohol filled up my fridge and cupboards with healthy non junk food and went for it. My plan was to exercise eat healthy and focus on my wellbeing - if I crave a healthy body there is no way I can drink after all! I downloaded My fitness Pal and signed up to fitness forums for tips. I also entered a tennis tournament (handicapped based on ability) which took place throughout January to ensure I had a good short term incentive to stay clean....The first day was easy due to my enthusiasm for change; the next 2 weeks were very difficult but by week 3 I could honestly say I didn't crave alcohol. I had to changes my plan a bit; I was less strict on the healthy eating and added in a good amount of chocolate in the evening to satisfy cravings which certainly helped. I was overworking myself in the gym so started going to the driving range some evenings as well to ensure I always had something to do and left gym/gold as late as possible to ensure as little time alone as possible. I also began reading to take away from the fact I was going to bed sober. This was difficult to begin as I could barely focus on a book and had issues remembering plot lines but by week 3 I was reading a couple hours a night and thoroughly enjoying it. ...28 days   the tennis final. Somehow I had managed 4 weeks not a drop of alcohol I had lost weight eaten healthily and my fitness had improved tenfold in such a short space of time. Against the odds I actually won this final and felt great. The trophy in my hands was a physical symbol of my success against alcohol and nothing would knock me down. But then I was offered a drink. I did not want a drink the thought of the drink repulsed me even the first couple of sips were rancid and I couldn't believe I used to drink so much of the stuff. Not sure why I accepted but I thought it would be nice to try casual drinking again. I had one pint then another then I bought more on the way home then I went out again to buy more. Then the next day I felt like shit so repeated the cycle....So I failed I only managed 28 days and was right back to square one but I had learned that it was possible. My health was better just from that one month and I knew now that I had more control than I thought I had previously. It should have been so easy to just get my act together from that day and start over but for some reason I couldn't. I drank most of February but had another shot in March to much the same success I think this time I managed a full 30 days before I had a similar misjudgement and was offered a drink and thought to myself  this time will be different  well it wasn't! ...Since then I have tried again and again and failed every time but during the course of this year and my constant restarts I have ended up drinking a lot less than last year from March to August I had bad luck I would quit for a week or two relapse for a month the same story every single time I thought of all this time as serious failures but looking back now I am happy for those weeks in between and I have managed to build myself up through these periods....In September I was sober enough to start applying for jobs! I thought this would be a turning point and everything would change but it didn't. I was nervous so I drank heavily the night before my first interview I turned up so hungover I could not read the newspaper and almost had a panic attack but luckily I had the knowledge they needed and managed to bullshit my way through the interview (I'm good at that) and they offered me a second interview in a weeks' time. Perfect I'll stay sober for the next week and ace it  or not. Again I drank the night before and turned up hungover   less so this time though. Due to my knowledge and enthusiasm I managed to get the job despite this! The fact I was hungover definitely impaired me and I would have been 100% better if I had stayed sober but the fact I know my job inside out saved my arse so it was clear I had what they needed. I definitely think if I had been on the top of my game I would have been able to ask for more money though....Since starting this new job I am now based in an office so my drinking quickly became a real issue. I would be in important meetings feeling and looking like shit just about able to stay awake and the days became absolutely nerve racking as I was sure people were on to me   how could they not be? I would finish the day and be an absolute wreck so I would drink. Heavily. I was back to 8 a night and slipping again. My gaps became non-existent I gained back all the weight I lost and functioning was a real issue again I was certain I was near my end. From September to early November I went through this pattern. I have no idea how I didn't get fired but instead my boss was lavishing praise on me and I was actually acing the job I was a fucking mess and no doubt people know this but the results were undeniably there and that's all they care about. I felt like a fraud thought I was performing at 10% and getting away with it. ...Mid November I managed to single headedly find a massive saving to the company that even got the attention of the CEO who personally thanked me for my hard work. So all this time I am coming into work still drunk worrying my arse off beating myself up and self-inflicting more stress than I have ever experienced in my life wandering when I will get fired  and I am still getting praised heavily? What the fuck am I doing to myself?! ...That realisation was a major turning point it made me realise the catch 22 situation I was in. I drank when I was stressed I was stressed because I was hungover and unhealthy and therefore I drank. Since then I have not stayed sober but I consistently manage to stay sober Saturday to Wednesday and drink between 4-5 beers the rest of the week. It has been easier to say no to drinks and I am dealing with things much more healthily. My worries are shrinking and confidence is now much better than this time last year. I feel stronger and more able to cope with life in general. ...It is easy to look back at my year as a failure to get sober there were indeed many nights where I lost control and promised myself this would be the last time. There were many failures and I failed to make the most of my potential. I caused myself so much stress and anxiety I am surprised I was able to leave the house some days. But it is important to look at the successes; all in all I went from drinking almost 365 days last year to probably drinking less than 200 this year. I won my first tournament I got a new job and through trial and error I am much more able to identify my weaknesses and strengths. ...I am certainly going to try again for 2017 and I think I am going to do it this time. It is unfair on myself to settle for anything less than my best and if I have achieved so much under the influence I am excited to see what can be achieved by a sober me!.

That is a wonderful year-in-the-life saga.  Whilst my memory of the details from my 2016 aren't as sharp my experience in this dreadful year mirror your own.  I drank less than the year before and yet was made even more painfully aware of the impact and consequences that drinking brought me.  One of my takeaways from my experience (and your post) is that there will be times where we think we've got this that somehow we've conquered the mountain and entitled to a little indulgence.  Hah!  The universe laughs at my naivet .  Perhaps the moral of the story is that if we're self-aware and learn from our falls we just may be able to walk the proverbial straight line...Thanks for the post.  I appreciated every word of it.
It sounds to me like each time you're learning something.  I think that's great.  Congratulations on a week.
