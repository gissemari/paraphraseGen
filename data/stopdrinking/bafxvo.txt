Congrat on 110 days!! That is awesome! Happy for you! I have been to New Orleans and it for sure is all about drinking but that does not mean you can not go and have a great time! You by now have developed the tools to get thru tempting situations so I know you can do it! I was barely drinking when I went and I had an awesome time! You do not have to drink to have fun as we know! I have faith in you! Have a blast! IWNDWYT
Hang in there!  Have you met with a psych dr. ?
You got this! The first vacation can be unnerving just don't over think it! My 1st vacation I was so worried cause I went away with a group of friends and family that were all drinkers. Waking up sober each morning feeling great made it all worth while! Especially knowing they couldn't get out of bed to enjoy the resort. Enjoy and stay strong!
