I just need to talk about this. When I was 18 I quit rx amphetamines and drinking cold-turkey (talk about some shitty withdrawals!). But when I was on the cusp of 20 I started drinking again. My sobriety had only made it about 18 months. My relapse was about 10 months long. I thought I would feel way more confident in my pledge to myself after I kept sober for longer than my relapse. But now I understand sobriety isn't a mathematical equation. It's not a penance that has to be performed for a certain amount of time and then after you've said your hail-marys and our-fathers you feel better and are freed. Internalizing that is rough. I still want a drink. I want to imagine a future where seeing my roommate's kitchen bar doesn't make my skin crawl and make me ache. Now that I know all this  I don't know what or how to think. I have a therapist a shrink a counselor a support network a community. But I still feel like I'll find a way to fuck up and have to start this painful process all over again.

Relapses aren't inevitable.    .    ..I had to change my mindset towards alcohol. Instead of thinking I was depriving myself of something (a drink) I realized I was *giving* myself a better life. In sobriety we have transcended the need for alcohol. We don't *have* to drink an addictive deadly poison to enjoy our lives. My brain chemistry is so much better off. A relapse would just reset everything back to Day 1. I don't know about you but I enjoy my freedom. I am a  former hostage that has escaped my captor and has seen the light of day. No way am I going back.    .Would your roommate be willing to lock up the wet bar?
