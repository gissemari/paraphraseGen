I don't want to keep doing this.  I don't even know what to say anymore.   I don't think I'm ever going to move forward.  My boyfriend had been in his own rut and he was frustrated and had been hanging out with me more.  I thought things were getting better and then I went and drank.  I'm no support for him or anyone and I'm afraid I'm never going to get this and I'm just going to watch myself throw everything away.  I don't know what else to do...why can't I stop?

I couldn't stop because I am alcoholic. I couldn't stop on my own either. AA meetings weren't enough. I was so entrenched in my addiction I needed constant supervision and daily help. I needed rehab.
This is really a decision you will make now or later.  It may take something serious.  It took a dwi for me.  For some people it takes multiple dwi's losing a job a home a marriage kids AND jail.  Some people just die.  This is up to you.  No one can make you stop except yourself.  
Alcoholism is a disease.  So first give yourself a break.  You are a human being. Beating the crap out of yourself for drinking is going to make you feel bad...and so you will drink again to not feel bad and the cycle continues.  You drank so what start over.  Are you judging yourself?  Why?  Be nice to you.  Self-abuse is very common in alcoholics and keeps a lot of people from getting help.  You are not the first one to stay sober for awhile and then drink again you won't be the last.  So if you want to stay sober then do what your counselors are telling you ask for help from others with more sobriety and let go of your ego as much as you can.  Your ego wants to kill you at least mine does.  Best of luck we will be here.
When I was in a similar headspace someone said.....&gt;* When it becomes more difficult to suffer than to change you will change...I finally reached that place. Hope you do as well. 
If re-hab is an option I'd recommend that. You need a good stretch of sobriety then you'll want to transition to AA. Don't beat yourself up too much. You'll be ok. :)
Never give up.
Alcoholism is a disease that strikes every age race economic/education level and gender. No one starts drinking expecting to slide into addiction. It happens like a thief in the night. ..AA is a place where this is apparent. By using only first names everyone is on equal footing. We don't identify what we do or how many possessions we've acquired.  The disease of alcoholism has spared no one. We come together to learn from people who have found satisfying sober lives. ..The most important relationship is the one you have with yourself. You will not have a satisfying relationship with a boyfriend until you have solid recovery time and figure out who you are and what you want out of life. The two of you need to work on your individual "ruts" individually. Let go of boyfriend issues for awhile. ..My relationship with alcohol was like a love affair gone bad. Ending it was necessary but not easy. I felt angry sad confused and scared. Normal emotions. Accepting the disease was the same process. ..Focus on getting better. Go to outpatient.  ..Go to AA. Look for recovering women who have something you want. It is here where you'll find **hope**. ..You are asking for help with your post. That's a good sign. **Step out of your comfort zone** so instead of this.....&gt;* I'm just going to watch myself throw everything away.. .**You'll watch yourself get better!**......
