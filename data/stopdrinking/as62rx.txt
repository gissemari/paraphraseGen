I'm coming up on two weeks. The first week was pretty much a breeze but I've found the second week to be a lot harder. My social anxiety is really really bad. I'm hyper aware of everyone. I've been working out though which has helped and school is a good distraction but holy shit I pretty much just feel anxiety when I look at anyone. Just asking a guy for the time today had me acting weird. I've had social anxiety my whole life but this is definitely worse than usual. Hypervigilance over thinking negative thinking terrible confidence. ..I'm also grinding my teeth a lot...People who deal with social anxiety is this normal? What was your experience like quitting? Any tips? ..I'm not going to drink. I'm committed to healing my brain. But damn. ..&amp;#x200B;

You sound like me. I have an alcoholic mother who would go into our unfinished basement and live down there on months-long benders. No kitchen or fridge down there no bathroom so I knew she had to come upstairs but I would go literally months without seeing her. My dad cut her off financially and she became a prostitute for money for vodka. Or just the drinks I don't know. I do know I put that together when I was 12 or 13 years old. How horrifying for a child to know that. She tried AA at one point. Her sponsor was my friend and classmate's mother. My mom ended up having an affair with her sponsor's husband. She was so far down digging her own fucking grave I couldn't even see her anymore. To be honest I have no idea how she is still alive. And the kicker is: she doesn't know that I know any of this. I've never told her I know and she would just deny it anyway. .For a long time I abhorred alcohol for the above reasons. Then when I got older it was just so socially acceptable and I thought after my childhood I would never end up with a drinking problem. Wrong. I have insane anxiety social and general and I started numbing it with alcohol. I eventually decided the price was too high to join my mother in the grave-digging. A weird sequence of events led me to get sober but they all centered around me not wanting to throw my life away. I've watched it happen in real time to my mother for as long as I've been alive. I truly and honestly feel your pain. Know that there is light on the other side. The sober path is not without its struggles but it beats losing everything. You are still here and for as long as you're still here there is hope. I find this subreddit incredibly cathartic and inspiring. We are all in it together. You CAN do this and break the cycle. 
Yeah me too with the social anxiety. I have a hard time with eye contact when passing people in halls and it did peak in the 2nd week for me too. It's like the blur tool is gone and all of the edges of social interaction feel pointy and sharp and I keep slamming into them. But the reality is the edges were always there and I was just ignoring them so I could get by. I don't have any solutions but I relate and understand! I think if I find some sober groups near me there will be more people who kind of get where I am emotionally and I won't feel like an alien around them.
