Happy Thursday sobernauts!..Thankful Thursdays is a weekly thread here where we can focus and reflect on what we are thankful for. I'll include something on thankfulness and invite you to take a moment to reflect on what you are grateful for today...I've read a bunch of posts this week that reminded me of what things were like before I stopped drinking and how sucky the withdrawals were and I am thankful for being reminded of the struggle. I am grateful for going through withdrawals and cravings as much as they sucked at the time because that sealed in my mind that I couldn't deny my problem any more. I remember what a sweaty person I used to be how I battled daily against rancid BO with extra strength deodorant bringing spare changes of clothes. Now I don't stink I don't sweat unless it's genuinely hot or I'm working out hard - I am still surprised by this and so grateful for this and every other change that's come as a result of my sobriety. I am thankful for today for being free of the chains of alcohol for the opportunity to face any challenges with presence. I am thankful that I hung on long enough when I stopped drinking to adjust to being sober and to come to realise and truly appreciate the gifts and freedoms in sobriety. ..**Thankful quote**..>[*Take pride in how far you've come.

I am thankful that I haven't relapsed yet. 
I am thankful every day that I wake up without a hangover guilt and self-loathing. Also so thankful to have the support of everyone here.
I am thankful for the sharing on SD and the responses I get when I share. It really has made all the difference these last couple weeks. I plan to check in everyday - as long as my internet is working! I am thankful for early mornings waking up at sunrise and feeling good about myself again. I am thankful for authors who have written helpful and empowering chapters on alcohol addiction. I am thankful for the last day that I drank and being honest with myself about the reality and senselessness of it and how my drinking was undercutting my self-worth my health and my relationships. I am thankful for this body that still wants badly to heal and be mighty and this life that still wants badly to be fully lived. 
I am thankful for the spirited way that my son teaches me each day that learning is filled with road bumps. He's so hard on himself and through having him understand self-compassion I manifest it a bit more in my own life.
I'm thankful for making it two years without a drink or mind altering substance. ..I'm also extremely thankful for having my current set of problems and stresses instead of the ones I had two years ago. Work has been a pain in the ass lately and my wife and I just got a new puppy (she's cute but puppies are way more stressful than I expected) but these are nothing like what I was dealing with back when I was drinking. I'm also thankful as always for r/SD and AA. The day I started to make progress in my life was the day I realized I couldn't do it alone.
I am so thankful that I've had the chance to spend two very full weeks with my young niece and nephew. I couldn't have kept up with them and been fully present if I had still been drinking. They are fantastic kids and we had a great time doing all the fun touristy stuff as well as games crafts and movies. I am so blessed to be given this opportunity to be part of their lives. They leave today and I'm gonna be a mess. I think I'll spend some time this afternoon planning their next summer visit! Thanks SD for being here for me during their visit. Full days got me tired and longing for evening "relaxers." Reading and posting here was all that kept me from relapsing.
I'm thankful for finally starting to learn what it truly means to stop and smell the roses. I've been so caught up with daily life worried about finding a new job taking care of my Mom. I did something stupid and isolated myself in my bedroom for a few days but I pulled myself out of it and have spent the past 2 days reading Blackout and The Naked Mind. Laugh?! Yes it's actually refreshing in a crazy sort of way to see what Sarah Hepola offers as "remembering the things I drank to forget". But in all seriousness I've been reading the books on my patio soaking up the sun (I haven't done this in more than a decade as I could never face the sun drunk or in blackout) and smelling the beautiful scent of flowers from the garden I work hard at every day. May sound corny but I am nurturing and growing these plants similar to the way I am now nurturing and growing myself personally. Everything will work out; I'm sober and grateful and I have faith. Finally. Thank you dear SDers for always coming to my rescue when I need you most :)..Oh and u/finally_woken I can appreciate the sweat talk lol! Thought I was the sweatiest of us all! Especially the feet yuk!! I'd buy industrial sized deodorants carry foot wipes and sprays in my purse baby powder in my shoes you name it. I proudly affirm that I do not sweat anymore unless it's unbearably hot and humid or if I'm doing a tough workout. So I guess we smell pretty darn good these days lol ;) Thanks for hosting.
I am thankful that my son is alive during the tying times but am scared of raising him in an environment where cops seemingly don't value black lives. What happened yesterday is weighing heavily on me.
I am thankful my husband quit with me. His friends and family are giving him a hard time about It they just don't understand. Without his support I could not have quit while watching him continue to drink alcoholicly.
I am thankful for my wonderful kind intelligent coworkers who make my work  life about a thousand times better than it is with the other type.
I am thankful for remembering the end of every night. 
There will always be struggles in anyone's life. Being sober through those struggles is something I'm profoundly grateful for. 
As always I am thankful for SD. I'm beating all this... and it's from you guys. I am thankful to be learning how to kill this beast. Like every scary movie the antagonist may come back for one more scare (or many) but I'm going to keep fighting! 
I'm thankful for this weird righteous-feeling anger that has been with me for the past few days. I usually have a very very hard time dealing with anger but this time it's different. It's energizing and motivating. It's making me want to do everything in my power to get better and *be* better...I'm thankful for all the support I get from SD from the CRD and from a few of my coworkers.
I am thankful for each morning and the first breath of fresh outdoor air that I take. I am thankful to be able to see the sunrise without suffering from a dull headache and bloodshot eyes. I am thankful to be able to experience the beauty of this world not through a thick haze but through clear and sober eyes.
I am thankful for my SO who gives me his full support for my friend who told me Saturday night that she was proud of me and for this community for helping me stay sober! 
I am thankful for the mods of this sub who do more work and put up with more bullshit than most of us will ever know. [(   ) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nd5BATyXEg)
I am thankful to be here right now and that I didn't have to lose everything before I got here.
Today I am thankful for feelings. I was listening to HOME podcast (awesome podcast btw) last night and the guest was discussing how growing up she didn't allow herself to feel anything other than "not bad""neutral" or "okay". ..That got me thinking about how I've always considered it a point of pride that I never "get angry" - but maybe this isn't actually a good thing like I've always thought! I think back to when I got in a fight with my boyfriend last week and I was suddenly SO MAD. I surprised myself with the intensity of the feeling but that's all it was - a pure totally normal feeling that I for once wasn't shoving down into the depths of me. I already knew that I suppress my emotions but I think I have even more work to do than I realized. Sobriety is allowing me to work past the haze of alcohol that covered all my feelings and dig more deeply into these thoughts and tangle feelings and I'm grateful for that.
Today I'm thankful for the warm sun on my face talking to my neighbor and just feeling good about life again. Thanks guys!
I'm thankful for my wife discovering my most recent relapse. Yes the current state of my life sucks. And if I had been able to hide everything better the immediate time would be much better probably seemingly awesome...But being forced to be accountable had really made me try to identify concrete steps I need to take...Go to my first SMART meeting Saturday.  It's a start. 
I am so thankful for SD for the support and daily reminders of why I don't drink anymore.  I am grateful for jagged mountains waterfalls and blue lakes.  I am grateful for the ability to travel and get spiritual nourishment from nature. I am grateful that my frustrations and obstacles seem so much more manageable than they did when I drank.
I am thankful that I have over 40 days of sobriety something that 45 days ago seemed impossible. I am thankful for my girlfriend and our new adventures that are beginning in a different place. I am thankful for AA because I know that even though I am moving across the country I will be able to find like minded people...I am thankful for the resilience of my father and my grandparents who have passed away but instilled in me the discipline and strength to take on this task. I am thankful for SD while I haven't posted too much since my sobriety began I have lurked. ..I am thankful for the gym without the opportunity to push some weights around when I need to i would not be sober today...I am thankful to God as I mend my relationship with him and allow him to help me. I am thankful that I now can better recognize his guidance...Edit: I am thankful for my first ever drinking dream last night! I woke up from it in such a panic and it helped me on my goal to remind me what I will feel like if I decide to take a drink.
I am thankful for this sentence:  "I am grateful for going through withdrawals and cravings as much as they sucked at the time because that sealed in my mind that I couldn't deny my problem any more."..Still in the "this part sucks" phase but I am hopeful for the future.
Today I'm thankful that I *can* be thankful. Pedantic I know but there were times when I most definitely wasn't.
I'm thankful that I don't have panic attacks at 3am anymore. one's body needs sleep to thrive - that's when it grows tissues repairs cells releases hormones consolidates memories all the things that make it possible to wake up fresh and healthy. I was interrupting that cycle *every damn night* with a traumatic attack on the mind and body. these days I'm able to fully rest and repair. I never ever want to go back to those miserable nights.  
Thankful my cat is doing much better. He almost died and we spent close to 4k to get him better....Before: http://imgur.com/e18yfT0..After: http://imgur.com/PQG6GiV 
Today I'm thankful things get easier over time and before you know it not thinking about booze becomes the new normal. I've even stopped wondering what pubs look like inside as I drive past ones I've never seen before.....I'm also thankful my work puts me in contact with some inspirational young people. Today's was a 14 year old who is one of the country's best swimmers in her event. In order to be that good she gets up at 3am every day. Gets to the pool for 3.30 stays til 7am. Goes to school then goes back to the pool for 5pm stays til 10pm. Six days a week...
...wow i am inspired by all of my fellow SDers of whom i am so thankful for: their support encouragement wisdom and various perspectives that help me on the journey to sobriety. ..i am thankful for being clear-headed right now and for my teenaged sons. i am thankful that i am alive.
I am thankful for my support team and the whole unexpected get healthy approach on this endeavor. I was good and ready for more penance and the response from my team was "Haven't you had enough? How about we work to make things easier on yourself instead". ..If I am not 100% successful on this attempt I have turned my path to the right direction and have learned things that no one can take away from me. For all of that and more I am thankful.
I'm thankful that I've decided to get help for my depression.   I'm thankful that I've stopped self medicating with alcohol and illegal drugs

I'm thankful that I made it through the toughest part of my week with no drinking! I took up exercising and spending time with friends to pass the time and feel great. I'm also grateful to the caring people of this sub to provide insight support and feedback. 
I'm thankful for taking this wonderful vacation with my family.  We haven't done a vacation in years ("vacations" for the past many years were either to be with my elderly parents or for their deaths or on trips to see our boy play baseball).  Traveling with our son now and doing adult things is really being a blast.  We are being such incredible tourists but pretty much going with the flow and doing what we want with no agenda (that's also very unusual for me).  Finding our way around Boston enjoying the history and culture etc.  I am thankful as well that I do not drink because I was so highly aware today of how many "opportunities" there are here to do that and I would have availed myself of many of them before.
I'm really sick of resetting my badge but I'm still thankful that overall this year has been the least amount of alcohol I've consumed in years. I'm thankful that I'm getting back up and trying again instead of giving up. 
I have so much to be thankful for today. Firstly I'm sober and on my longest consecutive sober streak. I'm blessed to still have both parents alive and well. I'm also extremely grateful for the excellent medical care that I receive I can't say enough for this one. I have a whole host of medical issues but everything is going better than I could have ever imagined. I'm so thankful for SD for me it has been my lifeline to long-term sobriety. I guess I'm just happy now and I finally know how to stay that way. Thank you all for keeping me sober I couldn't have done it without you. Peace and good vibes.
