I have relapsed a lot (obviously I'm on day 1 today) and I have depression that is pretty medicine-resistant. The medicine works to some extent but I am not fully functional. Specifically I lack the emotional energy to go to a meeting after work. I hold myself together pretty tightly at work and I have no energy left over to go to a meeting. ..I am at my wit's end. For those of you who are dual-diagnosis what tips and tricks can you help me with? Am I just full of shit? I am so frustrated. I want to be sober. I want a life beyond my wildest dreams. Working an AA program is important to me but my depression sucks.

It's definitely a vicious circle. I can say for sure that my mental health improved once I quit. I thought I was self-medicating with my drinking but it turns out I was only making things worse...I don't know you personally so I can't say what will work for you. What did work for me was replacing drinking with positive activities. Walking/jogging were huge as was meditating journaling and playing guitar. These are all activities that help with alcohol withdrawal and are also good for one's mental health...I hope you are able to find something that works for you!
Therapy is making the difference for me. And I'm to the point where I love AA meetings after work so I go even if I'm lacking motivation or energy because of depression. I know that I never regret going and I don't have to be "on" and be a social butterfly I can just sit and listen if I want to. 
I too have depression. Medicine isn't effective when combined with alcohol. Therapy and meetings worked for me. I wanted to be sober and have had a sober happy life for many years...&gt; If we want what we've never had;.&gt; .&gt; We have to do what we've never done. 
Exercise helps me tremendously.  It calms me down for hours afterwords probably due to the endorphins generated.  Listening to music usually lifts my mood too if it's the right stuff.  Ray Lynch's "Deep Breakfast" is best!  Good luck to you.
I have bipolar disorder was diagnosed when i was 14 lived a lot of my life debilitated by self medicating. Eventually tried antidepressants which made me manic for the first time (and last) and that's about the time i developed a crazy alcohol dependence. Anyway i was a mess for a long time. Very long story short years go by and i decide to try sobriety out of desperation and it's then that i realized my medication worked when i wasn't drinking...i don't think that ever even occurred to my addled mind. It took me until the age of 32 or 33 to realize that I can actually live a life with some sense of quality and not constant agony and suicide attempts. You need to be honest with your doctor with how much you drink...i just automatically lied to people even those trying to help me. If depression and mood disorders are a fire alcohol is the accelerant to burn you up into nothing. Your meds will not work properly when you are drinking...i thought that was always just some lame buzz-kill medical disclaimer...nope. I couldn't begin to *really* work on my problems until i was in a position to be receptive enough physically emotionally and mentally to real growth and recovery. 
For me anxiety depression and drinking were inter-related in a complicated way.  When all three were active it was impossible to separate cause from effect.  With the perspective of hindsight I now believe my drinking prevented my depression medications from working properly or effectively.  Before medication my drinking caused (or at least aggravated) my anxiety and depression.  I may have possessed some natural anxiety and depression before my first drink...These three were locked in a self destructive and seductive dance in a vicious cycle.  Drinking made me feel better temporarily but caused major anxiety and depression afterwards that drinking again would alleviate.  Essentially the cause of the problem was masquerading as the solution.  When I started Lexapro while drinking it provided no relief because alcohol prevented it from working...To sort through this I had to stop drinking first to break the vicious cycle.  After six months sober my Doc *carefully* weaned me off the anti-depressant.  Most of my depression cleared but I still suffered from anxiety.  Then I had to stop smoking stop coffee start eating hydrating and sleeping well and start meditating and exercising.  Finally the anxiety subsided although I still suffer bouts when life stressors intrude.  I had a Doc involved closely the whole time.  I hope my experience is helpful in some way.
I was diagnosed with depression was prescribed medication and continued to drink out of control on the med's. The depression got even worse. Then I decided to stop drinking; the result? My med's now work beautifully and the depression has decreased significantly...Congrats on day 1! Glad you're here with us...*Edit: I've also engaged in therapy and maintain continuous contact and follow up with my health care providers.
I definitely have the same issue. It's hard for me to go resulting in missed opportunities to heal. 
I too self-medicated for years while taking anti-depressants. Even after being diagnosed with major depressive disorder I hid the true nature of my drinking from my doctor so any medication prescribed was completely ineffective...And it never occurred to me that maybe the alcohol had something to do with the medication not working for me. I just assumed I was a hopeless depressive and that alcohol was helping me "cope". After stringing some sober days together forcing myself to attend meetings reading etc. the anti-depressants actually began to help me level out quite a bit. I was surprised and finally saw some light at the end of my previously bleak tunnel. I still get depressive days but it is much more manageable without the alcohol.

First of all. I feel you. You're not the only one in this situation....My psychiatrist told me flat out: "If you're drinking these meds are almost worthless." Ethanol is a central nervous system depressant. It **causes** depression both in the short term of being sleepy and in the medium term of screwing up your brain chemistry....I didn't listen for many years. I considered that my depression caused my drinking but I never considered the reverse. I quit a few times but not long enough to return to any baseline. This time I am more than three weeks in and I noticed a **real** difference after 2 weeks. I don't know what % is due to better sleep or more exercise or no booze or better diet or the meds working more effectively but they all play a part....Also I have been in different forms of therapy for years. In my experience:...- Therapy is a must and should directly address childhood neglect and trauma (broadly defined). If you are depressed and especially if you have developed a substance abuse disorder there is a very high probability that there are childhood issues to be addressed. AA appears to me to be basically free amateur therapy. It's better than nothing but not as good as seeing a professional. It costs money but there are forms of brief therapy that are high bang-for-the-buck (CBT EMDR)....-Depression is a learned adaptation to life stressors. You've got to take action on those life stressors. You've got to protect yourself from what is bad for you. You've got to learn that you are worthy of your own protection....- you've got to shop around to find someone who you feel comfortable with. The therapist is as important as the style. If you're not feeling it after a couple of sessions tell them then switch if they are unable to adapt to your needs....Good luck
My doctor wouldn't even give me anti depressants because I was a drunk (I told him)  He said there's no point alcohol will prohibit them working.  Stay sober and try your medication.  I won't drink with you today! 
I don't have any yoda-like advise but I do know that drinking made my depression 10x worse. Over time not drinking it gradually got better. I'm not depression free but I'm much better off. When my bad days hit I'm just thankful I'm not still drinking. It's lifted a brain fog I couldn't get through sometimes. 
Bipolar here I feel you. I go to a 6:45 am meeting I know the later the day gets the less likely I'll do anything never mind something I don't "have" to do. It sets me up in a better mood for the rest of the day. 
The great question was does the alcohol cause depression or does the depression cause the self-medication?  Answer I was given is that it doesn't matter - you have both so treat both.  Problem is it is literally impossible to treat depression if you are drinking...I quit drinking and my depression is (magically) in check...Sometimes I wonder was I just using the out they gave me to continue my drinking?
