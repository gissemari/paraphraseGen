Waved at him at a stoplight and reminded myself that I'm not the only one. Countless people are contemplating sobriety attempting sobriety newly sober or long enough into it to get it printed on their license plate yet so often I walk into a public place and feel like no one there knows what I'm going through. But it really helped to remind myself that my struggle is nothing new and more people than I realize have experienced it firsthand or loved someone who has experienced it and they understand. ..Maybe it's time I go to a meeting...

Aw this is cool! I'd love to see something like that :) 
We have a red Corvette with this one it's license plate  SOB3R  
What does that OBiLw mean?
Awesome!
Share what it means???
Friend of Bill W!
for those wondering found this explanation on the internet..where else :).."A member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and therefore (usually) a recovering alcoholic. Derived from the name of Bill Wilson (Bill W.) one of the founding members of AA."
Sorry folks: I thought y'all would be familiar with the expression... ..The plate is saying  Friend of Bill W  which is AA code. It's a somewhat secretive way of asking/telling someone about AA membership (e.g.  Are you a friend of Bill W? ) If they're a recovering alcoholic in AA they'll say yes and if not they'll just say  Who?  and it's easy to backpedal out of it without raising much suspicion. It stems from the name of the guy who founded AA Bill Watson and he's called Bill W cuz ya know anonymity. 
I love that it is so old school. I remember in my early 20s many moons ago seeing the bumper sticker Friend of Bills and wondering who is this Bill guy with all the friends. My dad who was in AA explained it to me after a while. Very cool. .Peace
