I see my therapist every Monday morning and after relapsing last week and recovering throughout the weekend.  I found my self sitting in the waiting room so anxious I thought I was going to explode.  Every second of the five minutes waiting felt like eternity and every sound echoed in my head and startled me. All weekend I thought "this is too big. I can't do this". I felt like breaking up with my girlfriend and quitting my job because I didn't feel like I deserved any of it.  That I should go disappear somewhere until I can figure everything out. When my therapist came to get me and we got to her office I just let it all out and told her everything I was feeling.  She told me that I deserved to have a relationship and a job that's why I was there that just like everyone else I also am deserving of a life I want to live in. It really helped me see that my low self esteem and negative thinking had clouded my judgement just as much as drinking had. ..When I left I felt so much better and confident and deserving.  Here's onto the first week sober again.

I really struggle with low self esteem myself and it is a bitch! I don't feel like I deserve anything or I don't want anything or maybe I just don't know what I want? I do think everyone deserves a chance to be happy though. I hope you can hold onto that feeling because you deserve it too!
You are working on it! That's the whole point. If you work on it you deserve it. Period! 
Thanks for the kind words!
