Hello SD! So I'm 5 days into sobriety and I have some questions. I have been a heavy drinker for about 10 years but the drinking was usually interrupted due to work so it was not uncommon for me to go days or even weeks without drinking. I just got done with 3 years of non-deployable duty where I could pretty much drink every day and I usually did at least something. I used to get drunk but things didn't get scary until the last couple years where I've had a couple incidents of blacking out. For the past 5 days I've had a buzz almost like I've had a couple beers. If this is what being sober is like sign me up! haha j/k ..I know the feeling will subside and that this is somewhat common but what comes next? Does anyone have any kind of timeframe at least from your experience?..I have also noticed my short-term memory is not very good. I open the fridge while cooking and forget what I'm getting over and over. On a bright note I haven't had any sleep problems which surprised me but I have also been working out pretty hard. ..I have not decided where I'm going with alcohol in general but I have at least made the commitment to abstain until I get down to my goal weight no matter what. I can't justify drinking at all while I'm fat and unhappy. Maybe by then I'll be used to not drinking altogether. I'm doing one day at a time and it hasn't been that tough but that may be because my subconscious thinks I'll drink again. I have honestly never tried abstaining probably because I feared failure and a cycle of quitting and relapsing so this is all new to me. Oh the webs we weave.

Oh yeah this time when I quit I got that high on life feeling the day after I stopped drinking (unusual because I was still hungover but I suspect now it was because I knew I'd been really lucky on my last night out there and I also knew I was done drinking - that I pretty much *had* to be done or something bad was going to happen) and felt like that for almost a month before reality calmed down a bit.  But honestly I had such a wonderful day with my wife 8 days after stopping that it's one of my favorite memories ever.  Since then life has been up and down but I'm generally ok and not ever very tempted to drink anymore.  I'm sure the cravings will return again but I feel pretty secure in my sobriety with the support of this group.
well done on 5 days.
