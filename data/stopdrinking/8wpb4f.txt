I'm honestly desperate for encouragement at this point so hi Reddit. There's a strong possibility that I am going to lose my job on Monday which meant a lot to me and am struggling with immensely. I considered checking myself into an inpatient program last night but it isn't covered by my insurance.  ..I had my fiance hide my Atarax and he is keeping an eye on me this weekend. I've been met with an outpouring of love and support but I'm terrified for my financial future and compromised sense of self worth.

Well I was once fired from the job I had moved my family to another state to take after a year. It sucked. Difficult times ensued...I am now doing something totally different and I really like it and they like me. It wasn't instantaneous and quitting drinking was a big help but I know now that big awful events have things on the other side of them as well both good and bad...How can I help today?
Sorry to hear this but know that being sober you will come out the other side okay. I was let go somewhat unexpectedly a few years ago because of downsizing but it has worked out better than I could have expected. The nature of all life is that it's uncertain and you cannot control it but you can control your response to it. Best of luck to you. IWNDWYT.
Don't let it get you down too much there's always another job possibly another career you never know when one door closes a window opens or so they say. Best of luck. 
Don't worry about the job...I mean you were looking for one when you started there anyway right?
