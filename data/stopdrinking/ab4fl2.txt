It started with a horrible hangover last new years on my flight home after the holiday. Was vomiting with dry heaves nearly every hour on the hour. Esophageal  contractions so bad that drinking even a swallow of water felt like squeezing a chicken through a snake. This was a fitting punctuation to a streak of drinking that lasted for twenty years. .Countless mornings checking the driveway to see if I had driven home wasted again. Countless days lost on recovery which always ended with more drinks..I do not have the time right now to explore the depths of my embarrassment but rest assured if you are struggling out there you are in very good company. .Tonight will be a tough one as I find myself the only sober person for miles. .I am really happy to have stumbled on this community of support (just 2 days ago). Will be checking in regularly..Wishing everyone a safe and sober new year!

Awesome. Good work!! 
Congratulations! I loved Phuket but unfortunately I've screwed my life up to the point that I can't afford to get back. Congratulations on getting (almost) to a year sober. I hope it has been a good one!
