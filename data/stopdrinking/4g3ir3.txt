I went out for dinner and dancing to a live band with a large group of girlfriends last night. A friend ended the night by saying"I'm so impressed you can dance without drinking. " and I had so much fun being able to have real conversations. And was bemused to watch a couple of the women barely able to walk by the end of the night. Thinking that could be me. And how much I want to continue to get up feeling good and wanting to get outside. It's just those 5o'clock habits/cravings I  struggling with. Cheers to strength to you all. I will not drink today.

Sounds like a nice time. I'm going dancing tonight and looking forward to being fully present for the whole night. ..
Nice job...
