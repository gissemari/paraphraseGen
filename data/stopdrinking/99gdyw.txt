First of all I need a badge reset and I have requested that now. ..Earlier this summer I made it 3 months without alcohol a record for myself. Then I relapsed but got back on top of it however in the last couple of weeks I have drunk until drunk on several occasions (but at least not daily) Right now I feel like I am back at or even behind square one and I feel daunted by building up another three month streak let alone forever. ..If anyone here has relapsed and subsequently given it another go and remained alcohol free I'd love to hear how they did it.

For me I catch myself in the train of thought I'd had the last time I'd relapsed.
Its probably safe to say most everyone here has relapsed and given it another go...The key is to learn from your previous slips so that you can avoid making the same mistakes again.  Were there any patterns or triggers that led to your relapses?  Is there anything you can do differently this time to avoid the same outcome?..&amp;#x200B;..3 months is a long time to go without a drink.  My first real effort was about 3 weeks...
You done good for achieving 3 months.  You can do this again!  For me each recovery after relapse only gets worse and worse and I cannot go there again! Best of luck and IWNDWYT
