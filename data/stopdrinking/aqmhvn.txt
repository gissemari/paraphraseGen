Hi ..I promised myself I would have come here to write some lines about the benefits from these 30 days if I ever had some and well here I am...&amp;#x200B;..Story: ..I am a 27yo male and I have been drinking since the age of 14-15 strongly binging during weekends and having my beers on weekdays. On November-December of last year I had a peak of consume due to a painful breakup.   .I suffer from IBS and anxiety which I  tried to cure with meditation and exercise...My consume skyrocketed (especially on weekends) hand by hand with a dependency on cocaine. I was going out two nights in a row sometimes even without sleeping. That behaviour I was convinced helped me avoiding negative thoughts and sadness. What I discovered later is that it was actually feeding my ruminative-depressed thoughts during the other days of the week. I eventually joined the gym and started to get more serious about but I was still destroying myself during weekends. ..On 1st of January I had a strong black-out as I over drunk (thanks to cocaine) and I couldn't remember what I did for around 3 hours. It's always a bit scary. I then decided to take a month and a half off from cocaine till my birthday (I never thought I would have make it tho)..It helped that my brother went on rehab for cocaine and alcool addiction (he has ADHD) which gave me the willingness to prove myself I could stop...**The decision:** on January 15th I decided to take a one month break from alcool. Some of my friends were doing Dry January (all of them  eventually failed to) and I found myself explaining that I did it too the year before but that at the time I was in a couple and that it would have been impossible now. ..This storytelling clicked inside my head. Did I really need to be in couple to stop drinking for one month? can't I take care of myself by my own?? ..I did some research and I became very interested on the benefits others were advocating on IBS anxiety and mood....&amp;#x200B;..**What I did:** I then took the decision made my friends aware of it (to make the challenge bigger) and stopped drinking. ..Together with it I decided to take some other steps forwards for this month: ..*Habits:* ..\- started vaping - it was always difficult to stay away from cigarettes while drinking)..\- started hitting to the gym 4+ times for week - waking up fresh on the weekends helps a lot..\- continued meditating everyday - I'm now on a 120 days streaks on Headspace. A MUST..&amp;#x200B;..*Food and supplements* ..\- taking everyday VLS#3. It's a very strong probiotic very expensive but alone it probably made wonderful things for IBS and anxiety...\- taking creatine monohydrate - for the gym  but it's also a mild nootropic and mood enhancer. You should try it...\- taking brewers' yeast - for vitamins and skin benefits ..\- eating a shitload of proteins (for the gym you know)..&amp;#x200B;..**Thoughts:** ..I started on wednesday. First weekend went easy I also went out with my friends clubbing and I had redbull. Went home quite early tho. ..By the 6th-7th day I started to feel some light headache especially during the evening. I quickly realised that it was a common feeling I usually had on the mid of the week and that I usually replied to it with a beer. Was that my light addiction kicking in and asking for its treat? I think so...Weeks actually passed really easy: I had some very interesting conversation with friends and colleagues abut the my sobriety I went on three Tinder dates completed sober - and I actually happily ended one of them :D - and I hit the gym like a crazy. ..I guess this was actually what helped the most: having something to look forward for the day after to give you motivation and strength and seeing some visible results putting on...&amp;#x200B;..**Benefits:**..All the following benefits come from the habits and changes I listed above:..\- energy: it's insane. No hangovers fresh Monday mornings willingness to go work out two times per day. It's actually crazy how much stronger I feel ..\- muscles: I have actually built some serious body. Not in one month of course but I feel that if I would continue on this way I would become a beast..Face:..\- skin: I stopped drinking (and started taking probiotics) also to improve my skin. Not that I had problems but I wanted to look better. I honestly didn't notice any particular change maybe it's a bit tighter? Nothing really easy to spot. ..\- eyes: it's maybe my impression but they look much more alive..\- dark circles: it was an important point for me i always had problem with it. I may say that it's getting better even if I am probably overtraining and therefore I look a bit tired..\- eye bags. This! alcool is supposed to stop collagen production. I am sure that the bags under my eyes are much smaller now crazy :) ..You may think it's all placebo (and I honestly doubted too) but I had two friends commenting on how I have a totally different face! Not bad as a result :D..&amp;#x200B;..**MY FAVOURITE BENEFITS:** ..Anxiety (and IBS)..I used to have this feeling on my stomach for no particular reason like something was eating me from inside a continuous pain and feeling of unease. ..It completely went fucking away !..Together with IBS I am now almost 85% anxiety free. It's fucking amazing. I didn't even remember this feeling. ..95% of your serotonin is produced on your stomach this is enough to explain everything. ..The even fired me one week ago (long story) and I managed to feel calm and at ease in the situation something I would have never thought possible. ..I am now planning to go for a cheaper solution than VLS#3 probiotics I will let you know if they work as good as these ones. ..&amp;#x200B;..**Future:** ..Tomorrow the month is over and actually something strange happened: I don't really feel like drinking...I mean I am I look forward for a beer or glass of red wine but i don't want to get wasted. It's crazy how things has changed and I am curious to see if the situation will last...&amp;#x200B;..My negative thoughts have not completely went away I still have difficult days and struggle thinking about my ex. Nevertheless I am doing much much better than when I was trying to killing my worries with alcool. ..In my opinion together with all the changes I did on my lifestyle it helped a lot taking a real strong decision on taking care of myself on doing something only for myself. It changed my perspective on things completely...&amp;#x200B;..Most importantly I am aware - or I would say worried- that these are quick fixes and they won't really change my way of handling things. I am worried I too have ADHD (it's genetic) that would actually explain a lot of things about what happened in my life (like the breakup and the fact I was fired) but I keep looking positive. Maybe discovering I have this disturb would solve many of the deepest questions I carry with myself. ..Nevertheless spring is coming in Paris and even if unemployed and single I can't help but feel very good and optimist. I'm very proud of what I achieved :)..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..  .Again I think that what will help you the most will be a real decision on taking care of you guys (and therefore have a good impacts on your loved ones). ..Excuse my english if I did too many errors I'm not mother tongue - and you know I probably have ADHD so I won't re-read the thing hahaha..If I can help or you are curious about some stuff just ask. Hope this will motivate some of you out there1..&amp;#x200B;..Ciao Davide..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
