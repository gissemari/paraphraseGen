Day 1 again. Twice before I've quit for a year or more. It takes months after a relapse for things to get bad enough to quit again. ..Bad means drinking a bottle of wine and four beers most evenings. It means waking up most mornings feeling physically crappy and also ashamed of myself. It means watching the guy in the mirror getting fat again. It means saying cruel things to my spouse. That's where I draw the line...I quit smoking (again) two weeks ago. Doing fine with that but I have been drinking even more. ..It's time. Thanks for listening. ..

What's gonna be different this time?
Glad you're back. I learned early there is more to getting well than simply not drinking. I'm curious what else you are planning.
Hey just curious. Why did you relapse? What made you give in to it? 
Welcome back!
Welcome back. You can do this.
I know the feeling. You can do this. 
Shit. I'm exactly where you are (sans spouse) and posted almost the thing here on Saturday. Sweated through my entire bedding all 3 nights except last night I actually slept. Keep up the good work it took a 9 month relapse for me to wise up now I'm sobering up. Good on you! 
Hey what you said- "it takes months after a relapse...to quit again" really woke me up thank you. On the other hand maybe "fuck months" and give sobriety a try every morning. Idk-just I never give up (so far) even though the urges are overwhelming at times. Don't give up and thanks for giving me the internet kick in the pants I needed. Take care.
