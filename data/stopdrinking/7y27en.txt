Yesterday was Day 5 for me. I knew the temptation would hit sooner or later and it did yesterday. I had the afternoon off to take my GF to the doctor. Later while at home I could feel that temptation coming on to the point of feeling jittery sitting on the couch. I reminded myself IWNDWYT and read a few posts here to help...We went to dinner fortunately a place that does not serve alcohol but even after dinner I was feeling jittery. I went to the restroom and simply looked myself in the mirror and reaffirmed what I'm doing and that I can do this!..I suggested we go to the grocery market along with Target after dinner and by the time we were walking through the store I was feeling better. At the market my GF asked if I was going to buy wine and I told her "not tonight". Later in the car I told her I was consciously  not drinking which is why I hadn't bought wine. She'd noticed I hadn't been drinking and asked me how long. She's happy since it was something that bothered and worried her. ..Thanks for listening. I will not drink with you today.

Great glad you stuck it out. I am on my Day 4 today. I feel good confident. Glad your GF is supportive!!
Well I'm glad you were able to do something to distract yourself from the urge.  And you told your girlfriend which sounds pretty huge too!  Congrats on those five days!  IWNDWYT
Surprise surprise... She knew! Happy that you both talked about it no drama it can be dealt with... But so much easier when you can count on her! Iwndwyt
Great job!
