and I haven't missed one meeting.  I've had 2 job interviews.  Starting my first job tomorrow.  Will hear about my EMT position next week.  crossing my fingers.  I have been open and honest with myself I may get it I may not.  It's okay.  Time takes time.  I just finished my week long IV class and passed everything in the high average.  All without a drink.  I was a complete mess 2 weeks ago.  This year I finally accepted that I was an alcoholic.  I tried rehab I relapsed and every time I drink I let the best of the worst happen.  No longer will I let drinking into my production.  If I feel like I need a drink I call someone anyone.  Today I wont drink.  I  appreciate anyone who can look at themselves and fight the demons that haunt them.  I would rather live a life thinking I am an alcoholic and not drink than to live a life thinking I am not an alcoholic and drink.

Well said!
It's hard in that downward spiral but 15 days - that's good - that's really good - give yourself a pat on the back and take each day as it comes without poison 
Since ive gotten a new job and kept busy it's been so much easier for me to stay sober. GL.
