So as mentioned yesterday I've been having a down-in-the-dumps couple of days. Today I know my sugar issues were back with a vengeance so for dinner I made myself a massive "Mood Juice" in an attempt to shock my system out of it. (I'll meditate and sit with it in a bit too but I wanted to try to get some positive change going as well.) Mood Juice: Three Beets (with tops) handful of wheat grass massive chunk of ginger one whole jalapeno pepper two carrots one orange three stalks celery. Chug a lug...This prompted me to go online and Google "mood juice" to see if such a thing formally exists and while I did not find a recipe for mood juice I did find this wonderful free self-help CBT-based guide for overcoming Depression. It's pretty much all the things I try to tell folks on here struggling with it to do but with pretty graphs and worksheets and check-in sheets... it's really stellar. I plan to spend some time with it this evening myself...http://www.moodjuice.scot.nhs.uk/Depression.asp..And wouldn't you know? They have one for Anxiety too!..http://www.moodjuice.scot.nhs.uk/anxiety.asp..Really wonderful free resources totally beet my juice recipes any day! (See what I did there?)

no offence ... I mean I'm all for green drinks ... but that sounds revolting! ;)
I'm supposed to be doing those CBT exercises at the behest of my sponsor. The idea is I write down my shitty thought identify which distortion it might be and then write a rational response. I've done it a few times but I have a hard time believing I'm going to get out of this depression and anxiety with this. I guess I should still do it. I'm skeptical but I was skeptical about AA too so IDK.
