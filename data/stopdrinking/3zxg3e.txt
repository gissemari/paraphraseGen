I'm only on day two here & I'm already struggling. I've got a ton of deadlines upon me & had a meeting today thats given me enough work til' June (freelance graphic/web designer over here)...Typically I'd have a drink & keep plugging away at work. Need something else to fill that gap & provide a little relaxation...I'd smoke some herb but my productivity would go out the window & I'd end up watching funny animal videos. Tried lifting some weights but the craving is still going strong. ..What do y'all do when the cravings hit?

Try some sugar - candy/sweets or ice cream.
A quick walk a few pushups works for me.
I'm right there with ya. I'm clinging to this subreddit like my life depends on it. At this point I'm not sure I'll make it the next few hours sober. But let's try!!
People say that if you ride the craving out it will go away. It is called "urge-surfing". Perhaps you could try another form of relaxation such as meditation. Picture yourself on a beautiful beach and listen to the waves crash. For myself some form of distraction: reading listening to music--works best.  But I am new at this too! And where I live we have not yet reached the witching hour. Good luck!
Meditation light exercise and stretch.  Any combo of those three.  Also keeping in my mind that by not drinking I would have vastly more productive time to complete those stressful projects than I would otherwise.  Meaning more time to watch movies or get into some hobbies later!
Keep on keeping! I find that taking my dog for a walk or exercising are the most useful options for myself. 
I eat a small bite of toffee and make a mocktail of POM juice and soda with a squeeze of lime..
The first few weeks are tough. And for me it wasn't "One Day at a Time" it was: "One Minute/One Hour at a Time." I remember feeling actually surprised when the first 'urge' had past --and I had four perfectly organized drawers to boot! The more times I resisted the urge the less power I gave it. Good Luck to you. I know you can do this if you really want to.
Here's my [Ulysses Bargain post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3z4wos/newcomers_how_i_process_the_alkybrain_alkyvoice/?ref=search_posts)  I found this metaphor irresistible and very helpful to me.
Day 2 here my friend. Just do what you think is best. I just take some deep breaths and read the note I wrote to myself or think about how dark of a place I'd be in if I drank. I made a pledge and I intend to keep it! Keep it up! We can do this!
In the beginning I walked 8 miles a day. I had no other choice but to just keep walking and drinking lots of water.
