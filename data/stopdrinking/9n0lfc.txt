I've been struggling like crazy... Going in and out of binges resetting my badge over and over drinking at night and barely making it through the day just to start the cycle over agaib falling behind on responsibilities... Ughhhh enough is enough. This is not me. ..So I'm snapping myself out of this. Going to go visit my sponsor since I've been avoiding her lately so she can fill my head with some nuggets of truth. It's not gonna be easy... But I'm just gon a take it one moment at a time... ..I'm ten days late to the Sober October party but I'm here!!!! ..Thanks for always being here for this alcoholic. ..IWNDWYT

Welcome to the party! I was 4 days late..... or two years early if you wanna get technical on when I first got sober lol. ..[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) for getting back on the wagon again and again - I have done it a few times myself it is rough but worth it :)
