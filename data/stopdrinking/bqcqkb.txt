I'm sorry this may be triggering but I need help.......I was doing amazing. Got to almost 3 months sober. Now I'm circling the drain.. it's 2pm here and I'm already drunk as a skunk. I need to stop this again I just don't know how. I have 2 beautiful dog's and the world's most amazing fiance who loves me to the end of the world and back. But I can't seem to stop this shit atm. I want off this ride. It sucks. Suggestions please? I'm so damn sick of this shit.

I'm sorry it's so hard
Tomorrow is a new day. Focus on that!
You won't stop until you have a reason to. So you can keep going until you're alone or dead.
I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
