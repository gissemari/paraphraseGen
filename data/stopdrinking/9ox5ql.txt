.Today marks four years since I last took a drink...I first reached out for help to get sober in April of 2013. I was unsure of what I really wanted but the negative consequences of drinking were becoming overwhelming and the drink was no longer making me feel the way I wanted it to any more. At 4am one night while incredibly drunk I asked my wife to take me to AA. The meeting I chose started in 9am which made for a rather rough morning. Spoiler alert: alcohol impairs your judgement...I spent the next 18 or so months slipping in and out of sobriety. 30 days relapse 15 days relapse 20 days relapse and so on. I still was secretly holding onto the idea that somehow some way I would find the recipe that would let me drink without losing control and bringing the world down around me. The reality that I hadn't accepted yet was that I couldn't control my drinking once I had started and that drinking virtually guaranteed disaster for me...In that period my life went from bad to worse. I attempted suicide I brought myself and my wife to the brink of homelessness and financial ruin and I did some incredibly hurtful things that I still struggle to comprehend today...Eventually I ran away from all my problems by moving countries and starting work at a small startup. I happened to land in a town that had an incredible amount of support for sober people. I became more active in r/stopdrinking and the #stopdrinking chatroom and I finally got a sponsor in AA instead of just warming a seat a few times a week. In conversations in #stopdrinking and with my sponsor it became clear to me finally that I was really an alcoholic and that I simply could not drink and expect to maintain any level of control...I got busy. I started going to at least one meeting a day I did the steps and I spent a ton of time on SD. The first few months hell the first year were hard - I was scared lonely unsure if I could really do it anxious angry at the world. My relationship with my wife was raw. I was so broke I couldn't afford food or furniture. My mental health issues were still untreated. The only thing that was clear to me that I simply could not afford to drink...What has changed since that first year? Everything. The startup sold and I now work at a BigCo and live in yet another city. My relationship with my wife is healing. I no longer hate myself. Materially I am far more secure - I own a home and cars and make a good income at a nice job with a fancy title. I have made lifelong friends in my various sobriety pursuits and I gain happiness by helping my fellow alcoholics in the same way I was helped. I have an infant son. I have some hobbies that consume far more time and money than I should let them but I love them. I am happy...Why post this at all? It's not to boast. I want to get across a few things that can be learned from my misadventures and changes..* **If you have relapsed once or a dozen or a hundred times it is never hopeless.** This might be the time for you the last time..* If early sobriety seems to suck well you might be right. **That doesn't mean it is going to suck forever.** Things change..* **There is happiness and fun to be found in sobriety.** More than I could ever imagine...You all have been and continue to be a big part of my sobriety. Thank you for everything.

Wow! Thank you so much for sharing. And thank you for passing down some wisdom. 
As a chronic relapser I take heart thank you for sharing 
Thank you for sharing...it helped me...Have a great day.
Congratulations on Your Sober Solar Circumnavigations!..You're an inspiration!
Great post all the best to you! IWNDWYT!
Congrats dude! And thanks for sharing I hope one day to reach where you are and more. I'm still quite early on and some days getting  through by the skin of my teeth but I am fighting. You seem to have a fulfilled life which is something I desire greatly - hopefully one day I can have that too. I just have to remind myself that drinking will not get me to that point.
Congrats on 4 years! That is awesome and inspirational! I really appreciate your sharing as I relate especially to your 30 days relapse etc. with an inkling  of the idea that control is possible. I'm far enough into that pattern to realize that control is probably off the table and hope that in four years I'll be celebrating my 4 year anniversary of sobriety. But I'll take it one step at a time. Today just for today I will not drink with you!
Admirable turn around. Thanks for sharing.
Great share congrats on 4 years. With my countless day ones I am encouraged.  And I love the honesty that this is not easy!  But worth it.  Thank you!
#4!!!!..I'm glad you preserved until sobriety clicked and stuck around afterwards.
Such a good post thanks. I would add that if early sobriety sucks it will suck even more if we keep drinking... Sobriety is truly a gift that an alcoholic who still drinks just cannot understand only time will show it to if we work for it.
Thanks for the inspiration. 
Congratulations!  Yeah that elusive  recipe for drinking right   so grateful to stop wasting time trying to find it.  
thanks drycycle!! ..-amp from the chat
Brilliant post thanks Iwndwyt 
Bravo pour les 4 ann es !! Man you have been through a lot. 
Thank you for the inspiring post!
Right now I am stuck in a bad place. Reading success stories like yours brings hope. Thank you so much.
Thanks for sharing.  An excellent post!
Thanks for sharing this you almost made me cry on the bus home from work...I've tried sobriety dozens of time for years I've had a cycle of a few weeks or months of sobriety followed by some light to moderate drinking followed by excessive drinking hurting loved ones and damaging everything I touch. Rinse and repeat. I'm 17 days sobre now and it sucks...I have mental health issues which are mostly manageable but I feel tired anxious and sad almost always. I've spent a decade running away from my feelings. In the last two years I learned to allow and feel sadness and fear thanks to two awesome therapists. I set a goal two years ago and with time tears and hard work I achieved that goal. I know I'm doing the right thing I know I will feel better and be a better person after some time (Weeks? Months? Years?)..It just sucks right now. Your story really inspired me to persevere.
Congrats on 4 years and thank you kindly for the inspiration!
I have relapsed quiet a few times. I take inspiration from your post. Iwndwyt
