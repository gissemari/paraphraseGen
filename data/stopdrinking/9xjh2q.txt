The past couple weeks I've been scared of relapsing. I haven't and I'm okay now but I considered drinking. Even thought about suicide (just ideation but still) because I couldn't drink. I feel sometimes the more sober I get the more afraid I am of relapsing... because it progresses even when we aren't partaking. I never believed it would kill me my drinking and drugging until now when I think of what a relapse would look like for me. I would certainly overdose if I picked up where I left off. ..The importance of playing the tape forward.

6months/200s/9months were always hard for me as well. You got this my friend and we got you &lt;3 [High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) for reaching out and glad you are still here :)
I think a lot of people go through this like the other commentor here and myself. I have a theory ...n my early days I read up on a thing called Cherophobia: that feeling you get when good things happen to you that your luck is bound to change and that these good things must come to an end soon. I think I posted something about it a year or so ago and it's really stuck with me...I believe that as alcoholics we sabotage ourselves in order to feed the addiction far more than we realize. As a result we invite pain and suffering. No wonder we have a tendency to flinch when things are finally going our way; we've spent too long ensuring they don't last to trust that that will...Anyway that's my $0.02. That knowledge helped me through hard days and maybe it will help you too...Haha in there. It gets easier.
Do you have someone in-person that you can talk to about these feelings? Preferably another sober person or a therapist/doctor? I find that whenever I go through these types of moments that it's really important to put voice to that experience with another person. /r/stopdrinking is a fine resource but it's my opinion that nothing beats 1x1 human contact and relating on a deeply emotional level. Thanks for posting and I hope you get past this! Rooting for ya.

Some days I just know my head will hit the pillow sober. Other days I have to take it by the hour. Even still after all this time...But it's not exactly "cravings"...its just a God's honest fear of knowing that I can very easily fuck this up.
