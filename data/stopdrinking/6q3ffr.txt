Over the past 4 years I have gone from drinking 4 pints a day to an 18 pack of cheap beer (rolling rock). I had my revelation a while ago but keep slipping even prioritizing beer over food when I'm too poor for both. I have struggled to stop for the past 8 months but today is the day. My #1 life goal is to be a great future father and this is the first step to my success.
