I understand the importance of badge resets.  However last night I came to the realization that the ability to easily reset my badge whenever I mess up seems to offer some sort of a bye for cheating.  A free pass at least for me.   What's the big deal if I slip I can just restart tomorrow.    Yeah it's OK if I shoot myself in the foot today I can just have a doctor fix that up for me tomorrow.  It would be easy enough to pretend I didn't drink and not request a reset but that would not be honest.  I take my commitment to my sobriety and to you the community very seriously.  .Come to find out that stupid little icon with a number actually means somethings to me.  It's a measure of struggle and strength.   Resilience.   Moving forward I will cast aside the thought of the easy reset.  One less trick of the mind to grapple with in my battle with drinking.  .Stay strong.  Be true to yourself.  IWNDWYT . or ever!.

I keep resetting and I just feel ashamed.
I like to see if I can beat my old "high score."..It's 20 days so far. I would've made the month but the server at the restaurant asked me if I wanted a cocktail on the house FOUR TIMES IN A ROW and I was already on edge...grumble...Anyway I think I can snag the month before 2018 is out.
