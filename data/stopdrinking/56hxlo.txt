In various points of sobriety I had a lot of questions about the future. Planning ahead knowing what is coming and having a plan in place for when things go bad is probably why I have not yet relapsed. I hope someone like me finds this helpful...* [Day 7: if you relapsed after 7 days why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3ozsba/if_you_relapsed_after_7_days_why/).* [Day 17 no longer having drinking nightmares](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3qcdoz/just_noticed_im_no_longer_having_drinking/).* [Day 21 I'm Scared](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3qura6/im_scared/).* [Day 40 Randomly crying all week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3t8r39/randomly_crying_all_week/).* [Day 42 i thought i had this thing licked suddenly cravings every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3u4vrt/6_weeks_i_thought_i_had_this_thing_licked/).* [Month 2 Exercise routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3ttzfc/first_try_at_fitness/cx9bd3i?context=3).* [Month 2 Put a whiteboard by your bed].(https://www.reddit.com/r/EOOD/comments/3x84yu/put_a_whiteboard_by_your_bed/).* [Month 7 How long before being a non-drinker feels "normal"?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4fcg34/how_long_before_being_a_nondrinker_feels_normal/d28axv8?context=3).* [Month 7 Can't stop eating](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4hcg6e/cant_stop_eating/).* [Month 11 Lonely](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4yly1r/spending_tonight_alone_dont_know_what_to_do_with/d6owx4e?context=3).* [Month 11 "Relapse is part of the process"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/51m8cz/relapse_is_part_of_the_process/)'..A year ago I was a shell of my former self. Now I am happy. A HUGE thank you to the mods of this subreddit and to the individual posters. Each time you share your experiences your struggles your ups and your downs it reminds me who I am and keeps me focused on what I need to do. Thank you.
