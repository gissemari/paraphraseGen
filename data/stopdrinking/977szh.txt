Hello everybody!..Today as a special treat I'm going to share with you all a [speech that Will Smith made on a talk show once](https://youtu.be/doqS35FfcUE)  which I find endlessly inspiring. I'm [not really competitive in the traditional sense](https://youtu.be/XRN8NK2oCVo?t=30s) so I think of the other treadmill as being occupied by forces in my life. ..In this instance I'm on the treadmill running against my addiction. And I'm not getting off first. I will not be outworked. That means that every time I relapse &amp; come back I do more to support my sobriety than I did the time before. Because what I was willing to do the last time wasn't enough. And either I stay on that treadmill &amp; I keep running or I die. (Or I eventually lose everything that I value &amp; all the things that make life meaningful to me which amounts to about the same thing.)..That's it. That's all there is to it. What I was willing to do last time wasn't enough. So this time I have to be willing to do more. And I keep doing more until it's enough. (I am making life a little easier on myself this time around by paying more attention to what I can visibly see working for people with long term sobriety and doing that.)..And with that less talk more rock...Ginger\_Sprout Out

Interesting!  IWNDWYT 
I'm on my latest (and last!) reset and love this analogy. You have to do more. You have to work it every second. Stay on that treadmill. 
You can do it!
Thank you for sharing! This is a great video and I'm filing it away for later. ..Also I can't run to save my life. In my mind I'm editing this to gentle walking on a treadmill. Because sobriety isn't a race. It's just about moving forward at a pace your body can sustain. I can't run and I'm committed to continuing walking this treadmill. ..Catch you tomorrow! IWNDWYT
