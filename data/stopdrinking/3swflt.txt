Hello Sobriety Supporters :) I'm here to chiggity-check myself before I wiggity-wreck myself. ..I came to an inpatient treatment a few weeks ago because I was having a great deal of trouble landing (a minimum of) 30 days. My experience has been very positive (a surprisingly low-cost program with extra high care a surprising amount of freedom staff who are supportive and fun to be around and a group of women who I would be friends with on the outside world) and I feel like I've got a lot of the resources and network of friends to reach out to when I get those sick thoughts. ..Here's the problem: While I know that I am capable of staying sober if I want it I am getting tripped up over my immature intrinsic rebellion. My family are huge supporters of my sobriety more so for my health than any behavioral consequences. I was the kind of drunk that could stay sober all day long but wouldn't dream of not drinking a bottle and a half of wine before brushing my teeth and climbing into bed to watch Law & Order SVU for hours. My liver function is fine but has some pretty gnarly damage. ..The day I get out of treatment my entire family is going on a trip to Palm Springs which is something we do every year. This has traditionally been a drinking/relax vacation and I'm prepared not to drink. I've already found meetings and have a few relapse prevention plans ready to go. The problem is that I will have a night to myself at my house before I leave to meet them and all I can think of doing is drinking for one night before I head to the desert. Now logically I know all of the consequences of this idea. I could be that wild card that kicks the bucket. I would lose my 31 days which I worked really hard to get but can easily manipulate myself so that I'm the only one that has to know. I would let down my friends sober network family and myself if anyone found out. ..But I still want to do it. My hundredth "last hoorah." I'm not up to  talking to my sober homies yet because I know they will be so disappointed that these are my secret inside feelings and will likely talk me out of it. Brain says don't heart/body says don't disease says haveeeeablastttt you sucka! I don't want to change my name to FailureOnceMore. ..Thank you for reading about my crazy. Any words will likely be helpful!

You're here because you know it's a bad idea that's certainly a good start...People post here all the time in your exact same situation. I'd spend a few minutes browsing some before/after posts by other SD'ers who had one last hurrah. Some people have had dozens of one last hurrahs. Some people come back the next day ashamed and hungover full of regret. Others don't come back at all but I don't think it's because that one last binge crushed their demons. I have not seen once case where someone had one last hurrah said that it was overall a wise experience and then successfully remained sober going forwards.
Thanks for posting. Sounds like you're in the right place. ..Ok let me run down what you just told us. ..&gt;I came to an **inpatient treatment** a few weeks ago because I was having a great deal of trouble landing (a minimum of) 30 days...So your drinking problem was so bad that you needed a comprehensive treatment facility for a month to stop. ..&gt;My liver function is fine **but has some pretty gnarly damage.**..You drank so much that you caused measurable damage to your liver. ..&gt;all I can think of doing is drinking for one night before I head to the desert. Now logically I know all of the consequences of this idea. I could be that wild card that kicks the bucket. I would lose my 31 days which I worked really hard to get but can easily manipulate myself so that I'm the only one that has to know. I would let down my friends sober network family and myself if anyone found out. ..And you still think that drinking may be an option? If you're still thinking that is something that you can "get away with" and that "no one else needs to know" then you're missing what in my experience was one of the most important parts to my sobriety: ..**I will know**..I had to ask myself this question: do I want to be sober or just have people think I'm sober? As a corollary to that: do I want to be happy or just have people think I'm happy? ..&gt;But I still want to do it. My hundredth "last hoorah." I'm not up to  talking to my sober homies yet because I know they will be so disappointed that these are my secret inside feelings and will likely talk me out of it. ..If I were one of your sober friends I would be very disappointed that you didn't tell me about it. ..Right now you are planning a relapse. What else are you going to do about it?
Before I stopped drinking a few weeks ago I was telling my boyfriend I wanted to have a last hurrah just like you. I was planning to invite people over and have a table full of my favorite IPA's and bourbon. Then guess what? I got horrifically drunk at a work/social event I had no intention of going overboard at before my planned alcohol goodbye party. That next morning I woke up and decided that having a "beer funeral" as I was calling it was a joke. It was just a fancy way for me to justify bingeing as I had countless times in the past. My point is it's never a last hurrah. It's just another binge in a long boring series of binges. Stay strong and reach out to those somer homies you are referring to because I bet some quality time with them will be far more interesting than a lame night in front of the television with a cold bottle in your hand.
