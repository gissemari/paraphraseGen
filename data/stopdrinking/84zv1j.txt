Hi I whine so much here on good ol Reddit but honestly I see it as a good alternative to asking people in my life to do constant emotional labor.  I'm trying to rebuild after my relapse and it hasn't been easy. I have a meeting with my boss about my performance next week. I know I've been slipping and my company has been going through a whole raft of other issues that make working there stressful at times. So much of my life seems to be organized around my tenuous mental health: realizing I have problems taking steps to heal fucking up readjusting thinking about more problems in different realms of my life etc. etc. It's time consuming and has become central to my self-image. Why? Am I doing this to myself? Is it a defensive mechanism of some kind (my therapist would totally tell me it is?) ..Also I've been questioning my purpose. As of now I'm just kind of...surviving but I want something more. I want to be proud of what I can create build and contribute to; what are the barriers to taking steps so I can create that kind of life? I feel depressed and emotionally flattened. (Relapsing is a bad idea guys.)..I know what I need to do. I have a whole slew of tasks for work my affinity group and just like general life maintenance to do; I need to create some structure for myself and *do them* instead of feeling sorry for myself. I need to honor my obligations to others instead of drowning in self-pity and making everything about me. I just feel like garbage...My therapist told me that phases like this - when things aren't exactly great in your work and social lives - are part of life. The thing to do she says is to sit with those feelings of loneliness and sadness instead of numbing them with drugs booze or short-term relationships. I'm trying my best to make it through this..

i know that you know it is easier to regain mental health and take care of your business without drink. because of that i really love your shiny badge. and i love that you are here. and i love that you are see a therapist.  you haven't already it might be really helpful to you to read some of the books in the sidebar. if you are worried about delivering emotional labor to this group; don't. that's one of the reasons this group is here. and i don't doubt that you have (or will) respond to others with similar needs for a sounding board that you have today. patience my friend. one day you control is today. i will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink with you today. Your story resonates with me.
