Nice job booking an appointment. After my last relapse I decided I had to get super serious about not drinking. I can see rock bottom but I don't want to feel it. 
Keep working on it. Do you have support to stay sober? It's a hard journey we're on. Harder if you try to go it alone 
You can do this one step and one day at a time. Visualize green spaces fresh air and health. Don't overwhelm yourself with a big list of reasons why you have to fix yourself with a drs visit. Breathe and think how great it will be to breathe easy with self- confidence and love. We are with you. I will not drink with you today. 
Hell extends eternally downward. There is no bottom.
