(For background info [Chapter 1 was posted here:]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45ihtk/30_days_before_i_quit_drinking_i_wanted_to_learn/)  )...So during that first week I saw a glimmer of hope as I read posts by other people online and met women who seemed to be stable and not ready to die..which was a hell of a lot better than I was!  I got a badge here on /r/stopdrinking and every new number seemed to be a new achievement.  It was a great motivator.  .I'm an  Everything or Nothing  kinda person.  Either I go full speed ahead or I don't move so 7 days sober I decided I needed to tell my closest friends and family.  [I posted about it here.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26jv3d/towards_the_end_of_the_7th_day_and_now_i_told/)  My family was somewhat surprised but completely supportive .but my friends were pretty much like  Well it is about time!   I kept my 24 hour sobriety chip in my pocket every day to remind myself I could make it another 24 hours.  ...That first week was physically and mentally hard.  I was shaky headachey moody angry and mood swings were insane.  It seems like EVERYTHING reminded me about alcohol.  My husband who knew I was going to meetings and needed to get sober nevertheless refused to remove all alcohol from the house because my  lack of self control shouldn't be a punishment for me .  If I could have done it otherwise I would have cleared the house of all things alcohol and alcohol related IMMEDIATELY.  ...[On Day 10 I got a temporary sponsor](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26tth6/day_10_strange_morning_anxiety_i_got_a_sponsor/) by just asking a woman I saw at all three of my first meetings.  That might have been one of the most important choices I made in early sobriety.  My temporary sponsor got me started on step 1 genuinely accepting that I had a problem and she had me call her every day.  If I thought about drinking I'd be reminded that I needed to check in with her and I didn't want to disappoint her.  Plus I had already informed my family I was  all in  (as they say in poker) and the people I loved most in the world knew I had quit drinking and I didn't want to let any of them down so I slogged through it.  ...On Day 11 my amazingly supportive mother came to an Open Beginners AA meeting with me.  I could tell she felt like she was out of place but she willingly and uncomplainingly showed up to support me.  (354 days and many many challenges later that same wonderful woman was standing at my side when I picked up my 1 year sobriety chip.)  It made a big difference to know I had family at my back even though I was scared to death that I'd slip before I could even get a month sober....My sobriety date is less than 2 weeks before Memorial Day so I was pretty miserable as I said in my first ever SD post.  It was summer! That meant deck time drinks on the deck..grilling all of that.  And there I was trying to be sober at prime drinking season....But then someone spoke in a meeting and made something much more obvious to me:  I formerly drank to blackout almost every night.  I drank daily. I drank to excess.  EVERY day was a  drinking day  or  holiday  and year round was  prime drinking season  to me so the holiday and every other 24 hour period was just the same challenge.  ...That second week was much less about physical withdrawal symptoms but more about emotional rollercoasters and mood swings and breaking routines. (Example: walk in the door from work pour myself a drink before I even tended to the needs of my pets no more of that!)  Sleeping was difficult and my sleep cycle was a mess but having admitted to myself that I historically abused sleeping medication to a dangerous degree even those medications were off limits to me.  ...I had already planned my annual deck party far in advance BEFORE I decided to quit and it was too late to cancel (or so I decided.  In retrospect I should just have cancelled).   I followed through with the party but stayed sober and actually people-watched.  And what I discovered was amazing.  Yes my friends drank. (They didn't know I quit so of course people brought booze.  My house ALWAYS had booze!) My spouse drank.  But as the party wound down I realized my friends had imbibed maybe 3 or 4 beverages not the 8 or 9 I would have had.  They weren't sh!tfaced and slurry.  They were having fun without needing to be wasted..and some nursed a drink most of the party or even left a half full bottle and didn't finish it.  (Wait!?  Who does that!!!?? What a waste of booze!!)...Yet I knew honestly if it were any other year's big  Deck Party at the Mouse House  I'd be hammered by the end.  I would have been drinking before people even arrived. I'd be encouraging other people to drink more bringing them refills and pushing for others to join me.  Without me egging them on the party was pretty calm and while people had fun no one was out of control.  That was pretty strange because I would have sworn all of the people around me drank just as much as I did.  For the most part I was wrong.  ...I became very active on /r/stopdrinking early on.  It was an anonymous (NonnyMouse. Get it?) way for me to share my struggles my experiences and read about other people's triumphs and failures.  It helped.  I downloaded the app on my phone and had this group at my fingertips at all times and I went to AA meetings about 3 times per week with therapy 1 time per week.  .And one day at a time with my 24 hour chip in my pocket I survived the first month and [I posted this]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/28fb1o/im_going_to_bed_sober_when_i_wake_up_tomorrow_i/)...By the time I collected my 30 day chip physically I felt SO much better.  No more frequent migraines (IE: HANGOVERS!) a much less upset stomach my sleep evened out and I awoke refreshed and clear headed for the first time in a VERY long time.  It was so worth it.  I nearly bounced out of my chair when I collected my chip.  .*************************************.On day 30 I wrote these words and there is so much truth here:  .*For those of you struggling with the first month: It is a tough climb but you can make it. One day at a time one hour at a time 10 minutes at a time or less...just keep going. Go to a face to face meeting...call someone if you are struggling...post on here. Reach out for support and stick to your guns. This isn't a quick fix process...we didn't get ourselves in this situation overnight it will take time to get healthy. Be patient and diligent don't give up. Have a great sober day.*....I felt better.  That spark of light had grown into a small but steady candle flame of hope.  I had NO idea just how true  a tough climb  would be in the months and year + to come but I survived those 30 days and didn't want to give up that hard won chip.  So into my pocket along with the 24 hour chip went my 1 month coin and I carried on because I was starting to realize my life might actually be worth saving..************************  ..To be continued ..**********************************..Stay sober my friends.  .Mouse.

I'm a drinker I admire you guys
I loved reading this. Thank you.
Thank you. 
Another inspiring chapter thank you Mouse! Sounds like you have a great mommy too!..High Five
Thanks mouse
I'm a drinker too....except I stopped drinking 30 days ago.
This one was like reading a good book by the fire wrapped in a fuzzy blanket with an owl mug full of chamomile tea in it in my hands. SD is so amazing. That we are given the opportunity to go back and get those snapshots to see just how we were feeling at a certain time. It's not just a vague remembrance. It's almost tangible. ..I appreciate you putting together a full week of shares not simply a Saturday. :-)
Hugs Mouse!
