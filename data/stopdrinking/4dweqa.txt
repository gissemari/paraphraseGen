So my psychiatrist decided to put me on a drug called Campral to help me with the intense cravings for alcohol. (generally by day 14 the cravings are so intense I can't function and end up relapsing to get some relief) Has anyone else used this or any other medication to aid in recovery? if so what was your experience? Any and all feedback is appreciated.
