Hi guys this is an amazing sub so supportive and I love it and the kind caring words you all put up here. It means so much to us struggling as I'm sure you know. ..Today is my first day on Baclofen. I've been nervous about trying it but things have been scary lately so many black outs and worse. ..So the Baclofen has made me very sleepy and I have that weird drugged up feeling I've had from painkillers before but I have two days off from work and will hopefully get used to it real soon. ..I guess what I would like is to hear any good stories about it. ..I try to stay away from reading about any bad side effects. I've read some and then decided it was better to not know all of them in case my silly brain decides it had them by power of suggestion if you know what I mean. I've had long conversations with my GP and with the addiction specialist who prescribed this drug for me. .They have both told me I am safe to use this. ..Considering how scared I am by my alcohol use I am almost prepared to try anything which could help anyway...It hasn't made me want to stop drinking yet (I know it's a longer term drug that will hopefully help with the cravings for alcohol when I can up my dose enough.) But I'm starting on a very low dose as I am vey effected by any mediation. ..So today I've slept almost 14 hours. And ready to sleep more. I can do the same tomorrow but I have to be at work at 7.30am on Sunday...I'm hoping the drowsiness will wear off by then. ..On the upside so far I work almost every weekend and knowing I have a Friday and Saturday off I'd be staying up tonight and drinking until at least 2 in the morning. But tonight I'm ready for bed in the next 30 minutes...I'm so tired because of the Baclofen and probably because of how much I hate this life that I feel is subject to drinking. ..Wish me luck. I have alarms set on my phone at 9am 1pm and 4pm to take my medication...Long post I'm so sorry about that. And I thank any of you who have made it this far reading my words...I'm trying my best.

My mom takes Backofen every day to help with her spasms in her legs as she has MS. This is been a godsend for her and there have not been any negative symptoms for her. She has been taking it for 20 years and without it she would've had a nightmarish life. This drug is one that generally works well for a variety of people and you will get used to it affects on you soon. ..Stay strong and keep looking forward to a joyful life.
&gt; Considering how scared I am by my alcohol use I am almost prepared to try anything which could help..Baclofen is Not a "magic pill".  It is HARD work to break an addiction.  In fact stopping drinking has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life (and I'm 56).  It takes "Dogged Persistence" to not take that first drink and whether or not Baclofen helps you I still needed additional tools (like AA) to keep me sober and learn to live a happy life without alcohol...Additionally I've suffered with MS for many years and used to take Baclofen.  It did nothing to stop my urges when **I wanted to drink** because getting drunk is not just an action it's a "mind" thing.  I also learned I could get really f'd up by drink alcohol and taking Baclofen...I hope it helps you get over some temporary hump but Hard work is still necessary to stop drinking....
