* The close friends & family who knew I have had an issue for a while and are happy about my current sobriety.  They have my back...* The friends & family who just don't understand why I need to be sober.  I've been to events gatherings and places within the past year without being a mess.  Is it really an issue or are you just looking for attention?  ..* The friends and family who know I have had an issue but are still angry at me for something I did or said.  Maybe one day I'll list the reasons but they all start with alcohol so why bother?  ..* Drinking buddies who know the struggle and are happy that I'm fading out of the scene...again.  In a few months I'll roll by the old spots to say hello.  If I'm feeling mentally up for it...* Drinking buddies who are assholes but fun to hang around while you're hammered.  No desire to catch up with them in the future. Who cares?..* Exes who I am now friends with who are happy for me.  They are basically just friends but an ex is an ex...* And of course Exes and flings who may or may not still hate me.  I could be an asshole and I certainly was one when I drank too much...Just a random list
