Just a quick rant about how a few people in my life see my drinking as not a problem at all.  After a two month long bender on wine (with a few sober days in there) I started getting the shakes yesterday around noon a mere 14 hours after my last drink.  My symptoms got progressively worse throughout the day excessive sweating racing heart anxiety etc.  I was talking to my sister who is also an alcoholic (but doesn't want to quit) and knows that I struggle with it.  She said I wasn't detoxing and it was coffee or "just something you ate!"  I ended up drinking two glasses of wine until the shakes went away (and actually stopped drinking at that).  She still didn't really think it was the booze...I just hate that so many people in my life refuse to acknowledge the negative effect it has on me.  I had 52 days sober earlier this year and my best friend (an ex heroin addict who lives a very clean life!) was like "But it's not like you're never going to drink again!" and encouraged me to have a drink with him even though he barely drinks.  How do you not understand how addiction works?..When I went to visit my other sister I told her I wasn't drinking because I have a problem with alcohol and I wanted to get through my break up sober and she literally bought me my favorite wine and vodka.  "Just in case."  (Somehow this strengthened my resolve to not drink.)..WTF is wrong with people.  It all comes down to personal responsibility but I wish my loved ones were more realistic about it all.  It's so nice to get on here and have people who understand it.  IWNDWYT!

Man I get where you're coming from.  Before I realized that I was addicted to alcohol I didn't understand addictions.  I just thought if you needed to stop something then just stop.  I've struggled long and hard and I have full sympathy for anyone with any addiction whether it be heroin alcohol meth or even pornography.  Its very hard.  We're with you.
I have decided that trying to get other people to understand my problem with alcohol is like trying to teach a pig to dance -- you get all muddy and you just annoy the pig...Now if someone says something stupid about alcoholism I just smile and say nothing. I tell myself that they can be stupid about it and they can pressure me to drink but they can't actually **make** me drink.
** I just want to second what @sfgirlmary wrote!!
When something is easy for you it is hard to grasp it being difficult for someone else.  Especially when it is not just easy but instinctual it can be hard to comprehend.  Like if you have asthma I have no tips for you on how to breath normally like I do.  I can't even explain how I do it.
