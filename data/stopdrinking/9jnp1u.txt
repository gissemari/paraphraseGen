i apologize in advance for the long post and the format as i am on mobile. i just need to get some thoughts out with some like minded individuals :)..i have always struggled with alcohol. my son was born almost 5 years ago. prior to my pregnancy for about 4 years (16-20) i was drinking large quantities almost every night. about a year before i got pregnant i also developed a pretty serious addiction to cocaine. when i found out i was having a baby i quit everything cold turkey - even smoking and coffee. ..after he was born i had a dark beer (to bring in the milk apparently this helps) and it was vile. when he was 6 weeks old he went to my moms for a sleepover so i could celebrate my sisters 19th birthday. i drank - but not much. over the next few months while i was still with his father we would have nights alone - averaging every one to two months. his father is an alcoholic and when we would go out i would always drink with him but moderately. i would be excited when we made it home by 11pm or 10pm or omg 9pm. can you imagine how much sleep we're going to get tonight?! i would also be absolutely disgusted by how drunk he would get how he would stay out til 6am then come home still drunk and this is the only time he would play with our son. shortly after we broke up my son had a seizure. it was around 6 in the evening and we had to rush to the hospital. he showed absolutely hammered. i ended up having to ask him to leave because of how belligerent he was. ..i thought i was out of the woods with my drinking. we broke up shortly after my son turned 1. for a little bit i was a social drinker only. going to hang out with friends once a month bringing a 4 pack of coolers partying hard once in awhile (birthdays the odd full weekend i had to myself)..then i started dating again. the absolute nervousness i would start feeling about meeting anyone new having sex with someone sober (even after knowing them for a few months) is what i believe made the drinking bad again. and once i started i couldn't stop. every weekend was a blackout drunk weekend. had some left over alcohol? drink it til it's gone. i was going into work hungover more times then i can count. the summer my son was 3 was one of the worst ones. whether he was home or not i was getting drunk. my neighbour was an addict in every sense of the word and her and i would buy boxes of wine and spend all week drinking them out back while the kids played.  i once got so drunk i blacked out and puked while my 3 year old was in bed with me. i decided then to look into aa and give drinking a rest - not quitting but a rest. my son started school and i had calmed it down in a sense - drinking all weekend turned into just friday night and maybe once or twice during the week. ..i started dating a new guy about 9 months ago. he has some anger issues he needs to workout and i don't like the way he talks to the kids. throughout our whole relationship he wanted me to quit drinking. he noted that the first 3 months of our relationship he rarely saw me sober unless i slept over but then he just saw me hungover. we went out july 1st where i bought and drank a mickey of vodka myself. i ended up crying myself to sleep because i didn't want my son to remember his mom always drunk because it was a weekend - or it was nice out. ..the summer he was 4 (this summer) was a bit better but not great. aside from what i considered casual drinking 2 incidents stand out to me from this summer. 1. we had a bbq at my boyfriends house that i blacked out at while my son was there. and 2. (although less severe but this is what really opened my eyes and this date was my last drink) i hosted a baby shower for my best friend. one of the prizes was 2 bottles of wine and a wine glass which no one won. after everyone left at around 2 pm my friend stayed and helped me clean up and we each drank a bottle of wine within 2 hours again while my son was there. ..nothing bad happened i didn't even get that drunk. i was browsing reddit and came across this sub. and it hit me that my drinking wasn't normal. i have done everything right since getting pregnant - i have a great job a cute little home my son is listened to and we have fun i have a nice savings account and an resp for him. but how many mornings were wasted hungover? what was i doing to my body drinking this much? what did i say or do in a black out in front of my son?..today is 20 days sober. something i'm consciencely thinking of and taking seriously. ..i have come to some realizations - good and bad. .-people react really weirdly when you tell them you stop drinking. my mother has managed to make this all about her and her feelings as well as constantly pressing for a week and a half as to why i've stopped. .-i was never not getting enough sleep i was just always drunk/hungover/recovering. i have never felt so refreshed in my life. .-i do have self control when it comes to other aspects of my life! ie; work routine eating .-i don't want to be with my boyfriend. my stepdad was a monster and i spend a lot of time thinking of how different my life would have been had my mom left him. my son doesn't like my boyfriend and i don't want to repeat this cycle.-raw emotions: to the above point. if i'm going to date again there's no alcohol to mask my nervousness. further i'm sad about the break up i can't get drunk to mask that. i have to deal with these things head on. .-i used to use alcohol to hide behind saying or doing stupid things but surprise! i've done and said way less stupid things sober.-i'm becoming the sweet and considerate person i was a long long time ago again. i'm not as irritable my mind and memory is clearer i am patient and happy again. ..

Well done on your 20 days and your looking out for your son via not repeating the cycle. It sounds like you're on your feet to battle through. Take the dating thing one day at a time or put it off for a bit.
