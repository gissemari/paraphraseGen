I don't even know what to say anymore. Last wednesday would've been my 12 year sober anniversary had I not relapsed a few months ago. Since I relapsed I think the longest I've made it was 7 days. I'm riding the narrowest possible line of not screwing up everything in my life. And waking up every morning with this horrible anxiety/hangover/doom feeling I know you all know so well...I don't want to feel this way anymore. .So this is day 1 again. I'm so glad you all are here. I'm going to a meeting this afternoon and I'm not going to drink today. .

&gt; I'm riding the narrowest possible line of not screwing up everything in my life...I hadn't thought about it like that until you just said it.  This best describes what the last few years of my drinking were like.  I had described it in the past like juggling chainsaws that were starting to move away and were harder to keep under my control.  But riding the narrowest line... being on the edge of a cliff.  And constantly wobbling but somehow not falling off...The stress of that time in my life is indescribable and still makes me feel anxious...It's such a relief not feeling like i'm centimeters\^wmillimeters away from losing it all...Good luck.
Best to you in your struggle. Getting and remaining sober may be more difficult in some ways for alcoholics in your situation than for those who are brand new to sobriety. ..
