Having horrible urges to drink today. Massive struggle. Feeling very emotional and down only 11 days in from my previous best of 274. Starting to doubt I am cut out for this. Sorry

I'm having a crappy day too. Let's both hang in there.  
What I would ask myself in that sort of situation is: When I wake up tomorrow will I be glad I drank today? ..I've never not once gotten up in the morning and wished I'd gotten drunk the night before. That's payment enough for any struggle I might encounter.
Today is a  hard one for me as well...But I will make it...Hope you will as well !
On days like this I tend to shut myself up in bed and hang out there until it's time to go to sleep. Soda and binge watching tv shows really help me here. I've relied quite heavily on drinking fizzy drinks to replace alcohol and it does abate some of the craving. The tv helps me get to a different level of oblivion that still works for me. ..Some days just really really suck though but there's strength in solitude and isolation. You don't have to worry about other people and can focus on getting yourself through to another day. ..You'll be alright just hang in there buddy. We're all here with you.
