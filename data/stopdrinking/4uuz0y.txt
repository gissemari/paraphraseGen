I have only been to 3 meetings and I'm really really trying to have an open mind but I'm sincerely struggling with the tone of the 12 by 12. In two of the meeting I've attended they've read the 12th and 11th step. I was honestly repulsed by all the God talk. I'm trying very hard to see past it..That being said outside of the readings the comments have been truly helpful. I never realized how many people feel the way I do at my darkest. That makes the meetings worth it to me..One phrase said in comments will not leave my brain......"You don't have to be the villain of your story anymore"

Whenever I see "God as we understand Him" I always substitute that phrase for "Higher Power."  And my higher power is not anything supernatural or metaphysical.
Have you looked into the SMART program?
I guess my feeling is that sometimes the medicine that I need tastes awful but I take it anyway because it works and I want to get well. Meeting other recovering alcoholics irl has been extremely helpful and hearing their stories and thoughts has made me think about what can happen if I start drinking again...Also I don't know what size city you're in but my mid-sized city has over 300 different AA groups. They vary in their degree of "God talk".  Maybe ask around and try meetings in different parts of your city if possible.  I found one that is quasi Buddhist so they are just more open minded and their closing is a group recitation of some positive thought instead of a prayer.  ..Good luck to you no matter which set of resources and supports you choose!
I look at it in these terms: [Take what you need and leave the rest](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4j5mup/the_night_they_drove_old_dixie_down_take_what_you/).
