I am drunk right now last night I was just watching "Independence Day" on this forum trying to stay focused on something else than alcohol. I was just going to bed when the phone rings around 11:30 pm it was a good friend who needed a ride home and was very drunk I felt sorry for her picked her up and yes oh fucking yes I bought a case of beer.... what was I thinking? Long story short  we drank the case of beer as well a bottle of tequila she had in her purse last night and 36 more beers today!..I just  keep on thinking wanting to hit the reset button I've done it before the reset button where I just start over a totaly new life with a new job in a new house new friends new country......... what's stopping me now to do this reset as I've done it many times before?!? A nagging wife who will keep me on track since my divorce --and yes because of my drinking-- things have been down going out of control. ..Three DUI's in 3 different countries people tell me that just means I've traveled but really to me just means I'm an alcoholic no matter where I am...Sorry I am just ranting!..**sigh.... reset and back to square one.

The whole big reset thing ... I get it. I'm currently living in my third country third CONTINENT in six years. Guess what your problems will go with you until you address them head on
You have the desire to change and you have the tools. So what are you going to change this time to make it stick? Keep in mind there is no right answer. Hell I'm back on day one. But you have to change something and learn where you went wrong. Good luck! 
Since prior attempts have failed I suggest a totally different approach is in order. If you do the same thing you have evidence it doesn't work.
