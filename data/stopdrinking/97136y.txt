I just accepted a job offer because my previous place of employment was a slippery slope back into a relapse.  Unfortunately due to background check delays my start date had to be pushed back a week.  If this had happened 5 or more months ago I would have given myself the green light to go get wasted for a whole week.  Instead I'm doing the right thing by eating healthy continuing to get organized going to AA meetings and catching up on some sleep and Netflix.  Progress not perfection!  IWNDWYT!
