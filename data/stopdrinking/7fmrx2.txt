What kind of dangerous?
Not sure what you mean by "dangerous".  Can you explain a bit more?..For me the most dangerous thing that's happened is experiencing my own emotions -- which I've successfully (?) avoided for quite some time now.  Having to learn to be comfortable with uncomfortable feelings.
Yes this happens to me  I think it's a combination of things.  I feel so good I start wanting to drink again  I have so much energy I don't know what to do with myself  and I am now out of my comfort zone I have been living in for so many years.  It's self sabotage.  For me I have to learn to live with out dulling down my brain/personality.  ..Find something to do.  Hit up a Meeting if your board if anything AA is entertaining.
