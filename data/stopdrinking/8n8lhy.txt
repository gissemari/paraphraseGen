I was listening to a Refuge Recovery podcast the other day and the speaker said your mind has no bottom \-\- your brain has no permanent landing place.  It really struck me both as a person who cannot handle moderation \(there's no bottom /enough when it comes to drinks\) and as a person who struggles with anxiety \(there's no magic circumstance or destination that I can land on that will finally make everything feel calm and still\). I can struggle forever and ever trying to find some magic place of enough knowing deep down it doesn't exist drinking along the way to block out the discomfort and dissatisfaction of not having "landed" there yet. Or I can accept that I'm not ever going to stop falling and finally land and have permanence and control because even if those things exist in external life there is no place inside my mind that's going to agree that I'm "done" or "arrived. Dammit! It really \*is\* just accepting and inhabiting the journey. So I am left with this:  If I'm traveling drunkenly and in struggle it will feel like falling all the way down. But if I'm traveling healthfully and with awareness? Maybe I instead of just falling sometimes I can fly.

Good points!..What I've worked on is shifting my emphasis.  ..I have three main operating domains: my head my body and my heart...I tended to operate from my head....my thoughts my thinking my cognition.  My body came next....usually indulging the thoughts urges and wants from my thinking most around my self centeredness.  My heart came last....  thinking about being caring and kind to others....  the opposite of  self ...Alcohol encourages living in my head.  Thinking pondering analyzing rehearsing reviewing considering what ifs what could and what shoulds.......Those are not  Real .  My cognition is not subject to the laws of physics are not bounded by constraints of time and have no corporeal manifestation...That's how I get in trouble...I want to live fron my heart...I had to use my body to intercede through Action...Whadda ya think?
