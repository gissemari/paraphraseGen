REALLY had a stressful day yesterday. But talked it out with my wife and everything is good now. Just one of those days if the armor wasn't up and the support wasn't there don't know if I would have made it to day 54. Thank God for small favors and for watching over me and my family. And for watching over all of you and your individual struggle. Keep up the good fight. God bless you.

Thank you.  Back at ya!  Are you old enough to remember the group Midnight Star?  Used to love the song ( No parking on the Dance Floor). #memories :)
Kudos for 54 days! I didn't have a spouse in early recovery so am grateful for my therapist and AA. [The internet didn't exist back then.] They got me through many stressful days. 
Glad you were able to talk it out.  Congrats on 54 days!
