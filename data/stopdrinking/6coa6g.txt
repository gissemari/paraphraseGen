I have always had a terrible habit of looking at life as 'all or nothing'...  In my younger years that phrase was burned in to everything I set my mind to: my schooling  appearance social life and eventually my drinking.  . I weighed my successes and failures on other people's scales and It never occurred to me how self-destructive and emotionally stunting this form of "perfectionism" could be.  ..Struggling with sobriety for the past year has been F*$king humbling.  I honestly thought it would be easy. .. Step one: don't drink.  Step two: repeat.  How hard could it be?  ..Sobriety Like walking is one foot in front of other.  ..Sobriety also like walking requires you to be fully present to look before you step.  Failing at this seemingly simple task has shown me that I'm a adult toddler.  I'm shaking babbling and learning how to truly listen.  I'm struggling to match the correct pieces to their corresponding shapes but with patience and persistence I'm bound to figure this out.   .  .I'm not proud of where I've been but I'm thankful for what this journey has taught me:  Alcohol takes ALL and gives NOTHING. .. It is essentially an emotional cash advance; you borrow happiness from tomorrow (with interest) to give today a fleeting boost.  ..Here's to a sober morning.  .

Very well put! ..I was just thinking about "all or nothing" the other day. Trying to figure out ways to explain my situation without really *explaining* my situation. I came up with "For me it's all or nothing with booze. And for everything good in my life... it has to be nothing". ..Sober on! 
"It is essentially a cash advance...." that's gold. Props to you. I will not drink with you today.
I really like that first step - don't drink! Thanks for sharing this :).
