I have been reading here a lot and I see many of you are just like me.  I have been struggling for years.  I am more of a binge drinker I guess.  I go on a bender maybe for a day or 2 but then I tell myself I am going to stop followed by 2-3 days of guild and extreme depression.  Then I tell myself "oh it will be fine just go for a few it will be different this time.  Well Sunday i tied a good one on and I have been in bed for the past 3 days with extreme depression.  Today I got out of bed and started making calls.  I think I have found a really strong out patient program.  I am hoping I dont get fired for the missing the past few days however I have an FMLA in place for some other health issues so I think my doctor can recognize this is all related.  Im rambling so...tomorrow I have a call scheduled with my benefits group at work and I am expecting a call from the out patience program to get admitted ASAP.  Seems EXTREMELY hard to say but I feel excited about all this.  Of course I am EXTREMELY nervous about work and not getting paid for a while but I will figure it out I guess.  Thanks for reading my rant.  Any feedback is welcome!.

I'm so glad you're going to get help.  I just returned to work this week after a 30 day rehab and extended leave of absence.  It was one of the best things I've done for myself in life.  I'm now in a evening outpatient program and it's very helpful on this journey.  
I did a 5 week outpatient program this summer and I'm so glad I did. I'm coming up on 4 months sober for the first time in a decade. My advice would be to really go all-in while you're there; be completely honest put it all out there do the work. You won't regret it. Best of luck! You've already taken such an important step!
