With me I've noticed every time I get sober its just a bit easier each time. And I'm a bit better. ..I guess a downside is I have noticed I get a bit more better at hiding it from those who love m. ..Let's have a good day guy! I won't drink with you today xoxox

When I look back at all the times I "quit" I realize there is one flaw that existed in my thinking: I left the door open to the possibility of moderation. I wasn't able to quit for good until I closed that door and locked it. I had to embrace the fact that moderation was not an option. The only way I could control alcohol was simply not drink it. I have not relapsed since I changed that mindset.
This is clearly a drunk post and I'm not drunk just cranky now. Not helpful.
