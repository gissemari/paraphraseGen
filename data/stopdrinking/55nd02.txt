I don't drink everyday but when I do its always a blackout type deal. I'd like to stop but I struggle with it a lot. I've tried AA and it doesn't work for me. I really don't want to go back to it. I may try something different. Frustrated and embarrassed by my behavior but it's difficult to be around it when everyone can be fine and I turn into a crazy person. Feel like a failure. .

Keep trying different tools until you find one that works. I got therapy and joined Refuge Recovery. Best wishes.

I found a combo of cognitive processing therapy. Gabapentin and reading books like this naked mind has helped a lot. My problem was cognitive dissonance. Conscioualy I desired to quit drinking. I had to clue in my subconscious on that fact.
Im going to check out refuge recovery. Thank you for the advice ! 
I was the same way - a weekend blackout drunk. Took me a few times until I got it right. Don't be too hard on yourself - just move forward :-)
