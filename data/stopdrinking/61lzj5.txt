So it's been over a month since I've had a drink and I've been struggling with the disappearence of my usually great libido. Has anyone else struggled with this? Does it return to normal? I'm sorry if this is a dumb question but this has been really hard for me (and my SO). Thanks.

I have had this problem a bit too but I think it's just general overwhelm from emotions frankly.  Libido sortof gets trumped by the rush of other emotions coming back.
I'm going through this also. I'm feeling like my brain is working on repairing itself. I'm going to go ahead and give me time to reestablish my normal. Lord knows I'm repairing years of damage. 
Mine is starting to come back. I think like everything else with Recovery it takes time.
