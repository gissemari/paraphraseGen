Waiting at an airport coming back from a work meeting. Very stressed about work right now but have to remember to give myself a pat on the back. ..Thanks to everyone here for sharing all your struggles and successes and for listening to me when I needed it. This sub has been an immense help at times. ..Hopefully the next few days go well and I can get back to feeling more content but no matter what I won't drink with you today.

**CONGRATULATIONS!!!** 
A year is amazing! Congrats and give yourself a treat today!
Something that helps me with that is in a nutshell the concept of the 3 'yous'; past present and future. Be grateful to past you for doing awesome shit like not drinking for a year! Give presents to future you like looking after yourself and your mental and physical wellbeing. Make all the 'yous' your best friends. I'm not always good at remembering the concepts or acting on them but I feel much more happy and peaceful when I do..I'm not drinking with you today my friend.
Congratulations!
Congratulations on one year!! That's a huge feat :)
Congratulations! That's huge
