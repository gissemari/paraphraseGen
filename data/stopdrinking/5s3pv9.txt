Very hungover but day one of attempting to be sober. I need to stop drinking as I can't just enjoy one I have hurt myself and put myself in danger many times through drink it has affected my self esteem and health hurt and upset people who love me and it really isn't the way to deal with my everyday struggles or feelings. I hope being on here will help me and remind me not to.
