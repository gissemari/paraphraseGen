Anyone getting tired of your brain's wonderful ideas? I've been doing fairly well so far but yesterday I was early for picking up the kids and boom! out of nowhere ten dancing lightbulbs went on in my head. They could have said go get a coffee or sit in the sun or browse the book store but nooo they said this is the perfect time to pop by the liquer store and get just a small bottle to keep in the closet and take just a small sip whenever the mrs is occupied elsewhere...Now *I* know this is a terrible idea. But my brain and my whole body actually lit up like I d won the lottery leaving me jittery and torn even now the day after. After ten years of struggle I m still surprised at how deep this goes. Pardon my French but #$%&amp;!!!

My brain will lie to me.  That little alcohol devil will withdraw from the main stage when I'm "in my willpower".  But it's lurking!  It's patient!..It knows vigilance is difficult for humans.  We're just not good at it!..That's why I enlist support.  Alcohol can defeat me alone.  It can't defeat all my supporters!  
Oh non! Putain de cerveau! That last is "damn brain" in French btw. Next time it tells you that nonsense you go sit in the sun!
