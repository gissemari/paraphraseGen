*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---.If there is no struggle there is no progress.  ~Frederick Douglass .

Good morning and happy Friday sober folks! Not drinking with you all today.
Checking in. This weeks been a tough one a lot of self doubt and self loathing but if I drink alcohol I will make it a whole lot worse. So today I pledge not to drink. Just for today. And to try and worry about the other days when they come...Have a great weekend SD keep up the good work.
Friday. I'm gonna make you my bitch. No drinking today 
Thank god for Friday! It's been a long exhausting rewarding week. My day today is back to back to back. With three items due today before the end of the day a new employee who started yesterday and still working on managing both my old role and my new role. And in the process of merging my emails (personal and work) to my phone I 'unread' all of my email and they are all blended together with the read mail. My organization system is to keep it unread until complete. I've been so busy that my inbox is full of both. Not a HUGE issue but I'm going to have to clean up my email to find the outstanding work. Ugh. ..But I get to see my son tomorrow! Woohoo!..So I will not drink! 
And Here We Go: It's Friday and I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.  Thanks SD.
I have to laugh a bit because I am sick and keep thinking wrf? To think I was sick everyday after drinking. I will not drink today.
30 days! I'm proud of myself. I will not drink today.

I will not drink with you all today! It feels pretty good to be sober (and hydrated).
Been drinking for 10 years at an unhealthy level and because of this my girlfriend broke up with me last week. I'm glad I found this sub this is the encouragement I need in my life to finally change. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today no matter what.  I remind myself that a feeling is just that it is not an action and it will quickly morph into a different feeling.  There is no need to get wrapped up in this one feeling and create a story around it.  It is a feeling and that is all.
I will not drink today.

Hi everyone. I'm not drinking today.
I really want a fucking drink today. I'm so anxious and I know I'll find some sort of relief by giving in but it'll be very short-lived. This is the cycle I wanted to break out of by quitting alcohol so I'm not going to have a drink. I'd rather wake up anxious and sober tomorrow than wake up surrounded by empty bottles and regret.
Ooikoyy
I will not drink today. I look forward to not having to spend Saturday recovering from Friday "happy hour"!
I will not drink today.

Oh I was tempted- first to celebrate something positive and then because of the "fuckits" about something vexing...But I did't for either. So i'm glad to check in..Perfectly capable of being a grumpy whinging old so-and-so without the help of drink thank you.

I'm still here thanks. Sadly it's 2am here and I've not managed any sleep yet despite being so tired earlier!  Hoping I'll sleep soon :)
Not drinking today
Up at 3 am flew to west coast forgot to check in went to open bar.  Did not drink today.  Won't forget check in Saturday. 
I didn't drink today just like every day the last 5 weeks. This is twice the length of the longest stretch I have had in 20 years. Not every day has been easy. I have started every morning by telling myself that I will not drink today. I do not get out of bed until I make that very promise. I will not drink with you tonight. 
[removed]
I believe this is truly the beginning of my permanent sobriety.  I am currently very hungover anxious regretful and generally feeling bad.  I want to nay NEED to stop for my physical and mental health.  ..I will not drink today.  See you all tomorrow. 
 No drinking for me today! Going to get a good nights rest for a productive and fun filled Saturday with my lady.
Just checking in for Friday... albeit 9:35 pm. I did not drink today. Good night!
Still not drinking.  Thanks everyone and hang in there.  It's worth it
I did not drink today and I will not drink tonight. 
today I did not drink not just because I chose not to but because I proactively took steps to ensure that I didn't. These steps were not just taken today but yesterday and the day before....each day sober allows me a better foundation for the coming day..
First drinking dream last night. Turned it down..I will not drink Saturday night  
I will not drink today. Day one again.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
Count me in today!
