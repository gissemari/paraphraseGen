I'm new here. I've been a heavy drinker since I was about 17 (12 years) and it's slowly ruining my life. I blacked out again last night and apparently verbally abused my gf in my sleep. This isn't the first time it's happened. I am weak. It's not just alcohol though. Weed codeine even cough syrup when I was younger. I just don't know how to be sober and function in life... Just wanted that off my chest.

Seek out some local AA meetings.  Ease your way in.  Your certainly not alone
I went to one once years ago. I was there for half an hour and it was basically just a church sermon. I am not religious so struggle with that side of AA.
This sub has been useful to me.  I don't do meetings though I know they help a lot of folks.  There are other types of meetings too.  .When I was ready to stop I read everything I could get my hands on about recovery.  I started to learn about my addiction so that I could conquer it..It's work but for me it has really been worth it.  I check in here everyday to read and sometimes to post.  I feel like this is my meeting.
