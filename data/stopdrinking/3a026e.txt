Been sitting here reading and getting caught up on all the posts. Really enjoying and benefiting from everyone sharing their dayslives thoughts and sobriety. I have had a few really pleasantpeaceful days. It is really nice when my head just leaves me alone free from the drinking thoughts and all the other self criticizing and negativity that i am capable of. I relapsed after 13 plus years of sobriety and it has taken almost ten years (wow) to get 44 days of continuous sobriety. That being said I have felt as stable and centered in the last few days than i can ever recall feeling in those 13 years. Other than growing older and more mature I cannot really explain that. I don't need to figure it out either just gonna enjoy this moment and accept it as a gift. Tomorrow will be a brand new day and I will deal qwith it appropriately. Will I think about drinking? Don't know but being alcoholic and having used alcohol as a solution for so many problems and feelings a coping mechanism it would not surprise me. I just have to remember I am not my thoughts. Thank God...
