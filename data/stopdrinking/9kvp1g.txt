I have 27 days without alcohol which is great. I remember struggling with 4 to 5 days and then relapsing a lot before I had a solid streak of 100+ days. I hope to now just keep on going this time like I did then. The thing I dislike about this whole thing even though ultimately I'm to blame is the constant paranoia of being scared of relapsing all the time. I keep to try myself busy and take it one day at a time but yet I never really feel proud or sure of my sobriety. It's difficult but I suppose it gets easier after a while...I did smoke weed twice this week though. Not sure why as I didn't really enjoy it and I had quit for a while. I rationalised it as 'something to take my mind off alcohol and you deserve it for your streak' but I now feel and am more commited to being 100% sober. Substance use is just not for me and I've had enough for multiple timelines. I hope to have many more sober days.

Congrats. Weed is helping me a lot too I'm planning on quitting that eventually but I'm giving up alcohol and cigarettes right now so I just need something to distract. But yeah 100% sober is an awesome goal. Fun to see how much better it gets. Can quit caffeine sugar etc at least a bit and your mood will keep rising
I like 100% sober. I've been not drinking longer than I've been 100% sober and I like the 100% sober better. Mostly. Some days it is still hard though...Congrats on 27!
You're right it does get better and after a while fear of release is background nois3.
