Hi everyone. I'm 18 and I have been drinking for about 2 years now. Ever since I have started I had a bit of a problem with blackouts. When I'm out drinking with friends (we usually drink Wodka) I almost always don't remember half of the night. I don't really drink that much I don't pass out I go back home normally go to sleep and everything should be fine but when I get up in the morning it is quite usual that I don't remember coming back home etc. My friends tell me that I hadn't been that drunk and that I had looked completely fine. It worries me a lot because I don't drink more than my friends and none of them experiences something like that. So here is my question - is there something I should be worried about? I have been struggling with headaches a lot for the last couple of months and I'm worried that It may be related.

This isn't a great place for medical advice; only your doctor can do that...However -- alcohol related blackouts are something to worry about.  Trust me.  No two people will have the same reactions to alcohol so judging your sobriety against theirs isn't really going to tell you very much.  Also their perceptions of your sobriety are really more related to a.) how close they were paying attention and b.) how sober they were...If you're posting here it seems you may think you have a problem or at least the beginnings of a problem.  The one big question I have is when you go back home are you driving?  Do you remember how you got home?  Are you sure you're being safe?..
