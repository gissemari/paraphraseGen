I can see that 1 year marker in the distance...Just so this post doesn't mean anything... Yesterday was very tough for me I feel hated by a lot of people at my workplace. Its been an ongoing thing for a while that I brought on myself to some extent. Anyways I was upset at work went to a meeting came home and still felt down. I went to bed and today just feels good because its a brand new day and I got through yesterday. ..Trust me guys its worth it just to push through the struggle because tomorrow might be easier.
