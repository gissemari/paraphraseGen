Still sober just going through a pretty rough spurt.

When I feel like that I just go to sleep. Waking up without the shame/guilt/sickness/fill-in-the-blank-awful symptom....worth every extra minute of sleep! Kudos to you IWNDWYT
I'm a pretty quiet and reserved fellow but I really find it helps to share my troubles with the wise folks around here.  We are all in this together and there's always someone who can relate. Stay strong and know that it will get better
I can feel that. Rough patches suck. It will pass. I just got out of one. Sometimes I'm just fighting and trying to be an adult but the thing that helps me get out of the slump is treating myself and doing something I enjoy. We often burn ourselves out working too hard and a break is what we need.
140 days is nothing to throw away. Hope you find the strength to get through this. I'll urge you to do whatever it takes - sleep eat something sweet go for a walk attend an AA meeting during this time to tide you over and keep you away from the bottle. Good luck friend. Wishing you strength and peace. IWNDWYT
