I know this isn't Reddit SD-related but our son (5 years old) is relapsing in his Nephrotic Syndrome and is very sick. I wish I had a rosy update but he isn't doing well and I need prayers/good thoughts please. ..I wish I had a good staying-sober story for myself...and that is why I haven't posted here in a while. I will probably reset my badge when I feel strong enough to stay sober...but right now...I can't. I will be in the hospital with our son for a good week at least...so I will be dry for that long at least. Wish me luck too...I hope the withdrawals aren't too bad...Thanks SD. :(..If this is inappropriate then I understand. I just need support as I am going through some bad stuff right now. ..~LG

I am so sorry to hear that you guys are going through this. Good luck and good thoughts and keep us updated. 
Best wishes for you and your son.

Pro-Tip: You can be there for your son and be much more supportive and effective if you're sober...Drinking will likely make things worse for EVERYBODY...You're asking everybody here to do something for your family (and we will) but we're asking *YOU* to do something for your family as well...Stay sober. Good luck and good vibes to your son.
You have my prayers...If you feel like you need to drink then drink. But know that it is a tried and true fact that you will be able to be there for your son in a much better way if you just white knuckle it...Each morning look at your kid on the hospital bed and just tell yourself you won't drink for that one day. Then reassess the next day. You can do that right? You told me earlier you could make it just one day.
