This summer I have experienced all of the above activities (and more!) Without alcohol AND...I have been having FUN!!   It is honestly not even a temptation anymore.  I was with a group of people at a concert this weekend and everyone was drinking.  I happily took on the role of designated driver and watched them shell out $10 + for each drink while I stayed hydrated with my free water.  For anyone struggling or just starting out just keep trying.  It IS possible to escape the firm grip of alcohol.  You just have to choose to not drink today.  I know it's hard to believe that in the beginning those first couple of months feel so long but before you know it you will be free.  And freedom feels amazing!!!!

Good for you!  It's true just take it one day at a time and before you know it you have a good chunk of sobriety under your belt. 
Thank you very inspiring- Many of us need to hear that life is so much better when alcohol is not a part of it. Thanks Again! IWNDWYTD
