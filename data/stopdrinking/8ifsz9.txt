Well ladies and gents...the big 6 months is on Saturday.  That's the first 5 months and 3 weeks congruently sober in 17 years for me.  While the newly acquired mental clarity and the inescapable life challenges have been daunting to say the least. I can positively say I am in a better place and a better person for it.   A very sincere thank you to all of you that share here.  It's continuously reminded me that I am not alone with these feelings and struggles.  Many a times I have wanted to relapse but a personal story on here has turned me around in the right direction.  Thank you more than you know.  ..Now.  My friends are busy.  My wife's going to be out of town.  Any solo ideas on celebrating?  I'm at a little of a loss for ideas....

A weekend getaway using all the money you didn't spend on alcohol ;)
Well considering a year is "cake day" .... pie/ice cream?..Honestly I would prob hit up a theme park a hiking trail tattoo....... kinda an adrenaline junkie over here but yeah I would do something I  have been wanting to do but for whatever reason (drunk money ride etc) just hadn't done it yet. I like outside so healthy food prepared back pack &amp; hit up the lake/springs/beach.
Massage or any other way of pampering yourself?
Digging the tattoo idea.  I have tons already.  What's another one??..Adrenaline junkie here too.  Unfortunately the weather is going to be shit here this weekend but I dig that idea too!  Maybe at one year!
I'm celebrating six months this weekend too yay! Have fun whatever you're up to x
Ohhh! I did one of those sensory deprivation tanks for my birthday it was super relaxing! It feels like you're floating and it puts your mind totally at ease. Check it out!!
Def going to check it out!  Thank you!
