Yeah something clicked for me around 5 months. I went from thinking about drinking every weekend to now where it barely crosses my mind. Don't get me wrong I still have cravings but those quickly vanish when I think about how much better off I am without alcohol. I was never a fan of aa but I recently found a group on campus with people around my age going through the same struggles as me. I finally found a group that I look forward to attending every week. I don't need to rely on SD as much as I used to but I love coming here for that extra support. You guys are awesome. Stay sober friends. It's well worth it.

Good job... I hope I can say the same one day.
Talking with other people in real life with the same problem is a great advantage.  Well done on your 6 mths!
congrats to you!
You are describing the sensation of being "released from the bondage of self" when you report that you describe not having to think about alcohol every weekend.  Thanks for describing your experiences at 180 days it helps others.
