I've been trying to quit since the beginning of the year but have relapsed multiple times since and finding it harder and harder to say "no I don't need that drink". Sometimes I'm successful and feel really good about myself and other times I'm not and I feel like shit...I decided to drink 1 1/2 bottles of wine last night and having a hard time picking myself back up again because I just feel like I really let myself down. And I drank alone which I'm very ashamed of too...I'm curious for all you out there how do you recover from a relapse when you're finding it difficult to? ..Usually I've been pretty good at telling myself I'll be better next time or I'm even more motivated to not drink etc. Today though I'm finding it really hard to do that. Any thoughts?
