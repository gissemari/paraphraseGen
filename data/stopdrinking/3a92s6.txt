I remember it being my birthday this past December. I had plans to get my life together I had planned to cut out the drinking right after the new year. I made an ass of myself over christmas and swore of the bottle.. It lasted a few days a few months ago I tried again with the support of this subreddit. I made it a few days and I was doing well. The day I planned on going to my first meeting I relapsed. I'm still young Im just 22 but I am lost. I want to swear off alcohol I made it through the day but when it was time for my shift drink at work I thought well this will be my last next thing I knew I stopped at the liquor store and bought one of those 24 oz of redd's wicked apple and downed it before I went home to  my family. I recently moved home from my college town without my degree in hopes that living at home would help but it hasn't. I don't really know what to do anymore. Im sitting here coming down and contemplating going to a gas station and getting another tall boy... I am seriously depressed.. I think I need professional help but the thought of telling anyone is so embarrassing. I am an addict I used to laugh off my parents warnings of alcoholism..... I don't know this has been my only place of help and support.

I understand the embarrassment but remember this is not your fault. Alcoholism is a disease not a moral failing. The first step I took was telling people in real life what was going on with my drinking. The next thing I did was find other alcoholics that could help me and I've been going to meetings almost daily since. You are not alone and you don't have to be ashamed. It's good that your posting here. What the next small step you can take? You have the power to change your life.
&gt;telling anyone is so embarrassing..Fuck no. Dealing with the problem is brave and awesome...I'm over 50 and drank heavily at your age. Tell me what's more embarrassing: doing the same stupid shit for another 30 years or dealing with it now?..If you need help you need it and the only embarrassment is being too donkey-headed to get it. ..Can you get support from your parents? Ask for their help? Many here have had fear around this and been surprised by the love and support that family offers. ..You might have more support than you know and you might find a lot of relief in asking for it.
