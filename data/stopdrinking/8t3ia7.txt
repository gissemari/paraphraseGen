Recently I tried going back on birth control and went full psycho. Mood swings depression anxiety unhealthy behavior patterns all came crashing back in force for the first time since I got sober...Until this past month sobriety has just been roses and I was secretly wondering  this is too easy...I haven't really been tested yet ..Well I've been tested. I stopped the birth control and am feeling much more stable but for an entire month I rode the rollercoaster and did not relapse. I'm extremely proud and more validated than ever. That back of the head voice has been quashed because I now know when shit gets real I have enough of a grip to not drink and lose everything. ..This challenge has also highlighted some deeper work I've neglected regarding mental health and past traumas that I can now address...I guess the message here is if things are getting tough for you just hang in there. Drinking is not going help. And when you fight through the tough times clean and sober the victories are so much sweeter.

Great to hear you are doing well! One day at a time we can keep going. It will be worth it!
Stay strong. I had to go back on anti depressants at around 500 days. Being sober makes things easier but for me life still sucks shit a wholeot of the time.
