I have been a chronic relapser and I now am giving in to what they tell me to do in AA.  Get a sponsor okay okay i will get a sponsor i will read the big book and I will stop trying to do this on my own it didn't work my way now I will try a new way.  I'm done with the cheating the lying the stealing the puking the shameful walks to find my car the missing work the being repulsed by myself and terrified to ask what happened.  This thing is a beast and no one but the others who suffer from it can sympathize and that is okay at least there is a group of supporters out there who do.  Thank you so much for letting me declare yet another day one.  hope and pray it is my last.

I didn't get a sponsor until about 150ish days in.  I was feeling overwelmed and knew I needed someone else helping me.  It's been a slow move but more so I am using my sponsor as someone who is getting me connected to a bunch of other guys who are sober and giving me a group of people who I can talk to.  Last week Tuesday we meet for the first time and I got homework. we are starting the steps over again so Step 1 homework it was.  I think Having that extra step is nice.
