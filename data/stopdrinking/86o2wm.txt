I don't really talk about my sobriety with anyone outside sometimes my wife (not fishing for advice) but I do check in here pretty often to see how everyone's doing. This thread gives me strength especially when I read some of y'alls open accounts of struggling with this shit. Thanks for struggling forward with all of us here. Here's to the next 100 days one day at a time. IWNDWYT!
