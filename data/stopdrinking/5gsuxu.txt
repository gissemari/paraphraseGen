I have a holiday party to go to on Friday. It's for work but it's open bar and we usually head out after. This whole last week has been "can't wait to see you at the party" "shots shots shots". ..This party could do a lot for my career but also ruin what I've been working towards as far as not drinking. No one at work knows I struggle with drinking but I do have a rep as the "fun one". ..I'm thinking I should just bail on the party all together.

I just went through this last weekend I had a ginger ale a diet coke and water all night.  It was easier than I thought it would be...I got an invitation to go out after but I said I had a busy morning.  I worked out at 8:30am the next day.  Instead of going out I went back with my date and we had ourselves a very fun sober night
