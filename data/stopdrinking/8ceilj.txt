Hey Everyone and especially those with experience in AA. I would love some input advice thoughts etc. ..Last week was my first meeting and it was pretty stereotypical: 95% middle-aged working-class white men plus a couple women in their 60's and 33F me. It was also about 40-50 people and only had a couple of pre-arranged speakers. ..I was at my 2nd AA meeting last night. About 12 people LGBTQ-focused all ages and gender identities. There they brought up the question to the room at large "Is there anyone new here who is working on 90 meetings in 90 days?" I had raised my hand for their previous question identifying myself as new but I was just dumbfounded by that one about the 90 meetings. ..So I did research online about it this morning and I guess that's a common suggestion for people coming out of rehab and getting themselves reestablished in their lives while sober. So in that sense it sounds like a great idea. ..But I haven't gone to rehab. I've only started attending AA meetings because I was getting a little lonely and thought I could really use some sober friends that I could really be open and frank with about my past and my challenges. (Side note: I have told one of my best friends finally this week that I'm sober and she is 100% supportive but I also don't want to run to her with every craving conundrum or FOMO-frustration and burn her out in terms of being an emotional crutch). At over 90 days myself now I don't intend on going to rehab...So anyway this one woman who had been invited as the main speaker at the meeting talked to me afterwards gave me her number and seemed REALLY intent on getting me to go to AS MANY meetings AS POSSIBLE. She also wants me to call her every day until I get a sponsor. ..So far I've been enjoying the idea that I can go around and check out various meetings until I find a home group. But I wasn't planning on going whole-hog like this as I have a tendency to fizzle out on projects when I start off like that. I also think that working through a 12-step program would be really helpful in getting me to the root reasons why I drink and building up my spiritual support for life in the long-term. But I don't want to *rush* into getting a sponsor I don't want to *rush* the 12 steps and I definitely don't want to spend my few free hours each week attending meeting after meeting after meeting. Once a week commitments are hard enough for me to keep! ..I understand that this woman has probably seen many newcomers fade away or relapse unless they commit 100% early on and so she's trying to give me the best advice she can which is to follow the path that worked for her. I guess I was just wondering what other's perspectives on this were. Thanks! IWNDWYT

I can super relate to this (though you have a better/more understanding attitude about it than I did!) I wish I had been more assertive with my boundaries at and after meetings- no one I encountered was anything but supportive and clearly well-intended but I found the experience a little more stressful than I would have liked due to my own issues of people-pleasing (and being insanely busy with work and family!). I'd like to get back to meetings at some point with my new more confident self. I don't have anything else to share but like I said you seem to have a great approach so thanks for sharing!
In the beginning I was in danger from my rationalization when left to my own devices.  Also my feet were trained to take me to bar liquor store or beer aisle in the market.  Those days did not end well...Having a "safe" place to go.  Having a goal - get to the meeting broke those dangerous habits situations..  enabled me to stay sober for that day.... this was a big deal ..Like many "don't tell me what to do" is my middle name - I never did 90 in 90 - but sometimes I did 2 meetings in a row if I was still rocky.   I also took 9 months to get 90 days... - not recommended - I was lucky to come back...AA worked for me despite my having ALL the issues.  Still does though I go to about 3 meetings a week - meetings which I enjoy with a bunch of really interesting people.....&gt;I also think that working through a 12-step program would be really helpful in getting me to the root reasons why I drink and building up my spiritual support for life in the long-term.  **this is so true and the very reason AA works for those of us for whom it does.**..Finally sponsorship is not forever.  an interim sponsor may be a better way to start.  Trick is to find what you need.  Some folks need direction and respond to it.  Others need a less restrictive arrangement - some of my sponsees call me - some don't but then some of them have a great deal of time...
&gt;I've been enjoying the idea that I can go around and check out various meetings until I find a home group. But I wasn't planning on going whole-hog like this..You indeed can do this!  I checked out somewhere around 15 meetings when I first stopped.  I narrowed it down to about 6 after one visit.  Then I visited the 6 a few times narrowing it down.  I eventually settled on 2 that became my "Tribe".  ..As you noted each group is independent (for the most part) and each has a personality...There are indeed enthusiastic even zealous participants.  Mostly for three reasons - it probably saved their lives they've watched others including friends and loved ones die and finally "helping another person get sober" is both a service to another and a gift to the support person strengthening their own sobriety...I always return to this principle:  from the actual "How it Works" read at the beginning of every meeting - "these steps are **suggested** as a program of recovery".  ..I take the best and leave the rest...When I stopped I was desperate.  If my counselor had said "stand on your head and count backwards" I would have done it.  Instead she said "I think you should consider 90 in 90".  ..I wanted to be sober and end my misery.  I did 147 in 90.  It was what worked for me at the time...You have to do what works for you at the time...Here's a technique that works for me with "enthusiastic meeting participants who want to 'help' ":  ..I listen kindly to them.  I say "Thank you.  I appreciate you wanting to help me.  I'm here for support.  I want to take this at my pace.  I think you want to give me advice.  Let's do this as soon as I want some advice I will immediately ask you for it.  I want that to be OK with you."..
To me 90 in 90 serves two purposes: 1. Meet some sober people 2. Find a couple of meetings you like. ..As for calling daily my sponsor asked me to do that at first. The biggest thing it did for me was to get me used to reaching out to people and to be able to ask for help. That may be what that woman is trying to help you to find. Most of us struggle with that. ..All of this felt foreign and uncomfortable. I didn't like it one bit. I am glad that I did as asked though...As others noted this is YOUR sobriety. You have to do what's right for you.  But I would recommend that you step outta the box a little.  My own best thinking got me into a mess I had to borrow other's thinking to get out of it..And what's the worst that could happen if you did the 90/90 and made some calls?
I have done SD like my 90 in 90 - for the first 90 days also coming here on Saturday nights. I believe it really made a difference in terms of me sticking to my intent...It was only when I'd hit 90 and felt pretty solid on my own ability to do a sober saturday without visiting SD that I went back to not being online at all on Saturdays including the nights. And I have noticed that the very idea of drinking on a Saturday feels pretty strange and weird to me now and I look forward to a major book reading binge instead!..My "sober angle" here [an AA veteran] is kinda like a sponsor - I can ring or text anytime if I need to but haven't yet - we run into each other often enough here in town for me to check-in and get any advice I need and he's great for giving me ideas of how to progress my thinking about being sober that are based on AA. He says it also helps him when he talks about the process and lessons of sobriety [his Step 12 I think that is helping me]. ..Unfortunately getting to a meeting is just impossible for me due to my location and work/parenting situation so I'm grateful for the existence of SD and the wisdom of folks that have done or are in AA...
&gt;I understand that this woman has probably seen many newcomers fade away or relapse unless they commit 100% early on..I understand her perspective but I also wonder how many people just walk away from AA completely after the high pressure introduction and either return to drinking OR figure out a way to stay sober on their own. What works for one is unlikely to work for all. 
I think that for someone very newly sober 90 in 90 does kind of make sense in terms of helping to rewire subconscious thinking. I am not an AA member myself but I found great benefit from being here more than an hour a day for the first 100 days. For you now at 98 days yourself you have found your rhythm and I gotta say that for someone who struggles with boundaries too being able to recognize that 1) you are a people pleaser and 2) someone who tends to fizzle if they start out with too much gusto is AWESOME. That's a lot of self-reflective insight and I think you should be damned proud of yourself for recognizing those things...AA works like many faith-based systems. For those who have found success there it's a true belief. That makes sense! But that does not by any means mean that it has to become your true belief. Have you checked out SMART or Refuge Recovery? Maybe that'd help with the IRL connection?
My interpretation of the 90 in 90 is this: if you follow the idea as stated plus follow the advice given there   don't drink between meetings ... you get 3 months sober. In 90 meetings you'll hear a lot of things and meet a variety of people. It may take many meetings till you hear the right words on the right subject you never quite know what is going to resonate with you. Over the span of 3 months you'll recognize various people perhaps make a few friends. In 90 meetings you'll have a solid idea if you want to remain within the program who YOU would choose as a sponsor who's views and ideas make sense to you who you might want to hang out with in other avenues. The pros of all of this??? In the first few weeks you may struggle changing your habits a meeting gives you a place to be a sense of accountability. 3060&amp;90 days you get a coin if you choose to acknowledge it: there is a warm feeling when you make that walk and get that hug. One of the biggest benefits is : in 90 days you feel better both physically and mentally.... this takes some time. There is a huge difference between   not hung over  and   healthy  .  D.
Here are some suggestions based on my own experience. I was in AA for several years and am now involved with SMART Recovery as a facilitator...1. Try some different AA meetings. Some are not as zealous in their approach as others..2. Don't worry that you find this one woman's approach off-putting. Ignore her. She is offering you advice and just like the advice you get here you are free to accept as much or as little of it as you see fit..3. Do some research and see if there are meetings of other support groups in your area such as SMART Recovery or Refuge Recovery. These groups take a completely different approach from 12 step groups.  Give those groups a try as well. Be an informed consumer and know your options..4. Specifically regarding the 90 in 90 thing.  It's only a suggestion. So is the thing about getting a sponsor and home group right away. If anyone tells you that these suggestions are rules or that you will relapse if you fail to do them pay no attention. I didn't do 90 in 90 took my time about the other stuff and didn't remain in the program at all over the long term.  I know many folks who do great without ever stepping foot in AA. There are lots of people here who use SR as their sole support group. ..Welcome to SR.
Wow reading though your answers to the comments it looks like you and I have a lot in common. 1.) boundaries (or lack thereof). 2.) people pleasing. 3.) being ale to ask for help. Same same same for me all of it. Perhaps we can inspire each other to learn new ways of living.
