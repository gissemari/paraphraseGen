I stopped drinking again on Tuesday (can I ask for a badge reset on here?) he knew how important this was for me and also for us we came to the end of our tether and basically broke up on Monday. ..One of his issues was my drinking and how I just couldn't figure out when to stop. He was right and our relationship on the line in the most serious of ways made me finally steel myself to doing it for all kinds of good...He promised that all we needed is us and he's sit in and drink tea and watch movies with me and I could do it...And I'm doing it but I'm struggling and heartbroken...He went out with his friends and got blackout drunk instead of coming home to me on Friday Saturday and now tonight. We had special plans to cook tonight and watch a movie after I'd finished my weekend shifts.. and he's not here...All this may be inherent to recent relationship problems.. but I'm doing what I was asked and I'm trying so hard but I'm so sad right now :(..And he lost his phone drunk last night so I can't even tell him how much I need him right now...So here I am on another night alone with a fizzy orange cheers everyone.

Cheers &amp; I am sorry that your weekend got so messed up. You should still cook and do your movie for you! You deserve it - you have busted your ass and done what you set out to do. Treat yourself - hell get some take out and watch something he would hate if he were there. You my dear are a rockstar you survived this situation you kicked ass not only on a weekend but a holiday weekend!! &lt;3
Screw it just do you for tonight! Make something he wouldn't like and watch something he wouldn't like. Overindulge in your guilty pleasures (the good ones!)..I won't drink with you tonight.
i'm really sorry to hear that.  hang in there.  you are doing an incredible job sticking to your sobriety!!
