Just checking in post-kareoke sesh with a few thoughts and observations...First of all I got a lot of support and encouragement from some dear friends who have stuck by me for over a decade now drunkenness substance abuse and all. It was a huge contrast between my usual shenanigans yet at the same time felt completely natural. Being able to sing in front of a group without 'liquid courage' was a unique experience but I was able to stay alert and in good spirits for the whole night...The drinking ritual I would normally engage in was a real eye-opener- I mentioned this in the checkin post yesterday but I'd usually preload with a six-pack before heading out. One of my friends did that and boffed on the floor at around midnight. Realising that could have easily been me was a sobering thought if you'll excuse the pun. By the end of the night arguments and depression had set in with some members of the party... I realised that through the elaborate booze ritual performed most people had entered their own stereotypical drunken state of mind. It really made me wonder what mine is as it was very apparent that nobody was aware that they'd reached that state. At any rate it showed me that I can party hard and be just as charismatic with a microphone in my hand sober as I am drunk which is great news for my creative aspirations. Furthermore with a bottomless glass of water in my hand I felt no urge to drink... The only temptation I felt was when a Jagerbomb was passed under my nose. Felt a real physical pull but also pride in not caving...The best part was the admiration of one of my dearest friends who also struggles sometimes but more in a binging sense than constant drinking. He insisted that we have to spend more sober time together which I love because I know that I have friends who want to transcend their issues and continue to grow with me...Rambling post but I'm bloody tired and have a gruelling shift ahead of me. Hope everybody's well stay strong :)

Great accomplishment! And having supportive friends is perhaps the best asset of all. Sounds like you have a great opportunity to help your binge-prone friend also! Your story gives me a lot of encouragement to carry on.
It's good you have supportive friends but risky spending an evening where drinking is a primary activity...especially when your sobriety is so young. Alcohol should not be within arm's reach until you have established yourself in recovery. There's more to it than simply not drinking.
