I stopped drinking last Thursday.  I've been sober one week...This is the second time in ten years that I've been sober this long (the last time was nearly 2 years ago).  I'm waking up earlier and being productive earlier.  I remember the things I read at night.  I have more energy during the day.  On the downside I've always been prone to nightmares and going to bed drunk ensures that I don't have dreams of any sort.  So I'm having nightmares again...The last time I stopped drinking felt harder.  I *constantly* wanted to drink.  This time I check in here a few times a day and read inspiring stories from you folks figuring out how to stop doing this destructive thing.  And I read about the relapses.  And it reminds me that I don't want to drink...Anyway I just wanted to thank you all.  And to say that I won't drink with you today.
