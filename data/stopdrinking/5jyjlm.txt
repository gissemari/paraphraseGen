I couldn't stay sober without support. A therapist and AA did the trick. I also went to rehab and outpatient. AA meetings were a safe place where I met people who understood. Seeing sobriety in others gave me hope. I also made some new friends. Antidepressants don't work when taken with alcohol. 
Not drinking is doubly hard when we don't have things to fill our time.  And when we're feeling depressed its that much harder to get ourselves to do positive things to fill our time.  Too much free time can be a curse (as you well know)...You asked for suggestions.  I don't know that I have any magic bullets but here goes.  ..- Take small bites.  You won't turn things around overnight...- Get out of the house - anyplace that's not a bar...- Create a schedule for the next day each evening. Put every little thing you can think of in your schedule.  (Even simple things like picking up the mail taking a walk or an extended period of gaming.)   ..- Your schedule should have the exact time you will do something how long you will do it for and include plenty of 5-15 minute breaks for goofing off throughout the day.  Set alarms to keep yourself on track...- As much as you may not feel like visiting with people (depression can have that affect) make it a point to schedule at least one time each week where you do.  I schedule mine for sometime between Fri and Sun...Hope this helps.  Check back to let us know how it goes for you?..
Anti-depressants took about 6 weeks to kick in for me once I got sober. They do not work when you drink on them.

Same place as you my friend  im proud because ive never been able to do longer stretch before but still relapse after a week or two sadly.
For me I had to learn how my dependence on alcohol worked how my brain kept sabotaging itself. I read **This Naked Mind** and **The Biology of Desire** which broke down the science of addiction AND the cultural pressure to drink. Made a huge difference for me. ..Also anti-depressants can help but they take time. They also seem to work better with some support therapy to go along with it. A lot of us drink to hide from or numb ourselves to bigger problems....tackling those other issues make the "need" to drink less strong (eventually and with effort of course). 
I have to keep finding my triggers and pay attention. For me being alone is the start of it then getting LONELY. I am learning to notice when it starts and try things (SD IRC room Messenger to friends gym) to get myself off track before it gets bad. Where I live the stores close at midnight so if I can fight/distract until then when the craving hits afterwards it is too late to buy anything and I go to bed...I take Paxil and can attest that for me alcohol negates the positive effects and I become susceptible to my depression again as well. Keep trying don't give up and learn from each thing you do. It is like walking down a dark path you can't see the potholes but you CAN remember them and get a little further next time. :)
Do you drink caffeine or use nicotine at all?  I had the same problem where I'd get sober for like 10 days or so but then be hit with cravings out of nowhere.  I realized that my caffeine intake was way high and was giving me anxiety &amp; jitters which in turn made me want to drink.  Now I try to avoid caffeine completely and the boom and bust cycle of being sober has almost completely stopped (except for a relapse I had last weekend :(
