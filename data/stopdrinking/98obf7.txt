You got this ... stay on this sub.  It's here 24/7...Focus on not drinking  just for today ..And tonight you will be in your bed.  Be strong 
I'm right here with you. It's yet another Day 1 for me and I'm hoping this is the one that sticks. IWNDWYT   
"The weight of self discipline is much lighter than that of regret."..So dont let a fleeting emotion make you do something that youll regret later. Im on day 63 after a reset so i get it. But Im always proud of myself later when I realize I made it past that moment.

Thanks everyone you are all so amazing. Thank you for taking the time to be here for others   
I'm sitting right next to you in that rocky boat.  Hold on tight and we just might get through this together.
I was stuck to the couch all day from drinking last night. Don't give in it isn't worth it.
Hang on! There's no bad day I've found that drinking won't make worse. You can get through this sober. Sending positive thoughts your way! IWNDWYT
