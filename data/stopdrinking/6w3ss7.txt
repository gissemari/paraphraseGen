Just about through day 1.  Finally trying to settle down after hearing co-workers talking about going out and parties on the weekend. ..Tried reaching out for help but nobody picked up.  The struggle is real.

we're here! the first few days are tough. real tough. it gets easier. maybe try to find some local meetings? people are generally very welcoming and very quick to give out numbers. they're the good numbers to have.
Good on you! Anything I can do to help?
Me too! Just posted about it!..This is the first Friday night in almost a year I haven't drank in some capacity...I was never a rough-and-tumble blackout not showing up to work alcoholic (no judgments toward anyone) but I was probably heading there if I didn't change...How do you feel so far? Where's your head at?
One Day at A time.  .Whatever happens never give up on giving up comrade.
You got this!.One day at a time!.  
Thanks everyone. I made it through yesterday in one piece. Woke up feeling glad and wanting to keep it up; so started chores......Then SportsCenter started talking about the fights tonight and I realized I would be getting invites and such. Time to burn my phone.
