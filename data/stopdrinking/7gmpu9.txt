Hi everyone.I just stumbled onto this sub by accident a couple weeks ago I'd never even been on Reddit but my friend convinced me it was awesome. I know I'm new here but I'm needing just to connect somehow with people who understand what I'm dealing with. I drank heavily for a long time and not just to have fun I drank to deal with everything. It  was my first reaction bad day at work? Drink. Family issues? Drink. Any issue especially dealing with military life it didn't matter what I used alcohol to cope. When I got back from my last deployment I was really struggling with being in normal society again and I didn't know how to deal with everything that happened so I crawled inside a bottle and didn't come back out. My 2 weeks of R&amp;R I was drunk the entire time. When I got a couple weeks to go home I drank for the first week. We went out for my brothers birthday and I don't remember most of the night not until I woke up slumped over a diner table a few towns over no memory of how I got there or what had happened and a table full of cops behind us. Since we weren't bothering anyone they didn't arrest us and we weren't driving so there was no issue with that. It was a wake up call I was drinking so much I was having gaps in my memory and while I was trying to use it to cope it was making it even harder. That night I swore to myself that I was going to stop drinking. That was May 12 of this year. Lately I've been struggling I'm physically in constant excruciating pain from my back and knee getting messed up and the emotional issues that come from being physically trashed in my 20's and my family is MIA so I feel like I don't even have a home to go back too. My best friends know I'm trying to stay sober and they're really encouraging but I can't bring myself to burden them all the time. I want to crawl back inside a bottle but I know that'll be an awful road to be on again. Just needed to somehow tell someone who will understand.

I'm really glad you are here. Asking for support and getting it from this sub and the IRC chat made the difference for me this time. You can visit the chat here: ..https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.snoonet.org:+6697/stopdrinking..There is also a link in the sidebar. People are around 24/7. I may not have the exact same experiences as you but I've been terrified after waking up from a blackout not knowing where I am and felt the loneliness of my drunken isolation. It sucks but after a year I feel like a different person most days. You can absolutely do this. I won't drink with you today.  .. .
I may not be able to relate to the specifics of your situation but I can certainly relate to the inner struggle of drinking again vs knowing how awful it is for me...It sounds annoying to hear but I've found finding other concrete ways to relieve stress have helped me overcome cravings before. I know doing yoga has helped both my body and my mind...Stay strong. I won't be drinking with you today.
I find meetings are helpful.  You will probably find former military people in the rooms.  Thank you for your service.  I will not drink with you today.
Thank you for your courage to post!..There is a place in the world for you right here with us...Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?
