So I've been going to meetings the gym talking to my family more and eating regularly. My sleep is finally returning to normal. All good things.  No hangover. No more crippling anxiety and depression. ..I even got a job that I start in 2 weeks. All directly related to me finally stopping drinking. I really struggle at night. I used to be content watching tv all night and vegging out and getting smashed. ..I still love my shows but I can't stand sitting around for long periods of time.  I get so bored and now the boredom translates into anger. I never was an angry person. Now that I'm sober im bored and angry. I miss the excitement and chaos. I hate the emotional rollercoaster Im on...I don't want to drink but I'm not in a good mood. I used to smoke a ton of pot to call me down and I quit that as well. I don't have much money and I'm in the hole a little bit and waiting to start work again so I'm limiting myself on going out and spending money. I've completely isolated myself and I don't have any friends. ..I'm completely bored...End rant.

For me the boredom problem was really hard for the first few weeks.  Suddenly I had not only eliminated my main hobby but because I was sober I had suddenly gained even more time to fill.  I'm sure you already know that you've got to find new hobby to replace your old one.  In the meantime when you feel bored and angry maybe try cleaning and doing chores around the house?  Stuff like that helps me burn off my excess energy which turns to anger if I let it sit for too long.  Congrats on almost two weeks!
I have fairly extreme nighttime anxiety which sometimes becomes irritability/anger. Fun! Things that help:..* getting exercise during the day so that I'm more likely to be tired; if I'm really feeling irritable I exercise again (could just be a quick jog around the block).* taking a hot shower at night before getting into pajamas (I switched from being a morning shower person); this helps my body get ready for relaxation.* something to do *while* watching television/movies (sounds crazy but hear me out - try easy puzzle books coloring books or a craft-type-thing); this will help fully engage brain/body and you'll be more likely to have trouble paying full attention than feeling bored (it's...kinda like being drunk but a lot more productive).* nighttime ritual that you enjoy and look forward to; for me this is good chocolate + tea; it helps to have a food treat that I will enjoy even if I'm feeling grumpy..When you're going through hell keep going. It gets better. .
Early sobriety is the worst. I was livid for a few months at first... I did **not** want to stop drinking but my liver was done. I felt like I'd been sentenced to the shittiest most boring life ever. And to put up with everyone else's bullshit while sober?! Gross. ..But... all that funk started to lift around 3 months. By 4 months I was finally seeing that there could be happiness in sobriety I just had to fix my mess and find it. Stopping drinking was only the *first* step in me getting my life back. ..[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/bored) a great list of things to do while bored. Reading about [Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome) helped me realize I wouldn't be "broken" forever. I just needed to be patient. ..Once I started participating here and reading [books on recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) my healing *really* began to take off. The first book I read was [*This Naked Mind*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27202127-this-naked-mind) by Annie Grace. It was pretty amazing how quickly my tune changed about alcohol after I read that. ..Early sobriety is uncomfortable but it is temporary. Stay strong. It is worth the fight. I will not drink with you today.
