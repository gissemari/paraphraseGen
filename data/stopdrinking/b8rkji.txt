----------immediate responses--------

Good on you friend!!!!!  Hey sometimes it's just finding something else to do for the next 5 minutes......there are many unfortunate souls who did not share; who took another and another until it was all they were and then they died..............so blessings on you and our beautiful and sometimes painful struggle that is life!  It's just today.....you can do it!
Distraction helps me in these moments.  Things I do when I feel the urge: call a friend watch a comedian on Netflix to get some endorphins going take a hot bath write it all down in a journal make an apt. with my therapist just go to bed organize something to feel productive and get out of my head watch a movie think of how I'll feel tomorrow if I drink (physically and mentally) take a walk do some yoga read a book knit remember it's just my reptilian brain wanting pleasure and I don't have to provide it in harmful ways. Good luck and IWNDWYT.
Distraction rocks! In fact rock music can be a good distraction.  
One day at a time my man!
Good for you! I'd note this day down as a definite victory. They say  If you think life is tough try going thru it sober'. Today you did.   IWNDWYT 
I needed this. Thank you.
