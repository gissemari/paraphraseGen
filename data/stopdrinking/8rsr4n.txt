Hi everyone..Feeling extremely overwhelmed lately. Been on a pretty big on and off bender for few months. Just turned 30 and feeling overwhelmed and out of control.wake up feel like shit started getting new anxiety hangovers which makes it hard to focus on anything. Im pretty smll but drink wayyy more than id ike to admit. I have garbage cans full of tall boys on my floor weekly. ..Ilive  in NYC and its hard for me to take trains with thw fear of having panic attacks or feeling shakey...I blow a lot of money drinking and have a hard time paying bills. My depression has been holding be back from being happy and i have hard time opening mail and practicing self care. I cry too often and drink to silence that noise...I recently got a letter from my landlord ttying to take me to court for back pay on rent. I am an artist and do not aly understand how this legal thing works but i cannot be on the streets! ..I just wish I could explain to my lanlord that mental health is a real issue and im struggling to take care of both. But unfortunately not everyone understands. ..I already went to rehab a few years back but here i am again in a downword spiral...I know i have an issue and am trying to get out of this alcholic rut of self sabatoage and just neeed someone to listen or if anyone can relate...Im going to be more active on here and keep my mind at ease so i do not drink my self pitty..Thank u for my rambling.

My landlord had no mercy when I quit my job and couldn't pay rent this May . I started bindering and blacking out . The tall boy cans that cost way too much do pile up . What piled up worse for me was the self disappointment. I have drank too much for too long . I deserve better. YOU DESERVE BETTER if it's hurting your life . I'm glad you are here . I'm here if you need me . Lots of great people here !! I Won't Drink With You Today  
I was in a very similar situation a year ago. living in a small studio in Brooklyn suicidally depressed drinking alone filling my apartment with empty bottle and cans. Panic attacks daily. like incapacitating shaking total breakdown can't breathe bawling panic attacks. My only option was to get sober and leave nyc. I know not everyone can or should leave their city to fix their problems. Sobriety was the first step I couldn't have done anything else without that. It was the hardest thing I've ever done but it quite literally saved my life. Find another sober person to talk to whether that means AA or whatever. Don't drink today everything else will follow.
