Anybody else watch his videos?..&amp;#x200B;..He's a british dude named Craig Beck and I think he is one of the only people who really speaks to me. ..His videos are organized and concise and makes a lot of really great points. ..He also refers to alcohol as what it truly is; a poison. ..&amp;#x200B;..Poison that we KNOWINGLY put into our bodies that we KNOW only harms us and makes us stupid. ..&amp;#x200B;..I have been sober now for the longest I have been in over 3 years since I turned 21. ..&amp;#x200B;..I cannot recall the last time i went almost 3 weeks without a drink. ..&amp;#x200B;..Watch his videos if you are struggling. it is helping tremendously. ..&amp;#x200B;

I haven't heard of him but I'm going to check him out. Thanks for sharing. 
Congrats on not drinking! It's amazing when a drunk goes a day without booze let alone almost three weeks! Personally there is no way I could have gotten sober through online interaction youtube videos self help books alone. And oh boy I really tried to for years.  I needed a personal connection with other alcoholics.  ...IWNDWYT! 
I'll have a look thank you
