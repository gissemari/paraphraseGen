I'm not going to drink today but I have this feeling that's just burning in the back of my head. It's telling me to go buy alcohol and drink it. Even though I felt like a complete bag of shit after my last relapse...Is this physical dependence or my brain just being an asshole to itself?.. I'm very perplexed by myself. I'm not depressed unless I drink but my brain seems to be wanting that now. I know how horrible it is and how much it makes my heart hurt these days... but the thought still excites me today. It's this damn vicious cycle. I have a sort of pink mist going on ATM and feel really good. ..Am I masochistic? I know I don't like it the following days... I don't get it. It's like the ticking bomb that always explodes in my face and feels like a real bomb exploded the days after...I know you guys probably can't answer this but it's a bit of insight into my alcoholic brain. It's hard out here...Alcohol plus certain other drugs have driven me to bad points in my life and I won't go back. One day at a time. I will not drink today.

That voice is called addiction and yes we all know it well..Different people call it different things. "Addict Voice" or  "My Inner Scumbag Alcoholic" whatever you prefer it is the battle we all face when trying to get and stay sober...I sometimes like to visualize it as the classic devil on one shoulder and angel on the other. You *know* what is best for you yet that demon alcohol powered bastard  will do everything possible into tricking you into "just one this time"...Well **Fuck that voice!**  You are smarter than it is. You are not going to drink today.You can do this.
Yeah I know that voice too.  I went to the hair salon this weekend.  And it's next to the liquor store I always used to go to.  On the way in for the haircut I wanted to go buy some really bad.  But had a nice chat with the hairstylist and forgot all about it.  Keeping busy with positive things helps at least for me.
Someone on this sub (or another recovery sub) said something recently that made my jaw drop from it's simplicity and wisdom:..**Life doesn't get easier.  We get stronger.**..Please allow yourself to walk through the madness and get stronger ..Sending my deepest support and strength that I have acquired.  I have tons now so please take some of mine! ..You are not in this alone    ...

Yes we all have the voice.  ..I've learned not to engage it anymore....Prior to that I would stop what I was doing and give it a stern talking to. Where I remind myself in excruciating detail exactly what will happen once I take that first sip....By the time I've played the next 24 hours all the way through in my mind the voice is gone.
The situation you're describing is not one usually resolved solely by resolving to not drink today. As you said you do not currently intend to drink BUT...  The people who successfully not drink each day do so by taking action when those buts pop up. They don't just grit their teeth. They do something.  It's about being smart not being strong. 
The last time I relapsed I had that "pink mist" feeling you're talking about. I was feeling great just sort of stopped paying attention and figured "What the hell." Now when I feel that way I know I NEED to do something whether it's go to a meeting talk to someone sort out my feelings by writing them down do squats run until I feel like throwing up - something anything. Sometimes all of the above. The more I replace drinking with going to a meeting or to the gym the thought "I'd like a drink right now" is more often replaced by "I need a meeting" or "I need to go lift something heavy RIGHT NOW."..That panicky masochistic feeling is still there but the thing it craves is changing. I think that's progress. People tell me that in time even the feeling of needing-something-urgently will go away as I work on the underlying unresolved issues that cause it...I may not be drinking but those issues are still there and they demand some sort of fix. If I choose to do nothing I know what happens...Whatever you do I hope it's not nothing.
