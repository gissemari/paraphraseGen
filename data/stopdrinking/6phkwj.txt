She had every reason to be skeptical when I recently said I quit. I'd grown into a daily drunk and years flew by. She put up with me tolerated me and at times scolded me. We stagnated and grew into something other than the beautiful thing we'd started. We'd become something far beneath what we should have been. There was a time when we had something special. ..After a week of punishment for all I've put her through and how long it has taken me to see it I'm back and **she knows it**. I'm sober and feeling like I did when we first started dating. Witty goofy charming and caring. We're having so much fun just being total goof balls together. Nobody can make me laugh like she does. She's hilarious! ..We (us and our young children) had dinner **at the table together** for the first time in forever. We could barely eat over all the chuckles and joking. So many times I'd say "Ya'll go ahead and eat I'm not hungry" because I had to get drunk. My god the things I must have missed. But I won't miss a single thing from this point forward. ..I can't believe how good this feels and I want everyone who might be approaching that 7-8 day hump to keep going. The struggle ain't shit compared to the reward...And thank all of you fine people. Good day...

Beautiful story glad to see you are holding on to the better life.  I know my wife has enjoyed the early bedtimes sober movie binges conversation and jokes.  She doesn't give me a hard time with my emotional recovery roller coaster and I try not to forget that when I have an irritable spout.  I won't be drinking with you today friend.
Welcome back!!
this made me cry. so happy for you..will not drink with you today
It sounds like you're giddy with seeing yourself for the first time in a long time too. Congratulations!
Congrats on 9 days.  Isn't laughing the best high?  I won't drink with you today.
I'm with you! Next familiarize yourself with all the stories off people who felt this way started "drinking moderately like a regular person" and ended up right back where they were. When you get the urge to drink read what you've written here and remember! Congrats!
Outstanding! Congratulations
Congratulations!!! Keep your head high and remember these moments when things aren't as easy. 
Keep it going. It gets even better if you let it. 
So nice to read. I can picture you guys at dinner. Precious.  Enjoy  not drinking with you today.
A full heart is so much better than drinking! So heartwarming to read :) you say your children are young so sounds like you have a lot to be present for in the future yay! 
This is awesome :) keep it up 
Posts like this are why I am here. Thank you sir. I am on day two. I've had lots of day twos. Usually it's day 4 to 7 that are the hardest. I haven't been past 12 days in over a decade. Thank you for this. It is the story I needed today. 
Thank you so much for this.
Such a wonderful story! Carefree happy family times are the best!
What a vision. Thank you for sharing!
Reminds me of the book The Alchemist (which is short and awesome and always makes me smile) "The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it. And if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better."..When I was drinking I could never be present for  anything. I was always in the next drink or next obstacle I needed to clear to get to the next drink or drug. Getting physically sober helped me gain some emotional sobriety. This unlocked the present. What a beautiful gift. Sounds like you're getting the joy of the present too. Congrats my friend and I won't drink with you today!
The struggle ain't shit compared to the reward..Loooove this. Thanks so much for posting!!
