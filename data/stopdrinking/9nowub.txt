Hi everyone - first post here. I've enjoyed reading from afar but now I think I need some wisdom strength and hope...&amp;#x200B;..A bit about me - I've struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse since I was about 16 or 17 (it runs in my family); I'm 26 now. I've been having bouts of trying to quit and returning to full-blown addiction since I was 18. By 21 I was physically addicted - drinking at 7 am drinking beers between classes in college etc. I was finally arrested for a DUI after what had to be hundreds of drunken drives in January of 2017. I was sober for a while but once summer of 2017 came around I started smoking pot again until I had a vicious relapse with alcohol at the end of September. I was sober until April of this year when I occasionally had some pot. That eventually led to me having alcohol again and I quickly ended up back in jail with a felony DUI (.28). I lost an amazing woman who took a chance on me and I know everything happens for a reason - I'm now in treatment and discovering things about myself for example. I'm back in AA. Even probation won't be so bad - one year of biweekly meetings and my felony will be reduced to a misdemeanor. I'm hoping that I can finally get beyond six months of sobriety...&amp;#x200B;..Here's what is bothering me. Here in NY we have DWI courts. I'm getting a SCRAM device - fine I'll fork over the cash. But this DWI court only operates 9:30 to 4 or something like that and I have a full-time job at the bank. I don't know how flexible they are going to be and it worries me; I can't lose this job; this is my career. I work for a significant firm and this is the one good thing besides my family I haven't lost due to my drinking. I don't want to drink; I just need some reassurance from people who GET it.

I don't know how often you have to go to court but even if that is how you have to take your vacation (1/2 day at a time) it seems oike there will be a way to figure it out. You are lucky you didn't kill yourself or someone else. 
Do you have sick days or vacation days you could use?
