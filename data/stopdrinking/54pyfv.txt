I didn't know him very well. But had plenty of conversations with him before and after meetings. I related to what he said during meetings and I liked him well enough. I had been told he was a chronic relapser and he'd been in and out of the rooms several times. His absence the past few months was "normal" for him. ..This is the first one of my anonymous friends that I've personally lost. I'm told it won't be the last...I used to try to induce numbness through drinking. Now the numbness I feel is the most uncomfortable thing...RIP friend.

I am truely sorry.  I will not drink with you today. 
When this happens as it does not infrequently  I spend some time with that person in my mind...I remember their face.  I think about their sadness their despair their comments their smiles their comments.  I offer a "Thank You" to them.  For many things and mostly for the gift they left me which is: " I too can die from this condition if I neglect my work."..I don't drink in celebration of their sacrifice.  ..
The Man who chaired the  first meeting I went to died because alcohol got the best of him and it was terrible. I had never really been to a wake sober before so I didn't go too early for me. Since then I've seen guys in the program that have died sober and that's a lot easier sort of a victory. And I'm well enough to go to the services. I know its a worn out saying but I'd rather die with this disease than from it. I'm sorry for your loss. I won't drink with you today.
So sorry for your loss. 
I'm sorry to hear this.  Hope you're doing alright.
So sorry.  I will not drink today in honor of your friend.
