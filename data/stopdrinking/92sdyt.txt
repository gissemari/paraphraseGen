The last few years since I graduated from undergrad I have been constantly going back to day one and drinking heavy again in a matter of days or weeks. At 25 getting blackout drunk is no longer a good look for me and I've had lots of embarrassing moments and regrettable actions. I use alcohol as a coping mechanism and while I love drinking I no longer love who I am when I'm drunk. In fact I don't even entirely know who I am...So it's almost Sunday and I can't seem to get the smell of Thursday's vomit out of my carpet. While I have always been told I was the  fun  friend during nights out at the bars I realize that I was never actually fun what I was doing was never healthy and never helping me to cope. I finally feel serious about quitting drinking but my friends seem to laugh off. I guess this has been part of my identity for so long that even my friends don't know how bad my problem is or how bad I'm struggling. ..I guess I'm here because I don't want my drunken decisions to identify me any longer. It's comfortable numbing emotions but it's never too long before it catches up with me and the cycle repeats. So I'm ready to start again and make the decision that IWNDWYT.

Your post is so relatable to me. The toughest part for me is the social aspect of being the sober one. I'm 5 months in now and my friends know I'm serious about it but I've  always used alcohol to mask my anxiety around people I don't know very well. The quicker I could get drunk the less I cared which led to some very embarrassing nights... Good luck IWNDWYT!
I've had a lot of Day 1's too...You know the "different" ones are the ones that turn into Day 2.
Hiya. Welcome back. IWNDWYT:-)
