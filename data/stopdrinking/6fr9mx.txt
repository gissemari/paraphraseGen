Just finished this book for the second time and found that reading a chapter or two a day helps me stay on track and reminds me just how silly alcohol is. Has anyone else read the book?..I ask because I see the idea that alcoholics are somehow different than "normal" people proliferated widely through this subreddit and the book argues vehemently against this. Thoughts?..Also any other thoughts or success stories in relation to this book are welcome :) and I highly highly recommend that anyone struggling with alcohol reads it.

IMO is someone with diabetes different from normal people? How about people allergic to cats? Those who say we are different from normal people IMO suffer from terminal uniqueness. The way I see it we are ambivalent about alcohol. Every one is. On one hand we know it's not good for us on the other it's a source of comfort pleasure etc For those of us who go overboard with drinking the trick is listening to the sober voice and ignoring the other that tells us to drink. We are not special but we have life and that makes us worthwhile. It's on us how we use that gift. 
I haven't read that book but I don't think of myself as abnormal. My relationship to alcohol wasn't normal but that is not the defining characteristic of me. Everyone is bizarrely and beautifully messed up in their own way some are just better at hiding it.
