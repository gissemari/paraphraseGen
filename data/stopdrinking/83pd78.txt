Wife and I have decided we need someone to help us figure out how to start moving forward - both to help her start learning how to forgive me for hiding/lying to her about relapsing and how to support me in a healthy way going forward. ..I'm also hoping to do some on my own to learn how to better deal with anxiety/stress that I think exacerbated my alcohol problem...I have a list of some groups/orgs that are covered through our insurance plan. What do you look for to try and find a good match with someone who has some experience in these types of things? I know you sometimes have to try out several before finding a good match but I've heard very good and very bad stories and have never looked into it myself - and the unknown can be a bit unnerving. ..

I found mine on psychologytoday.com..You can filter by area insurance specialty certifications etc.
I like therapists that tend towards cognitive behavioral therapy because in my experience it's more about helping develop strategies and tools than just talking.  Talking is good too but I really like having strategies I can take home with me.  Other than that I just read their profiles (as mentioned in other comments psychologytoday is a great resource) and look for someone that seems like I might have good rapport with.
