Two years ago was one of my lowest times - we went to a Super Bowl party with all or friends and their kids etc...I proceeded to get so drunk my husband had to take me home after the halftime show..and leave our daughter with her friends while he got me in bed. . I have zero recollection of Beyonce performing - so ashamed - I cringed thinking about for months and months. ..Last year was my first sober Super Bowl  Could I do it?  I obsessed over it - I was terrified to see all of the people who hadn't seen me since my sad exit the year before.  I got through it last year and it was HARD - I could hardly breathe - but I got threw it. This year - same annual party - no worry.  NO BIG DEAL!  Never thought about being sober until I got home and reflected what a difference a year makes.  SO if you are struggling tonight - stick to it - it gets easier. I didn't believe I would ever be at peace with sobriety - not only at peace but wholly grateful. I will not drink with you today!
