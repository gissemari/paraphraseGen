I forget what number relapse this last one was and it took everything I had to get back on that wagon.  In this third week the fog is starting to clear and I got to thinking about each relapse.  It seems like every time I get sober again I learn something new.  I'm a thick-headed individual that has to be my own personal crash-test dummy in life so I really dont recommend this path.  However I'm learning just how much I try to conform to people around me and dont speak up about things that are important to me such as my sobriety--I dont want to sound preachy etc.  I undersell it and just tell people it's no drink November.  I've come to the realization that I dont owe ANYONE an explanation for not drinking.  ..This weekend a friend of mine told me that he felt I was judgmental at the bar this weekend with how many drinks he had.  I got hurt at first because I thought nothing of the sort until I realized that this is a 'him' problem.  I make him feel uncomfortable just by not drinking.  He's having internal struggles about his own consumption and that has nothing to do with me.  Anyway I guess I'm just saying that I've realized I need to guard my sobriety more closely.  Its the most important thing I can do in my life right now.  If people dont understand that then they have no place in my life.  Drinking has no place in my life and thems the facts.  Today I will not drink either.  Cheers!

Very true the people who have a problem with my drinking may very well be going through their own stuff. Good reminder. Congrats!
I will join you in not drinking today my friend!
I definitely conform to the people around me too. It's convinced me to become more selective about people I choose to spend my time with. I heard "stick with the winners" as a suggestion when I was newly sober.
