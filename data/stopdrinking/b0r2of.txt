This place helps me stay focused.  I am trying to get back to not drinking again.  I did all of 2017 but relapsed and have been playing with moderation/failure since then.  This year I started physically drawing lines on my calendar to watch my drinking habits. I thought I was doing well but I am right back to shitfaced at least once but typically twice a week.  No more.
