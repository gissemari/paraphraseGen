Over the past 4 T-days I've been lucky to be sober.  I was even sober last T-day my relapse didn't start until a week before christmas... I was sitting here reflecting on every Thanksgiving I had while in my 12 year marriage and realized they all played out the same:..* Wake up either still drunk from the night before or horribly hungover..* Drag self out of bed at 6am to help former husband stuff a turkey..* Pretend I wasn't dying of a hangover/ withdrawal.  Make excuses to keep running into spare bedroom where I hid all the booze and take swigs out of a wine bottle to stop the shakes..* Try not to breathe on hubby while in close proximity..* Hubby would go back to sleep I'd stay up continuing my wine breakfast..* Trashed by the time guests started to arrive..* Blacked out by the time guests left...Even though I've just come back from an 11 month relapse after 30 months of sobriety I am so damn grateful all those terrible memories are in the past and I'm getting myself back together again.

Wishing you all the best this Thanksgiving. This will be my first sober Thanksgiving since I was pregnant... let's see 11 years.  I'm looking forward to being present and sober but I'm a little nervous too.  I hope I get to go for a walk or get some brief minutes of alone time so I can deal with the stress of hosting.  I am going to rely on the dog  as an excuse to duck out if I need to.
Wishing you a wonderful Thanksgiving!
I love this sub.  Happy turkey day!
