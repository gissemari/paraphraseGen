I've been pretty depressed lately and had creeping thoughts like  what do I have to lose  - and  wasn't I this sad when I was drinking?  For context I'm having issues in my relationship (I moved to the west coast for work and my partner is still on the east coast - it's been really hard lately - I absolutely love this person and I feel very alone) ..The fact is - I have a *lot to lose* - I'm living responsibly being kind performing well at work physically healthy listening to my friends saying what I mean and meaning what I say etc. ..I just also have depression and have struggled with it since early adolescence - and struggled with it *way harder* and acted out *way more* when I was drinking heavily. Lately the dark thoughts are back - and depression always tricks me into thinking that I never felt good before and I'll never feel good again. ..I am sober - I have everything to lose - and when I come out of this depression I will thank myself a thousand times for not grabbing a beer. ..A temporary escape sounds enticing - but it isn't worth the hangovers the irresponsibility the wild mood swings the sweating the constant colds skipping the gym waking up at noon on weekend days acting cruelly toward my family and partner the anger the suicidal ideation the stomach pain the sheer number of Advil tablets the weight gain the puffy face the migraines not knowing or understanding myself my long term goals going out the window my performance at work failing the self disgust. ..I am a thousand times grateful for the life I have - even if my brain feels like it's floating in ice water right now. ..Love and strength to all of you!
