I'm posting a lot because I think it helps sort my brain out but here are the many things that happened during my 9 month 'experiment' of drinking again in case you ever want to try it:..* I threw up a lot - after drinking while drinking. I never threw up while sober.* I talked shit about my friend (that I don't even really believe) to their new girlfriend and now they won't speak to me.* I ended up having a weird 'thing' with my friend's boyfriend while I am in a relationship - nothing happened but it could have done and that nearly destroyed another friendship and my own relationship.* I tackled my boyfriend to the ground while drunk.* I left my bag in a club with everything in it because I was totally wasted.* I cancelled so many plans for the next day.* I stopped exercising entirely.* My face got bloated .* I managed to break nearly all the glasses in my friends house.* I had a full two day hangover where I was unable to move without feeling sick and had to 'work from home' to cover it.* I worked from home and did fuck all many times.* I got fired from my job for poor performance (shocker).* I began to hate myself.* I would cry a lot.* My anxiety went through the roof.* I was so hungover at my boyfriend's mum birthday I had to keep going to the bathroom to throw up.* I turned up hungover to play boardgames with my friends everytime and spent the whole time wishing I could go home.* I got the worse acid re-flux at a festival meaning that I could barely enjoy what was happening.* I fought with my boyfriend many times over stupid shit..I am lucky to be with the most supportive partner ever who right now is willing to give me a second chance. He knew me sober and agrees that I was a way better person then. I have friends who support me despite my fuck ups and I have you guys SD. ..I know that person up there isn't me. That person is a demon who is released by alcohol. I would never purposely hurt people or fuck up my jobs. It scares me that it's only been nine months and how quickly it all unraveled. ..So yeah it was a wild ride and one I'm pretty glad to be off. IWNDWYT.

Thanks for this post.  It's always good to read another testament of all the wonderful things that alcohol brings to our lives.  Welcome back chalkyfish glad you're here 
Thank you for posting! what a great reminder of the reality of drinking versus the distorted view sometimes seen.
TOTALLY identify with this. I'm nine months into a 9 month relapse RN. It sucks
Welcome back. Plan on doing anything different this time to help you stay sober?
I went out after 18 months and it took another 12 months to committing to being sober.  So much of what you wrote was exactly what  I went through.
I can certainly relate to many of those points. Particularly leaving my bag behind with allll the important shit in it.     
Saving this post. Basically what happens when I relapse after a long sobriety.. I have to remember these things. IWNDWYT
