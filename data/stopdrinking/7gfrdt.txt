I never started drinking regularly until I was in my mid 30s. I'm 44F.  I look back at when I started and a lot of it was self medicating for back pain. I went years with severe back pain off and on.  I went to physical therapy more times than I would like to count. I finally had an MRI 5 years ago and low and behold I had a severe herination of one of my disks. I took no pain medication during this time.  I worked full time and by the time I got home I couldn't sit I had to stand or go to bed because of the severe pain. So I drank wine and numbed the pain.  I ended up having surgery 4 years ago. I'm much better now but I still struggle with some siatica issues and have trouble working out because everything irritates my nerve.  If I hadn't had the surgery I wouldn't be working anymore. ..My point?  That is where my abuse started. I could have asked for pain meds and gone down that road. Thankfully I did not!!  The only time I took pain meds was when I had my surgery. So instead I'm abusing alcohol...My SO- I met 7 years ago.  He also drinks.  My drinking progressively got worse over these last few years (after surgery).  I would bring it up and the SO would always tell me it's ok. You go to work.  You are responsible.    We are wonderful together...drinking. Seems to be our favorite past time. ..I want better for myself. I don't want to drink anymore for something to do.  Thanks for reading. Great place here!
