I've been having sticker shock at the thought of accepting that this needs to be a lifetime thing for me. The anxiety it has been bringing on has been pretty debilitating over the last few days and I've lost some weight and sleep over it but it's slowly getting better. Normally I would deny myself the thoughts that were causing the anxiety and/or drink to curb it. ..Last night I was finally getting some real sleep when I woke up again a few hours in in sweats and anxiety with my mind racing about the on going struggle to accept reality. When I first decided to face reality a couple of days ago I didn't know what to do so I just nealt down at the side of my bed and prayed...I grew up religious but have since lost it. But I am at a point where I'm clearly not doing well on my own so even if I can just go through the motions of being religious it would help me. Who knows maybe I find something there I missed before. ..Anyways immediately after praying I had an intense urge to dump the liquor bottles that were hiding away in my closet. Now these are  memorable  bottles in that they all have some sort of sentimental value to them. I'm not even a liquor drinker beer was my drug of choice most of these bottles hadn't been touched in years if at all. I got up walked over to the box and grabbed a bottle and started walking to the sink and froze. My mind started rationalizing. All types of bullshit reasons as to why it would be dumb to pour them out. I listened. Put the bottle back into the box and tucked it away in the closet. ..Well last night in the midst of my anxiety attack my nerve endings were on fire. The thought of a drink momentarily crossed my mind and immediately I remembered the box in the closet. I have the control that I wasn't going to touch it but I started to think of how dumb it was for me to keep holding onto them. One was a small little whiskey bottle with a customized label of when my brother asked me to be a groomsman. I thought  what the hell do I need a little trinket for... I have them. And possibly won't if I don't kick this habit for good . ..So in one fell swoop I stood up out of bed got dressed and put on a rain jacket grabbed the box and a weed pipe/grinder leftover from college (I've been thinking about picking weed back up lately too) threw it in the box and looked at it and said  you have no power over me anymore.  I walked down the stairs of my apartment with the box that voice in my mind telling me how stupid it was to do something like this but I felt some external force (maybe internal willpower but it felt out of body) kept me walking all the way to the trash can on the side of the street out in the rain. Threw it in without hesitation turned around and walked back inside and never looked back...It feels strange and it still feels  pointless/dumb  but I think it's a major step towards accepting the long term commitment I am making. The trash pickup has already come so it's gone now and whatever small  regret  I have about the  sentimental value  to that box is dwarfed by the feeling of more clam ness today accepting the lifetime decision I am making...Still not 100% over this sticker shock but something deep inside of me or maybe even divine is helping me make the steps in the right direction even if they feel awkward doing them at the time. ..Stay strong guys. Accept life on life's terms and play with the cards we are dealt. I will not drink with you today tomorrow or the day after or the year after. I will not drink with you ever again.

Good for you! The anxiety insomnia and night sweats are typical withdrawal symptoms. You will be feeling much better after 7 days or so. Hang in there.
Way to go. I am always reminding myself " It is what it isnow deal with it " I will not drink with you today.
