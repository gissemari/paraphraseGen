I'm trying to celebrate the small victories so I can ignore the billion gallons of alcohol on my way to and from work.  .It's awesome waking up and my nervous system doesn't make me feel like a mouse could knock me over..It's awesome not waking up at 2am to go chug a bottle just to go back to sleep..It's awesome not having to drink just to get to work..It's awesome not having heart burn from a PB&J..It's awesome to not have heart palpitations all day..It's awesome to see my house become cleaner and more organized each day..It's awesome to have come this far; and terrifying knowing how stubborn I am; and how close relapse can be..

Great job! Keep going!
The good effects you describe just keep getting better.  It is important to remember how close relapse. An be but also important to remember how strong your willpower is...How you can wake up each morning and power through another 24 hours to the next day.  ..Congratulations keep it up and I will not drink with you today!
Awesome post!
