I have been struck by the number of posts and comments over the last week of our SD newcomers who are struggling with the temptation to return to drinking.  In one case someone mentioned that their boss and upper management types would be in town and wanted him to join them "for drinks."  Another well-meaning newcomer is dealing with bad family news and someone else says that the weekdays are OK but how to fight the desire on Friday or the weekend?   All of these scenarios and the infinite variations on them are no different in my experience to the same impulses I felt and that we endless talk about as the alky-brain the alky-voice and so forth.  But there is in my experience a well-recognized conscious strategy to deal with all of this and I laid it out [in a post called ***the Ulysses Bargain.***](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3il4y0/the_ulysses_bargain_how_i_get_past_cravings_and/)..Fighting the good fight but at a loss as to what works?  Try the [ideas at the Ulysses Bargain](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3il4y0/the_ulysses_bargain_how_i_get_past_cravings_and/) and let us know what you think...

This is where one day at a time is so brilliant - and the ability to change that to 10 minutes 1 minute 1 second - at a time...It can also be one step at a time - **a step away from the liquor store bar or wherever the temptation is taking you**..It's ok to be silly saying to yourself "I dare you to walk around the block."  - "Oh look a shiny object in the hardware/book/shoe store" works too.
I can admit I was the one struggling yesterday with going out for drinks with management.  I can also say that I didn't go quite literally from reading replies to my post.  I woke up this morning so relieved I could call out Day Two on not drinking.  I'm not one to get excited about anything so I'm trying to temper going two days with the possibility I might slip up but in the interim I am finding this site very helpful.  I will look up the Ulysses Bargain..thanks for sharing. 
wow it's like fighting cravings is an EPIC thing to do. ..Hear that Miss Seductive Craving? By ignoring you I'm freaking Ulysses!
How have I not read this before? Thank you so much for posting! Brilliant!
