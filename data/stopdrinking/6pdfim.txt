Annual physical: ..bad cholesterol level literally cut in half weight lost liver enzymes great vitamin D doubled bp totally normal. Guys I'm SO excited and happy! I feel fantastic! Doctor high-fived me! And I was really scared to go. ..In a concrete objective way it reinforces all the positives I've felt in the last 19 days. Mental clarity physically stronger mentally and emotionally more stable and available. Anxiety manageable and depression almost nonexistent. ..I do have cravings and my little sneaky alcoholic voice revs up sometimes but it's not bad. I stay vigilant. Oh and I quit smoking at the same time. Life is good. Not perfect. But it's my life and I'm living it fully. ..If you're struggling stay with it. The cravings and the difficult emotions do pass. I'm learning not to act on every emotion and it's helping. ..Not drinking with you guys today! Thanks for being here!! ..-lemon
