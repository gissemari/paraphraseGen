After years of bouncing between doing "better" for a few days at most and not trying at all I genuinely feel proud this afternoon and for the first time I'm confident that I can finally keep moving mostly forward...The weather hasn't been as brutally hot lately so I took a 3 mile jog and stopped at a gas station that recently started selling alcohol for some coconut water. The cashier asked me "Wait \*what\* no beer today?" (This was at 10AM oof I have a reputation there) Despite the walls lined with booze and the man playfully bringing it back to my attention I still walked out of there with just my water and made my way home with no regrets...Then I fired up the grill and got some sun with a wholesome veggie-filled meal. It's been about a week now but I haven't exactly been counting. I feel amazing I have more energy than I know what to do with and I don't break out into a miserable sweat the moment I step out the door. It's been difficult and the struggle isn't over yet but IWNDWYT.
