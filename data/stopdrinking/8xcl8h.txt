After consuming copious amounts of alcohol the last few months I want to stop. I have been an alcoholic for 3 years now. I was able to abstain for a week in March but relapsed hard soon after. At this point I don't even enjoy the feeling anymore it's the overwhelming cravings   that have kept me going back to the booze. ..I don't know what there is about today or now but I'm going with it. I want to feel alive again -not like a zombie going through the motions. I am grateful for the support from my church partner and friends and am returning to this subreddit for additional support in quitting for good. Requested my badge be set for today. I will not drink with you on this beautiful summer day .

OK! Today is a Good Day! ..IWNDWYt..G-Jam
Welcome back!..I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself.....&gt;it's the overwhelming cravings that have kept me going back to the booze..There are some videos about [overcoming cravings](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=this+naked+mind+overcoming+cravings) on the TNM YouTube channel which I found helpful.....When a craving strikes come here and talk about it instead of blindly obeying!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
