Hey all. I've gone nearly three weeks without a drink and am feeling pretty proud of myself.  I sought help from my GP and he referred me to a fantastic psychologist (yep it's upfront expensive but thankfully I can claim a rebate from the govt)...I think I'm through the worst of the withdrawals - shakes headaches nightmares have all subsided I'm back at work and I think the SSRI my doctor prescribed for my anxiety is starting to kick in and have a positive effect. I think my old sense of humour is coming back I feel like I am a more positive fun and present parent and I'm more honest with myself than I ever have been. ..The only thing is I see a challenge looming on the horizon and I'm so scared that I'll relapse...I'm turning 40 soon  and am going away with friends for a celebratory weekend (no hubbies no kids) and I know the champagne will be flowing in abundance. I don't want my friends to know I'm an alcoholic trying to stay sober...I'm sure they'd be very understanding  as they're lovely but I do still fear the stigma. And I've hidden it from them for so long.....Any advice/support would be appreciated!

When I was newly sober I had to go to a very boozy family wedding and also felt very uncomfortable... I told everyone I was recovering from a bad bronchitis and still on a lot of medication and no one paid much attention. I then focused on the cake and dancing. Take care and enjoy your birthday!

I'm facing that today. I'm going to a hotel/casino for my 42 birthday. I am really nervous but I am pre planning:..My kids are coming with so I'll focus on them. I have a mental list of mocktails. I have a massage planned and know where I want to eat. I wrote out my "playing the tape forward" scenario. I know what will happen if I have one drink. Straight back to my old ways. I know if I get through this challenge every other event after will be easier. ..Pre planning really helps. ..Iwndwy!
