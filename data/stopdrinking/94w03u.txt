I'd really developed a severe drinking problem as a way to cope with my problems. My mom had breast cancer throughout my high school years and ended up passing away about a year and a half ago (I'm now 20). This re One of my biggest supporters throughout it all was my girlfriend who dumped me a few months after my mom passed. I don't intend to bash on her at all she was a perfect girlfriend. She dumped me because I wasn't the same person as I was years before hand when we first met. I'd lost myself to alcohol. I'd hit my lowest of lows after this happened struggling with severe depression and flunking college courses. This lead to serious drinking until I'd fall asleep in my dorm then skipping my classes the next day. Over and over again for a few semesters. Thinking that drinking would cause my pain to float away was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. ..Something as simple as drinking water instead of alcohol has seriously helped me. Thinking about it it's amazing the clarity that water provides you. Water allows you to become a more vivid version of yourself rather than lose yourself through alcohol. I'm now entering my junior year of university to become a teacher just like my momma. My priorities are clear and I'm excited to live life every day I wake. Water allowed me to alter my perspective on life; the most precious thing we all have. I hope this post can help somebody in some fashion. Changing little things can make tremendous impacts.

That's great! I drink a ton of water but I was still having the alcohol in the evenings. It's a struggle but we can do anything right?!
I am drinking a lot more tea + water. Tea is so much nicer than alcohol. I've brought tea bags to small parties and greatly enjoyed sipping on it instead of booze and my favorite part is being able to drive myself home once everyone else gets a little too rowdy :) ..My skin has gotten clearer and I'm seeing some cellulite reduction. I'm not overweight but I have that  23-year-old college girl alcoholic  cellulite that's got to go
