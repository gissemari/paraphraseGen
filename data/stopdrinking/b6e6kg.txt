Hey Reddit. Have dealt w/ depression &amp; anxiety associated w/ PTSD for some time. Really appreciate that there's an entire community of folks out there just looking to help. Very cool. To the point: Am late twenties have struggled w/ alcohol for some time hx of alcoholism in the family. Am aware that despite feeling in "control" of my addiction and rarely drinking outside of special occasions i'll never be in total control as long as i intend to continue w/ use. Started a new job about two years ago and haven't vacationed since... decided to finally submit a request for PTO this summer - current plan is 5 days in Nice France &amp; 5 in Genoa Italy (not loaded just travel cheap and per google these places are vair pretteh). Will be traveling alone though hence the (mild) concern. I don't drink like i used to but being alone and knowing no one anywhere i'll be does raise the question of who would know if anything happened to me. Putting this out into the universe just in case anyone happens to have a known/trusted pal they'd be happy to connect me w/ in these areas who might be open to making my acquaintance. Will be traveling on my own hence le concern.  ("Well what better place *is* there to vet a trustworthy host source than an anonymous internet forum?" to which i respond your point is fully understood and acknowledged as legitimate but that said am slim on options &amp; fairly confident in my internet-vetting capabilities). Thanks for the help folks. Best to you and yours :)
