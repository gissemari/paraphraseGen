Im with you   I'm done   
I would wish you good luck but it's more than luck. So I'll wish you good determination and good patience.
I'm here with you too on day one. Can't fall/stay asleep tonight. It's a sweaty toast turny night coming off a 4 day binge. IWNDWYT 
Well done. IWNDWYT!
It's not that we slip and fall but that we stand again and walk on that counts. Courage to you on your journey.
