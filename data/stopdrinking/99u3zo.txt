Most of us should be in bed or soon to be. Which means we all made it another day without drinking. Every single one of us should be proud of ourselves. We have all succeeded in a struggle that few outsiders can understand.

Whatever other shit is going down in our life we can be grateful for another sober day.
We can deal with any shit going on so long as we don't pick up that first drink. IWNDWYT.
