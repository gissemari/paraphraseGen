It's been 36 days since my last drink. I'm still thinking about my sobriety everyday but less and less and more positively. Everyday gets a little easier. Almost everyday has a small challenge and some big ones here and there. But the important part is that I'm not trying to numb them away and bury them with alcohol. I'm trying to stay focused and build from small goals. ..One of my small goals is slowly trying to get through my media backlog. I've bought a number of books and games over the years and I'm trying to chip away at them everyday a little bit here and there. Even though it's not really "productive" so to speak I feel like I left my hobbies by the wayside over the years in favor of drinking and mindlessly browsing Reddit/Twitch. So I'm picking up where I left off and rediscovering my old hobbies. I've even rekindled my interest in game design or programming so I'm dabbling again in that world with small projects here and there...Part of my success in doing these small things is consistently writing in my daily planner that I purchased about a month ago when I started my sobriety. I draw a circle and next to it a goal and if I complete the goal I fill in the circle for the day...I think a difficult part of sobriety is regaining your previous energy level. And when you're drinking your gradually lose your ability to handle this energy level that you had before. And then when you suddenly go sober you have to almost relearn how to live with all this new found energy. And if you can't handle it you can get bored really easily which can lead to relapse. So having a lot of small goals including a couple big ones can help refocus you and fill up your sober life and help you relearn how to live without drugs or alcohol. ..Thanks for reading I hope you have a wonderful day..IWNDWYT

This sounds like a great plan.  My hobbies and leisure narrowed over the years until they could fit into the neck of a bottle!  I hear you on the newfound energy level.  Its like pressing on the accelerator of a racecar after driving a pinto - aiming it in the right direction is really important.  Congratulations on 37 days!
