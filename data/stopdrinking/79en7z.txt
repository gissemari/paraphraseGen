Hey all  ..I know i'm not too active on here but today is 20 years since i had a drink or any drugs!!!! I am soooooo grateful for my sobriety. Without it i have nothing or wouldn't be here.  ..The reason i'm posting is that i wanted to share in hopes that if someone is struggling maybe my experience can help. No ego either just trying to help.  ...First off I'm 35 year old. SO if y'all know math... I was 15 when i got sober. I was told if i wanted to stay sober i would need to change my playmates play things and play places!!! I think this was one of the most important ~~suggestions~~ directions i was given. It played a huge role in my recover!!! Losers can only teach you how to loose. I Graduated high school sober. Went to cooking school sober! Worked in the Restaurant Industry sober! Have made amazing friends and meet truly awesome people in recovery. For the most part my life has been amazing!!!  ..But it hasn't come without its troubles! I lost my sponsor in 9/11 been fired relationship troubles money and car problems. Lost friends due to the disease and other typical life issues. But the 1 thing that has been a constant is my #1 priority....**SOBRIETY!!!** It has always remained my most grateful part of my life!  ..I want to convey that no matter what happens in life you can get through it sober. I mean anything. A woman that i know that was super active in recover was hit by a car on a bike and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Her husband also in recovery had stayed sober and helped his wife! I know someone who lost kids and parent but remained sober and eventually happy.  ..Just hang in there and keep at it. A drink or a drug wont make anything better. I believe that hole heartedly. Bottom line......  ...**I LOVE BEING SOBER!!!!!!!!**

Hell of a milestone buddy. Congrats!
H Cheff! Thank you for the inspiring post! LOVE that you are active and not complacent!! You are a testament to sobriety working if it's enough of a priority. ..The traumas we go through can be what they are or they can be MUCH worse if we drink. ..Raising my coffee to toast your fantastic 20 year long gift to yourself and I'm not drinking with you today! Cheers!! :)
Good on you mate thank you for sharing! If only I had the good sense to chuck the drink at 15. :) 
Congrats to you! Very inspiring 
Damn good on you!! Super inspirational stuff. ..What was it that made you decide to quit at 15? I ask because I started drinking at a young age as well (13 or so) and I didn't have the maturity to even think about my future at all let alone my relationship with alcohol. 
Congrats! I often say that if I could've written my own 'life script' I would have sold myself short. I got sober at 18 and have had many of the same ups and downs but never a situation where a drink would enhance the issue. .Currently I am sitting on my couch while my family sleeps enjoying the quiet before the storm of 3 teen girls exterior door installation trumpet practice and who knows what else. Keep trudging along it gets better!!
Congratulations!  Amazing commitment at such a young age! Can I ask was there someone in you life that came through as an example?  I mean like "I'm going to be like him/her." Or "I'm not going to be like him/her!"?

yesss! what an inspiration you are to all of us! there is so much power in taking it day by day. that used to be just a saying for me now it's how i'm choosing to live my life. well done! 
Thank you so much for sharing your words and story! 20 years is an amazing achievement. I hope it doesn't come off as insensitive but i'm thankful when people share how they were able to get through really hard times while staying sober because for me i always picture myself drinking when something bad happens (losing someone etc) you're an incredible person. Keep on keeping on! I will not drink with you today :)
Yay.  You got sober at 15.  I can't imagije the years of torment and dispair.  The DUIs and losing jobs and maybe your wife.  It's a miracle your liver survived.
