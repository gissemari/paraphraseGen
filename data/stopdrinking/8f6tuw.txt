Would I love to have over 800 days right now? Yes. ..Did it happen? No. ..Has my recovery been perfect and flawless? No. I have relapsed several times in fact. But I learn from each of them...Did I miss holidays birthdays concerts obstacle races career opportunities ect during those relapses? Yes....Am I going to drink over fucking up over and over again? No. I know that more opportunities will arise &amp; there are more holidays to be had.....So keep your head up if you are struggling or if your wagon hti a pot hole and you fell off. *Trial and error &amp; try and try again. Never give up the fight my fellow sobernauts!!* Here's some [Girl power](https://imgur.com/a/1csThvz) encouragement to the lovely ladies of SD &amp; my [pictures of inspiration](https://imgur.com/a/HWkoD) from my 1st day 12...Happy Thursday &amp; .[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
