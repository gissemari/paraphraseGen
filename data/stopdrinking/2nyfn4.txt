It's my first relapse I got hospitalized for drinking too much 29 days ago and yet I couldn't fucking stop now I'm back at square one looks like I have a problem after all.

You're not back to square one--I'm sure you're learning a ton about yourself and how your addiction works (or doesn't work). You're closer to sobriety than you were before. Gather yourself and carry on. You can do this!
Hey there - been there done that.  But the most important thing is that we keep trying to quit.

You didn't know you had a problem when you were hospitalized 29 days ago? I'm glad those blinders fell off now you can see your path a little more clearly. That's a big step to learn so congratulations in taking the lesson even if it's a humbling one.
Congratulations! Our first step to recovery is recognizing that the problem exists...

no kiddin'?
Whether you realize or not yet even in your month of sobriety (and especially with medical care) you've learned tools and gained insight that will help you this time around. Good luck. Keep going.
