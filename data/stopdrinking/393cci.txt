I relapsed a while back and it's true what they say it gets worse when you hit the bottle again. the last several weeks have been an absolute shit show. after a relationship ended last month I have spent several nights a week drinking. I'm really ashamed of some of the things drunk me has done. I do things while drunk that I would never ever do sober. ever. I fucked up pretty big yesterday so this morning I dumped my stash down the kitchen sink. today I won't drink and I hope I have a long healthy sober life ahead of me.

Welcome back /u/bitty_bitters.  Nothing wasted if in the end you gain insight that spare you a recurrence of relapse.  I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you.
what were you doing to not drink before? ..And what are you going to do to ensure you don't drink now?
