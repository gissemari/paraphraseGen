Been lurking for a few weeks wasn't quite ready to commit to total abstinence. However moderation is just not in the cards for me. Today I join your ranks in the struggle for sobriety...Wish me luck...I will not be drinking with you all today.

I'm here with you. I will not drink with you today. 
Warm welcome to you! I am new here as well. As of 12 tonight it will be 48 hours without drinking for myself. I really had the urge to drink tonight but I'm 25 and have told myself I will quit drinking for the past 3 years but it's time for a change my friend! My advice? Keep yourself busy and don't go to places that you used to go to when you were drinking. It's too easy to fall back in the old routine. Use this as a time to explore and find new places!
Welcome and I'm here to support you...I'm new here also. When I go to bed in an hour it will be one week for me and the first weekend I can remember without a drink...I will not drink with you today.
Just posted my own first post as well.  I drank earlier today (justified doing it early so it didn't impact my evening and justifying any drinking is a problem).  I want to make it through this week without a drink.
Good luck! i will not drink with you today!!
