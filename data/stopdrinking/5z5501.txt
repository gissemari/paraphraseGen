So this morning I finally bit the bullet and told one of my very closest friends that I can't hang out with him anymore. This has been an extremely difficult decision for me to arrive at. I go back a little over ten years with this man and the history between us runs as thick as blood. We've both struggled for some time with substance abuse but the only difference between us is that his tendencies go fully destructive 90% of the time. He's totally nearly every vehicle he's owned while either drunk or barred out stumbled into work fucked up run his store into the ground and blamed his employees shown up at my house in a nod and lied about being fucked up and even left a loaded handgun in his office after going MIA from work.. The biggest problem is that his dad (who owns the company) continually enables this behavior and the man is rarely presented with any real consequences. I saw him about two weeks ago and we talked about his (at the time) month of sobriety and his excitement about it. Well that didn't last and he went out and got himself some blow took it to work and then pulled the MIA bit mentioned above. Anyway when he reached out yesterday asking to hang out later this week I took the day to consider my response. This morning I sent a text that honestly broke my heart to type out and told him that I can't be around him until he gets and keep his shit together. I encouraged him to seek help find a support group and try to get well. All I know is that I can't focus on my own recovery and worry about the next call I get that he's done something stupid again. So yeah.. Don't really know what else to say about that. Just felt like I needed to get it out. Thanks for reading my friends. I won't be drinking with you today.
