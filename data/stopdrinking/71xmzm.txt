*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens -- good or bad -- and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset! What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at:..US - Night/Early Morning..Europe - Morning..Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar..____..*Good day SD. Well the week has flown by. It has been wonderful hosting the check-in and quite humbling. If you have a chance (and at least 30 days) I highly suggest you try it. Seeing all the new people checking in has been incredible. I truly admire all of you for going through this struggle. Just keep checking in. Even if you slip keep checking in. I leave you now in the care of /u/kisdoingit*..*~ iDoneDo*
----------immediate responses--------

Good morning my friends!! :)..Driving back to family today...but first on the off chance the weather is clear enough in an hour I might fly a few takeoffs and landings before I get on the road...All this early morning stuff...so much easier when sober. :)..I will not drink today...Take care..
Morning SD! I will not drink with you all today. Enjoy your day!

Good morning everyone. 32 days and feeling good :)..I will not drink with you today!
Hiya and I will not drink with you today :-)
This is a beautiful day as was yesterday. Nothing is lacking. I'm not missing out on anything. I'm not leading a subpar life with second rate experiences. ..Instead I'm complete for the first time in a long time because I took something away. I'm not missing anything because I'm fully present for it all...Today I continue this journey I continue *life*. I'm not drinking with you today.
I will not drink with you all today! Woke up early and super sore from this week's workouts... heading to the gym soon to get in a lower body workout. I love how much more committed I can be to the gym on my weekends now that I'm not spending them hungover or drinking all of those calories :).
I will not drink today!
I am determined not to drink today! So there!
I will not drink today! 
I will not drink today.
Happy Saturday everyone. I will not drink with you all today. 
Not feeling good the past two days. The days before were great. It's still a rollercoaster. I didn't think about  I alcohol for weeks and suddenly sometimes cravings are back. Hoping for more stability I will not drink today even though I will have many opportunities.
Day 54....I've got an early morning flight followed by a bar tending shift followed by an hour and a half train ride.   It's going to be a long day but I vow to not drink today because that would only make everything worse. Have a great day everyone!
I will not drink today.
Not drinking today 
Ah this rapidly becoming my morning ritual....love it. I WONT DRINK TODAY!
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today! Starting day 5!
Not drinking today. I'd rather go mountain biking!
I will not drink today. ..My job interview yesterday seemed to go very well. Now my success at getting the job depends on factors outside my control so I'm going to have to let it go and not stress until I hear more...I fly back home today so here's to another sober day. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today 
I will not drink with y'all today.

I don't know what to do today feeling totally apathetic. But at least I know that I won't drink today. 
Afternoon all. Still packing up my house for the move in two weeks. Excited to carry on feeling positive and looking forward; difficult to recognise the way I was feeling matter of weeks ago. I won't drink with you today    
I will not drink tonight.
I will not drink with you today
Thanks for the check ins this week u/iDoneDo! ..I'm not drinking today no matter what!
I will not drink today. 
IWNDWYT   
Today I pledge to pass on the poisons end the eye-openers ditch the drink veto the vino toss the tipple forgo the firewater ban the booze block the beer refuse the red-eye evict the ethanol lose the liquor cancel the cold ones shun the shots and go negatory on the nightcaps....  FTZ!.
Rough ride this week!  I think as I've gotten so much better mentally and physically I've really started to "emerge" from my drinking shell and realized a lot of my life is not the way I want it to be.  It reminds me of the heavy duty feels I got around 2 months into sobriety.  I guess it's all part of the work I need to do as nobody but me can do it!  I will not drink today!
Today I'm making myself some bomb biscuits and gravy for breakfast going to a meeting and then hosting a surprise birthday party for my mother.  I will not drink today!
Feeling a bit dull and haven't done anything productive today but at least I'm sober for my fifth consecutive day.
I will not drink today. Feeling positive today which feels great!
Thanks iDoneDo!..I will not drink with you all today!
I will not drink with you today!
It's Saturday I will not drink today..
I'm at the airport about to start a 13-hour journey to deal with a difficult family situation on my own. I will be away from my kids and husband and dogs for over 2 weeks. I will be living alone for that period of time. I am taking it one day at a time and starting with today I will not drink today. Daily checkins will be important 
Ugh so tired the past couple days but hanging on. I will not drink today..

Hello! After two hours standing in the sun i made it to the end of the line for signups to a class i'd been looking for all summer and all spots were filled! So that's how my day's been! But i will not drink!!!!!!!!!!
I will not drink today.
I was forced to go to a wine bar last night but I kept it together by downing Cokes. Turned out this stupid bar didn't have free refills so I ended up spending as much as a glass of wine. What kind of bar gouges the DD? I'm happy though that I didn't drink and I will not drink with you today.
Goooodnight!! Over and out in Perth and here's to another 24hours :)
I will not drink today. Man it is a perfect day here in NY! Absolutely gorgeous!

I will not drink with all of you today
I will NOT drink with you today. I've things in front of me to keep me occupied and away from my nemesis boredom. I will have contact with the sober community today.

Also tomorrow will be 3 months for me and not messing that up! 3 months and a clean spacious room in my future! Woot woot!.Hope you all enjoy this beautiful Saturday!.I will not-drink with you today!

Hi everyone good morning. I'm not drinking today.
I will not drink with you today. I won't be tempted by the wine tasting at the festival I'm attending this evening because I'm not drinking!
One of my motivators is that I'd love to host the check-in so need to get to 30 days for that. It's one day at a time but it still helps to have that goal in sight. I will not drink with you today:)
Hey SD - I *slept in*. WTF? I'm not drinking today. I'm loading up the car and heading to the surf/sun/sand ;). Welcome Fall?? Huh. I'll take this *amazing* weather *any* day!!! Have a beautiful weekend my gorgeous ladies and gents of SD! xo
Day 55 feeling confident and ready to set some new goals. I will not drink with you today!!
I will not drink today 
Not gonna drink today. 
I'm on day 4 right now... I've been amazed how much easier this has been this time now that I am committed to not drinking than my previous attempts where I had just tried to see how long I could go without drinking. Previously every day was a struggle. Even if I made it a couple weeks every day I came home and fought to avoid alcohol. But now my mindset is different. I know how bad it has been for me and that I'm through with it. So now when I get home from work the thought of having a drink so far hasn't crossed my mind. Four days in and I'm feeling great. I know it won't always be easy and there will be days I will struggle but for now all I know is I will not drink alcohol today with you all!
It is going to be a great day without alcohol!  I am not drinking today!
Morning! I won't be drinking with y'all today.  Got plenty of chores to do and I won't make time for booze either! Nice to have so much of my life back! 
I will NOT be drinking with all 80000 of you today!!!!
I will not drink today. I will continue skinning my knuckles taking the exhaust manifolds off my Camaro so I can install headers. And taking the kids (they are older) to It at the theaters.
I  will not drink today. Weekends can be tough but I will not give in!
Not drinking today!
not drinking today
Not drinking with y'all today!!!  
I will not drink today! My sincere thanks to all who give of their time to run this sub. It's very much appreciated.
Not drinking today y'all.
Not drinking today. Playing softball and golf. 
Having a wonderful Saturday sober with my kids- I won't be messing it up by drinking today no way!!..Have a great weekend :)
I have to start somewhere so I'm starting here today. It's a beautiful fall day and I'm not drinking today!
I will not drink today.
I'm not drinking today! Yesterday I made a kind of silly choice: I went to a bar with a friend and had two NA beers. It was fun; but tbh it felt too much like what I do when I drink (minus the drunkenness of course). I'm grateful I made it out but it's already got me fantasizing ("well maybe I can just have 2 lighter beers instead...") nope! My sobriety is more important than anything else. I'm grateful I had my meeting last night to hold me down...Anyway yeah cheers to not drinking with you all today!
  another one down! Let's stay strong and keep it going friends!
Not drinking TODAY!!!
Today is my eleventy-first day of sobriety!(tip of the hat to Bilbo Baggins) I will not drink alcohol today!

Let's do this day 9! I will not drink with you all today!
I will not drink today. 
Woke up this morning rather than regaining consciousness. Had a burp after breakfast and was surprised to not smell booze. I will not drink with you today.  
Day 264 not drinking today with u. .Can anyone help let me know how to put my days next to my name? Is it the badge?
I have literally no plans. What am I going to do with my day?..I won't drink with y'all today!
Good morning! I will not drink today. Ugh- getting a late start to the day. Time to get moving!! Have a great day everyone!  
I will not drink today. 
I sure as heck won't drink today! I am however making myself a soberversary cake!

I will not drink with you all today! Waking up today is drastically different than last Saturday! 
OH happy Saturday. I won't drink with you today.
Heading to the gym for legs day... Still better than a hangover. 
Checking in having a bit of FOMO because my DH is going out for drinks with his new boss. It's like I'm not jealous of the booze just what it represents does that make sense?  
Good morning SD. For the 149th day I will not drink today. Sept 21 marked the end of my first sober Summer and in fact my first sober season. Tomorrow is another milestone 5 months. I spent way too much time trying to figure out the last time I went 5 months with absolutely no alcohol. Finally decided it must have been about June 1994 when I was 19. At some point that month I got a killer buzz with a couple friends made a bit of an ass out of myself (friend cut me off) and have not had more than 3-4 months sober ever since.   Now I am sober and I am not a 19 year old idiot. No wonder I feel like the best version of myself ever!  Lol
Good.  Not drinking today.
I'm not drinking today. 
I will not drink with you all today! And will feel better tomorrow because of it. ..I worked at a concert yesterday where I saw several people who were hammered.  A few were drug out of the place. I was reminded of the shame and terrible hangovers I sometimes felt the day after drinking...It was a reminder that I am happy not to be drinking!
I will not drink today.
everyday I wake up sober I am grateful to have not drank the previous day. It encourages me to keep on. Another day of not drinking for me thanks SD! 
I will not drink today
It's a lazy Saturday for me and I won't drink with you today. I'll be checking in frequently as the hours roll past.

The coffee maker at work has been broken all week and I keep forgetting so I've been getting crappy gas station coffee every morning. Today I made my own and it is making me so so happy. It's so strong and dark and rich and I think I'm in love. ..Went to a bonfire last night. Didn't drink anything but water. 
I will not drink today! 
I am not drinking with you today!

WELCOME WEEKEND- I will not drink with you!  :)
Today I will finish "spring cleaning" the house.  Then tonight I will be attending an End Addiction Recovery Walk.  I'm going to spend my day being productive and positive!..I will NOT be drinking with you today!
Can't get much worse. Even if it does get worse that worse would only be made  4642457755 times worse by drinking. No telling what will happen today. The only thing I do know is that I will not drink today...I will not drink with you today. .Topochico Cheers! 
Day two for me. Feel pretty good  a little head ache but I think a glass of water should fix that right up. Going to be working an a personal fan/art project for fun today. Hopefully I can get it all done so I can spend sunday with the S.O. Have a great day Everyone! .
Day 7 today!  Looking forward to not drinking! .Going on a hike though it is 39 degrees this morning... Brrrrr.... 
Count me in :)
I will not drink today. 
If I finish today I will have 2 weeks!  The cravings have been very manageable lately and it feels like it's getting easier.  I am starting to get sort of depressed for reason other than drinking.  I think this is normal as my life is no longer revolving around being drunk/hungover.   So I'm probably starting to notice the real problems in my life again.  I will not drink today!
Not drinking today
I pledge too
I won't be drinking today!
What's going on friends!? Happy Saturday. Got a hot date in a couple hours. This sober thing is kinda cool. 
Feeling great today! on break at work picked up a half day last night. Looking forward to fiddle playing reading art fundamentals and painting and play time with my little girl. Already enjoying a giant mate' latte but will be looking forward to drinking tea all day long! Life is good when you have good tea. Good I am so very grateful  was able to pick up some work today so I can make money for my family but also have time to do the things I like to do. I have complete power over alcohol through my decision making: I will choose to not poison my body nor my mind today I will eat healthy vegan foods today I will not put ethanol in my mouth today!
I'm not going to drink today
I will not drink today.
So many great insights on SD today.  I'm inspired to dig deeper into why I've numbed out for so many years. For now though it's "one day at a time". I've been binging on cookies and feel bloated. I've had a nasty headache for two days.  I don't normally get headaches.  Am I still detoxing after a week?  I'm drinking about 4 La Croix per night to "normalize" sobriety by having a bubbly in my hand.  But the headache is discouraging. Guess I'll try an few advil just for today.  Sluggish brain and body.  I will not drink with anyone today. Not me not you.
I am not drinking today. 
Not today.
I will not drink today even though I will unavoidably be around a lot of drinkers tonight. I got my ginger beer my ale 8 my San Pel and I'm good to go.
I will not drink today! Already had a healthy breakfast and did 2 loads of laundry. Perfect weekend day
I won't drink today 
Last night was a bit of a struggle for me but I didn't drink. And I'm not today!

One more day and I'm half-way to double digits! I will not drink with you today. 
I've loved having you host this u/IDoneDo! I keep your before and after pics in my mind for inspiration...It's a beautiful fall Saturday morning here. Enjoying tea and toast while SO watches LC vs. Liverpool. I'm feeling fine and ready not to drink with all of you today.
I won't be drinking with you tonight!  Keep up the good fight!
I will not drink with you today 
Feeling great today. I'm trading in my job for grad school officially today. Get to tell my old boss that I am happy to share some celebratory nachos but he can keep the margaritas. 24 more hours!
Not today 
It's my birthday! I surprised my son's gf at her soccer game and am camping by myself for the weekend (with the pup of course). Why the f*ck would I mess that all up with alcohol??
I will not drink today 
It's been 48 hours since my last drink. I won't drink for another 24 hours. Then I'll be at 72.

I've had a couple good days in a row. Today...Not so good. I've got a family dinner tonight and there's no lack of drinking at those. BUT... Bad day or no... I will not drink with you today...Make this choice with me..Stay bold. Stay empowered. Stay true..I love you.
Day 4 is in the books and day five is half over.  And this is very good.  In a little cranky right now but it's really more about doing chores on a Saturday than anything else.  Soon I will read and take a nap.
Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend!
I will not drink today 
I won't drink today

My first Saturday sober in years (probably over a decade if I'm honest). So happy to not be drinking with you all today!
  
Day 4 of withdrawals mostly just headache and digestive issues now. The shakes stopped the depression is easing up a little. Thinking about drinking makes me sick. Trouble sleeping last night. But I will not drink with you today.

heading to a bar to watch a friend's show but thrilled to say i will not be drinking with you today. 
Today I completed a Dri-Tri @ orange theory (which is a 2000m row 5k and 300 body weight reps) AND went to hot yoga afterwards! I would have NEVER been able to do any of that while still drinking. I feel AMAZING!! Better than any glass of wine ever consumed. I won't drink with you all today!!    
Not drinking today!

54 days of not drinking. That's milestone ... but hell lately it's hard. But no drinking today. 
A little late in the day but I still wanted to check in. No drinking will occur today!
This was the first Saturday in a long time that I've woken up at home entirely sober and looking forward to the day. I got up early had some coffee and then started to plan my day. Another first - my plans didn't involve waiting for the liquor store to open or for myself to sober up enough to drive and restock...I went shopping visited a local market and then made tacos for dinner. Now it's time to Netflix and chill! I will not drink with you today. :)
I will not drink today.
