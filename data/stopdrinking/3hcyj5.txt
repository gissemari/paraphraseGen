This has been a pretty crazy month for me. There have been a few things that could have triggered a relapse in the past but which I have got past without too much difficulty thankfully. ..A lot of hrmming and hawwing over study decisions and moving away from my family etc have changed and I'm going to be staying locally at home for a few more months at least while I get settled into my new classes and soon even a nice part time gardening job with an employer who is being wonderfully flexible about when I can start and has said they definitely want me on board. ..As ever I'm going through moods and changing my mind about things quite frequently but I'm doing OK and I'm doing it sober.
