I relapsed Sunday and like 5 times in the past 2 weeks. I decided that i wanted to drink on sunday and of course i thought i could control it. Went over the whole moderation speech ive had with myself many times before. I bought a 30 pack of pbr to have for a few days a week but not every day. I drank 10 and threw away the rest this morning. Had i not thrown them away i probably would have drank most of it today despite my dream then bought more tomorrow to make sure i had enough after i polizhed off that 30 pack.. Slowly but surely im overcoming this addiction. I may slip and fall but im getting back up. ..On to my dream. After passing out i woke up at around 5am and went back to sleep. Had a very vivid dream of the fallout of my drinking. In the dream (which i thought was reality) i woke up from a blackout where i trashed my apartment causing lots of property damage i couldnt afford to repair that really pissed me off so i went to go get another beer. while still a bit drunk i accidently kicked my dog in the head trying to pass her to go down the stairs (she likes to lay at the top) causing her to fall down the stairs and have multiple seizures. Thankfully it was just a dream but it really put things into perspective because it was 100% possible. Nothing about it made me think it wasnt real. Especially considering something bad happens almost every time ive drank within the last month. I was so relieved when i woke up to realize it was a dream. ..Since ive been clear headed a lot more recently than i have been in the past 3 years ive decided to go to school and work towards having a six figure career. Ive mostly just been going through the motions for these 3 years with no ambition. Wake up no earlier than noon go to a low paying cooking job get wasted every night after work repeat...Its like 4am so post is pretty rambley but just wanted to put some stuff out there...Just for the record nothing has ever happened to my dog because of my drinking. The way my post is worded could make people think stuff has happened in the past.

&gt; I may slip and fall but im getting back up...Me too. I have found that having a plan has helped tremendously when the thoughts of drinking become too loud to just ignore. ..As is often said here "nothing changes if nothing changes". What led up to the decision to drink on Sunday? What can/will you do differently next time?
