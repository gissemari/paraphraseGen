Hello all ..I've been thinking a lot (which I'm able to do when I'm not drinking) and I really wish that I could go back in time to stop myself from drinking alone for the first time. I was a shy kid in high school but when I was drunk suddenly I was friends with everyone and having a great time ! Fast forward to 18yo me amorous of Hemingway and I was just bored and thought that the same logic would apply to being at home and frankly it seemed to when it was only a very rare occasion. ..Going to uni made things a lot worse I was living on my own and didn't have to worry about my parents asking questions. Drinking alone became more common but the social scene was good enough that most of the time I wanted to drink there was something to do. Eventually I started drinking alone more and more often and I couldn't be arsed to spend time going places and paying for the mark up in bars. ..Fast forward to drinking Eclectique1: three beers a bottle of wine and a variable amount of whisky on any given night. I didn't want to have really serious relationships or friendships because this would cut into my drinking time. Exercise and diet became non existant because let's be honest nobody wants to go on a run with a hangover. My flat was a complete pigsty I only needed my drinking chair to be free and a relatively clean glass. 2/3 of my "food" budget was going towards booze food was only something to stave off or nurse a hangover. To put it simply I was missing out on life. ..So as the title indicates I wish that I could go back in time and tell my former self what would happen to the moment that I deem the biggest mistake of my life. I'm not even sure if I would have believed myself but such is youth. When I look at my life sober and my life drunk I can't put into words how exponentially better the former is. Last night I relapsed and sometimes I have tendency to tell myself "well might as well keep going" but not today. ..I will not drink with you today

We cannot go back in time and in my opinion we barely have control over the future but we can change now. And this is great. IWNDWYT!
