Hi everyone!..I'm quitting smoking for real finally. It's now been.... I dunno 34 hours since my last cigarette? Something like that. Back in the day there used to be a guy on here who talked about how when quit drinking he made a spreadsheet with a box for every hour of the day and he would cross every hour off as he stayed sober. That's about what this feels like. I'm white-knuckling it...It's actually scary to be in this place again. I haven't had alcohol in a couple of years my badge represents days sober from everything (drugs have also been a problem for me.) I haven't been struggling with urges to smoke weed since quitting and it's been a while since I've had any real thoughts of drinking but holy shit. My brain is performing *backflips* doing all sorts of crazy addict talk at me about why it'd be okay and actually make *sense* for me to keep smoking. ..I spent my entire therapy session yesterday talking about quitting smoking and working through the compulsion and there were a couple of times that I pictured myself walking out of there and going to 7-Eleven and buying a pack of cigarettes. I honestly wasn't sure that I was going to make it home without smoking until I did. I am the embodiment of powerlessness over cigarettes right now. ..This feels like quitting drinking in so many ways. I've been smoking like how I drank. I kept telling myself that I was gonna stop but then I kept finding myself buying more packs. I saw more and more how fleeting the pleasure was even as I became more entrenched in my addiction. And quitting just gets harder and harder as my use becomes more compulsive...I know that I can break the back of this in a couple of days. Just like with quitting drinking I know that I just have to get through the first couple of days and it will never be this painful again. But I also know that it'll be easy to get lulled back by  gentle cravings after the memory of the pain of quitting fades...I knew that I had a problem with alcohol for **years** and I kept drinking without making any *real* efforts to quit. I just honestly couldn't see how the addiction was twisting my thinking. I thought that I was making the decision to keep drinking. But as the saying goes first I took a drink and then the drink took me. I came up with stories in my brain to justify what I was doing and pretend that I was still in the driver's seat but that's all. I was not in control. ..I was powerless to stop on my own. It kills me to say that but it's true. As long as I was on my own I couldn't quit drinking. I only ever started making traction after I started coming here and then as I started getting real life support through AA and therapy. As long as I stayed on my own and kept my thoughts in my head my brain could figure out ways to say why I  had  to drink why it would be better to delay quitting. ..It's the same flipping thing with smoking. There's a ton of reasons that I don't want to smoke and it's not something that really benefits me in any way. But I'm telling myself stories in my head about why it's fine for now. And it isn't that's just my addiction speaking. So I'm getting it out of my head and sharing what's going on with me with others. ..I've also turned it over to my Higher Power. I heard someone at a meeting the other day talking about a God Box so I googled it and it's a container of some sort where you put notes in it with things that you want to get out of your head and turn over to your Higher Power. I don't know that it's any more effective than other ways of turning things over but I'm pretty visual and I like being able to picture things in concrete ways so that aspect of it really appeals to me. And you can keep writing things down as you need to even if they're already in there. ..I already had a sorta fancy little shoebox sized box that I was just using to store random crap in so I cleaned it out and made it my Higher Power box. I'm digging it. It helps to get things out of my brain if nothing else...It'll take quite a while for it to be filled (although I'm making a decent start I have quite a backlog.) And I imagine once it gets filled it'll be interesting to go back through and read all of the hopes worries and troublesome things. I do add a  thy will not my will in everything  at the end since I really don't know what I'm doing in life. And I say thanks  cos I am appreciative of the idea of being able to ask for help...Anyway I hope that you all are well. May we all find freedom from whack-a-mole addiction and the bondage of self...Ginger_Sprout Out.

Good luck with this - it's hard and so worth it...You might be on the lookout for Nicotine Anonymous which is harder to find than other groups but which helped me...for one thing its a safe place to be a little nuts...
