I'm only on day 2 (with more frequent stretches of sobriety lately) but I'm really struggling with depression and anxiety.. I had pretty severe postpartum depression and anxiety and I feel like that is still lingering. I go to therapy as often as I can afford. I took Zoloft for a few months and had terrible side effects...I would love to try another antidepressant but I am currently trying to conceive and Zoloft is the only safe option. I'm not doing that again. ..I work in a pretty toxic environment. Another job is not an option right now for several reasons. I'm used to drinking after work to have something to look forward to after a crappy day. And I'd drink to numb the depression and anxiety. ..I don't know what to do. I'm trying to focus on healthy habits. I'm eating right exercising and meditating. What else can I do? Will this dark cloud ever lift? Because right now being numb sounds better than being so sad.
