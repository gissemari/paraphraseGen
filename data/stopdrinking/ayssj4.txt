So this is my first post ever got a typo in my username seeing if I can fix that...So anyway I was a heavy whiskey drinker for about 3 years. Hospitalized probably 7 or 8 times. Once the doctor said It was miracle I wasn't in a coma with how high my BAC was.I was in a very dark place worried about my job no vehicles from DUI. My work was very supportive and suggested I enter a 28 day program which changed my life...In the past 5 months I've admittedly drank about 4 times which is a huge improvement. Unfortunately one of this times was Tuesday. I started drinking on Friday and went on a bender...To anyone struggling with cravings use every tool you possibly can to get over them. Withdrawals are the worst I've slept maybe 2 hours in the past 3 nights. It may be controllable the first time but you're always rolling the dice and moderation has never worked for me...One of my best tools has been exercise 6 days a week. A grueling workout really relieves some stress and helps with sleep. I've recently started outpatient counseling journaling and will be seeing my doctor for anti craving medication soon. Really hoping this time sticks...I think my biggest obstacle is after a few weeks I feel so good and so much energy that it feels unnatural from drinking so long. It's like I have a nature of self sabotage I figure drinking will relieve some stress and I'll just have one. Doesn't work. I go on a bender and have withdrawals so it becomes a week long affair...Anyway that's my story happy to be here with you.

I'm day 3 as well. Only chronic drinker for about my last 3 years of college so my withdrawals aren't so bad but I have to say I admire your strength. This has been a rough fight for simply 48 hours. Keep it moving and remember we are here for you...IWNDWYT 
Good for you!  Hang in there it gets easier I know it sounds doubtful but just wait until it happens to you.  I like your name spelling mistake included.  It's mysterious now.  I'm so happy not to be drinking with you
