I'll start off by saying how alcoholism runs in my family.My mother is a alcoholic and has been sober for 28 years. She decided to become sober a year after I was born. .My father on the other hand refuses to admit he has a problem or ever has. He is an extremely abusive person both physically and verbally.I personally from a young age said I would never have an addiction problem because of him. But at 12 I had my first drink since then I've always felt the need to either have a drink or something that can help me cope with every day stress. I quit smoking weed and other drugs at 20 when I woke up one day and said enough is enough. But after about a week of being completely sober I found myself every day with a bottle in my hands. 2 years ago I found the love of my life and couldnt have been happier. The problem is my drinking didnt slow down it got worse. We had a horrible break up and my drinking was the main cause. I found myself angry everytime I drank and she would always be the target of my destructive nature. Now I never laid hands on her but I was abusive verbally. The following mornings I would always wake up like nothing was wrong and she would try to tell me how I was becoming my father. Which she knew would kill me but of course I refused to listen. And eventually i had one drunken stupor where i looked at her phone and got mad because she went the movies with one of her guy friends that shes known since she was 8. I kicked her out at 3 am in the morning because of this. I instantly regretted it. My heart was broken and I knew I had fucked up. That was it for her. She came to the house with her mother and got everything that was hers. I knew she was gone and I wasnt going to get her back. Instead of trying to better myself I would drink until I would pass out. I would blow her phone up while doing this and eventually she blocked me. That just made me drink more. Until one day I woke up just like I did at 20 and said fuck this and threw the last of the liquor in my place out. I didnt completely quit but I would limit myself to a max of 2 beers socially. Now of course that wasnt enough within 2 days and had a bad relapse and found myself passed out in the shower one night. I got out of the shower looked at myself in the mirror and hated myself and said nope I'm done drinking or I might as well die. I tell myself every day I wont be my father. I'm back to my happy outgoing self and loving life more and more every day. It's been almost a month now sober and looking forward to staying this way...Not sure if yall care but my ex is currently back in my life now if only as friends. I'm extremely grateful to her for giving me another chance to be a part of her life. .Second chances dont come along a lot and I'm taking full advantage at it now.

Personally I don't think that genes have a huge role to play. My father had a problem as did my mother. I swore I would not be like them but guess what!!..Anyway I believe that a lot of it is learned behavior as a child . Counseling can really help my drinking was a symptom not The Problem once I realized and addressed the underlying issues things got better...I learned everything I could about alcohol as a starting point. Sometimes I'm grateful for my struggle with alcohol because it helped me change other parts of my life for the better. I hope this helps
