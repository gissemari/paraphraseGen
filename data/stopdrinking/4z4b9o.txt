My badge is not true. I only made it two weeks last time I tried to quit. I've drank at least 6 beers a day every day since (usually more like 8-9). I've also tended to drink more liquor this last go around. ..Yesterday I stopped drinking at noon but had been drinking hard for 4 days. I woke up in the middle of the night with sweats and dizziness and couldn't go back to sleep. The feeling lasted all day but I made it through work and did not drink tonight but I am fucking scared. I've never felt withdrawals like this. I can't seem to stick with sobriety and I'm losing hope. I'm at day 1 again because I have a problem. I am an alcoholic. I want to be a productive emotionally and physically well person again. I've written this same post 999 times before so it's hard to take myself seriously. ..That's all. Have a good night SD

What do you think it's going to take for you to take yourself seriously?
