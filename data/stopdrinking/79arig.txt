I'm not sure what to write. I have a lot to say but my brain doesn't seem to be working quite so well this morning so I'll keep this short. ..April 9th 2016 I quit drinking for the first time. I took 2 months off from school and made the change. Up till this point I was drinking excessively every day for several years. 20+ beers a day starting when I woke up and continuing until I passed out. I was surprised at how quickly I started to feel better once I stopped. By the end of even just the first week I was over majority of the physical withdrawals. I actually felt proud of myself for the first time in as long as I could remember...I started back into my classes and stayed sober for a year. I resisted the urge to go out and party with friends I made it through my birthday and the holidays without drinking and it felt really good. Around the end of 2016 however I began to struggle with depression and feelings of resentment. I've been doing so good why shouldn't  I be allowed a drink or 2 after a long day? I never really talked to anyone about how I was feeling I just tried to throw myself into work and forget about it...In March 2017 I got a job while still in school. This is when I fucked up. My entire life since age 17 I always drank after work and sure enough this was a habit still lurking in the depths of my mind. It started out "innocently" enough; one day I had 2 tall cans after work. This quickly spiraled out of control with both the frequency of my drinking as well as the amount being consumed.  Over this last summer I took another couple weeks off intending to quit again but was not as committed as I had been in the previous year so ultimately my success was limited. By August 2017 I was back to full blown alcoholism...I quit school quit my job and didn't talk to my family for weeks. I was on a hell of a bender...Since this time I have made several more lackluster attempts to quit never making it through more than a day or 2 before making an exception for myself and allowing myself to drink. Exceptions are a dangerous thing...I can't keep going on like this. I know I need to stop. I feel like a piece of shit like fucking human waste but just yesterday a thought entered my at the time still intoxicated brain. I realized that every day that I don't drink I can feel good about myself just for having stayed sober that day. It doesn't matter what else I did or didn't do just so long as I abstain from alcohol I have a reason to feel good...I didn't drink yesterday and I will not drink today. My life is a mess but as long as I stay sober it will get better little by little...I'm really glad I discovered reddit over the last few months and I hope that this sub will encourage me to keep fighting the good fight.

Hey sounds like you are really having a difficult time at the moment and I really hope things start to get a lot easier and better for you...Keeping drinking will never make things any better-always worse. Alcohol just keeps taking even when theres nothing left to take. You have made a great decision to try again. Its not easy and it doesn't magically make life sunshine and roses overnight but little by little you will start to feel the fog lifting...Just keep taking it day by day and you will get there-never doubt you are making the best decision of your life...Good luck my friend Im rooting for you!
This post is incredibly powerful to me. I think your reptile brain has the right idea. Someone asked me this recently and I'll ask you too I guess. Why do you want to stop drinking? Aside from feeling like human waste of course. What do you remember from the first time that still stays with you?..Thinking of you internet friend.
