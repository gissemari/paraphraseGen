A week or so ago I drank and woke up with guilt despite it being only a beer; I spent the rest of the night with a craving so strong that if the bars had not all been closed I would have gone on a bender.  Had gone a month without drinking and before that much longer...But tonight I went out with friends to the Red Bull Crashed Ice event; then back to a good friends house were a few people were drinking a few were not.  We played some games and honestly at one point I was laughing so hard I had tears were coming out of my eyes...I went into the night with a lot of trepidation and even had a friend I hadn't seen in a while try to pour me shots a few times with the "c'mon man! celebrate!"...But nope didn't.  And I'm back home in bed clear headed about to watch some netflix.  I had a great night I remember it all I don't doubt my behavior and I wont feel like shit tomorrow and as I left everyone was telling me how they can't wait to have me back over...all with NO DRINKING!..Thanks everyone at /stopdrinking ..
