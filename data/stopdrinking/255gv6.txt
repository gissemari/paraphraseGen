In my dream I was walking through this big room with bodies littered about on the floor. I thought it looked like a battlefield but no they were just drunk and passed out. Then on a pedestal in the middle of the room was a bottle of booze. I was suddenly dressed like Indiana Jones and thought to myself that I could put something on the pedestal like in the movie and steal the booze. Then I remembered how that movie ended and booked it the hell out of there because I knew the big boulder would come crush me if I stayed there.

Interesting dream.  Sounds like the kinds of dreams I have.
That is awesome! Did you carry a whip? From the same era in my dream I am Hot Lips Houlihan from MASH.
ha!
aww man I had a drinking dream last night too. I could taste it in my mouth. Gross. 
I keep having coke dreams. Really pisses me off. I wake up sad but then feel proud. Stupid dreams!
