It's great to fully feel and experience getting my ass kicked by this extremely tough project. And I can't wait to treat myself to some Cinco de Mayo cupcakes when it's done on Friday. ..Sobriety is the bomb dot com. I raise my cup of keurig coffee to all of my brothers and sisters in the struggle. One day at a time we got this

Well I gave up coffee a few months before booze; but I raise my perrier to you ;) Its great to go in the office first thing and not spend the first hour on Monday (and tuesday and wed) recovering form the weekend binge.
Woo hoo!
Yes.  Eat a cupcake for me!
Totally rocks 
Hell yes! Suddenly I'm in competition with myself to see how much I can accomplish. It's made a huge difference to my professional performance and people have noticed! ..Proud not to drink with you tonight
I came here to post the same thing! A couple of weeks in and I am now starting to pay attention and feel less dreadful. I also want to do the work well rather than cutting corners. Feels refreshing.
Awesome! Go you! I look forward to being more clear &amp; centered at work. It takes me awhile to get settled I'm fidgety easily distracted anxious. I start to tucker out at around 2:30-3pm. Then fighting cravings. I know it will get better day by day. Not drinking with you tonight! 
The last time I drank I became disturbingly aware of how it was separating me from the world. From my family friends work nature you name it. I finally feel like the barrier has come down. Rock on and here's to a newfound feeling of presence.
