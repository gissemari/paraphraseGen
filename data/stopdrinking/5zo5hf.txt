My dog died yesterday and he was like a son to me I got too sad lost my mind and drank away my sorrows. I know its not a good thing to do but that is what i did and i regret it alot now the day after. I was clean for 3 weeks before that...Does my relapse yesterday make those 3 weeks completely pointless? Of course I will not drink again and return to the stopdrinking-grind......... =(

Not in my opinion.  Any sober day is a good day in my books.  The fact that you had a slipup in your grief does not negate that you strung together 3 weeks.  You can get right back onto the pony and ride happily off into a wonderful sunset.  Hope to see you there.
I relapsed once too. Know that you know what to expect it will be easier the second time around. Don't wait too long though. It took me two weeks to try and quit again. But here I am Day 6
It does not make the previous 3 weeks meaningless.  But I think if I was relapsing I'd be questioned my approach.  What went wrong?  Why did I turn to alcohol?..
Your liver thanks you for those three weeks!
I had a lot of day ones as do most people here. With practice your coping skills will get stronger and you more and more resilient.  I am so sorry to hear about your puppy. :( hugs!
Sober days are good so don't worry about the slip up and get back on the sober path. If you try moderation it's gonna be harder to get back on track. 
sorry for the loss of your dog. .I dont think your three weeks are pointless
So sorry for your loss!  I lost a furry son a few years ago and know that deep sadness...The only thing affected by the slip up is a number.  The work you did still "counts" and your epic bounce back is all the more impressive.....
