Thank you all for your kind words on my post yesterday. So so helpful. I'm grateful for all of the support. ..I came home and my boyfriend said he wanted to treat me to dinner. I was a little worried for a second because I wasn't supposed to drink tonight. Then I realized wait I don't have to. So I didn't. I did taste a sip of my BF's beer but that's it. And we had a great time. As we were paying he pushed his drink towards me like he wanted me to help him finish it but I must have had a look on my face because he immediately pulled it back towards him. He is supportive but sometimes doesn't understand my struggle but he tries. He's starting to get it. Also that meant I could drive to dinner instead of us walking in the freezing weather so that we both could drink. ..I will not drink with you tonight!

Challenge accepted and conquered - congrats!
Awesome job! Man isn't it cool to just be able to drive somewhere whenever the hell you need to?
I went to dinner tonight and didn't have a drink : D Club soda with lime. Actually very tasty.
