I am not sure how this works ( ... how every anxious person begins their post I know) but I really do need help. I have been trying to stop drinking for a few years and it hasn't worked. I thought it was getting better that I was getting better but I drank today and yesterday and the day before that. I drink until it becomes a problem and then I stop for a bit and then start again and just keep cycling through. I am in a bit of a tight spot - I'm American and I live abroad so no family no close friends. I live with my boyfriend ( who also drinks.. pretty much daily now ) and we have talked about this and he has  tried  to help but I wind up drinking on my own and it just gets bad. We fight and shit like that. I am financially dependent on him at the moment because I am finishing my degree here (I live in Germany). Alcoholism runs in my family but we are not close so I don't think anyone would respond if I reached out. I also just don't feel comfortable talking to my family about this. I have struggled making friends here which probably has a lot to do with the alcoholism. I have come to the conclusion that I need to stop drinking permanently so here I am. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;I drank today..I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
Herzlich Wilkommen!..I used to live in Germany for a while when I was a student and am currently living far from home too without much of a support network so I understand how difficult and isolating it can be... this sub has helped a lot!..I had several attempts to quit all on my own and that never stuck for very long so I had to get serious about it... With the right knowledge tools and support it's been totally do-able and I wish I'd done it years ago.....My first step was to speak to my doctor openly and honestly about my drinking and I was given medication to help make withdrawal safer and easier... Your mileage may vary.....There are also medicines that can help with cravings block the 'buzz' from alcohol or make you sick if you do drink... that could be something worth exploring with a doctor if you think it might help.....Here's a couple of resources which were really useful:..The book/YouTube Channel '*This Naked Mind*' and the book '*Alcohol Explained*' really helped me understand my drinking problem and gave me some useful tools to stop and *stay* stopped without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing out on anything.....Having support via this sub was a game-changer for me but there are also recovery programmes IRL such as AA or SMART which you could explore too... there might be English-Speaking meetings near you somewhere depending on how good your German is but I think SMART also have online meetings you could look into.....When people with drinking problems talk to *other people* with drinking problems in recovery *everyone benefits*... ..Addictive tendencies can also run in families it's very common and it often takes a few goes for sobriety to stick so don't be too hard on yourself......Hope that helps!..I won't drink with you today hope you'll stick around and let us know how you're doing?..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
