Day five and the cravings are real..So is the anxiety about being lonely and missing out. I deleted my Facebook because I know I suffer from a fear of missing out and depression. FB was giving me anxiety about not being asked to join parties and envy towards everyone else's life but mine. ..Now with quitting the booze I feel a bit more alone today and it sucks. I guess some days are better than others. Just looking for some support to be honest and maybe share some thoughts with you guys. ..Thanks. .

You're not alone! So many people here have been exactly where you are. And we're with you. But it's true this requires a different inward orientation for a while. And it's okay to just feel sad. But maybe you can turn your attention toward something you learn to love--making something building something learning something or growing something? Something that's just for you. 
Are there any AA meetings near you?
What works for me is 'changing the channel' in my mind. Remember why youre not drinking. Try put on some podcasts ie This Naked Mind &amp; move walk or get your heart pumping. Breathe &amp; pray.  IWNDWYT
Give it time it sounds like you're getting out and bring constructive with your time so that's really great!  Sometimes the best thing is to do the actions that are aligned with our goals and values and stick with it because we'll get more comfortable as we go.  5 days is great!  You're also just getting started you'll keep feeling better the longer you hang in there with your good choices.  That's the way it works   i will not drink with you today 
Get thee to a meeting like everybody is saying. Everyone on here has been just where you are. You can do it! And community awaits. Here and at that meeting.
