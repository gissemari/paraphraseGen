This is my first time here. I've been lurking though. I'm middle aged woman with a lovely life and an abuse problem. I've been struggling for a few years and had some successes and failures. I had stopped drinking and was loving life. I had one of the best vacations ever while sober. On my 60th day my Dad passed away unexpectedly. I started drinking that day and have been a mess since. My rationale has been; it's understandable Dad died. I'm from a big Irish family so I was by no means the only one. .I have to stop! I'm a binge drinker and don't drink during the week but make up for it on Friday!!! I feel like crap I'm so disgusted with myself. .We're going out for my daughter's birthday tonight. I'm not going to drink. .Who's with me?

Lost my dad suddenly a few years back. It's a real world shaker for sure. I still get the wind knocked out of me sometimes when I think about it. Sending you much empathy. And I'm with you; I will not drink with you tonight! 
I'm with you.

Thanks to you all!! Could definitely feel the positive vibes when I asked for water with dinner. A lovely time was had!! Thanks again!!
