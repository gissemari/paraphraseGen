..Don't get me wrong this group helps it really really helps. Reading "This naked mind" helped as well it gave me the answers I was looking for . But at the end of the day it was ME... I did it. ..I was was the one that made the decision to quit. I was the one that white knuckled it for a month but hung on. It's me that walks past the liquor store every day but doesn't go in. I'm the one that says NO every single day and night when I go out... me. ..If I ever relapse I will have no one to blame but myself; but for now I choose not to drink. It is me that makes the decisions good and bad. The only person that can save my life is me. ..I know it helps to have a support network I get that; but I am the one  the only one that is ultimately responsible for my own sobriety me. .
