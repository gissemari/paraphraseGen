I think this is the first time in a year I've slept through the night without having to wake up and go pee.  (That's one of those famous "shocking" first lines in a novel intended to keep you reading... heh)..But seriously that's such a relief!  (Not as much as when I got up and actually went!  -  daboom-tisss :P - yeah I pretty much planned that bad joke from the start. Sorry!)..Perhaps my sense of humour is returning?  (good/bad - you be the judge of that lol) ..In any case I feel a whole lot better than I did a week ago.  ..But I'm still not great. ..**Here are some things I feel that could be improved:**..I'm overweight    .My flexibility is terrible - bending over to pick things up is a struggle... so is just walking when I wake up in the mornings.     .Body is sore and aches.     .Memory is terrible - it's been bad for years but I'm hoping my ability to recall things like um basic words during a conversation comes back.      ...**Here are some positives though:**..I don't feel suicidal anymore!    .I don't feel an enormous weight of guilt in my chest anymore.     .I can breath without smelling smoke from the countless cigarettes I consumed the night before    .I have the energy to do basic stuff so my house is not a complete mess    .My attention span has improved to a point where I can actually complete work related tasks    .I'm motivated to achieve small goals on a day to day basis (this is how I've been planning stuff)    ..Actually... that's a point.  The biggest and most useful tool I've used during this process (aside from just being *here* all the time (That's rule #1) is to: ..**Step 1:** Find the most *urgent* thing and put all your attention into that until it's done...**Step 2:** Find the most *useful* thing and put all your attention into that until it's done...Turns out that **not drinking** satisfies both those criteria nicely! ..In a work/productivity sense though... I've also followed these steps to get myself out of the shit. ..I have tackled a whole lot of stuff this week just looking back.  ..My business/work is not in any immediate jeopardy..My health is bad but I'm no longer in borderline need of hospitalisation.  .My mental state has improved remarkably (self-esteem risen).I feel a lot more in control of my day. ..It gives me confidence that if I just keep sober and keep doing the urgent things followed up by the important things then I'll be ok!  I'll keep moving forward.  ..This... is a workable model.  This is simple enough to remember.  This I CAN do. ..~ ***Stay Sober*** ..
