Go to a doctor and have medically assisted detox. 
See a doctor there are meds which can help.  Also supervised withdrawal aka detox is a thing.  If funds are an issue Available from health dept but not 5 star accommodations 
Go.  To.  A.  Doctor.  
There's a lot of anti seizure meds they can give you. Definitely don't wanna have one while driving. IWNDWYT 
The only thing that any one of us can do is to tell you to see a doctor. We have strict rule against seeking medical advice on this site because no one here is qualified to give it and your post has been removed. Withdrawal can be dangerous even deadly and should be supervised by a professional. If you are unwilling or unable to see a doctor you might try calling the National Alcohol Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) and see if they can give you support.
