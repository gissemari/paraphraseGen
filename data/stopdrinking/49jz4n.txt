I know relapses happen but I really want this to be my last Day 1.  I think going to the meeting helped

That's some resolve! Hungover and going to a meeting!..How did the meeting help?
Such a smart move! This CAN be your last Day 1. :)
Glad you did something about slipping up! What happened and what will you do differently this time?
Returning to recovery even after a slip has been really difficult for me in the past; you did the absolute right thing! I know you might feel like shit today but you'll feel so much better tomorrow.
I'm happy for you that you went to a meeting. I hope you can go again tomorrow that it gives you support. Sending positive thoughts your way.

I try not to say "I want this to be my last day 1". I try to say things like "This WILL be my last damn day drinking!"  I know it seems silly but to me it is a huge difference in mindset.  I left no door open!  Everybody who is important in my life now knows I will never drink again.  I am accountable to them and more importantly to myself.  You can do this!  If I can then anybody can.  That is the truth!  
The longer I go without alcohol in my life the more I know that I don't have another day 1 in me so this day one was my last day one... I have no illusions about being a normal drinker or someone who can moderate.  I am an all or nothing kinda gal so my last day one was 494 days ago......and there is no going back .... Good luck with your day 1 and 2 and 3 etc.  .
