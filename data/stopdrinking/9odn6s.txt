My wife used to help me get up the stairs at night because I was stumbling around or falling over drunk.  Even if I didn't get that drunk (tolerance is so high) I stall drank way too much and would say mean things or just be nasty.  I would always have to apologize and sometimes I wouldn't even remember what I said.  I go to bed WITH her now instead of standing in the kitchen like a zombie for an hour pouring  one more .   ..I just made it through another weekend sober!  Not easy but IDK why we have to just  survive  or  make it through  the weekend.  If you dont drink all weekend you are absolutely CRUSHING IT!  It is a struggle everyday but because I feel better sleep better look better and treat my family better there is no just  surviving another weekend .  The weekend is actually way more enjoyable sober.  So heres to another sober day! (raising my Lemon La Croix).   Have a great week SD!  IWNDWYT

To cute and too fantastic!..Thanks for this!
Sober weekends make Mondays easier which makes the rest of the week easier then BAM!  Back to another sober weekend.  It's so worth it.
