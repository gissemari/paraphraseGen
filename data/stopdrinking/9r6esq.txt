That I would start drinking for the weekend. Tonight has been the biggest struggle for me so far this time around but I'm proud to say that I've turned on Daredevil and drinking iced tea. I know this is only the beginning and the struggle will get more difficult but for tonight I'm happy with my choices. Waking up clear and not hungover will be a fantastic reward

@sojayn Hope you're staying strong sober buddy! Almost a week down    (ps - I can't tell if this tagged you but if not then I hope you see it! Lol)
Daredevil! I'm only 2 episodes in so far but I'm so happy Kingpin is back. Some nights you just got the itch especially this early. Just know that some random stranger online is proud of you. I will join you in sobriety tonight.
