It's Monday morning here and for those of you struggling through Sunday evening if I can do it you can do it....I had a packed weekend no where near enough time to do all the things I wanted to do.  Yeah I was tired but I wasn't groggy or unfocused.  I didn't stop working at 4.30pm just because I started drinking.  I was sewing last night until 9pm!...I had some serious 'wow I really need a drink' moments on Sunday but I pounded ice cold coke zero and got through.  It's Monday and I've got a bunch of stuff to face this week but feeling super positive.....I won't drink with you today!
