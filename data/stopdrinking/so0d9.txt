Hey..My head is pretty straight these days I've lost about 20 pounds since I stopped drinking work is going better my depression is gone...Got some problems happening at home though (about 400 miles away). My mum starting having heart problems last week then my sister collapsed at the weekend and is in hospital now my mum's drinking and behaving erratically. Whole family feels like it's coming to pieces...No point in me going to pieces though so I'm still going to try to stay cool and enjoy myself.  .

Taking a drink won't help any of those situations and in fact will impair your ability to deal with them.

Congrats on hitting 90 this week! That's a huge goal for me. Good luck with your family issues staying sober will only help you/them.
Hang tight. You can do this.
Congratulations. It's a big milestone. You have to remember - you know this I'm sure - drinking would make dealing with the family situation worse not better. When it was our coping strategy for everything for so long that reflex doesn't just go away though when hard times come along. 
I'm with you about 4 months also drinking wont help the problem but numb the feelings....its tough though stay with it!
