Last week I made a post about my relapse after 439 days of sobriety I went on a week long bender that started out with me trying to "moderate." It's been more challenging than I thought getting back on that wagon but in just a few days my sleep is returning to normal my skin is clearing up again (I completely forgot what alcohol was doing to my face) I've lost most of the bloating my appetite is returning to normal and my anxiety has lessened. I'm starting to feel normal again...I'm just happy to be sober. It's hard and at times very lonely but it's a much better life. Thank you everyone for your encouraging posts and support. I'm happy to be here.

my favorite part is when the appetite comes back. 
Lovely to see you back and doing so well!
Hey great to hear from you Unbeatable one! I remember your post...I'm so glad things are getting better for you. *Feeling normal* - isn't it awesome? And normal people just take it for granted.
