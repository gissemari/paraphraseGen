This isn't my first time going two weeks but it is my first time doing so and feeling like I can stay sober long term. Drink cravings are practically gone I feel like I've finally come to understand at a subconscious level that drinking is not an option. This has been cemented by not only the obvious repercussions my drinking had in the past but the disillusionment I've felt in every instance I've relapsed. It didn't make me feel better and gave me horrible anxiety for days. My anxiety has quelled but I've noticed it gets bad on the weekends. Not sure why but like clockwork Sat night it hits and I'll feel anxious the rest of the weekend.

Good job! I feel like I've been having a tough time on weekends too. Started reading *This Naked Mind* to really beat into me why the reasons for drinking are fallacies. I hope you continue to maintain your momentum.
Nice work! The first couple weeks is always the hardest.
