Ok- this may sound crazy; but I am very excited about this eclipse coming up. And I almost feel like it marks a new beginning for me in terms of true sobriety. I've been struggling off and on; but I think this is it and I'm going to latch on to this as a sign from above that I need to just stop. ..Because life will be (and you all have vouched for this and I've even experienced it) so much better sans alcohol.  This eclipse is once in 99 years (?)- which to me is a sign that someone or something above and beyond (whether you're religious or not)-is telling us all something. Sounds weird I know- but I'm going to leverage this as a kickstart to a new me!  ..Who's all with me here?!?!

Me too!

I'm gonna try. Resetting my badge. Now. Ugh
Oh shit! I didn't even think about these two aligning with my stopping too. Awesome! Here's to letting the darkness pass and embracing the light. 
Hey guys!!! So happy to see all the responses to the eclipse post. How is everyone doing?
