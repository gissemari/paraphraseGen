So I quit about two weeks ago  had a relapse though last Thursday when smash bros came out.  Other than that one night though I've been sober.  I feel better when I wake up but I've noticed something alarming.  I no longer have a sex drive.  I'm seeing this girl and she's great we have awesome chemistry and she knows what I'm going through and what not.  We haven't tried anything since we're still new to eachother.  But we have had some heavy make out sessions and nothing.  Which didn't used to be the case.  Also I no longer wake up with a hard on.  What's going on here?  I'm legit freaking out I am too young for this shit.   Is this normal?  Gas anyone else ever experienced this?
