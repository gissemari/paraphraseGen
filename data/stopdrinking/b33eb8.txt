I am almost 14 months sober but for some reason so far this year I have been miserable as it says up top my anger is worse than it has been in years I have very aggressive thoughts against people and my ex boyfriend more than anyone and I'm very paranoid  my depression is even worse than that (suicidal thoughts) .I do struggle with bi polar disorder but I'm medicated and in therapy .I was just wondering if any of this could be related to getting sober off alcohol after drinking heavily for over a decade

14 months sober is pretty long. If you're having these aggressive thoughts and suicidal ideation and paranoia maybe a hospitalization is in order.
Your doctor is best placed to answer this questions. 
It really reasonably could be sobriety related. It can take us a long time to let feelings like anger come up. 14 months doesn't seem a lot to me for coming around to anger. When you're angry you're no longer suppressing or avoiding those difficult thoughts and feelings. And they sound REALLY difficult. I'm not surprised if it took you this long to get ready for them. I wouldn't call it PAWS but hey do get support around it.
