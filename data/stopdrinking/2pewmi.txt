Weekly check in almost 21 days days sober 3 weeks.  The last week was trying a slight depression and eerie board-em has began to creep in.  The phone calls and txts have mostly stopped and I rarely leave the house except to work and to and from the gym.  I was wired and anxious the majority of the work week slept very little until the weekend in which I slept the majority of the time.  ..I'm starting to realize there's more to being a good father and husband then just being at home.  I can defiantly tell that my wife's super positive anything you need attitude is starting to weigh on her as well and she is beginning to get annoyed although she hasn't expressed it to me yet.  I'm starting to have  intense anxiety about all the normal life problems but also this life long choice of being sober and not being able to do the things I used to do with friends.  I've also leaned heavily back on bad habits of large amounts of tobacco caffeine and video games. ..Even with all this there is no doubt in my mind I have made the right choice and will continue to work on my sobriety.  I haven't felt this good in a long time and dropped about 10 lbs doing very little in terms of diet and exercise.  I can see it in my eyes the most over the years of alcohol and general abuse to my body my blue eyes had turned dull and gray I can defiantly start to see the blue come back ever so slightly.  This could be a perception thing as well no one has said anything haha.  ..Either way all my problems weren't solved with just three weeks sober but life is still a whole lot better then it was when I was drinking.  ..Good luck all the struggle is real.

Sorry to hear you are struggling.  I highly recommend the Carr and Trimpey books under the "Wisdom Books Video Music Reports" link on the right.  They have been tremendously helpful for me.  Best wishes.
Hey congratulations on three weeks! I also hit a plateau at around day 19. It passed very suddenly when I noticed a new benefit from sobriety. Like yours my #1 anxiety with this thing is that I will never be able to get drunk with friends again. Right behind that is "What will they think? Will they look down on me for not being able to handle my drinking?" I suspect that the reality is that I am the stronger one for being honest with myself and that they can't or won't confront their own similar drinking problems. It's been a journey that's for sure. And it's just beginning. I wish you the best.
