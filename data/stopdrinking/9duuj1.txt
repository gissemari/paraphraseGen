Hello all I have been reading everyone's posts regarding their struggles and progress and it's so inspiring. I had to create an account and join. I am so proud to say I am 16 days sober today and already I feel way better mentally. I can literally write a book about my life I have done everything. Except one thing.. I was unable to love anyone (including my kids) because alcohol kept me to itself. I have been drinking every day for 14 years with a few pathetic attempts to quit. I never wanted to for myself it was always to keep my kids and husband in my life. I was extremely selfish and narcissistic. Now I am finally realizing that my shit does stink. And my kids and husband deserve to have a healthy mom/wife. And just because my parents were alcoholics (dad died of liver failure at 52) doesn't mean I have to be. Time to break the cycle. My kids deserve a healthy and happy future for themselves. I need to be a role model. I quit smoking 1.5 years ago and now drinking. I feel fucking fantastic and my husband and kids are smiling again :) life is beautiful. Thanks for listening y'all!
