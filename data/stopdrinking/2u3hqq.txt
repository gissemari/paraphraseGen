So this is the first time I've been sober for 7 days straight in probably 3 years. Ive had a few 5 day stints here and there but something about the last time I woke up hungover and discovering this subreddit really made me feel different It was a very different "this is it" kind of feeling....So 7 days in...I would be lying if i didn't say the first few days were a bit of a struggle. The first day was easy with a very dedicated "I AM DOING THIS" mindset but after the second and third day pushed on and my cravings and temptations started to kick back in it was a little bit tougher. I woke up the first day and physically said out loud "i will not drink today" as I have read is good advice it felt kind of weird but i did it nonetheless....The past weekend was odd I had no motivation to really do anything all i did was sit at home alone and think about a lot of things and kind of zone out (without booze for once). I thought about all the things about alcohol that fucked me over in the past all the relationships that i either ruined or tainted because I was too wasted to comprehend the situations. The realization that i have a problem stopping drinking when i start. I watched Craig Kilborns youtube skit linked on this subreddit and really understood the part where he said "I have a thinking problem not a drinking problem" and I feel that really accurately described the feelings I have towards alcohol...Since moving to the middle of nowhere in the midwest from a big city I have taken up drinking a lot. I would dwell all day on wether or not to drink tonight wether i should be going to the store to buy alcohol which type to buy how much I was going to drink at night what i was going to drink this weekend and when. I felt like I was devoting SO much time into just THINKING about the aspect of drinking that it became like a ritual to me....So needless to say I had to shut down those demons the first week. Here I am on day seven and I feel great. 3 years ago I was not of heavy of a drinker but did get wasted every week to every other week I was more of an abuser back then so I know how it feels to be sober for 2-3 weeks. I feel like I am 25 again I feel well rested tons of energy and motivated....The best part is that I am an artist and I have been in a "creative rut" the past year with creating new pieces this past week i have had SWARMS of ideas coming to me I have started my studio practice back up (slowly but surely) and i feel a ton of creative energy like my mind is working again....The time I used to spend drinking at night I have now devoted to reading. I was always a reader before but now I am getting into a ritual of this:...6AM: Wake up.6:30: Run for an hour.8:00: Breakfast.9-5: Work (I love my job by the way).5-6: Either go food shopping or cook dinner (or both).7-8: Watch some TV browse reddit chill.8-9/10: READ.10-Bed: Fall asleep with a new show I am catching up on...Sorry for all the banal details. I would also be lying if I said part of me has a love/hate relationship with rituals So i am trying to think of things to spice it up. I have always wanted to write a book because I feel like i have a lot to say (not regarding drinking more on that on another post)...Anyway I just wanted to check in and give a weekly update. Any words from you all is greatly appreciated thanks for the comfort of knowing there are others out there....PS: When i get an urge i come straight to this subreddit and am SO inspired by all of you.

I very much relate to much of what you are saying. The THINKING that went into the drinking. The planning. The fantasizing. The worrying. Now my thinking is devoted to thinking about not drinking and that's kind of annoying at times...I just want being sober to be normal and my default. And slowly that is happening. But I want to remember why I'm sober and how bad it was and how much better it is now so I don't slip back into my old ways. ..And yes...the banality of routine. I'm enjoying routine and boredom. It's simple. And it's real life...You are doing great. Keep us updated!
