I know that this is a ridiculous question since it is the root of every addict's struggle.  Are there any things I can do to reduce these impulses besides burying myself in my work exercising and trying to be around people?

You have to rationalize them..In the past week i had strong urge too....Sometime i feel like there is multiple ancient Greek philosopher in my head arguing smoothly. 
Be patient. Your body is physically dependent on alcohol right now. I wouldn't even concern myself with what my brain is telling me I want right now because it's haywire for at least a week.
Journaling can be very helpful.  You don't have to write a lot but perhaps trying to keep a notebook handy and write down When you have a craving and maybe What you think may have triggered it can be eye opening.. Or just keep track of stuff in your life write down your feelings about how you got to where you are and your hopes and dreams for the future. Frankly anything!  It's distracting and gets you out of your head as you put it on paper.
You can ask your doctor or psychiatrist to prescribe you acamporosate calc which is what I've been using to suppress the urge..Of course urges are as much mental as physical so many of the other comments have very wise advice on how to handle that part.
