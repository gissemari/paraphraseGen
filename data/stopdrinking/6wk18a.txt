I could figure this thing out - that's what I believed for the last 3 years. Surely going to the gym and eating healthy would keep me sober. ..These AA folks were a depressing cult full of people focusing all of their energy on the one thing they were trying to avoid. I wasn't about to drink that Kool-Aid...NO WAY...I had relapse after relapse with a day - maybe two - maybe a week dry in between. Something had to change. On my last drunk I found myself drunk crying on the floor of my apartment. I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live either. Something had to change.....I decided to give AA another shot. After all there were a LOT of people at meetings with anywhere from a year to 40 years sobriety. How could they all have achieved this? How could they have anything close to fun without alcohol........I knew one thing. I didn't understand how I could live life without alcohol but after that last drunk I KNEW that I could not live life with it either...The first 3 steps of AA can be summarized as this:..Step 1 - Honesty (When I took an HONEST look at my past drinking I saw that I wasn't like "normal" people. I would always drink more than others. I would chug drinks. I would ensure that I had alcohol at home to keep my buzz going. I would drink and drive. I would drink in the morning sometimes to take the edge off. So called "normal" drinkers didn't do these things and didn't need to even think about them. I had to be HONEST with myself.)..Step 2 - Openness (I thought AA was cult-like and stupid. But there was this lingering idea that there were a lot of people in the meetings that had sobriety and seemed to be enjoying life. They started talking about this "higher power" garbage and I didn't understand that. I was told that all I had to do was be open and to listen and continue to go to meetings. I didn't have to completely DEFINE my higher power. It didn't have to be God dressed in robes on a mountain top. I was free to define my higher power as I chose. And I only had to be willing to stay open minded...Step 3 - Willingness (OK. I am willing to be open minded. Maybe I don't know everything...this made my Ego itch but I fought it and kept an open mind. What happened after that was incredible. I suddenly felt like I wasn't alone. There was this feeling in my heart that I now define as my higher power. It was something I could express gratitude to and ask for guidance. A funny thing started to happen: I realized that I had been fighting for so long to need to understand everything when all I needed to do was let go. Really LET GO. I realized that when I truly humbled myself and realized that I was actually powerless over alcohol I was able to let go. ..I have been going to a meeting nearly every day. AA works. It really does. If you are struggling go to a meeting - any one. Then go to another one the next day. There is rarely a meeting that I go to that I don't hear something that deeply resonates with me. I am so happy and grateful for AA and this sub. ..I hope everyone has a great week!
----------immediate responses--------

I wanted to stop drinking...My methods had failed.  I thought it was "my willpower" that would be the answer.  My willpower had been the solution to most things in my life .......   or I certainly believed so...Unfortunately alcohol as a *problem* is not responsive to willpower as a solution.  In fact alcohol *eats willpower for breakfast lunch and dinner* and the alcohol urge derived energy from my willpower while simultaneously draining me creating doubts and guilt...The sober support of people who had successfully stopped was the missing element for me to finally achieve success in stopping...Great Post !!
AA can be a beautiful thing.
