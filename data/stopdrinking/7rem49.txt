I had been doing great and then I allowed my husband to convince me it was okay to have a drink over the weekend. He left out of town yesterday and I guess since I drank over the weekend I thought it was okay to drink alone yesterday and today. I also ended both nights with huge regret and I forced myself to throw it all up. That scares me and is something I don't want to continue. I lied to him about the amount I drank. I left out the fact that I ate and threw up a whole large pizza. I don't do any of this crap sober. When I'm sober I love life.  (I do feel completely sober now which is why I feel okay making this post.) ..I'm just ready to be done with alcohol. ..I am ready. I'm scared I cant do it.... but I'm ready. ..I also think I'm going to tell my husband everything. (He knows I struggle but I think he struggles too.) ..UGH

I'm in a similar boat. My husband doesn't think my drinking is a problem mainly because I was hiding how much I drank. This is probably the 5th time in as many years that I've tried to quit. I still haven't told him I've quit and it's been 5 days already. I figure I need to do this for myself. I'm tired of the hangovers. I'm tired of lying. I will not drink tonight. 
I'm right there with y'all... I often hide how much I drink from my husband. I also binge eat which is a whole other thing. We can do this. I will not drink with you tonight.
Just keep trying. The only true failure is when you stop trying.
