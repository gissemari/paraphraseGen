I just reset my badge. I had about 2 months under my belt going into December. When I got serious about my sobriety things were falling into place for me. I was working out everyday feeling great working full time and I had met a girl that just seemed great for me. When I lost that girl I took a shot to my self esteem. I spent some time trying to get her back.. I started drinking again. I was on a downward spiral of depression and relapse. Today I picked myself up said I won't go down like this. I've got the knowledge now. I know what sets me off to want to drink and I know what life is like sober. I'm going to stay single for all of 2016. I'm going to make myself the best me I can be. What's in the past is in the past. Let's get it.

Welcome back!!!!!
I am with you! I had about a month and a half last year then moderated for several months (somewhat successfully) but I just can't give up the binges. I don't want to spend another day hungover. Let's get this sobriety party started!
Let's do it in 2016!
Yeeesss!! Glad you are back!!
