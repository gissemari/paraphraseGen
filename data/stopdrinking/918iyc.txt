85 Days booze-free. I'm so happy I didn't drink this weekend and I woke up early today and got to work without a hangover. I've got a new commute to figure out because we just moved and I wasn't sure how bad the traffic was going to be. I was able to get up before 5:30 and get on the road before 6:30 and cruised into work with minimal traffic. I could also deal with tracking down my clothes and things in various boxes without going crazy because I didn't have a raging hangover. ..I'm not going to lie. This weekend was a struggle and work has been really crazy and I have been dealing with a lot of cravings/the siren song of "moderation" but I'm so so glad I have stayed the course. ..IWNDWYT :)
