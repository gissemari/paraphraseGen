I'm around four and a half months off the booze only very recently having quit weed. I've isolated almost completely over the last few months and now I'm realising that this cannot continue I can't do it on my own I need a recovery support network or I'm probably going to relapse. That has happened in the past. If I shut myself off from the world I will go back to the drink. Understood. ..So my social skills are going to be a little rusty I've been alone for quite a while. But I am a little bit surprised by how I've been interacting recently;..\- I feel I've developed a slight speech issue. The "th" and "f" is a little bit of a problem right now haha..\- I could barely speak in the meeting last night. Literally I managed an introduction and then could speak. Almost as if something was straggling me as soon I opened my mouth. ..\- Generally having to put real effort into socialising with people at work. Struggling with the small talk and only really feeling comfortable communicating with little snippets of information and the odd joke here and there. I used to talk in meetings and my voice would carry. I'm no where near that now...\- Enjoying silence and quite enjoying the isolation even though I know its dangerous for an Alcoholic..\- I'd much rather think than talk right now..I don't really know why I'm posting this but maybe people have some tips and have experienced this before?  It's seems strange to me.
