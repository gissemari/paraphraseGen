I just reset my badge today and I'm already struggling with urges. I journaled but it's still hitting hard so I came here. May as well take the time to say thanks to everyone here you really help this drunkard be a better person. Reddit can be a real cesspool sometimes but r/stopdrinking is a good example of what it can be. Urges starting to lessen so im going to stop gibbering. I won't drink with you tonight!

Journaling is such a wonderful tool for sobriety and life in general. Every give urge surfing a try? I find it very helpful and relaxing. Here's a link to an audio MP3 to listen to:..[Urge Surfing](http://depts.washington.edu/abrc/mbrp/recordings/Urge%20Surfing.mp3).
Have you considered further treatment? An outpatient program has been extremely helpful for me and I'm starting naltrexone to curb cravings...something to also consider. Sending positivity! I will not drink with you today.
