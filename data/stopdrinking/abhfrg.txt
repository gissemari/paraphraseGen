Hey everyone..Throwaway account to protect my/my friend's privacy...To keep things short me and my best friend are both in recovery. He has about 2 or so years sober me less time but we have been friends for many years prior...Tonight at a NYE party a mutual friend of ours disclosed to me that our friend has picked up smoking weed again and has been smoking here and there. My friend's approach to recovery has been full abstinence since getting sober and this is why this information worries me. Our mutual friend who disclosed this info to me asked me not to bring this up to him as apparently he doesn't want me to know...I guess I need advice for how to approach this situation. I'm not sure if it's something I should discuss with him or not. Especially considering I heard it from a mutual friend who's trust I certainly don't want to break as I promised her I wouldn't confront him about it...My main concern is simply if he is doing okay. His alcoholism was very severe and it does worry me to see him start smoking again. I've relapsed several times myself (My DOC is heroin) and it usually began with simply smoking weed again. I know this may be my own projection but I don't think my worry is completely unfounded. I more so just want to check in and make sure he's doing okay. Additionally the secretive nature of it is what bothers me and I don't like the fact that this is something it seems most of our mutual friends know and not myself. ..What would you do in this situation? Should I try and approach him about this? Or should I just wait and see if he tells me? Have any of you dealt with this? And if so how?..&amp;#x200B;

Just from my personal experience I have smoked a handful of times since I quit and never had the urge to pick up a drink because of it. Every single one of us has to view sobriety in their own way. As long as they aren't drinking I don't see a problem with it. Having said that I do have a few close friends who DO have a problem with smoking weed and I would be alarmed if I saw them relapse with that. It just depends.    .All you can do is be up front and honest about your concern as a friend...but that's about it.
