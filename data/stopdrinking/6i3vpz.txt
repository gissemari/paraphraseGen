A dear friend and his wife and kids stopped by tonight.  I've known him for almost 20 years and we played in a band together for about 7 years.  He is such a happy guy and was telling me stories about so many of our old friends that he has kept in touch with.  The last 5 years I've been so depressed that I didnt keep in touch with any of those people.  Being with him tonight made me reflect on how terribly sick I've been for years and how I've gotten to be so isolated.  I'm feeling really sad about it.  I think when I was drinking I wouldn't have been in touch with the sadness it would mostly have been crushing anxiety that would make me want to drink more.  ..My primary problem has always been depression and anxiety.  Drinking for the last 5-8 years has really been self medication that made me worse.  Now that I haven't drank for a few months I see that for me alcohol was causing terrible anxiety and was helping to keep me "stuck".  I do feel much better not drinking but I now have to deal more directly with my problems since I'm not numbing them out with beer.  ..I've also noticed over the last 2 months that I've felt very sad about losing so many years to mental illness and alcohol.  It's almost like I've been mourning a part of my life that I lost.  I'm sure some of the rest of you have also had similar reactions about lost years to drinking.  ..I'm not really sure how to process this sadness but I wanted to share it here.  I'd like to talk to my wife about it but she is busy now with the kids.  Plus as someone who hasn't struggled with mental illness or booze there are some things that she doesn't quite understand.  ..Anyway thanks for reading this and I hope everyone had a nice alcohol-free weekend.

Yes I believe everyone who stops drinking thinks wow why did I wait so long and waste the time and money?  I also think there is a lot of wisdom understanding compassion courage and more that I have from going down the road I went down.  It's all water under the bridge now and I'm trying to be present in the moment.  I won't drink with you today.
Everything we go through happens to us for a reason. I used to get down on myself about time lost to drinking but I know the reasons it happened was to show me that I cant drink and never can. Sometimes we learn the hard way but that's still so very much better than never learning at all and repeating the same ol mistakes over and over.
