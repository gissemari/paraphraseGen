I couldn't help but notice over time that many of us here at SD battle other problems in life that are often factors in why we developed a drinking problem...So we get some sober time under our belt and then what..? How do we go on?..***..My demons are still with me. You'd never know it to meet me but my struggle with depression is constant. Cutting out the booze certainly made the demons quiet down but you'd better believe they're still there locked away and itching to get out and grin their razor-sharp teeth at me...I'm tempted to give into the fear and let them control me. After all they're a big reason why I started drinking in the first place. While I don't feel at risk to take a drink any time soon there's still that cold raspy voice in the back of my head that wants me to be afraid of life:..*"Why even try xJT? Hahaha you loser! It's no wonder you're alone. And even if you weren't single what woman wants to marry a man that won't drink. Women your age want entertainment and excitement - a life that someone like __you__ could never give them. Come on you idiot and give it up you're just going to be alone."*..***..Some days my gut doesn't believe it. But other days it does. **So how do I go on?**..Whether your struggle are with depression financial concerns family problems a jerk boss or anything else ***I firmly believe that quitting drinking was the first and possibly the most difficult step toward recovery - not just from my drinking problem but toward my recovery as a person.***..It's easy to feel cursed with a drinking problem. But damn it it might just be a good thing in some ways. Fighting for sobriety and I mean *REALLY* putting every ounce of willpower you can muster into getting sober is exhausting. There's no doubting that. But at the same time I'm beginning to feel like little else can compare to that struggle...Everything life has thrown at me since January 7th 2017 at exactly 12:00 PM has been manageable. And it's all thanks to my sobriety. While it has hurt like all hell and driven me to tears multiple times (and I'm a 6'4" man lol) I've stood strong. Quitting drinking threw me into the fire and dared me to get back out alive. And here I am slightly charred but stronger than ever before...***..***So how do we keep going?*** It's simple: never forget what it took for you to get where you are today. Love yourself and be proud of your accomplishments. Life may throw obstacles in your way but remember that you're a damn warrior. You've gone through hell and you can get through every other damn thing too...I'm proudly not drinking with you today. (Edit: formatting)

I was pretty astounded when I realized that the word "alcohol" only appears once in the Twelve Steps (similarly the word "alcoholic"). The 12 Steps are less about not drinking and more about recovering the me that is me dealing with the problems (many self-made) that we used to drink to escape...100% alcohol abstinence is right for me. And working the 12 Steps in AA has been a great gift to myself and my family...I'm proudly not drinking with you today.
Wow this was powerful. I'm still a tadpole swimming in this sea of uncertainty but I'm determined to evolve. I started the 30-Day Sobriety Solution which has been an incredible road map in this process. Also there are plenty of decent women out there who don't drink so don't give up on love for yourself or anyone else. Best of luck to you!
Love this! Thanks for sharing. 
Great post I am not drinking with you tonight.
Thank you. Needed this. Yes I'm 19 days sober but I feel as if that's ALL I am. I still stay in bed too much. I still rarely leave the apartment. I still haven't touched my master's thesis. I still feel like I don't want to do anything. I feel like I should be accomplishing so so so much more. ..But then I remember I'm not waking up hungover. ..I'm listening to the sad and scared thoughts instead of drowning them. ..So there's that. Maybe the rest will come in time?..I will not drink with you tonight. 
"I firmly believe that quitting drinking was the first and possibly the most difficult step toward recovery - not just from my drinking problem but toward my recovery as a person." --Agree!..I'm proud to not drink with you today.
