Good morning everyone here goes day 5.  Good luck and best wishes to everyone out there.  Join the chat if you want some more support it's a nice place.  No real big reason for this post looking for advice or desiring to rant about anything.  Just wanting to put some positive vibes out there for everyone who is struggling today.  So far day 4 has been the worst even more so than day 4 when I sobered up last yesterday was easily the hardest day I had but with some willpower and the people in this sub I didn't drink...So yeah...I guess I just want to say thank you and everyone stay sober and sometimes you won't be happy but always think to yourself "if I feel this crappy now...how much worse will it be tomorrow if I wake up with a stupid hangover?"

Thanks man.  I'm on day 5 as well.  Except sleep I don't have any issues so far and going SMART and AA meeting has helped.  Planning on going AA today
I am not going to drink TODAY!  I am going to wake up sober on Saturday.
Great post! Glad to see you. I was just looking back on my journal of my first week and Day 4 was definitely the worst for me especially anxiety wise. I saw definite improvements after that. Hope you are feeling a little better today...Check in when you can and tell us what you're up to tonight.
