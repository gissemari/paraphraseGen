Greetings everyone..Im new to this. I've drinking since age 16 im 23 now and realized I have a drinking problem.  My problem is I binge drink sometimes I black out and make a fool of myself in the worst scenarios(weddings fancy parties close friend's parties) other times I binge drink and drive my car I "learned" how to do that its so stupid and dangerous.  However I dont drink during weekdays except the ocassional pizza with beers and friends or the thirsty thursday that sometimes happens. Other than that Im ~~hungover~~ fine...Thing is alcohol was so much fun I got wasted every weekend from age 16 till 19 then I kinda leveled up. Im in a bad place. Writing this only helps me see I really have a problem. It's affecting my social life. I've stopped drinking for almost two weeks I got away with it last week because I got a vaccine but now my friends invited me to a pool party and I really dont want to drink I dont know what to say its a small thing not like a big party where I can act goofy and people will assume Im drinking.  I cant go and say to people "I realized im an alcoholic i've stopped drinking" The stigma is something i cant bear.  Also all my close friends are really just drinking buddies and they all are fucked up in some way like me!..I've struggling with depression lately and for quite a while actually.  Told my mom about this and went a therapist for alcohol abuse im starting a program next week.Cant really tell my DAd he is old mid 70s old and ol school MAcho im kinda macho myself so theres that.  I realized i have to put my inner self in order because the drinking is an effect. I felt a bit outta place because its almost an addict clinic but writing this has made me realize I'm in the right place...I still dont know how to go about not drinking in public. I cant stay at my house all my life it'd kill me. Writing this has been very cathartic. I feel better just pouring this put. Thank you. Please share soe advice on how to go at this im very new to this not drinking and I kinda want it to be for good. ..Thank you again..

It will be okay. Once you attend a few social events with a soda in your hand instead of alcohol you'll be surprised to notice how many people are either doing the same or only having 1-2 drinks over the course of the evening. Someone offers you something stronger? Usually all you have to say is "no thanks". Best of luck and come back here often to share how your recovery is going :)
