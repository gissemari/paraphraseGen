Hi All.I went to my first in-person SMART recovery meeting last night. I went in with zero expectations and I was taken back by the emotion and the rawness of the meeting. It was almost overwhelming. There were around 20 people from varying walks of life and they all spoke of their life situations to some degree. I being the newcomer was nervous AF and could barely get my introduction out. I'm not very good at public speaking in situations like that where I don't have control and I'm not well prepared. ..Overall it was a good experience and I'll be back next week but I wish I had stuck around after the meeting to talk to some of the people and the facilitator. I certainly will next meeting. ..What I walked away with surprised me. It wasn't a great surprise though. I left with the question "Am I actually an alcoholic?". I mean I don't/can't drink like a normal person as per my past but over the past week I've lost all interest in drinking and to be honest the only time I think about it is when I come here or access online sobriety resources. Outside of this I go about my life as usual and don't have big cravings. ..I know I'm not cured because there is no cure for this addiction but I am starting to think maybe I just need to stay away from all of this...the drinking the online support the meetings. It's like a constant reminder that I have a problem and it's not like I don't want to admit/face it ( I have already done that ) but I don't like having it shoved in my brain all the time. Granted I'm doing it to myself so I guess the power is in me to stop it...Also after the meeting I was talking with my SO about my experience and she said "I don't think you are an alcoholic. Maybe you don't need to go to the meetings.". I started wondering if all of this is in my head and I'm just creating this "Problem" so that I will have something to focus on and keep myself busy. Does that make sense? Maybe I'm bored and I need a hobby. ..That said I know that I don't want to become complacent because I know once I do that I am at risk of relapsing...Have any of you experienced these thoughts or feelings? How did you deal with them? Am I at a stage where you have been? I'm not sure how to cope with this particular challenge. ..Thanks for your advice...Update: I've been thinking about this since I posted it this morning and I think the "boredom" is coming from not knowing what to do now that I'm not drinking. Alcohol used to be in a lot of what I did so now that I've removed it from my lifestyle I am searching for something to replace it. And frankly I am struggling to find something. I know I just need to find something that I like to do but I've been in this rut for so long that it isn't easy. I certainly have a lot to keep me busy with work and family but I don't get the gratification of doing something that I truly enjoy. This is the journey that I'm on now and I'm kind of struggling with it.

I have absolutely experienced what you have described. I had that thought pattern every time I quit drinking for a few weeks which happened several times over thirty years of drinking...The thought pattern that maybe I don't have a problem would be followed by "well if I don't have a problem I can have one beer now and again". This would be followed within weeks with "how did I end up feeling so sick and broken today"...These cycles got further apart until in my mid forties I realized that my last bender lasted over seven years of daily drinking...As to whether this place or SMART will help you only you can decide but I urge you to be honest with yourself and watch out for the trap that I and many others have fallen into.
&gt; I left with the question "Am I actually an alcoholic?"..SMART Recovery tends to discourage the use of labels such as "alcoholic" or "addict" in meetings - Instead it looks at the addictive behavior as a choice. When I stopped drinking I didn't spend time working out what an alcoholic was and whether I was one - I knew my drinking was a problem and that I needed to stop...&gt;after the meeting I was talking with my SO about my experience and she said "I don't think you are an alcoholic. Maybe you don't need to go to the meetings."..My SO said a very similar thing to me after my first meeting. I was 9 months sober at the time and he had called me an alcoholic many times back when I was still drinking. I explained that the meetings were just me trying to broaden my support network - so I could discuss things with others like me in person. I didn't want to lean on him too heavily especially as he has no real experience of addiction/recovery which makes it hard for him to relate (as evidenced by what he had just said!). I've also communicated that I have chosen abstinence as the most effective way for me to be free of my problem (when alcohol is in the scene it is front and center of my life costing me waaay too much) . He initially thought "cutting down" should be the solution to drinking too much - and has come to understand that that's not an effective solution for me and for many others. I don't personally need meetings but I'll go as long as I continue to gain/learn from them...The fourth point of the SMART Recovery program and ultimate goal is "living a balanced life" and that's very much my focus these days. SMART Recovery makes clear that engagement with the program needs only be as long as the individual wants/needs it to be. I still engage actively in recovery on SD because I feel had a lot of faulty wiring and it's helping me to steer in the right direction each day.
