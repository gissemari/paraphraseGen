I'm posting again here just to thanks this subreddit that helped me so much. The last time that i pass the 3 month sober mark I ended up being sober for a year and then relapse because i thought that i can moderate. The following year was the worst of my life the acoholism was worst i was drinking anything that had alcohol in it. I didn't do cocaine like i used to mainly because i was broke. I was drank mouth wash liquid soap and pure alcohol I don't know how my body handled it...My life was a mess my mother always worring if not crying beacuse i left and didn't return home or i just locked my self in my room with all the beer and rum i could buy. But I always was trying to get sober. It was that I don't want to be alive but I couldn't kill myself no matter how bad I wanted to die. Being sober was the only path for me. Fuck it was so fucking difficult. ..Now I'm 3 months sober feeling like shit mostly because of the depression and suicidal thoughts but sober. Had cravings in the last few days i rather had cravings that being drunk. I miss feeling powerfull excited to be alive i miss feeling happy. All that was when i was drunk or doing the first bump of cocaine. That life is over for me it's not worth it. No matter how much i want it back. Fuck...I will not drink with you today. FUCK THE ZERO..Have a great week.

Yes FTZ.  Congrats on those 90 days.  You seriously have something to be proud of there.  May I ask if you are getting help for the depression and suicidal thoughts?  It really hurts my heart to think of you suffering in this way.  I'm proud of you.  Let's keep it moving.
&gt; I miss feeling powerfull excited to be alive i miss feeling happy. All that was when i was drunk or doing the first bump of cocaine...Something I've found really helpful is that scientists say our brains have their own internal pharmacy. All of those awesome feelings you got from substances were actually manufactured by your brain! It takes a while for it to rewire after substance abuse but you WILL feel powerful excited and happy again from things like exercise sex meditation... the catch is they take more effort than popping a bottle. But the good news is they'll make you feel strong and healthy instead of sick and out of control. Hang in there... I know you can stick to it this time!!! I will not drink with you today!!!!
