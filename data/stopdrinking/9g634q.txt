Hey sobernauts. So I haven't felt shame over my decision to stop drinking the past 7 months. But as an introvert I haven't had many opportunities where I had to turn down drinks these past 7 months either. Now I find myself working with a new cast/production team of a play I love and they do not know I am sober. Usually I am loud and proud about my sobriety but I became meek after turning down drinks three times in two minutes last night at an opening night party. I am afraid they will look at me differently feel bad for me not be able to connect with me because that's how I looked at sober people when I drank...Like I said I usually embrace my sobriety with bad-ass pride. But with difficulties at home doubts about my talent and self-worth (depression and anxiety nestling back into my brain) I am feeling pain over my outsider status rather than happiness over being a renegade...I am not about to relapse but feel I need to honor this feeling and talk about it in case anybody else is feeling it too. IWNDWYT.

I get this too. I'm young and single and it's all basically anyone wants to do. It's really tough and I keep relaxing.

First off congratulations on seven months! That's still a decision that you consciously made. I'm an introvert too and my downfall hasn't been drinks other people offered me it's been the drinks I sought out myself. Also my brain is an asshole too. I feel you on that...My take on it is that sobriety isn't something that everyone needs to know. It's just not everyone's business and like other personal information it can be inappropriate to share in some circumstances. ..I noticed when other people didn't drink when I was drinking. But I'm an alcoholic. I was trying to normalize my own drinking or something. In my experience most people don't care or even really register if I'm not drinking.
