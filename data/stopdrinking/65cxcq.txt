A couple days ago I officially made the decision to close my business and it's already a huge relief. I feel bad for failing. I feel bad for not scrounging the effort to sell it or to walk away with some sort of return. But that is FAR outweighed (for the moment at least) by the relief that has come with making the decision. ..Two days ago it was a struggle to get out of bed. At all. I haven't washed laundry or deep cleaned my apartment or dealt with my ever mounting list of chores for MONTHS even though I've been sober. ..Already in the last two days I've done laundry I've cleaned I went for a truly enjoyable walk I even left the house last night to go see a band which is the first time I've gone out to socialize with ZERO reticence in many many months. ..I have a ton of work to do still. I'm going to be broke for months. I may have to declare bankruptcy. I may have to move back in with my parents. I have to totally start over from zero...But I'm sober I have a chance to improve my health I'm looking forward to being around family after being away for over 15 years...I'm going to get rid of nearly ALL of my stuff pack my bags my bike and hit the road. Well in a few months after I slog through cleaning up the worst decision I've ever made. ..Drunk me bought a business. Drunk me ran it into the ground. Sober me has to deal with it. Sober me is looking forward to the next chapter...Thanks for being here friends. And if you have any hot tips for good employment opportunities let me know :)

I can say that one of the toughest things I ever face is knowing when to let go of something and make a change.  I let pride get in the way of admitting when it was time to move on.  That makes it way way worse for me.  Inevitably moving on got me to a better situation then the one I refused to bail on.  ..Sorry about your business but I think it's great that you're getting rid of things that aren't working for you so that you have the space to grow.  I think it's a great call and I won't drink with you today!
You didn't fail you just may not have used the best strategy.
