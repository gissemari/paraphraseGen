I'm over thirty days now and still going strong! I stopped cold after many years of solid drinking. Dumped everything I had down the drain on mother day. Have looked back since that day and I am happier then I've been in a very long time...I know I won't relapse it's just not worth it. I have yet to attend a meeting and honestly I don't think I will anytime soon. This sub has been all the support I've needed. I'm curious how many of you stopped cold and have stayed vigilant either with or without AA. Those of you who never attended a meeting or didn't attend for quite sometimes am very curious to here from especially those of you a few years removed from alcohol. ..I'm also interested in when you knew it was time to stop for good. For me it was when I was looking at myself in the mirror shot in hand. My skin was grey and peeling. My stomach felt like a pot of boiling acid I looked like a zombie. I was drinking to feel normal and that's when I knew I had to stop or I was going to kill myself.

Took me 10 years to get to this point. Before that I never got to 90 and I made many many many efforts. I always full stopped I knew full well I couldn't taper. I relied heavily on AA for my first 90 days I've backed off a bit and supplement a lot of meditation study and yoga.
I knew it was time to stop for good when I read rock bottom post after rock bottom post on SD. My liver is fine my health is good to go but just about every success story on this sub-reddit ends with "I wish I would have done this 20 years ago."..I'm in my late 20s I am most success-stories' "20 years ago". 
As I said in my '28 days' post I got drunk as hell and had an absolute all out crazy time at a strip club till 4am. Next day I woke up and thought it was a good way to "go out with a bang" and I haven't drank since...EDIT: But this was not my first try just my best try so far and I don't miss alcohol right now and I don't regret my decision! :)
There was a survey with [these preliminary results](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/21zn8k/survey_is_closed_here_are_some_preliminary_charts/) including [this chart](http://imgur.com/iGR2tBN) of zero-alcohol time (keep in mind that there were only ~550 responses)
I stopped cold turkey no medication. ..Tipping point - physical withdrawal when I didn't consider myself having a problem. 
Me! My tipping point was Memorial Day weekend when I basically drank it away. 
I went cold - 45 days in now - My tipping point: My SO attempted suicide and I was too drunk to do anything for her. She's better now our relationship is better. My life is so much better without alcohol. ..The only thing that isn't better (for me) in being sober is that my body isn't used to the overwhelming lack of carbs. I've been a motherfucking hot air balloon of farts since quitting...

I wasn't happy with my drinking patterns and decided to bail before I got physically or mentally dependent based on a family history of alcoholism.  I used online SMART meetings for a brief period after I relocated but other than that it was just this subreddit and being stubborn.
That is almost the same story as mine except that my eye balls were yellow when I looked in the mirror. ..I tapered then stopped. My only support is this sub. 
Very very bad night when I saw I had become what "drove me to drink" to start with and it made me sick. Fear is what got me drinking and disgust at what I had become got me to stop. Cold turkey with 3 days of pretty brutal withdrawals.  I had attempted moderation for several years up until the last 2 years when I was drinking every night pretty hard core (1500-2500ml wine/night). Attended two AA meetings/week for the first 9 months or so and now I do one a week or so. I probably would have gone the SMART route had it been available but I'm quite happy with how I have incorporated many different pieces of this program or that (support mainly from here I have a sponsor but we don't see each other very often) making a program that works for me. If I thought for a second I was having issues I would get my ass to more meetings though.
