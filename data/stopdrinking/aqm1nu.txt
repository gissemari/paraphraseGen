Good morning all. As some of you may know I have been struggling for the last week or so with insomnia. ..Well last night I got 8 continuous hours! I feel so much better. ..When I went to bed last night I had anxiety starting to ramp up and it was starting to feel like another restless night of frustration. ..I started thing it through and one of the issues I kept coming around to was feeling a little adrift in my sobriety. When I committed to dry January I had a plan and a timeframe I could break down into micro goals that would add up to victory. ..Since then I have been in a bit of limbo. I know rationally I shouldn't drink but saying never again stirs up the addict hornets in my head. ..Last night I did some writing and committed to 2 goals. One is I would like to hit 225 lbs by June. That's 25 pounds to lose. I can break that down and plan it out. ..2 is I am committed to not drinking until May 1. This can also be broken down into micro goals to achieving it. ..When I did dry January I actually planned at the start to restart drinking in February. That month revealed a lot to me about my habit and I am abstaining. I am hopeful that by May 1 I will have it clear in my head that I'm not going back to drinking ever. If not I'll just set a new date for taking a look again. I also downloaded This Naked Mind last night. I figure all the Ravi g about it I see here can't be for nothing. ..It's funny I can't seem to say I quit forever. But I can easily commit to 10 more weeks. ..A bit rambly but I feel fuckin awesome today. ..TL:DR - have a plan ..Stay strong all. I appreciate this site so much.  Y'all are saving lives. ..Embrace the suck. The juice is worth the squeeze. Other throw away lines of inspiration. ..I wish you all continued strength and resolve.
