Thank you to everyone on this reddit because I don't know if I would be doing this without you. Stopping drinking and staying stopped has been the hardest. It most rewarding thing I have ever done. The last few nights I have been having awful relapse dreams- I am happy and grateful to wake up every day sober! IWNDWYT!
