Hi All   .Just a quick note.   Had been cruising along fine - no drinks - until about a week ago.  Last Wednesday slipped up and immediately had cravings etc. come roaring back.  Thought I had it under control but then Wednesday (identical circumstances) it happened again.  I cannot live like that!  So yesterday and today I've spent hours circling the wagons calling on my support system apologizing where need be and getting back on track.  ...Long and the short of it:  I relapsed while trying to have "just one".  It didn't work and is ABSOLUTELY not worth it.  So back to the sober path for this guy.    ...I hope you all have a great Friday &amp; weekend.

Good on you for gathering your support system and getting back to it.  IWNDWYT
