Just looking for some reinforcing words. I'm on a work trip in Ohio for a couple of weeks and struggling/ stressing and fighting the constant urge to grab a drink to take the edge off. ..What do you all do to offset that annoying itch to get a beer or glass of wine?

Lift weights. Run. Burpees. Eat ice cream. Read. Bath. Netflix. Drink 32 oz. of water.
I do ANYTHING that works. Bath. Candles. A tv show that I care about. Food. Sparkle drink. Walk. Exercise. Call someone to talk about stress. Anything.
I just angry cleaned all my dishes and my craving passed. Exercise is the best one I've found. Journaling filing my nails taking a shower or bath putting on my pjs/taking off make-up so won't easily leave again. Rewatching a favorite show. Reading a chapter in some quit lit. Putting myself to bed early if it's a really rough night.
