I am an alcoholic. I lost my job last week because of my drinking and a few days later my girlfriend left and came back the next day with her mom and movers and left me in the driveway with no money and no gas. I had become dependent on her and I was giving her my whole check and the only reason I'm not on the street right now is because I was able to withdraw from a cash advance account and make it to my stepdad's house where he chose to give me his credit card instead of a place to stay which is the opposite of what I was hoping for. She didn't see it fit to leave me with most of my clothes or hygiene items or my phone either (which was in her name) and she won't talk to me not that I want her to...So I have been in a motel for the past week drinking myself to sleep. This is the first morning I didn't wake up and grab the bottle next to me but I'm only posting this because my mind is screaming at me with all of the regrets that I drink to calm down. ..Right now I am trying to summon the courage to call my probation officer because I missed my meeting last week and haven't talked to him and to call about getting my car unlocked because oh yeah I have an interlock device for the next month and all of this made it impossible to go to my service date. This is the last month of my probation and I hate that I'm struggling so hard right now...Like I said I don't know why I'm posting this and I have a plan but I'm so alone right now. Both of my parents are dead and no one's going to be there for me if I can't get over the drinking and the lying...There's a song by Conor Oberst which is the title of this post about drinking so much sorrow in the bar owned by the Patron Saint of the abused and the mentally ill that even she doesn't want to deal with you anymore and that really says it all I think.

it sounds like your life is pretty crappy right now as a result of your continued drinking - but have no fear my friend I was once in an incredibly similar situation when I was in my early 20s and you wouldn't believe if it you met me today..there is only one way out of this shit storm and that is to put the bottle down for good..it only takes one sober week to start feeling significantly better about yourself and your life - at this point you will be able to find and maintain a new job and buy your own food and amenities and perhaps after some time perhaps your step-dad will allow you to move in..but you have proven that none of this can occur when you are actively drinking alcohol ..sober up and watch your life change - you sound intelligent perhaps your are artistic as well - when you sober up for good watch your creativity soar to new heights ..(I'm currently on 3 days straight of making music)..it's the only way you will grow up!..best of luck
