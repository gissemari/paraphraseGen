And I am incredibly thankful today. Ill keep it short and sweet as I have about fifteen minutes before going into work. First thank you to the mods and every single alcoholic that posts here. Whether giving or receiving advice just know that I have been able to take something away from every post here. I read as many as I can...To the newcomer of you're struggling reach out. If you're struggling  *good*. Its not going to be easy. Everytime you struggle in early sobriety you learn something for further down the line. Its okay to be miserable i know I have been there but it gets better. I promise. If you're struggling that means your sobriety means something to you. Do not take it lightly. ..I have so much more today than I ever thought possible. I remember being so scared this time last year ovewhelmed by this project I had taken on. Overwhelmed by the responsibility and the fact that I had done it for a year and it was a big long stretch ahead of me. I am happy today. Its my project and I do it for me. I am worth it. You are worth it. ..Dont give up hope. Dont give up. Be a badass today. I sure feel like one.

.Thank you for honoring the strugglers posting their first comments here. It's sometimes a little intimidating to see someone with the "Big Number" and wonder "how will I ever get there?"..Glad you're still reading the comments!.
Congrats keep it up! You've made the right choice.
