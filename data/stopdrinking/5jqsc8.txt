I just ran across this quote about Truman Capote:.."Truman has all the stigmata of a genius. I am convinced that genius must have stigmata. It must be wounded." --Robert Linscott Capote's editor at Random House for 12 years..I'm wondering if this helps explain why so many artists struggle with addiction? I'd love to hear other perspectives on this. ..Celebrating 180 days by not drinking with you all today.

The way I see it - artists are in the public eye so it's harder for them to hide addiction (and sometimes it's actually a badge of pride). Aspiring artists emulate established artists and drinking is quite a conspicuous feature. So ok let's say Capote was a genius and he was wounded - it doesn't mean he had to tend to those wounds with alcohol. To me it's just an excuse. It's not different to eg frazzled and overworked retail workers who "need" alcohol to "destress" at the end of the day in the run up to Christmas. Or mums with their "mummy juice" at "wine o'clock". Any excuse did for me when I was still drinking. Being a wounded genius has the advantage that nobody would question it because they would just be told they do not understand what it's like. As long as I saw alcohol as the only solution to my problems my eyes were closed to alternatives.
A lot of writers drink it's true. I'm one of them. The list is long and notorious from Kit Marlowe to Jack Kerouac to Dorothy Parker. The arts do have a culture of hedonism and when I was in graduate school surrounded by other writers we drank *constantly*. In my little cohort of 12 I'd say that at least five of us were functioning drunks. Two of us have gotten sober in the two years since graduation...But I think this can be overblown too. There's a romantic idea of the tortured genius I think because a lot of artists have really made a lot of hay from their mental illness. Some of us parade it as a badge of honor. Some of us write from it because we know no other way. Some of us hide it as alacritously as any other drunk. (That was me.) But I don't know if you really have to be wounded to be an artist. Just as there are a million ways to be a schoolteacher or a car salesman or a parent there are a million ways to be a writer. A lot of writing is about being quiet and noticing things. Drinking can actually really hurt that...Art is often about digging into a painful place in the human psyche or society and excavating it. For that reason it can seem like all artists are damaged or alienated. But the fact is that every person in the world has spots where if you press on them they hurt. Your bus driver your grandfather your fourth grade gym teacher Barack Obama. Everybody has pain. Just not everybody parades it around for the world to see...I do think mental illness stalks a lot of artists maybe more than other people for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what it means for everybody but for me mental illness has really been a lesson in empathy which is critical for a fiction writer I think. I was born about as privileged as it's possible to be -- white cis-male upper-middle-class American both parents with college degrees and white collar jobs educated in Catholic schools and then a high-powered private college. If I were naturally well-adjusted I don't think it would be possible for me to understand people's troubles enough to write about them. I might not have wanted to. But being forced to confront your own pain forces you to confront the fact that other people have it too...For me the most important part of being a writer far more important than my gift for verbal expression or the fact that my parents started giving me books to read when I was 4 is my understanding of the humanity of people even -- maybe especially -- people I don't like and would rather not understand. I think that comes in part from confronting the weakest parts of my own humanity. And I *know* that my drinking comes from how obvious my own flaws have always been at least to myself. They're linked sure...But I also think that being sober is going to make me a better writer now. More attentive detail-oriented and harder-working. I've found that to be the case already in just the few days since I climbed up on the wagon...Side note: I know a few writers personally and while some of them are hot messes of the kind that I have been some of them are reasonably happy well-adjusted people. Jonathan Lethem Charles Baxter Julie Schumacher even Denis Johnson now that he's kicked the junk. And they're all still very good at what they do.
