"Contrary to popular belief willpower is not an innate trait that you're either born with or without."   ..http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2011/12/29/a-conversation-about-the-science-of-willpower/..Wondering why H.A.L.T. (hungry angry lonely tired) are triggers for me?  ..Wondering why so many people only promise to themselves that:  "Just for today they will forgo only one drink:  the first one?"  ..Wondering why going to a bar and not drinking may help me relapse?  ..Wondering why mediation helps me?..Well check out that blog post.  If you are like me it might give some answers!..P.S.  I can't find any research on the science of LaCroix Sparkling Water but it must be doing something because y'all are crazy about it.

This can not get enough upvotes!!..The number of people who believe in the miracle of 'willpower' is astounding...Thanks for posting!!!
Very interesting article. .Thanks! 
I'm "wondering" about all the things you're Wondering!  ;D..I appreciate the article link which I read.  Several takeways - the author is fairly equivocal ("it's 'this **and** that"; "it's *both*"; etc.)...I know that I have a "will" and I have "willpower".  They are an essential part of my ongoing sobriety and my every day living...I use "Willpower" and "Logic" every single day and together they help me achieve success in most of my personal and professional endeavors.  They are great "tools".  ..Unfortunately for me "Willpower and Logic" were not useful tools in the 'Stop Drinking' endeavor.  They worked against me.  ..Logic and Willpower are "necessary but not *sufficient*" for me to stop.  They however are useful in my Continued Sobriety...I needed support and assistance to successfully Stop...Finally your query "just for today"......."Forever" is a concept that is overwhelming and not something that I or any mortal I've met can actually comprehend.  I **can't do** forever.  When I set my sights on "Forever" I've already compromised my probability of success.  I've never done ANYTHING for FOREVER so why would I think I could 'not drink' Forever?..On the continuum of 'Zero Drinks to 1 to 2 to 3......to InFinite Drinks (drinking forever)' "One" is the absolute smallest increment.  In fact One compared to Infinity is by definition *infinitesimally* small ( 1/Infinity = .000000000000000 etc..... )..So While it's not only theoretically impossible to 'not do' something forever it's more importantly also realistically impossible for me to 'not do' something forever...But forgoing one drink?  Sure.  Did it all day yesterday.  No Problem!..Today I forgo just ONE drink - The First One..If today proceeds like yesterday I'll do the same thing tomorrow..."Forever" will take care of itself and I won't be around to see it ;D
