Today I was on a hike with my boyfriend and we were talking about the ways in which people struggle to find fulfillment. We each have different ways we are fulfilled- through our work through our relationships through our hobbies through our fitness etc..I came up with a nifty analogy that I'll attempt to share with you. I thought I would put this into terms that drinkers would understand. Because let's face it if we're here we've sought fulfillment in the bottom of a glass of something! ..Let's say you have six glasses in front of you. Now each of the glasses represents a chance for fulfillment. Imagine now that you try to fill one of the glasses by pouring all of your allotted LaCroix (hee hee) into one glass. That means that the glass will overflow and that there won't be any left for the other glasses. The trick is to perfectly portion the amount of La Croix you are given so that enough can be shared with each glass. That's balance. For me the biggest struggle in my sobriety has been trying to figure out how much to put into each of my glasses  to make sure that I'm  not seeking all of my fulfillment in one place but still have enough to keep each glass full enough as it possibly can be. ..My description is clumsy but it helps me to think about things in these terms when my type A starts rearing her ugly head and starts to think I can be all things to all people including myself...Cheers.
