Hi Guys I just discovered this forum after a quick google search. I have been battling alcoholism for a few years now (37 years old). It's not my first attempt to quit there have been many failed attempts before..I am very grateful that I can read real-life accounts of how others are struggling (and winning!) against this awful disease..I'm attending a wedding this Friday in NYC (St. Paddy's day no less) and am hoping I can avoid drinking..Thank you for reading have a blessed day.
