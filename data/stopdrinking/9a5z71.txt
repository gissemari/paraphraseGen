Well just a quick post to say I'm back and still at it after a relapse on holiday. I made it 70 days and would be heading towards the 100 mark now had I not let my guard down/demons back in. ..However I'm glad I did as I've learnt a lot from this including the fact I can't moderate the instant thirst was straight back including the grumpy/lack of sleep attitude that follows the next ..I guess this post is just saying to you guys/gals to keep up your guard I felt strong and was feeling a million dollars but I weakened so quickly. ..Onwards and upwards and well done everyone! Keep up the good work. IWNDWYT
