My goal was to stay sober until Halloween. I got close but I didn't make it. The thing is I did not enjoy drinking last night at all. I figured after 33 days of sobriety getting drunk would feel amazing. Nope. Drinking is just not what it used to be. I'm praying the withdrawal symptoms aren't as bad as my last detox. ..

Yeah when I have had time off before it's been a case of having a few drinks and not feeling great and going to bed waking up the next day feeling rough and anxious and drinking all day and then a bender the day after...Not worth having one or two or three.
I had so many relapses that I assumed I was a lost cause. With each relapse the booze kicked my ass even harder. I picked myself up got pissed off at this enemy and I refuse to let it take anything else from me. You've got this. We will fight together!
Sounds like you collected some good data. Drinking has been on my mind lately...not really cravings but just wondering what the big deal is. Thanks for the reminder. Best of luck with your withdrawals and congrats on not letting it slide into a bender.
