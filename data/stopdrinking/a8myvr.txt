Like many I have used goal setting as one of my tools to curb drinking. However I can't tell you all how many times that has led to relapse. The reason is that I was not approaching my goals rationally. I'll give one example; fitness. When I would quit drinking I would start back at the gym with same weights and routine as before without giving much thought to having been out of the gym for 3 or 4 months. In fact I would go at it extra hard to "work off stress". Within a couple weeks of overdoing it I would have an injury; nothing severe but enough to sideline me for several weeks. Then as you can imagine with extra time on my hands and the fitness goal on hold I would start to think "Well a few beers won't hurt."..In short whether you are sedentary or have gym experience don't go at it too hard when you first start or start back at the gym or other fitness routine. Work your way up...

This is sound advice for almost everything in life. Too much and too little is always bad (except for booze where nothing is just about right lol). I will not drink with you today!
