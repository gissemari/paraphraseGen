Hi everyone.  I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I was hoping y'all could help me.  I've been struggling lately to relate to the newcomer.  I'm trying to think back and remember what was most helpful to me back when I was super green to this place: tone words advice type - I am interested in all of it.  I want to be reminded.  I NEED to be reminded.  ..So help me out if you would.  Newcomers and old timers who remember being new - what is or has been most helpful to you?  What kinds of comments?  What tone of voice (text?) speaks to you?  ..Probably most importantly what keeps/kept you coming back?....
----------immediate responses--------

Honestly for me it's just seeing the words on my screen seeing the support understanding that people are out there who want to help me.  Any advice to help me quit drinking is good advice.  The worst is being alone and not having anyone helping you.  That's why I signed up today that's why I went to A.A. today for the support.
- Positivity and yet a healthy dose of realism. I want to hear from "old timers" that they are very much enjoying several years of sobriety - but that they still face challenges and a sober life isn't a perfect life..- Tools for staying sober. Newbies come in with no idea of how to stay sober other than: simply don't drink. There's more to it than that and I spent my first 30 days in AA/SD looking for what sober people do in drinking trigger situations. Most helpful advice for me by far: "One day at a time and if necessary one hour at a time.".- Step 1. Hearing people's stories of their drinking habits and the crazy shit they did while drinking and while I couldn't relate to all of it I found a lot that helped me break through the denial and finally identify as an alcoholic..- Finding humility honesty and a willingness to change. These are topics I always am drawn to when people talk about them.
I make a point to reach out however I can! I offer support to those crying out for help and I cheer on - and question - those doing well. My sponsor always says "I'm here to disturb the comfortable and comfort the disturbed"
My biggest challenge was overcoming my "special snowflake" status. I like stories and comments that I can identify with.
yep i'm pretty new here. i stumbled across SD when i was recovering from a weekend(?) bender. ..the community here is super encouraging and non-judgemental which means a lot to me because i've had some bad experiences where people don't know/care and are not understanding. ..i like reading other folk's journey; how they dealt with such and such...i feel like i can be open here because other people are open...what keeps me coming back is that i really do want to change and others who are struggling also share how they overcame...i also like when people take the time to respond. i look forward to getting a little orange letter in my in-box.
I'm new to being active on SD and new to actually attempting sobriety. I don't have a support system or anyone to talk to. I've isolated myself so much that my only true friend is my boyfriend who still drinks excessively and has no intentions to stop. So for me any kind of communication. Any words of encouragement any advice being reminded from people that have been here awhile (and newbies like me) that I'm not alone in the way I'm feeling (like a crazy person) and honestly any back and forth conversation just to pass the time for a few minutes to get my mind off the cold ones sitting in the fridge.
The thing that differentiates SD from my other recovery avenues is that I can see newcomers with a few 24 hours reaching out to other newcomers. When I was that new there was no way I would listen to an old-timer. On the flip side I often find myself seeing what works for the newcomer to be a very simple straightforward solution to not picking up a drink for today.
Just having someone comment on my posts is hugely appreciated. I also really like progress pics and posts about how people are filling their days with specific positive activities (monkey see monkey do). I also like links to articles books and videos that people recommend.
When I first posted here I felt disgusting. You guys did not treat me the way I felt. You were kind you threw me a life line. I appreciate everyone who responded to that first post so much.
I found r/sd on approx. day 25 of my sobriety and didn't comment until a couple days later...I can remember writing that "my detox was hard" but at this point it is hard to remember those details. It is only because I remember typing these things out that I am sure it happened but I can't truly remember now how it felt...I can remember laying down across my bed mid-morning weekends and wishing my intense hangover would go away but I can't remember how it actually felt...It also took me some time to realize that some of the badge numbers I was looking at (w many days even) had been previously reset at some point. This was eye opening for me that long term sobriety was not guaranteed even after I thought I might be "cured"...I used to like the stories of how people were feeling at certain day counts (am I on track?) then I liked the "big number" celebratory posts (it could be me someday) then the stories of lapse and recommitment (dang I hope that's not me but I sure hope I can recommit like they did)...Lately I like stories of optimism. That things are getting better each day. This is a story that resonates whether newbie or established in sobriety that with each sober day my life is better than if I were drinking. The challenges of life and I have had some lately are more manageable...I keep coming back for the honest sharing as well as the incredibly supportive and remarkably troll-free internet forum kept this way by our dedicated mods...Keep posting keep sober. One day at a time..
Staying on here for a while and seeing people like you giving good advice time and time again. The patience necessary is tremendous. Seeing recurrent long timers is comforting as a newbie.  It adds stability.  Don't get me wrong I often hear great advice coming from newcomers also.  It is a good mix.  I could see where somebody might need a break from reading the same posts and having to give the same advice.......AGAIN!  Lol. 
Thanks u/KetoJam.  I found myself just yesterday acknowledging to a noob that even *I* thought my tone was harsh in my initial response to her. I had to remind myself that this person was asking for help (although my judgment was that they were asking for permission to drink)...I remember when I came onto SD in January compassion and honesty were crucial but so was the *no bullshitness* of many people.  I had a couple of comments to my posts that seemed severely judgmental/preachy and I was able to deal with that 1) because I had had 10 years sober before so I knew what I was looking at in terms of my process &amp; I wasn't perhaps as fragile as many of the other noobs I read and 2) I'm pretty straight up and will set boundaries with anyone I think is overstepping either my boundaries or the guidelines of the sub...So while I value honesty I have to remember that *without self-awareness "brutal honesty" is brutality not honesty.*  I have actually stopped myself from responding to posts I have trigger judgments about unless I notice that and try to respond from a more compassionate place.  Compassion doesn't necessarily mean being all nicey-nice to me but it does mean I should really check my tone for righteousness veiled judgment veiled advice and dismissal of someone's experience.  ..I want to remember that we each come to this journey with a variety of experience in developing self-awareness of trauma of histories of class/race/age etc. I want to create a container for people to feel welcomed and safe to be vulnerable and open with us.  u/Prevenient_grace u/coolcrosby and u/VictoriaElaine are the masters of this.  When I grow up I want to be like them.  In the meantime I am also trying to remind myself when I post of the Buddhist questions: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?..What keeps me coming back is that there are so many people (including you) who care deeply about supporting others in their quest for sobriety and recovery.  What keeps me coming back is the knowing that we are all reflections of each other aspects of self we recognize we resist we embrace we aspire to we run away from...I keep coming back because *there is no one here from whom I cannot learn about myself.*  What keeps me coming back is that SD helps me on my journey.
I like being able to be honest and open here even when I'm not saying the "right" thing. For example being able to be very open about temptations to drink so we can all help to deconstruct those temptations. 
"Don't tell me what to do" was my middle name...And I was angry and very scared but I needed some no nonsense straight talk even if I hated it.  It's a fine line it helps to show I've been there my puke may be miles down stream but I remember the burn.    Coming to understand that I was not special there was no loophole with my name on it was critical "what are you going to do differently?" Was a question I needed to be asked.
The first day week month...SD felt like home.  Like people here got me really understood me because they were like me.  That I didn't have to hide here like I did in real life.  It was relieving and free...That helped me trust the community and trust the process hearing from other people like me...And that's why I keep coming back!  To hear from our veterans who still haven't drank (how they keep doing it everyday even through challenges) and from newbies whom I may be able to give advice to.  Our community is fantastic!!
I'm very new. I posted my story yesterday and what helped me the most was being encouraged and related to. I didn't know there were so many other people just like me going through the same struggle. I have a lot of shame and guilt right now about needing to ask for help having this community welcome me with open arms has been the most helpful thing. I already know you all will be here if I need any guidance.
.The single most helpful tool for me has been the daily pledge that I will not drink today.   Other helpful tools were the Baby Steps the book list and the flair counter.   And I agree with every comment about the support compassion and acceptance I feel from each and every person I've interacted with.  Even though we've never met I feel connected to you and you have become my true friends.  I hope we can meet IRL some day.   Love to you all.
good stuff here...Although it may sound corny a stark reality for me is I have never been sober today before.  Sure I have a lot of days in a row since my last drink however the reality is not one of us ever lived today sober before...Each day is new and all we have is this day.  My goal is to complete the day successfully sober and add another day to the total.  ..Also I can recall with great clarity exactly what it was like when I got sober the pain the suffering the realization that there was hope for me.   I was offered that hope for free from the men and women of AA who were there when I asked for help.   That small glimmer of hope that life could be different.  That someday I would not be a homeless drunk in the gutter anymore.   That someday I would be able to walk among the people of this world secure in the knowledge that I was equal to others worthy of having things like a home a family a job little things.  Also things like self respect no more self loathing friends.    ..It all came from a glimmer of hope that was shared with me by some guy named Mark when for whatever reason he thought I was worth talking to...There was no sd when I got sober heck the internet was a rare thing when I first got on the webs we had genie and bulletin boards where a few of us drunks who were doing this sober living deal started to meet up and share recovery with each other...As far as that on the webs it has come a long way but the basis of it all is the same.  One sober person reaching their hand out with a message of hope to someone who is longing for that small glimmer of hope...It is a good thing. 
Newcomers are my favorite to respond to that is what keeps me humble. I reach out and just say hi and talk about when I was brand new to SD and how I got through that first few weeks and why SD works for me. I just speak whatever comes to my mind and keep it in speaking from the I really. The newcomers help me to remember what it was like before I got sober and made the decision to not go back to drinking and that's what I talk about in most of my responses. I just try to give off good vibes and share what my late sponsor shared with me. Great post KJ!
I don't post that much and have had several badge resets along the way but what I have found helpful since I found this place is reading people's stories and identifying so much with the actions and experiences of so many of you here...Frankly its forced me to be honest with myself about my alcoholism.  Posters are often asked what they are doing differently this time well for me one thing is time around is not just being prepared to identify with others but to actually be humble enough to implement some advice! I can't thank you all enough for that.
I would say less than half the stuff old timers told me actually registered in my brain or helped me at the time. Doesn't mean they shouldn't say it because later on I would remember it when it made sense. 
Helpful to me from the first few days were words of support. Hang in there you can do this. Intermixed with the occasional grounding of "what are you going to do differently". ..The best posts to me matched the tone of my initial post. I recall around my 30 days me posting about just a build up of previously suppressed emotions that I couldn't begin to unravel and another person taking the tone of "relax this is probably a good thing" ..Just knowing I wasn't alone was sometimes enough but some times a little kick in the ass was warranted. 
I remember being very scared about the change I was making. I was just a lurker but it was invaluable to see other people who were making or had made the same change. I found reading each person's experiences invaluable - I certainly wouldn't be told what to do but listening to what other people did filled me with ideas and hope.
I honestly don't know. I think hearing about relapsing from others while unfortunate for them helps me realize what I don't want to have happen to me. 
Wow great question and one I've been thinking about as I start to sponsor guys. I'm not sure if it's a bit outside of the norm but I really appreciated hearing from and talking to old timers.  Sure it was great listening to other new comers and people with less than a year but what I really wanted to know was what did the folks with long term sobriety do to stay sober sooooo long. I couldn't manage more than a couple of hours without a drink and it just blew my mind that people were 10 15 20 30 and 40+ years sober and they were just as hardcore as I was at drinking. My sponsor was the guy at the meetings that I noticed was really into applying recovery principles into all his affairs and he took the time to answer the multitude of questions I had at the beginning. He also took me to a bunch of old timer meetings and introduced me to all the old fogeys who were tickled to death to have a newcomer in their midst. I soaked it all in like a sponge and I tried to make sure that I was as honest as possible with all my shares and that I was willing to consider any and all feedback I got from the old timers. These people had seen thousands of people come in and out of the rooms and they had seen what worked and what didn't so I took them at their word and applied the stuff they suggested and it's been great. No partying when new ok no major decisions when new ok work the steps ok take the problem to your sponsor and the solution to the meeting ok and on and on.... I was so incredibly jacked up when I got to my first meeting that I was willing to try anything to keep from drinking I had the gift of desperation. So what do I do with my sponsees?  I take them through the steps quickly I take them to meet my old timer friends and I try to keep it as simple as possible while only sharing my experience the same way it was done with me.
Hi! I appreciated that everyone was pragmatic yet kind.  I'm still amazed that people take the time to respond to someone rather than say 'read the FAQ' or 'this has been discussed here before look it up'. That graciousness to newcomers is a small thing but resonates a lot with a new person who may be as I was hungover confused and needing something to cling to. ..I keep coming back because it's a 24 hour/ 'I don't have to leave my house'way to connect with others who are trying to quit drinking which can feel really lonely especially at first. Even if we drank alone trying to be sober alone is way harder.  It reminds me not only that I'm not alone but also prods me into reality when the voice of denial starts to speak louder ('you are fine you don't need to quit'. Um thanks Voice but yes I do). I need the stories that resonate with me to help me take my decision seriously. ..Thanks for all that you do here! :) 
God I remember being *so angry* when I first got here. Just so mad confused and humbled (humiliated?) that I had allowed myself to get to the point where I was asking for help from strangers on the interwebs. ..I really appreciated people who had gone before me who said things to temper my anger or said things like "so what's your plan?"  Frankly that question - **what's your plan?** - was the most important thing for me. It forced me to acknowledge that I actually had no plan at all and that I'd be doomed to failure if I didn't get one asap. That is what stuck out here so vividly early on - that in order to get better I *actually had to take concrete actions.*  
* **Kindness** - #1 yo.* **Community** - I'm not alone..* **Hope** - Stopping is possible.* **Direction** - There is one destination yet many paths..* **Consistency** - I may wander r/SD is here when I need it..* **Personality** - So many good people here so many wonderful stories so much determination and perseverance. You know who you are. Stay golden r/SD.
