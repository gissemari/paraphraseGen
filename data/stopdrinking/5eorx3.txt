Up until a few days ago this year and my decision to stop drinking has been after the first bit fairly easy. I have been resting in my knowledge that I'd previously been sober for over 10 years so of course I can do this again and take it forward from there.  I've had occasional cravings yes but absolutely no concern that I would actually drink...This week though has been hard really hard and lots harder than I ever expected. I've spent *a lot* of time here on SD (I'm grateful that my job doesn't start until Monday so I've had the time to do that) because it's clear I'm not the only one.  ..This morning as I responded to someone's post I came up with something for myself -- identifying my Triggers my Temptations and creating Tactics for managing them. ..**Triggers:** My 20-year-old son is not home this year for Thanksgiving because we couldn't afford the flight.  I miss him horribly. I have virtually no family an emotionally vacuous relationship with my SO and very few friends (cue: pity party theme music). I feel alone isolated and sad.  **Tactic:** Write it down here now.  *Get it outside of myself* so it doesn't eat away at me. Understand that drinking will not fill this hole.  It never has and it never will.  Neither will sugar or bread but I may give myself a bye on those today...**Temptations:** *The holidays* and all of the "opportunities" (read: excuses) to drink.  The "good" wine.  The warm whiskey.  Yeah yeah.  **Tactics:** The Daily Check-In first and foremost.  *I will not drink today. I will not drink today. I will not drink today.* Take my own favorite beverages with me and play the tape forward.  A dozen LaCroix are better than one sip of that Cab Franc my SO will open at dinner.  Really. I know what path that sip takes me down. I just have to remember to keep that slippery muddy slope in the forefront of my mind.  ..I am grateful to have 11 months behind me right now because I have no doubt I'll get through it even if it's hard.  Because it is hard.  So I send my thoughts and love and internet hugs out to anyone else here who is struggling with your own Triggers and Temptations.  **I will not drink with you today.** And I hope you'll join me.

Great post thank you for laying it out that way.
I wont drink with you either. Today is a hard one for us all. It isnt worth it to drink but those little moments that pop up where it seems reasonable can be a challenge. Each victory makes us stronger. Tomorrow we shall be proud! Let's be an example for those who need a light.

Great post! I see this sub as a great way to get things off my chest too. Strangely writing it off and getting it out there makes me more committed to the cause. My wife doesn't think I have a drinking problem but it is a problem when you drink every day and can't really think clearly because they are always evening/night drinks. Getting so much positive feedback or recognition tells me I am not alone out there with this problem. I will not drink with you today!
