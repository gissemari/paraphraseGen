So a couple days ago I was cleaning my house; while running a vacuum under some furniture it sucked up something big enough to completely clog the hose. After shutting the vacuum down and taking the attachments off I found an old wine bottle cap that fit almost perfectly in the pipe; it had completely blocked all the airflow anywhere around it and I couldn't do anything until I literally beat it out of the hose.  ..  ..That's an almost picture perfect metaphor of a relapse; you're minding your business going about your life then suddenly an old habit appears out of nowhere and completely shuts you down until you put an inordinate amount of effort into getting yourself on track again. You waste a lot of time get frustrated in the process and the relief of kicking the habit doesn't always match the irritation that it causes because "god damnit it happened again."  ..  ..Just a thought. IWNDWYT ladies and germs; safe vacuuming. :)..  ..&amp;#x200B;
