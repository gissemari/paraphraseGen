Someone just posted a link to the UnPickled blog and as a consistent relapser who is in the very early stages of trying to stick it out yet again but this time for an unprecedented 40 days I find myself lurking here a lot but also reading voraciously everything and anything to do with quitting and specifically quitting on my own. So I followed the link and I loved the post; and I started to read the blog. And there was something else she said that is SO true for me that it made me gasp. Over the past few days lurking reading & commenting there have been a couple of things that you good people of reddit have said that have been a real moment of revelation that have made something click inside my head. It just so happens that this paragraph by this lady was one of those things. It is just so true for me and identifies exactly why every day is such a struggle. But it helps to know I am not alone and that I can do this...so I hope it helps you too and we can all do this! .Here is the paragraph:.."I could pinpoint the moment in each day when I pivoted and made the decision to drink.  I figured all I'd have to do was overcome that one hurdle each day   somehow I thought it would mean changing that one decision a day...Wrong!..As it turns out my habit is like a persistent bratty 3 year old that says  Can I have candy?  (No.)  Now can I have candy?  (No.)  Noowwww can I have some candy pleeeeease?  (No.)  I WANT CANDY!  (No darling.)  Wahhhhh candy! Candy! Candy! (No no no.)..I guess it's no wonder my head hurts at the end of the day. Wahhhh I want wine! I want wine now. How about now? Now can I have wine? Please? (No no and no.)..That's okay   I'm making it even if it means faking it."

Congrats on three days.  ..I had that voice in my head too.  Where I would wake up in the morning and proclaim I am not drinking today only to start feeling better and get cravings sometime around 3pm to 6pm where I would start negotiating and making plans to quit another day.  Pacing in front of the liquor store etc...However that voice is now gone.  I don't remember the exact moment it last spoke but it has been months.  If you're like me hang in there because my first week was the hardest and it got easier to the point now where the voice is gone.
[You can have candy \o/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMICD3aMZpw) just no wine.
