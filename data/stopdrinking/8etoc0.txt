Gosh doesn't the time fly?..To mark my 10-month milestone I thought I'd share some of my story and some of what I've learned about Addiction as it relates to my personal experience   hope you enjoy!..&amp;nbsp;...**Part I: My Family And Other Addicts (Where All The Trouble Started) **..&amp;nbsp;...Addiction is characterised by repeated compulsive engagement in rewarding and pleasurable stimuli in spite of undesired negative or adverse consequences . These stimuli could be all sorts of things: drugs alcohol nicotine food (especially fat and sugar) caffeine gambling &amp; risk-taking shopping &amp; spending work sex pornography videogames Redditing (!) etc etc . Healthy things like Kale and Broccoli are conspicuous by their absence from this list as they simply don't have the same mood-altering effect annoyingly ..I've often seen people wonder on here why it is that some people *can* seem to drink the odd one or two alcoholic drinks here and there or even get a bit drunk occasionally and it never turns into much of a problem but for others like me alcohol proves to be rather life-ruiningly moreish ..Addiction arises from a complex mixture of biological psychological and social factors which science is just beginning to understand  According to the Wikipedia entry on addiction  *roughly half of an individual's risk for developing an addiction is derived from genetics while the other half is derived from the environment*  although basically anyone can become addicted if they consume large enough quantities of an addictive substance for long enough... It also seems to be the case that for Addicts the  off switch' in our brains that tells us when we've had enough doesn't work so well .. Genetics loads the gun' and environment/exposure to the addictive substance  pulls the trigger' as the saying goes . .I believe I was an Addict-waiting-to-happen long before I was even born  That might sound like a strange thing to say but it's true  Addiction runs through both sides of my family tree like ivy  This is hardly surprising; Addicts in general either pair up with other Addicts or with Compulsive Helpers and that keeps the addiction genes and behavioural patterns circulating and being passed on within the population generation after generation ..To the best of my knowledge I'm the only one in my immediate family who got addicted to Alcohol but nicotine addiction in particular runs rampant on both sides going at least 4 generations back . My paternal Great-Grandfather for example risked attracting an enemy sniper's bullet and/or severe punishment from his commanding officers by smoking cigarettes after dark in the British Trenches during World War I so compelling was his nicotine addiction  My Father is a compulsive workaholic (I dread to think what'll happen when he retires!); an Aunt runs marathons and drinks coffee like it's going out of fashion (and also has no off-switch when she does occasionally drink alcohol!) my late Grandmother lost all her teeth and later developed a lot of health problems due to her sugar addiction (having switched from nicotine to sugar) both Grandfathers were virtually lifelong smokers and so it goes on . My addictive potential was there from the outset!..By contrast the  normies' in my family who *don't* suffer from Addiction are easily spotted . They tend to live a lot longer than those who do for a start . My other Grandmother virtually never drinks certainly never more than a modest glass of sherry if she does nor has she ever smoked or indulged in recreational drugs  She is still living independently is still sharp as a tack and is very active in her church and community at the age of nearly 88!. .My Mother can do an extraordinary magic trick  She occasionally has a teeny-tiny hobbit-sized glass of wine leaves half of it complains that it's gone straight to her head then carefully vacuum-seals the rest of the bottle and puts it back in the cupboard to gather dust more or less forever  She does not consume caffeine has never smoked or taken drugs has never knowingly gambled or taken a risk of any kind spends frugally and eats sensibly . .Even as a child I found it infuriating to be repeatedly told by her that I could only have *one* biscuit or piece of chocolate  How on earth could anyone be satisfied with only ONE biscuit for heaven's sake?!..A sensitive precocious and anxious child I never quite felt like I fitted in with most of my peer group for reasons that I could never quite put my finger on  I much preferred to lose myself in solitary activities like reading which I did voraciously often reading a book from cover to cover in a single sitting ..Although I had an ostensibly happy middle-class upbringing I had difficulty coping with Adverse Childhood Experiences and such things as strong emotions were rarely discussed or displayed openly at home (the proverbial British  Stiff Upper Lip' being alive and well in my family along with a certain amount of emotional dysfunction)  My Father was usually away working long hours and my Mother suffered from periodic bouts of depression anxiety and OCD-like-tendencies following a death in the family so growing up was a difficult and confusing experience for me at times  I entered into my teenage years as an academic high-achiever and put myself under great pressure to succeed in my exams and make my parents proud of me  Despite the excellent grades I could never quite shake the inexplicable sense of inner emptiness and disconnection that I was feeling without knowing *why* ..Later on the growing realisation that I was gay (and therefore  different') in a pretty conservative environment where such things were deeply taboo made me feel even more isolated and bewildered and feel that I had to bottle up my innermost feelings and keep them firmly to myself ..It was around this time that I tried smoking tobacco for the first time out of curiosity more than anything  I had seen both my Grandfathers doing it much to the pursed-lipped disapproval of my Mother and it appeared to me to be a very soothing and grown-up activity indeed if a somewhat illicit one  It also just so happened that my newfound  alternative arty' friendship group (where misfits and oddballs were welcomed!) were also dedicated smokers of cigarettes and the odd bit of weed lurking behind the school's Art Buildings out of sight of any prowling teachers or the Headmaster and I was soon joining in and having a jolly time of it indeed . .Unfortunately Mum has a nose like finely trained sniffer dog and instincts that would put any narcotics squad officer to shame and she can tell if you've even thought the word  cigarette' at 500 yards . When she located and confiscated my personal stash of weed and rolling tobacco (which was sadly less well-concealed than I'd imagined) and gave me hell for it I soon learned that indulgence in such pleasurable vices was an activity which had to be hidden at all costs and kept well away from nosy parkers and prying authority figures who might swoop in and spoil all the fun ..I was the owner of a Human Body and Brain without having been given an operating manual for it; and lacking some important bits of emotional programming and social skills was trying to navigate the difficult transition into adulthood in a wider culture where addictive substances like tobacco and alcohol were readily available attractively marketed and even socially-encouraged ..The parts of my brain involved in impulse control forward planning and decision-making had not yet finished maturing (that doesn't happen until the age of roughly 25-30) and yet here I was aged 16 already blithely dousing my brain with mood-altering substances  It was a recipe for disaster in hindsight . .At 17 some of my friends had begun experimenting with Alcohol chiefly the sickly-sweet  Alco-Pops' which were being heavily advertised at the time so being an angsty and rebellious teenager with an appetite for risky and thrill-seeking behaviour I was soon persuaded to join in  The Ethanol molecules entered my bloodstream via my stomach and swiftly passed through my blood-brain barrier where they began to alter the levels of various neurotransmitters (*the chemical messengers which transmit the signals throughout the body that control thought processes behaviour and emotion*) within my brain  In short this peculiar beverage produced a very enjoyable sensation of elation relaxation and camaraderie and made me feel unusually sociable and less shy how marvellous!..I felt instinctively that this feeling was a Very Good Thing Indeed and one which I was rather keen to experience frequently from that point on and thus the Feedback Loop of Addiction was off to a flying start ..&amp;nbsp;.  ..**Part II: Boiling The Frog   How My Alcohol Addiction Developed And Progressed **...&amp;nbsp;....During my university years from the age of 18 I repeatedly and unquestioningly sought out the opportunity to drink immoderate amounts of alcohol in the company of others who were doing the same - the whole student culture seemed to revolve around it and I depended upon it to quell my social anxiety connect with people and have FUN! We all agreed insofar as we ever gave any thought to it at all that people who didn't drink were terribly boring and must have some kind of perverse puritanical aversion to letting their hair down and enjoying themselves ..I seemed to have quite a high tolerance to it from the outset and often would get a bit carried away and not know quite when to stop once I'd started  I didn't let a trifling matter like the occasional killer hangover or bout of alcohol poisoning deter me though I simply learned my limits and not to mix my drinks and carried on  I was young and having  fun' and getting utterly shitfaced on a regular basis is just what young British people *do* apparently . .After a few years of this with the stress of finals looming I experienced my first nervous breakdown and episode of severe anxiety and depression and after a particularly regrettable vodka-related incident part of me realised that I had to at least stop drinking spirits and stick to something more innocuous like beer instead . The thought of stopping altogether never entered my head of course  I had no idea that all the boozing could actually be *causing* the anxiety and depression because at the time it felt very much like it was *helping* . A magical medicine to instantly improve my mood help me forget my worries and feel better if only temporarily ..After I graduated feeling thoroughly frazzled and with no clear idea of what I wanted to actually do with my life I spent a few years in my mid-20's working as a barman and pub musician in an environment where regular heavy drinking seemed like the most normal thing in the world  It was here for the first time that I learned from more seasoned Boozers that a  Hair of the Dog' could alleviate the distressing symptoms of a hangover and soon it wasn't unheard of for me to have an early-afternoon pint of lager or a cheeky vodka-and-orange (for the vitamins!) as a pick-me-up after a particularly heavy night of boozing  It never occurred to me that drinking to relieve the bad feelings caused by the previous day's drinking might actually be a REALLY TERRIBLE IDEA ..Unbeknownst to me regular exposure to large quantities of this addictive substance was quietly rearranging my brain chemistry (particularly dopamine and GABA) forging new neural pathways altering bits and pieces of the way that certain genes were expressed and forming a self-reinforcing feedback loop of behaviour driven by my unconscious mind  In short I was developing an ever-worsening Addiction . .As the years went by jobs and relationships came and went and the bouts of depression and anxiety came and went but with increasing frequency  The Alcohol stayed though as an old faithful friend to whom I could always turn for solace in times of need  I'd never bothered to develop any other coping mechanisms of course how could I have done? When all you have is a Hammer every problem looks like a Nail as the saying goes ..All the while my body and brain were sneakily adapting their inner workings in an effort to maintain equilibrium and normal functioning and counteract the effects of the regular infusion of alcohol  My liver in particular was working overtime to break down and get rid of the alcohol and its metabolites  To me this simply meant that my tolerance increased so that more drink was needed more often to achieve the desired effect  The crippling hangovers of my youth had mostly vanished to be replaced with a low-grade sense of feeling generally manky in the mornings and throughout the day until I had finished whatever needed doing and I could feel the relief of that First Drink again in the evening (quickly followed by the second third and fourth) without which I found I would struggle to sleep . .As time went on I began to notice cravings and distinct withdrawal symptoms (including sweating agitation and mild shakiness) when I hadn't had a drink since the previous day as my blood alcohol levels approached zero and my neurotransmitters and stress hormones were still in overdrive  I found that I sometimes needed a swift and stealthy pint of beer at lunch-time or a little splash of brandy in my coffee to get through a difficult day at work and keep me feeling chipper ..It was at this point I began to suspect that I had a little tiny bit of an alcohol problem so I almost immediately - a mere 4 years later following a particularly bad bender - made arrangements to see a doctor and reluctantly confessed to him what I was experiencing  The doctor advised me to stop drinking entirely much to my dismay... Radio Woody was tuned firmly to *Booze FM* at the time and I was rather hoping to continue drinking but avoid the negative consequences and thus was not quite ready to hear what he was telling me ..I threw away his prescription white-knuckled through a week or so of withdrawal symptoms determined to prove that I wasn't an  Alcoholic' (*I'm a Drinking Enthusiast  Alcoholics go to meetings*!) began to feel better and soon convinced myself that I was fine  Surely I could still enjoy the occasional harmless glass of delicious frosty beer now and again - in strictest moderation this time?...&amp;nbsp;....**Part III: Surely I Can Moderate This Time?**..&amp;nbsp;...Of course it was still the same substance chemically interacting with the same brain so almost immediately the  MORE' switch was flipped back into the  On' position and the cycle of craving roared back into life even more strongly than before ..Within no time at all my drinking had picked up exactly where I left off and another year and a half of heavy nightly drinking followed  Due to increasing poverty and desperation it was now mostly the World's Cheapest Cider consumed straight from the bottle at whatever temperature it left the shop at and gallons of my atrocious homebrew which I had stopped bothering to siphon into bottles in favour of dipping my mug straight into the bucket come the end ..I had reached the point where I didn't *want* to drink I *had* to drink  Every morning I would swear  Never Again' yet by the evening that switch would flip and I would find myself helplessly propelled towards the nearest source of alcohol almost as if I was on Autopilot  I could never have  Just One' as any time I tried that I found that it triggered a strong craving for MOOOORRRE ..Eventually at the end of about 15 years of consuming heroic quantities of Ethanol the negative side-effects from it had started to become distressingly apparent: piss-poor decision-making debt increasing social isolation terrible sleeping problems gnawing anxiety periods of borderline mania and blackest depression constant 'brain fog' not to mention the frightening suicidal thoughts that were increasingly becoming a feature of my daily existence  On top of this  a constellation of alarming physical symptoms including palpitations dizzy spells twitching aches and pains gastro-intestinal catastrophe malnourishment constantly pissing like a racehorse a patch of recurring yeast infection on my chest and various others  I looked and felt awful ..Finally I could ignore the problem no longer and knew I had to get sober for real this time  I again sought the help of my doctor for the withdrawal symptoms (which were worse this time due to the phenomenon of  Kindling') was given a prescription of Librium to get me over the hump and found my way to this sub for the help and support of the kindly folks here who had already walked that path ahead of me and who were ready to provide the tools and information I needed in order to escape from the hell of active alcohol addiction a literal prison of my own making ..To my amazement 10 months later here I am stone-cold sober and quite happy about it!..It hasn't always been easy but it's been worth it ..I now have a much better understanding of myself and my addiction as well as a better understanding of what Alcohol *is* and what it *does*  My addiction is not my *fault* but it is my *problem* ..I am no longer operating under the delusion that it's just a harmless bit of fun and a handy social lubricant but rather it is a deadly and destructive poison which has no business being inside my body ever again if I can possibly help it  I'll always have addictive tendencies but I now know how to manage my condition One Day At A Time by avoiding just that First Drink and regularly talking to and helping other addicts and sharing my story  By doing so I can keep that maddening little voice in my head (that still occasionally tries to persuade me that I'm clearly fine and can definitely drink like a normal person now) firmly in check!..I don't have a drinking problem *now*  I could *get* one again really quickly all it would take would be a few drinks!..Thanks for reading folks!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
----------immediate responses--------

Really enjoyed the insights into the nature of addiction how it fits into your story. Slightly different trajectories but I found myself nodding along in agreement most of the way through...Congrats on your 10 months!..IWNDWYT
First off... Way to go on 10 Months Sober! ..Your "story" and message is welcoming. ..**Thank you for posting and you should be VERY proud of where you are today.**..Another WOW moment for me... Sitting at my 2 week mark!..But if I may share with you... I have been working on my 'Recovery' for over 2 years 3 months. In that time I have strung together 50\-60 sober days in a row. But then "slip" for a couple months .. Then back to sober. ..I cannot take this roller coaster any more. ..I pray WE can remain "drink" free. ..At least for today! One Day at a time!.. IWNDWYT
Woody! Happy 300 days!..As a long time lurker I've seen you around here quite a bit constantly and consistently helping others...It's great to read your story and how far you've come..Thanks for being here - you're awesome..and a genuine inspiration. ..All the best.
Woody..Congratulations on your 300 days. Your story was amazingly well written familiar and helpful. I always look forward to your comments and seeing you around the sub. Here is to another 300 more!
Woody I know you do loads around here to encourage and inspire people but I really think you have a book in you! Would never surprise me to see you being interviewed on daytime TV as Ireland's answer to Annie Grace soon and we'll be able to say  ah we knew him back when...'.  And we'll know it's you because we'll recognise your beard ;\)..Congrats on 10 months fella   loving your work.
Thank you for sharing this. It's so helpful to read other people's experiences.
Congrats Woody! Your writing is compelling! I'd love to hear about the first full year of recovery from you in 65 days then 2 years recovery etc. ..IWNDWYT!
Hi Woody ..I got about half way through and was so engrossed that I had to scroll back to the beginning and check whether I recognised the posting name..I actually think I knew instinctively it would be you!!.Made me laugh out loud many times in recognition..... especially the spookily similar family background. .My Ma can also smell the  thought of a cigarette from approx. 4.5 miles away  ..Congratulations on 10 months..... an inspiration to us all...From reading through the comments it seems I'm not alone in looking forward toand devouring your support and advice...Please keep going keep posting and keep inspiring us all...I'll book my place in the audience for the  Late Late Show  in preparation for your first appearance ..Kiki.xx..
Read this whole thing after watching a couple of the videos you recommended me...You are absolutely right the SIGNIFICANT parallels from your story to my life is crazy. I've only been drinking for about a year now; but it's gone from 1-2 shots every few weeks to waking up and pouring my first shot of vodka. ..I don't count anymore. That doesn't help either. ..I woke up and remembered this sub today and decided to post here instead of taking my first shot. I might drink today I have so little self control. ..However I did text my mom and asked her to come support me at AA meetings. We both are struggling with separate things and AA/NA meetings used to give her a sense of spirituality I haven't felt. ..Thank you so much for sharing. Your story had me in tears as well as bursting out laughing. You have a lovely sense of humor and wit as well as a brilliant writing style. ..Sending many good thoughts :) 
Congrats Woody! Only been a part of this community for a couple of days and I already see you everywhere. Thank you so much for helping others out and leading by example. I see myself in what you've wrote and imagine myself where you are today. Your list of physical and mental symptoms are what made me eventually go to the doctor right down to the twitching and palpitations and seeing you write them down makes me know that I can soon be rid of all of them if I just keep focused on my sobriety...Also if I didn't already know you were well read I would definitely know now; you have a wonderful way with writing.
Congratulations brother! I raise my cup of coffee  to you!
Hey that wasn't bad at all woody :) I love it when people take the time to write a well thought out post like this to share their milestones with us so thanks for that. Looks like you got the wisdom/ knowledge to keep this up and i sincerely hope you do i like seeing you around here :)..Glad to have you in our team...Hi5 buddy ;)
WOOOOOOODY!!! Congrats on **300** Days my love! Woooohooooo I'm so proud of you! Yeah I know you weren't thrilled about dancing with me on this big day but I figured at least you could [jump in the line lol!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2BWd2S-vA0)..What a beautifully written post! I think I speak for many when I say that your kind compassionate comments to our members are so touching so meaningful. You show a certain type of support that just makes us feel at ease; you assure us that everything's gonna be OK - for those that have .
Mucho mucho congrats on 300 Woody! :)
Thanks so much for sharing...I like that you mentioned that the way you drank was how young Brits were "supposed to" drink. As a millennial from Canada I grew up watching the TV show Skins and was SO IN LOVE with their young lives of getting fucked up on drugs and alcohol all the time. I wanted so badly to emulate that life haha. I had a few internet friends in England who all lived that way. It really romanticized it all didn't it?..I spent most of my life until now thinking I don't have an addictive personality... Meanwhile I was smoking cigarettes from 18 on smoking a ton of weed drinking heavily popping pills and snorting anything I got my hands on. Nothing for me was ever in moderation but I really tricked myself and FULLY believed that it was my choice.
Great post -- thanks for sharing -- and congrats on 300 days!!
Congratulations on 10 months Woody!  I want to thank you for the humor and encouragement you have shared with all of us on the board.  I think your story should be posted in the Saturday Shares.  You have a way with words and I can just imagine your mother sniffing you down.  My father quit smoking when I was 5 years old.  I never smoked until I was 18.  We called him the Schnozz because whilst giving out a hug I could hear the inhale happening trying to detect any faint smell of cigarettes or pot. BWWAAAAAAA!!!!!! Have a great day!  IWNDWYT
Thanks Woody for this write-up and all the helpful and encouraging support you provide to me and others in this community!..Congratulations on 10 months!
I've always just thought of you as the poster who has 2 more days than me. Thanks for posting your story.
Yes I think they would indeed   
For your 300 mate.....WE.. ARE.. SD-AAAAGGHHH
Congratulations on your 10 months Woody!  Everyone already beat me to it but I too appreciate your honesty support and humor on SD. I agree with others that you've got a book lurking in you.  Looking forward to celebrating your year soon!
Wow a great sobering read (no pun intended) for which I could relate to. I'm coming up on the day 300 and not looking back ! IWNDWYT 
Congratulations on 10 months Woody!              .You sure know how to write!  .Thank you so much! Enjoy your day/nite! 
Congrats Woody!  Well done!
Congrats Woody! I've been here for about a week and your comments are the ones that I consistently see at the top. You always want to help others and you do a great job. Glad to see that you are helping yourself!..Thanks for posting this. I like to read the stories of the frequent posters here to get an idea of their backstories and why they came here. Now that I know a little more about what you've been through I feel like I can relate more to you and your advice. For instance I never knew that you were gay. I am gay as well and I think that some of the confusion and isolation that comes with it contributes to abusing alcohol. I'm glad that I have a gaybro here and I'll be watching for your future posts. I will not drink with you today!
Thanks for sharing woody!!.So glad you are here in this community. .Happy 10 months :)
I could so relate to so much of this even though I'm a hetero woman who grew up in the Bible Belt of Texas USA. Thank you for sharing. I appreciate your honesty and I appreciate you making me feel less alone in this thing. Great job on 10 months. You are an inspiration. IWNDWYT.
Congratulations on 300 Woody!!!.Don't turn around right behind you!  
The drinks are indeed laughably overpriced. Despite that that's about the only thing I remember from my times going there. In my experience the types of people vary depending on the type of bar you go to. What really turned me off of some of the bars was the leather that some of the guys would be wearing
Well played Woody. Have to say you and a couple of others were instrumental in getting me to day 4. Much appreciated. IWNDWYT 
thank for this. you have some wonderful insight and explanations combined with sharp self awareness...congrats on your journey and sobriety. 
Thank you for sharing your story Woody! I have so enjoyed your posts during my journey on SD. I'm very glad you are here! IWNDWYT!
Congratulations Woody-- you da man. You are doing it. ..And thanks so much for helping me and others live healthier by sharing your stories analyses research wisdom and humor. xo IWNDWYT
Woody!!! So nice to "see" you again (with over 100k subscribers now people get lost...though this is a good thing)!..I loved reading your story. Boy the bit about your personality as a child could've come from my own mouth. We have both stuck to it haven't we? From our first weeks and you being the first stand-out member of this community for me. ..I've got 300 days on Tuesday - so excited I've marked it on my calendar (that means I've put it as a reminder on my phone) :) and for some reason 300 just feels amazing to me. A big milestone. It's a nice number. ..I'm so proud of you. I hope that you are writing/playing more music. What a gift to have a talent like that to dive into when you've left the bottle. Your account of the cycle of addiction has reaffirmed everything I know but sometimes like to deny (I still toy with the idea of moderation but never for long as thankfully my senses win over). Thank you for this post and your cheery presence along the way! IWNDWYT!
Woody!!!  I missed your 300 party but you guys are never too far from my thoughts.  So wonderful to hear more of your story and more of your life.  And like I've said before I just love reading your posts.  Such a talented writer...You're awesome my good man!!  And keep rockin those sober days!!
