Hey all  ..Could just use some support right now. This will probably be pretty rambly warning in advance. I've been looking up AA meetings in the area all week but my (social) anxiety and general fatigue have been getting the best of me. My drinking got pretty bad in 2012 but I stopped most of my destructive behaviors with the help of therapy mental health support groups a few AA meetings and great friends.  ..However lately my cravings have gotten as bad as they were back then and it's scaring me. I have quite a bit of unstructured time at the moment and some major life events coming up that are exciting but stressful. I'm also alone for much of the day 3 days a week due to my partner and I's conflicting schedules. That combined with really poor sleep caused by an erratic work schedule depression lack of exercise etc etc. is making avoiding drinking/doing other drugs so so hard.  ..My partner is really supportive in every way but AA meetings. They don't agree with the general philosophy and don't seem to like labeling me as an alcoholic. It's weird though because they give me pep talks to avoid drinking and give me a hard time if I ever keep alcohol at the house (which is luckily very rarely). So I'm hesitant to go to meetings because I feel like I would have to hide that just like I would shamefully hide drinking.  ..Anyway thanks for reading just needed to get all this off my chest. I'm really lucky to have a great support structure of friends and mental health providers but none of them have struggled with addiction (that I know of). There's one exception but it's my boss and I don't know if it would be appropriate to open up to them more than just hinting at what I'm going through. In any case it's nice to read the perspectives of people who share this struggle. You all are an inspiration.

Boredom = drinking for me. My suggestion word be to find something that occupies your time...pronto. I was incredibly inactive but I started walking. Its easy not strenuous free and it releases endorphins. Try and make yourself as tired as possible. 
If your partner had a philisophical disagreement with a medical treatment for a dangerous illness would you forego the treatment? Your health your life your choice. No explanation needed. Do what it takes and your partner can work out their philosophy for themselves. Maybe when you're stronger you can talk about it. ..My husband thinks AA is stupid and I go anyway. He cares too much for me to give me shit about protecting myself though he does tease me a bit. It's better than drinking. Please be safe and follow your heart when it comes to finding support. Best to you.
