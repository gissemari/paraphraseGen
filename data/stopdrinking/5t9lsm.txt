You know usually when life tossed you some hard times you used to cling to the alcohol as a comforter a trusted friend and a well known enemy. ..The stuff that I've gone trough lately would be enough to make me run for the drug suppliers door and use drugs for the first time in my life (I've never taken drugs) but it is just so you get an idea what HELL I've been trough lately unemployment judgemental lonely low self-esteem sad truths and discoveries - enough to pick down even the most deluded optimist in the world harsh words - but the truth...But it's a good thing I don't know what drugs does to me (you know the same effect as drinking for the first time I can imagine but with a MUCH worse addiction and downfall I can imagine).....This would have been the time where I'd run for the bottle and just forget it all. But my body has somehow become immune to the blissful satisfaction I used to get from the alcohol (the pleasant buzz) it's gone - forever. I stayed away from alcohol for months at a time in here - had a few relapses (the RS - number of resets before the new daycount) but it did not spare me the side-effects in fact...the side effects where like 10x stronger almost leading to suicide. ..Right now it's like standing naked on a mountain top in the middle of the forest you see nature around you but no one sees you albet you've been stripped for everything you thought was you...I've noticed that forgetting the past is the best I can do - so I'll work on that..

Sorry about the rough times but great job not turning to alcohol.  As has been said here many times "there's nothing so bad that alcohol can't make it worse."
