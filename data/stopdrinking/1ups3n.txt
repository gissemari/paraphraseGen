At the beginning of December I was in a bit of a mess going through the first stages of relapse and posted this http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1sk8e7/3_and_a_half_months_sober_and_now_the_true/  I've not signed onto Reddit since that day but after reading everybodies replies and looking at things from a different viewpoint I managed to stay sober over xmas and new year thanks to all your support playing JRPG's learning to play keyboard and LOTS of days out. At 4 and a half months I'm seeing a drug and addiction counsellor which has helped me see things more introspectively as a person not just as an alcoholic and has helped me start working on my myriad issues that I wasn't even aware I had because I drowned them all with alcohol over the years. I've also now come to terms with the fact that I've had alcohol addiction since I was 18 12 years ago and it progressed into severe alcoholism 7 years ago. Thanks again for all the support and kind words
