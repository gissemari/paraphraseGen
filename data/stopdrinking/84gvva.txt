It  was so odd. I was half asleep in bed. My thoughts were fuzzy. But this sharp desire for the taste of a particular ale I used to love but haven't had in three years cut through my thoughts. And I found myself thinking vaguely how bad could it be to have 3 of them? ..By the time I woke up fully I'd pushed those thoughts all the way away and knew what was what. ..But I don't like that. The last time I relapsed albeit briefly it was preceded by thoughts like that. And since I won't allow them anymore I guess my mind has to play with them when I'm half asleep or something. Which is kind of scary actually. I can't be 100% in control of my thoughts all the time not if I'm doing human things like sleeping. ..Just wanted to post this here to expose this thought to reality.

You're getting closer to building a habit of not drinking. It's why the cravings only hit in your subconscious instead if your waking mind. Means you're doing well and the fear is valid and healthy as well. No worries.
