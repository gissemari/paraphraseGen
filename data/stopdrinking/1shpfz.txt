   Today marks the first full week I have gone in years without taking a drink or a smoke. I have been struggling with an steadily worsening drinking problem for some years now. .    I've tried to quit and get my life together several times usually after getting blackout drunk and waking up feeling like shit. My quit usually lasts a day or two until I'm feeling better. .    I've been trying to quit smoking since I started over 10 years ago. .    Today is the longest I've gone in years without "cheating" and I'm still going strong. I want to thank SD for the inspiration I've found lurking here over the last week. You guys are great :)

If we are doing it certainly you can do it. Welcome. 
I was a counselor for 4 years. My patients would always tell me that there's no way they could quit BOTH problems. I always told them that if they're going to quit one might as well get everything out of the way!..With that said make sure you have a vice! Exercise gaming sex reading meditation music...just have something. Everybody needs something they can fall back on when they need a break...Congrats!
Well done that's an awesome achievement. I have given up smoking three times this year pills patches chewies ugh! Each time would blow it drunk! Never occurred to me to stop drinking......but that's a story in itself! So I did stop drinking and three weeks in stopped smoking.......just stopped! No walk in the park that's for sure but feeling clean and sober which is very exciting. This is a great place to hang out look forward to sharing your success.
