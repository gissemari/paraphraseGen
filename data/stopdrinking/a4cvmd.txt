Started off the week getting sick and having to stay home all week wife was worried I'd relapse with all this free time but I made it through. Last night was the hardest I wanted to just get a bottle of crown and drown out the world. Came here instead read some inspirational posts and had some sparkling water instead. Today I woke up finally feeling like myself and so happy that I didn't drink. Now I have a whole day with my daughter and don't feel like shit. ..Thank you SD and IWNDWYT!

You're a hero! Well done I will see you at the 30 day mark.
I'm proud of you ! Right after a month was a dangerous time for me.  Thoughts of moderation came.  But you made it through! It will keep getting better! IWNDWYT
