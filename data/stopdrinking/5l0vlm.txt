I am 52 days sober and I'm on vacation with my family in Florida-really feeling the urge today...  my wife and extended family all drink and they will be drinking tonight.  I need to be strong today.

You can do this! Vacation only lasts so long. Stay strong.
where in florida?  Good luck to you.  Florida is not a great state to be sober in...I live in south Florida just north of Palm Beach.
I'm in south Florida. It's very much a party place but you can do this. Stay strong I won't drink with you tonight. 
Take it one day at a time.  Hour by hour if you need to.  You can do it. I won't be drinking with you. .
This is one of those trial-by-fire occasions.  Clear this hurdle and you will develop almost a superpower to stare into the belly of the beast and walk away unscathed...I'll be here in CA not drinking with you!
You got this!!! I believe in you and will not drink with you today. 
Hope you stayed strong. You got this. 
Last time I was on vacation in Florida my bff and I woke up in the er I was tearing the iv out of my arm and took a swing at a nurse.  She knocked a tooth out and had a concussion.  We were drugged (most likely by the bartender) and sent to the hospital in a cab by the hotel.  Ended up having to fly home bruised battered and with one of the worst hangovers I can recall.  Fuck Florida vacations lol.  Other than that it was lovely of course
I drank today..  2 martinis and 3 glasses of wine at big family dinner.  I'm not sure what this means but I like not drinking more!
