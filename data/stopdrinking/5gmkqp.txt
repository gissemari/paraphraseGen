And it feels weird. Lots of bad memories. I feel grateful that I don't recognize the person I used to be; but I also feel confused guilty etc. ..I sent him a message that was an apology (which I gave three years ago but haven't spoken to him since then) and congratulated him on a new job he got. He read it but no response. I'm trying to be at peace with this but struggling in that regard.

I'd say if he doesn't respond back within the week he's not worth your time.
