This is my 11th day of being alcohol free I don't find the weekdays much of a problem but it's the weekend that I struggle with. This weekend I got over my first major hurdle. My friend group has a big drinking culture and we all headed out as normal but this time I didn't drink and stuck to redbull and water. I must admit I was nervous before hand because there has been times when drinking that I haven't been able to get drunk while all my friends were wasted and I absolutely hated it. ..But I had the best time. 100% better than when I drink. I didn't do anything stupid or cringe I can remember the night clearly and it felt great being in control. I had expectations that I would be that grumpy guy of the group who clearly didn't want to be out but that couldn't of been any more wrong! I realise now that I don't need alcohol to be social and have a good time if I want to enjoy my self then I can do that all the better while sober!..Cheers for listening guys :) ...

Well done! Congrats on making it to Day 11 and getting to enjoy something you probably wouldn't have enjoyed much otherwise. I will not drink with you today! :)
That's great to hear!
