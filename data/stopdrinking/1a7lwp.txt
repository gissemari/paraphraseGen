Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Told a close friend about my struggles.  Afterwards we had a long talk about her drug struggles and how she's considered getting help too.  It feels good know what a friend is and being able to trust...Struggle: Work stress.  Yesterday I seriously started questioning if the career path I'm on is the right one for me...General chat: Temperatures above 0 make me a happy man...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:  Fifteen weeks today.   Down about 25 pounds...Struggle:   I have a lot of very grand plans about what to do with my new spare time but I don't quite yet have the energy to fully dive into them.   I just dabble in them.  Which is fine.  I'm just finding out that I'm human...General:  I do volunteer work now and there were plans for a few of us to discuss something at a bar.  I was actually excited about this for a strange reason -- when we got there I wanted to order a ginger ale and tell these new people who just met me that I don't drink.   These would have been the first people on Earth who always knew me as "the guy who doesn't drink."  I really loved that idea.  Turns out we didn't go.   Ah well they will find out eventually... 
Good morning all today's triumph features my lowest weight in nearly 10 years.  Down about 30 from 6 months ago.  ..Still struggling with stress.  That shit bums me out and I still have a twinge of a desire every once in a while.  Sometimes after work my mind drifts back to my old evening routine and there's about a half hour period where I have to distract myself long enough to reset the old brain...Additionally I'm getting more and more used to telling people I don't drink.  I also am at a point right now where I have pretty much stopped caring what people think when I tell them especially if they aren't close to me.  If someone I don't know well says "why?" when I tell them I'll have water instead of beer I have stopped feeling the need to explain myself.  Why?  Because fuck you that's why.   I of course don't say that out loud but I do think it especially when people ask me about it and it is clearly none of their damn business.  Any thoughts on this line of thinking?  I'm never really combative about it but when pushed I am now more able to say "well I just don't" and leave it at that.  I'd love to respond to the question by saying "why don't you like eating shit? Well same reason I don't drink."  However I would probably not be the best person to hang out with if I constantly said stuff like that.
Triumph:  I almost never even think about drinking anymore!..Struggle:  I sometimes substitute alcohol with food.  Especially this week which has been particularly stressful.  Like enough food that I still feel "hungover" the next day.  Any thoughts about not just replacing one bad habit with another?
Triumph: this is day 5! ..Also realised something very strange. i've never been close to my family and particulary my father. he was very straight and religious and we never got along and he's very tight with cash. he's never been a drinker in fact he probably drinks fewer beers in a year than i did in a day. ..i think from an early age i rebelled against him and what he stood for looking for fun quick laughs the easy ride money was there to be spent and enjoyed. and until i was about 30 i had it all. my own company fun - definately over drinking but it was fun and my body seemed to handle it etc etc. then i hit a stone in the road and i just gave up. cue the next 10 years of daily drinking from morning till night pancreatitis losing almost everything living paycheck to paycheck and lying - stealling when that didn't work out. then i got fired and things got worse. more booze so many failed attempts at sobriety just giving up at the first sign of struggle and the "fuck that i'll just get a beer" thinking until the "fuck that i need a beer" to stop the shakes the voices my thoughts everything.....then last friday at 4 oclock in the afternoon after my daily nap from morning boozing i decided something had to change so instead of pulling on my clothes and reaching for a beer as always i just stayed in bed. i was in bed most of saturday as well but i did muster the strength to rid the flat of booze.....sunday was pretty rough as well but i went for a walk and it hit me like a ton of bricks. my dad is a fucking hero. i saw then that he's a fighter. he lost jobs had a company go tits up had all the struggles anyone else has had and he never gave up. he'd get up brush himself off and try again. he was also always there for us making sure we had a good education taking us to sporting events etc etc. hell he's also bailed my arse out with cash a few times...maybe it's because my emotions are all over the fucking show but this has been one hell of a realization for me. a man who i've always wanted to be the opposite of has become my fucking hero... i can't stop thinking about this. I might put it in a letter to him..struggle: withdrawal emotions are really all over the show. yesterday i flew of the handle at something that would normally make me laugh. just want to feel normal but don't really know what normal is / should be at the moment...general chat: sorry for the length. just wanted to get this out. didn't mean to ramble
&gt;Work stress. Yesterday I seriously started questioning if the career path I'm on is the right one for me.. .Thing is I get stressed out too but I still love my path in my career too. So some days it's a love/hate relationship.. .I could probably do my work with a nip in my coffee or relax with a glass or box of wine at the end of the day but today again i woke up without a hangover so today is a great day to be sober!. .
I love the What's Up Wednesday threads...Triumph: I am 2 pounds away from my goal weight.  My exercise has been great this past week...Struggle: nothing major right now.  Work and home life are hectic as usual...General chat: the next 2 weeks are spring break.  Mother-in-law visits the second week.  We get along well so it should be fun.
Triumph: I haven't been hung over in twenty three days. I feel like my brain works better. I haven't made a fool of myself in twenty three days...Struggle: I'm still working on my laid off situation. Although I have a great lead. Also im concered that I will need to lock myself in my closet on St Patrick's Day. Damn Irish blood...General: I'm getting out more in a healthy way. I have got back into golf. I have a strong desire to get involved in my community. 
Thanks for posting this.  Sorry you're having struggles...**Triumph**: I got a [new bike](http://imgur.com/89LyFFH) over the weekend and have been out riding (last night and today were pretty fucking cold in Maryland).  But it's been fun and I'm down to 242.5 pounds! 12.5 more pounds and I match what's on my driver's license.  22.5 more pounds and I've reached my goal!..I haven't had any urges and am settling in well with alcohol just not being a part of my life.  I don't care if/when others drink around me I'm just a person who doesn't drink...**Struggle**: Sorry.  I've got nothing this week.  It's been a great week!..**General Chat**: Come on Spring!
**triumph** every day.  An on extended hiking photo bird watching trip to south west.  Hitting meetings loving life. Call from grand sponsee who is starting work as alcohol addiction counselor ( met him in prison meeting). ..**struggle** nothing really staying grounded..
Triumph: 3 weeks today!  It feels good to "wake up" in the morning instead of "come to".  I dream all night like I used to before I started drinking.  The last 3 work days I have been a machine much more focused and productive. ..Struggle: Good god despite everything I said above I have had moments where I become perfectly willing to drink again.  It always happens after the liquor stores are closed and I have no alcohol in the house so it doesn't become anything but at that moment if I did have opportunity I very well might have given in.  Also I hurt my calf on Friday of last week then hurt the bottom of my foot since I was walking on my calf funny.  Result is I haven't done a cardio day since that Friday and have replaced said exercise with eating really unhealthy.  I think I might have actually gained weight the last 4 days...General Chat. I'm considering buying a car that is basically a Honda Civic.  I really like everything about it with one exception.  I'm 6'4 and I barely fit into it.  Once I'm in I don't think anyone can sit behind me.  I stew about it everyday.
triumph: hitting 5 months on friday was a highlight. i realized it while i was on vacation in california a trip i know i was only able to plan save up for and execute via my being sober. i visited my boyfriend who is also 5 months sober and we had the best time being a 'normal' couple and doing things like going out to eat and going to the beach and watching movies instead of what we used to do which was just get shitfaced. i also got to see a ton of friends i haven't seen since last may and it was excellent. there were a few different occurances of old close friends telling me they were really impressed and proud of me for not drinking which felt really good since i knew these people throughout college when i was drinking pretty hard...struggle: sucks to be back to school and work after a week's vacation in the sunshine. experiencing some anxiety and stress about getting back into the swing of things. weather here is depressing. blah. i have to do laundry today and work on a huge literature review. not a fun way to spend my only day off but it will feel good to be productive and i know it will alleviate my anxiety to get stuff done...general chat: had a douchebag bartender at trivia last night who was jokingly making fun of me for drinking soda and seltzer all night. i half-heartedly laughed along and kind of said nothing but then when he kept doing it i just stopped smiling. he apologized because i think he could see i was irritated and sincerely told me that he was just giving me a hard time and i could get whatever i wanted. still it rubbed me the wrong way. when everyone else would order more beer/liquor and i'd ask for another diet coke he said stuff like "JEEZ SHE'S A LOTTA FUN WHERE'D YOU FIND HER?" and it's like man fuck you i am a lot of fun a lot more fun than when i was binge drinking and wasting my time having meaningless conversations with bartenders like you dude. anyway my team and i won second place and a $20 gift card haha.
Yesterday I was hanging with all my friends and a severe case of anxiety come over me when they talked about drinking tonight. They invited me but I declined I will probably go to an AA meeting instead. No one know that I have been going to AA. This is new to me and hard to adjust but I know I can not go back to the place I was before. 
Triumph: finding the strength to start over again and tell my fiance that I've lied out of humiliation and weakness about my alcohol intake- told him instead that for me every waking moment is clouded by either drinking or wanting to drink. But I told him...Struggle: How on earth did I get this way. My first year of grad school was one long binge session. A whole year of 6 beers a day. I hate myself for that. I tried so hard to get counseling and cut all alcohol away from my house denzel style. I hated myself for that. I felt like I was wasting that freedom and recklessnes. How harmless is a movie with a bottle of wine? how romantic right?..I hate to rant. I'm so frustrated about the hold it has on me. I wish I could kill the part of me that glorifies it so much. I am otherwise so happy with life. I know I am capable of living that happy life. I don't have any answers and it's tearing my fiance apart. He hurts for me because I have no control. ..Generally I hope y'all's day is infinitely more secure and happy than this wonderful Wednesday I woke up to. But can't stop living for experiences living for joy working to recovery. Getting ahead after all begins with getting started. 
Triumph: Handling emotions rather successfully this week by not deflecting hiding and trying to forget them but rather processing them and moving on...Struggle: A woman showed interest in me this week even after stressing my desire to reconcile with my wife.  Addictive nature led to some real bad muddled thoughts of burying myself in this girl but rational thought and future desires prevailed...General Chat:  My work performance is picking up but it could still be a lot better.
Triumph:  FINALLY got started with a plan to pay off all of my CC debt.  I wrote out in longhand a list of all charges on my credit card from 2012 and it's ridiculous how many of those charges were for alcohol.  SMDH.  Now that I've cut booze out of my life it's so much easier to set goals. I should be out of CC debt by September 2015 (much sooner really now that I've 'given myself a raise' by cutting out alcohol spending and drunken food spending!)..Struggle:  I'm wrestling a bit with the idea that I kicked booze partially in order to help boost my relationship with another person.  While that's still going well there's part of me that worries that I'll backslide if things deteriorate in that departments...General chat:  Spring is coming!
I've been struggling this week. Got some gynecological-health-related news I'm still wrapping my head around (nothing life-threatening or requiring immediate action but definitely fertility-threatening uncomfortable and possibly requiring surgery down the road). I was expecting the news and actually it was a little less bad than I feared it might be but it's still hard. I walked out of the doctor's office on Monday afternoon glanced across the street at a pub and thought about how badly I wanted a whiskey on the rocks. I haven't been struggling too hard with wanting to drink so this was notable. I got ice cream instead but I'm still feeling pretty raw and sad.
I loved your triumph. Congrats! :)..Triumph: 2 Months! Also was told by both my bosses (from separate employers) that I am a gem of an employee and can expect an excellent reference...Struggle: Still working on fixing myself up. This past week involved a lot of crying and difficulty finding motivation. I'm moving forward but faced a lot recently...General Chat: It has been BEAUTIFUL this past week. Loving the sunny weather.
I got given 4 tickets to the Auto Show here in Calgary for the weekend!  Going with 2 great female friends and a fellow recoverer. Pretty interesting random group of friends (the 2 girls have briefly met once) none of the others have...Work is busy.... doing a split today at the restaurant.  Decided to skip a meeting this morning but still am on track for 4 or 5 this week so this is a non-issue...Tomorrow is Pi day kinda nerd-excited planning to stay up til 2am tonight to update my status at 3/14 1:59.26.  Shit like this keeps me amused...The weather here is great! (+13C/55F) Looking forward to a nice walk back to work in about 10 minutes.

Triumph: 3 days into SXSW (a relapse waiting to happen every year) and I have NO desire to drink. I've been going out seeing friends dancing my ass off and I remember all of it. Today I not only went to a daytime show for the band rather than the free booze because I was hungover but I even squoze in a few hours at the office beforehand. Definitely a first for me...Struggle: I'm incredibly sad for reasons I can't really identify. I feel like I'm missing out on the full SXSW experience because my boyfriend is ever the suspicious one and prefers I come home long before the shows are over. Last week it was all about how much I hate my job. There is some larger underlying issue making me break down in tears every day but I don't know what it is...General chat: I was catching up with a few old coworkers in a free beer tent and when I replied "I don't drink" to a proffered cup the response was startlingly positive. Apparently my weight loss inspired a few female friends to change their drinking habits already but then they started gushing over my clearer skin and healthy glow. I didn't think anyone really noticed until someone said "So THAT'S what happened to you!" ..I'm already covered in tattoos that tell my story but I'm seriously considering getting my sobriety date tattooed on me. That's the first tattoo that isn't a song or piece of art that others can appreciate- it's entirely a reminder for and commitment to myself. My tattoos have solidified who I am in so many ways and my next one will be about getting sober no matter what.
