I would never have taken hold of myself like I have if it weren't for you guys. If you're just beginning if you're a dino a serial relapser a wonderer all of your posts and comments have been lighting the way for me giving me perspective revelations and the one thing that brought me to my knees the realization that I'm not alone. I often say that SD was a game changer for me. I learned more in a few months here than during ten years rambling on my own...I know 30 is just a number but hey it's also an occasion to say thank you guys. From the bottom of my heart. I can do it you can do it...Rock on! I will not drink with you today!
