The last 70 days have gone by all at once too fast and too slow...In a lot of ways I feel like a different person- better smarter stronger. ..I sort of forgot why I decided I needed to quit for a while around day 40- day 40 to about day 60 was really super hard for me all over again. It was like being right back at the beginning- intense cravings for alcohol- feeling lost...The last 20 days or so have been really good. Surprisingly the holidays were not much of a struggle for me. I had a brief craving when my brother in law brought a bottle of Crown Royal to my house on Christmas Eve. But it was short lived. ..Observing others alcohol consumption over the holidays was a bit of an eye opener for me. No one got drunk. Last Christmas Eve I was pretty toasted. My sober buddy (who has been sober for over 2 years at this point) pointed out to me how drunk I was last Christmas Eve. We laughed about it a bit he didnt know that I kept drinking after everyone left last year- but I told him I was having more fun this year being sober. ..NYE my wife was out of town so I was home with our 3 kids. We had a movie night and made pizzas. We had a great time and I was present and enjoying hanging out with them. We laughed together and made memories. ..There have still been struggles. Last night I had a really vivid alcohol dream. In my dream I was going camping with my family and my brother. I knew I was going to drink and I knew I was going to get blackout drunk. My brother is a big drinker and a lot of our relationship has been founded upon drinking together. In the dream I started to get a panicky feeling- about giving up my sobriety- about losing control- but it all felt so inevitable- like I had resigned myself to the fact that I was going to drink and I was going to get wasted and there was nothing I could do about it. ..But in my dream I left- I left my brother I left the campsite and I woke up a few minutes later- still sober and thankful.

Congrats!! We will be at 90 in a flash! 
Great job!  Being "present" is something I'm really starting to enjoy.  I miss that about myself.
