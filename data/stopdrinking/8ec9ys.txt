My wife and I have been waking up earlier and earlier than normal (I have insomnia so its a mega struggle) but the feeling of waking up getting ready in a reasonable amount of time getting breakfast and my things together and getting to work before most people and beginning to work on things that I am proficient at makes me feel hecka good.  It feeds my competitive spirit and I can see myself doing it more and more something that definitely would have never happened had I continued drinking to this day and kept waking up later or even skipping work entirely.  ..I suggest it for everyone here if you don't already do it!

Yes indeed. On weekdays I need to be up by 6 am.. But since I stopped drinking. It is more like 5 or 5:30 am. No alarm clock needed!..IWNDWYT ! .
I'm doing it!  I wake up at 4 am.  I think I'd prefer 5 but it fits my work schedule.  Early mornings are great for my frame of mind .IWNDWYT 
It's a hell of a lot better to wake up to grey light in your window and the birds chirping than to see and hear that and realize you're still awake! Enjoying early morning is low-key one of the coolest benefits of being sober for me
