It's hard right now to find the motivation. Last night I caved again and it concerns me that I caved so casually like it was no big deal to pick up yet another six pack I couldn't afford. That's every night lately and recently a few mornings too. I guess this is the first full relapse i've had since quitting earlier this year.  I want to stop but I have yet to muster enough motivation to get serious about it. It's getting my attention at least so I guess that's a good sign. Posting on here is one step. Thanks for any encouragement or input you can offer.

Good constant sleep. Body not feeling like shit. Depression and anxiety are basically non existent. While in relapse or when I drank I always cracked a beer at 5pm it's great not feeling like I'm in that prison anymore. Not gaining weight. No heart palpitations. No worry about withdrawal. I'm sure I can come up with more but I gotta get in to work. Be good to yourself and get back on that wagon. It's worth It! I will not drink with you today. 
I'm in a similar boat.  I had 6 months sober from April through October and then relapsed.  I went right back at it like nothing had happened.  Then it escalated - missed a day of work anxiety increasing missed a night with my kids because I had to sleep of day drinking.  In the past 1 1/2 months I've quit and relapsed 3 times.  I don't have some huge desire or motivation but I know I don't want to feel like shit and going on benders!  I'm taking it one hour at a time if I have to.  The good news is this isn't my first rodeo so I know exactly what to expect.  Keep up the good work and keep resetting that badge til it sticks!  I won't drink with you today..
