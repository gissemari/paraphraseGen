I relapsed last night. Honestly I did Thursday night too but I thought it was a one time thing. I feel like my entire month's worth of internal work was completely ripped to shreds.

Just focus on the future. You can't change the past! It's so cliche and simple but it's true!
In my humble opinion I don't think you would be here if it were ripped to shreds. This shit is straight up hard. Not like oh kinda difficult. Genuinely one of the harder things you can encounter in life...When you look at your badge you probably see "0". If you drank on Thursday your badge would've been at 36 and then 37 Friday morning...I see 36/37. I see a 97.297% success rate with what you were trying to achieve. Keep your chin up my friend that's a freaking incredible rate of success. What's more important? 36 days of learning and growth or 1 bad day?..I pick 36  . Today's a great day to start a new streak.
