Seriously guise (I know that's not how you spell it but I like it) I feel *sooooo good*. Of course it's still a struggle every day not to drink to not give into the temptation...Yesterday was actually a hard day for me the cravings were really strong. But instead of going to buy some alcohol I got out of the house. I went to Trader Joes Target got some gas got dinner (pumpkin cookie dough yum). By the time I got home I didn't even *think* about alcohol. I cozied up to some Netflix and went to bed...Now here I am this morning with a clear mind and feeling pretty proud of myself. Which is the *exact* opposite of where I was just a week ago. I absolutely **hated** myself and was truly disgusted with the person I was becoming and how I was living my life...Today I'm going into the battlefield that is the Mall (and the freeway and parking) to see Santa! I'm gonna stick around for this big fancy parade-ish kinda thing that the city puts on in the evening. I'm excited!..I hope you all have a great Saturday!!!

There are a thousand benefits to getting sober even for just a day but my absolute favorite is not being hungover. Good job switching up your routine so you could avoid the liquor store...And good job braving the mall...you're a tougher person than I am.
Even when I don't sleep well at night (and it's been a struggle the last couple weeks) waking up without a hangover is always a blessing!
Hello!  It sounds like we had the same struggle yesterday.  My struggle was intense because my husband had bought alcohol therefore it was in the house.  I survived though I didn't have a drop. This morning I woke up bright and early!  I exercised and got Christmas shopping out of the way this morning.  Enjoy your Saturday!
well done.
