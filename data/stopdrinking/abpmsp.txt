Last night was the first new year in a long time without booze and you know what it was great! ..I spent some quality time with my family played a shit ton of our new family addiction this card game called  Dominion  &lt;  shameless plug you should all check it out. And my wife and stayed up watching some Netflix until the ball dropped. Once it did we kissed each other like we did back in the day and went to bed truly happy. ..Today I mapped out my goal list for 2019 with not drinking for the entire year right on top. ..Wishing you all a safe and happy 2019. For those of you struggling out there take it one day at a time. Before you know it you'll have almost 2 months in and be on your way to feeling better!
