I made it 7 days then slipped up. I still have not made it to 10 days yet...but that is my goal. I've made it to 5 days many times and recently made it to 7 days then slipped up...&amp;#x200B;..During those 7 days I felt great! I do not know why I stopped and got beers...I have some theories though...&amp;#x200B;..Each time is a learning experience so Im trying not to beat myself up about it.I did make an ass of myself to my girlfriend but she understands my struggle so its not irreparable damage to our relationship.....&amp;#x200B;..I think I will try and participate in this sub when I really feel tempted...maybe that will help?..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks everyone. I appreciate reading your stories and hearing your advice.

I made a vow that I would post here before I drink again. That's saved me a few times.  ..It took me building up short periods of sobriety to make progress.  You're doing great...I would just keep going keep trying.  You can do this! IWNDWYT
