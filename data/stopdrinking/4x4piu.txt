Hi guys ..Been lurking for a while and haven't been brave enough to post yet. I got sober last August after a wicked bout of pancreatitis at 27. I've so far been able to keep it up for up to 90 days at a stretch and have had some tiny success with "normal" drinking almost always followed by a relapse for one reason or another that usually lasts about a week. I am SO MUCH better and happier when I'm sober I'm really committed to working on this. ..My question is this relapse didn't last very long (a week) but the brain fog and dizziness was fucking insane. I couldn't keep my eyes open. It felt like my body was shutting down. I cut way back Saturday detoxed all of Sunday and Monday and I'm still dizzy on Wednesday. I know the most reasonable thing to do would be to see a doctor but that's not in the cards right now so I'm just wondering if this is something anyone else has experienced? Part of my trigger for drinking is anxiety over my health (and I'm well aware that dizziness is an anxiety symptom - just never had it this bad before) so the fear that something is very wrong is making me want to drink. I know no one here can diagnose and don't expect you to - it would just calm me down a lot to read stories about how crappy others have felt while detoxing. ..I love this sub and will continue to read. Hope to contribute more positively in future.

Each detox is usually worse than the last. Your body is also compromised since there's a history of pancreatitis. I didn't drink no matter what. I wish that for you too. 
Read about kindling (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative-hypnotic_withdrawal).  It's what made me decide to never go through withdrawal/detox again.
Sounds normal for what you've put yourself through. I had similar issues.
