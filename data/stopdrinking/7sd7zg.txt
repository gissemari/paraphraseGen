Not sure how to reset my badge but feeling encouraged that I want to. It's so easy to lie to myself and others and say it isn't a problem but those closest to me my family will always know. I made an ass of myself off some Southern Comfort (100 proof naturally) and am not only awake at 3 AM with a pounding headache but my girlfriend is asleep in the other bedroom with our son and the door closed. I woke up hungover and alone in the middle of the night - you don't have to. I will not drink with you today.

Your honesty is very admirable! I'm sorry you relapsed but with 139 sober days I know you have the tools to start over again today. ..Keep your son and girlfriend front of mind for motivation. I will not drink with you today. 
The failure is not in falling but in not getting up again. Happy to see you rebound so fast! IWNDWYT
When you slip you can learn something from it.  I learned from mine that I simply cannot moderate at all.  Try to identify what caused your slip and be completely honest with yourself about it.  ..You are still in recovery so long as you stay committed to sobriety!   You are not starting over.
