Good Hump Day Folks! My name is /u/dancing-lobsters and I am here with Gizmo (who is currently having a Doggie dream). Share your triumphs struggles and general nonsense - I love reading them! ..---..**Triumph:** Had a two month review with my supervisor and it went really good. Gizmo is definitely mending me closer to my housemates and teaching me a thing or two. She's also really good at becoming a stone when I want her to step out of my way. ..**Struggle:** Cleaned my area at work today and I sneezed a gazillion times. Worried about my current spending habits with my tax refund but I haven't treated myself since last year...**General Nonsense:** This weather eh. American Baseball started up again - European Football is slowing down (kinda sorta) - any interesting match ups you have seen recently or are waiting to see? 
----------immediate responses--------

Triumphs: Saw my boy for the first time in 3 months and watched his college baseball team play four games (and win three).  First road trip without alcohol in.....I can't even say. Telling the truth about my experience to people from whom I've hid it in order to protect my SO's reputation and cover my own shame. Started seeing a therapist and I'm actually excited to work with her...Struggle: Big relational stuff up which is amplified for me by not drinking (not pushing it away as much).  What *are* the reasons to stay or quit an almost-30 year relationship when we don't fight or fuss much (or talk or fuck or much of anything else...)?..General Nonsense: MLB is off and running -- Go Cubs! I saw my first lilacs today and the pink dogwood off my deck is just starting to blossom.  Yes spring is definitely here.
**Triumph:** It's been a good week with lots of connections and hanging out with sober friends. Lots of other high points too...**Struggle:** Had my first real cravings in a long time. No danger just an opportunity to think through the whys. And a good reason to come hang out on SD for a bit...**Chat:** I'm not much for sports. I am loving the spring weather and the opportunities for different kinds of play.
**Triumph:** finally bought an aux cable to plug phone into car radio. Bye bye 15 track cd hellooOOoo 300 (and climbing) track playlist. Gotta sync more folders!           ..**Struggle:** .....honestly none at moment. Work has been hectic but Ive knocked a 20 item IMMEDIATE COMPLETE todo list down to like 2 outstanding items so that's nice. I mean I'm farting rainbows over here.             ..**General Nonsense:** in first month sober our oldest cat died. Buried her under ground cover out back and planted a knock out rose over her. Happy to see two roses have bloomed this weekend! Nice memorial. In so many ways. 
**Triumphs:** Still feeling relief from the burden of drinking and enjoying a certain sobriety of mind. I feel much more present. Just a few more days until I've been dry for a month...**Struggle:**  The mother of my children continues to spew anger at me and blame me for everything that is wrong in her life. When I picked my kids up from her house today she yelled at me in front of them and repeatedly called me a pathological liar. I felt indignant and was upset that she chose to do this in front of our children. My only intention has ever been to help her and my children but my efforts to do that have often been thwarted by my alcoholism. I was able to realize that I have indeed contributed to her current state and that anger and resentment would destroy any chance of being truly helpful to my family. This struggle between exists and will continue to exist for many more years to come. But it is much less of a struggle as long as I remain sober.  ..**General Nonsense:** I took my little kids to the park on a sunny and windy day. We remembered that we had brand-new kites in the back of my car. We had so much fun! It was such a simple joy but it's the kind of moment that makes life worth living. ***^^KITES ^^^ARE ^^^^AWESOME!***^^^^^^.

Triumph: I am feeling really organised and motivated in my job at the moment and have got a lot done this week..Struggle: I had a massive craving last night triggered by family telling me they had no intention of coming to my sons 4th birthday party because they didnt want to. I was angry and upset which was always the perfect reason to drink 2 bottles of wine I didnt and have woken up not hungover or feeling as resentful!.General Nonsense: I am spending the day not hungover and totally present with my 3 beautiful sons doing spring crafts and playing!.
T: drinking not a option today. S: out of sorts. GN: my perspective.
**Triump:** My new fountain pen and ink have arrived going to pick them up at the post office later :)..**Struggle:** This day. I need to write 2000 words within the next couple of hours or I'll fail my class. Been procrastinating way too long feels like I've had chronic writer's block for two years. Constantly obsessing about getting drunk just to get a break doesn't help...**General Nonsense:** I don't follow sports. The snow has melted and the weather is ... average?
Triumph: made it through 4 days today is 5 and I woke up super early with no hangover!..Struggle: I do have to teach today...that usually isn't easy but I am sure I can get through. That and money is tight right now after losing one of my jobs...General nonsense: I get to go to a free concert on Friday! Sober woot!
Triumph: Just received my 5 month coin this week at AA...Struggle: Sugar cravings through the roof I've been alright with giving into them while I stopped drinking at first but it's been 5 months so I need to start paying attention. ..General nonsense: Frost in southeast USA this morning not used to having winter in spring.
**T**: Under contract for a house!..**S**: Trying to pull a million things together and the stress is making me sick..**GN**: I'm in desperate need of planting seeds and too busy to do it! I'm a community garden leader - gotta lead by example.
Triumph: Didn't snap at my coworkers or my family yesterday had a great dinner (chicken stir fry!) and an amazing sleep...Struggle: Wanted to pick up some soda water took the turn I usually take to stop at the liquor store before the grocery store. Realized what I was doing and drove right past it...General nonsense: I'm getting caught up in the No Man's Sky hype train.
Triumph: I woke up this morning and actually felt happy with my decision and with myself. I haven't felt that way with previous attempts. I bought some new clothes and makeup over the weekend and pulling on my new (very) skinny jeans and putting a little makeup on really boosted my mood. Typically I would roll out of bed at the last possible minute throwing on yesterday's leggings and a shitty t-shirt. I lost 50 lbs in the last year and I'm actually starting to feel sexy. Waking up knowing I didn't make a fool of myself the night before has really boosted my confidence...Struggle: Boredom! Sitting at home in the evenings watching TV with my partner is basically our routine. We would usually share a few shots if whiskey and talk throughout whatever show we were watching. I'm a *lot* less talkative while sober and I feel a little irritable toward him when he gets that buzzed chatiness that we usually share. Overcoming this is going to be a big key to my success.
Triumph : I'm more than 2 months sober. I didn't struggle as much as I would have thought at first. It's still not over yet I'm still really cautious...Struggle : I'm at my worst business moment in the last 2 years. I lost 75% of it unrelated to alcohol. I didn't plan well enough and this is because of alcohol. Now is time to rebuild it at the same time that I build sobriety...General : I'm looking forward my summer season. I don't really watch any sport on TV but if I had cable I would watch the NBA finals.

triumph: 6 sober days eating well when I wanted to eat garbage knocking out some tasks my boss assigned me and going above and beyond on each one hydrating properly being mindful of my negative thoughts and turning them into positive ones...struggle: financially stressed a bit and this is when I start berating myself for spending a shit ton of money on booze during my 11 month relapse. but then I remember it was a learning experience there's more money to be made and I'll be just fine. also this headache thing happening behind my left eye since late last night. wtf is it!..general nonsense: I feel like big things are happening in my soul. it feels good. I'm really excited to clock out and watch xfiles reruns in bed with my dude and our pups.
Triumph; I cooked a decent meal although i was really tired from work...Struggle; feeling very tired but I have lots of serious stuff to be done...General nonsense; I had to take a test with a patient. She smelled so heavily of peppermint that I looked up in her eyes. In only half a second I realized;....." It takes one to know one." So sad.
Triumph:  Met a girl and have been talking.  She's cute!  But she overstated he age by 10 years.  .Struggle:  I tried to eat soup at lunch and had the shakes so bad I couldn't hold the spoon without sloshing the liquid out. I had to pick up the bowl. .nonsense:  I am Mensa eligible but am too lazy to fill out the form. 
**Triumph:** 100 days without drinking. This shit has gotten SO MUCH EASIER. Did my taxes on time getting a big refund because my drunk/depressed/avoidant ass never got around to applying for an Obamacare subsidy and I was paying for health insurance out of pocket all last year even though I could barely afford it. But it turns out you can get that subsidy retroactively as a tax credit. Also getting back into running with a Couch to 10K app. Also-also starting a new full-time job with benefits next week. ..**Struggle:** Nervous about my new job. Nervous about being late possibly not getting along with my supervisor and self-sabotaging in other ways. Nervous about the constant people-contact making me want to drink. It's been a long time since I had a normal 8-to-5 job and I have NEVER had a job that required me to be "on" for 100% of my workday. This will be a first. ..**General nonsense:** I dunno really. Just grateful to be here. Grateful that it was on the 70s and sunny a few days ago even if it's back down to the 40s right now. Grateful to wake up each morning without hating myself. ..
TRIUMPH:  Washed 24 panes of venetian-blinds-esque glass windows without breaking a single one...STRUGGLE:  Still working on letting go of a failed relationship that meant a lot to me...GENERAL NONSENSE:  If a tree falls in the forest and there's nobody around to hear it and it falls on a mime does anybody care?..P.S.  Thank you for starting this--  I love these kinds of threads too!
I tried to find a meeting today and the place I headed to was at a retirement home so I couldn't go. ..I'm trying to just chill my mind alone here instead..Listening to a speaker meeting on YouTube.
Triumph: productive working day 23 days sober in the mountains found some online/telephone AA meetings which helps daily with my sobriety.Struggle: hearing my mom ask her husband if he wants a beer.General nonsense: not looking forward to the nicotine withdrawals tomorrow since I am 15 miles to the closest convince store and refusing to drive there when they overcharge for smokes
