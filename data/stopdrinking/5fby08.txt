Tekboy you're doing all the right things to get through this. There's nothing we can do about the past only the present and work toward a better future..There's nothing wrong with you there's nothing wrong with any of us. We're all human and have our monsters..Keep growing keep learning and I promise you I will not drink with you today.
You are worth it.  Sooner or later I believe that sobriety will lead us to fulfillment.  Stay with us.  I will not drink with you today.
