Close friend of mine (out of state) called the police to my house because I was drinking heavily and having bad thoughts. Spent 8.5 hours detoxing in the ER they paid for a lyft to take me home. It's kind of a miracle I am alive after a .5 alcohol level (had to ask the doc several times if that was true)...I think this is the kick in the ass I needed. Went to my regular doc yesterday morning to get paperwork for rehab which I apparently left at the hospital so will have to try to track that down and hopefully get into a place next week to help me more. ..Resetting my badge after this post and IWNDWYT (or the rest of my days). ..For anyone out there struggling please reach out for help - sure as shit saved my life and it will yours too.

I'm so glad you're on the road to recovery friend. Yeah I've been to the hospital and detox and rehab over this shit as well. I hope you find the joy in life that you deserve and I hope you hear something here that makes you want to keep not drinking. It sounds like you're already there and you're utilizing the help that's available to you. Way to go!
Wow.  I didn't think it was possible to live at .5.  Blessings on your friend for calling the cops.  So glad you are with us.  You can do this.  IwNDWYT
