Where do I start childhood trauma  bipolar 2 with borderline personality traits and of course my alcohol abuse problem . .38 years old  3 beautiful children whom I know I am a great mother too . My partner of 17 years no that's not going well at all .  2 months sober and now a relapse .  A good career  so much to be grateful for  but suffocating from this illness maybe  or more so my lack of acceptance from my battle with alcohol and of course my demons from my past  that haunt me today .  Stop drinking but then comes the inevitable barrage of feelings and real life problems I drank away .  Tomorrow's another day  chin up and start afresh .

Don't beat yourself up too much about the relapse.  You're fighting a tough battle; your past raising kids life and that monkey on your back and that's all hard.  You found a reason for sobriety and waged war!  This one defeat could make your resolve stronger!!  I congratulate you on your effort and wish you strength and hope in not drinking today!! /hugs IWNDWYT 
HOLY COW I thought I was re-reading an old post when I saw that first sentence.  I'm all of that but male 42 married no kids.  I'm reading a book called "Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life".  I'm working through it with a counselor.  Very good stuff.  You don't suffer alone you have a bro over here.  Day 1 for me.  Take care and IWNDWYT.
