As you can see from my badge I was close to  a year of sobriety.  I went through an extensive (i.e. six months in a hospital) rehab program and threw myself into AA.  But I hit a few bumps with some people then a few more.  It seems like I hit some bumps with almost everybody I knew (including my sponsor).  Obviously the common factor is me.  But I still have a bunch of bad feelings towards basically everybody I know.  I don't know what to do...I relapsed and need a badge reset if that wasn't clear.

I don't think your alone on this....not quite sure what it is. Maybe a resentment of authority or people maybe who presume to be.. or maybe it's just plain arrogance on my part for my feelings about it all. 
Welcome back!  Did your community begin to not meet your expectations? Was there a suggestion that you resisted?
