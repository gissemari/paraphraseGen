Please disregard the number in my little star - it's from when I tried to stop drinking at New Years. I haven't had any luck resetting my badge - I didn't last three days then but I have now!!! ..Day three! I did not drink today!!..As the sun sets on my third day it's worth noting that I have just added to my sober days for 2016 by 50% my previous days were never in succession. I hope that you don't mind that I write to stay accountable and share what is happening to me. ..How does it feel? In a word: Strange. ..Today was definitely the worst so far when it came to anxiety and panic symptoms. This is an issue that I have had for a long time prior to developing a reliance on alcohol and probably one of the reasons that I developed an addiction in the first place. I used to treat panic attacks with a Valium and a beer to speed up the process - it worked every time. Today it was a Valium and a cup of tea - it still worked. ..I should not have to rely too heavily on Valium as I have returned to a medication that I know diminishes my anxiety symptoms almost completely. As some of you may recall I have very long term issues with eating disorders and major depression and this IS something that runs through my family history. It is most likely that I will be on medication for the rest of my life to make sure that my brain fires correctly - and I'm kind of ok with that. I can only imagine how well the Prozac will do its job without swimming in a sea of booze! I am also wary of developing a reliance on benzodiazepines - I have in the past (when I was still maintenance drinking 2 beers a day on my then tiny frame) but I have resorted to using them for emergencies only and today really constituted one. ..The anxiety was the same as I always experience; dissociation heightened senses a rapid heart rate and trouble breathing. I took the Valium before it escalated to a full blown panic attack - I guess that's one of the benefits of dealing with this for a long time - I know that it's not the end of the world. I know a panic attack won't kill me but I was scared that I wouldn't be able to talk myself down from one. ..Today is also the most disoriented and peculiar I have felt. I felt quite shaky walking around the house although I haven't developed the DTs or any kind of sweats. I woke this morning again feeling nauseated and headache-y but that passed after breakfast and a cup of coffee. I am also ensuring that I drink a glass of water every time I go into my kitchen. I did manage to have a nice shower today and do my nails - an accomplishment for me. ..Additionally today presented a challenge as it was the birthday of a dear friend who passed away at the age of 29. He had a heart attack and died suddenly and he was one of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever known. He also had the best smelling hair. His death was not only a huge loss it was a turning point in my former LTR. I started daily drinking about a year after his death and I am pretty sure that this is when my ex turned his recreational crystal use into a more sustained addiction/habit. We were a heavy drinking/partying social group - that comes with the territory of a band I guess and I have always celebrated the birthday and death anniversary of this friend with a shot of Jacks - which I hate. Today I just lit some candles. ..I am still eating minimally and mainly comfort foods but I am being hyper vigilant about not falling into a pattern of restriction or sugar consumption. With my history I can't afford to switch between alcohol and a relapse with my Eating Disorder/s. I'll start monitoring my calories with MFP tomorrow to make sure that I'm getting enough food in. Right now I'm sticking to porridge soup toast and more soup. Lots of sweetened tea water and some coffee. ..Tomorrow presents my first opportunity to say no to a drink. It's family dinner night with my parents and sister. I'll explain more about my family history with alcohol later but when I told my parents about my drinking and the relapse of my eating disorder last year the drinking problem was not considered a problem. I have planned that I am not going to draw too much attention to it. Just politely ask for Coke instead of my usual beer. I'm incredibly nervous. Super nervous. My anxiety is at work already niggling me with the 'what ifs'. But that is tomorrow and I will deal with it tomorrow...Today I did not drink.
