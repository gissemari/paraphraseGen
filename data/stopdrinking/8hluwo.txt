I drank 2 days ago. I feel so low shit and scared. Any messages or comments of support would be VERY much appreciated.

Day two is further along than you were two days ago.  You. Have. Got. This.  Stick with the people here read their stories get inspired do some things to comfort yourself and keep those days counting.  You are NOT alone!  I will not drink with you today!
You're back mate. Let's start again by not drinking today. X
I'm Dublin too!
I won't drink with you today and I hope you won't either.
