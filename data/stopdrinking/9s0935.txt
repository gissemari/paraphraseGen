I had a drinking dream last night where I drank!  Then my dream took a turn where I was sober at home and waiting on my wife to come home from going out.  It was getting late and I was really starting to worry/anxiety attack.   Then I see her coming home with two of my friends and they are basically holding her up while she is walking. I come out of the house they are gone and she is passed out on the floor of the entry way and I couldn't wake her.    My brain must have been playing some crazy guilt trip as when I was drinking this was the scenarios she would find me in a few times a year. I also was very bad at communication and my phone would die.  I remember one night loosing my keys and being locked out of out apartment building so I just sleep on the stoop in deathly temperatures.  Lucky she came looking for me and dragged me three flights up to our apartment where I puked.  I still can't believe she didn't leave me.   ..I'm ashamed of how I acted  and I have never been clearer in my mind that I will never put her through that again. The sad part is I didn't think I had an issue and that my drinking wasn't affecting her.   Looking back I know it did... Thanks for reading and I hope my story helps someone who is struggling with the urge to drink not too.  Tonight!  I will not drink with you!

Good on you for recognizing things from her perspective. Crazy how your mind can cause an epiphany through a dream.
