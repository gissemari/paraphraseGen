Hi everyone I haven't checked in over several weeks but I'm staying strong. When I last checked in I was having some relationship problems. Those are on the mend now. We still occasionally argue but none of it is drinking related and we are getting better at talking things through for the most part. Next week we are going to San Diego for a few days to get some time to ourselves. I have no complaints and haven't had any urges I couldn't rationalize away. That is the opposite from how I was. I've always rationalized to create reasons to drink. Now I rationalize to create reasons not to. The big difference now is that there are no consequences. I'm on 46 days sober and beginning to realize some other major parts of my life that could use some improvement. I'm still a hopeless procrastinator. I still struggle with self confidence (main reason for drinking problem). Im still only as mature as I was when I started drinking. Essentially I'm a 19 year old in the body of a 37 year old. I guess I'll start working on all that stuff sometime soon but I'm content to be sober for today.
