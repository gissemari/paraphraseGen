Thanks SD. Read the posts of struggles and triumphs today and it all kept me focused. You're all amazing and hope everyone is having a great night.

Well done!!
I am struggling tonight and needed a similiar pick me up hope you have a great night as well and thanks for the boost.
Feels good doesn't it! Way to go. Onward to Sunday!
Congrats :-)
Well done! Last night was my first sober night in 15 years. First time trying to quit cold turkey. I survived and I hope to survive many more nights. Keep it up! Waking up clear headed on a Sunday is weird eh?!
