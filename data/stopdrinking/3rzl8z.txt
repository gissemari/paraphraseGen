The gym in my little village (pop. 700 odd) is accessible via the bar in the harbour social club. I was in the gym until pretty late last night and I just thought how remarkable it is that something which I would quite literally run down the hill to get to now seems so unattractive to me. The bad music the puffy faces at the bar the expensive drinks the deranged behaviour. I was running down the hill to get my fix because I am an alcohol addict not because I wanted so badly to socialise with all my mates in there which is what I was convinced of at the time of course. This isn't some sneering "look at the foolish drunks now I'm not a drunk" post. They looked like they were having fun. I had good times in there too and they are mostly all good lads. It's just amazing how my perception has shifted after a couple of months off the sauce. A total turnaround in what I consider to be a good Saturday night. It's actually quite frightening to think that if I relapse that's where I'll be back in there. Spending all my wages and making myself sick surrounded by people I don't really share anything with besides a mutual addiction to ethanol. Since I ceased drinking I haven't seen or heard from a single one of my former "mates" in the bar. Not a one. Funny that.

Same - my drinking mates have disappeared too. I'm relieved in a way as it helps in my decision to stick with sober people/sober places. A gym accessible through a bar - talk about choosing heaven or hell!  
When I was an alcohol addict I drank to feel "normal."  Weird in hindsight how objectively weird "normal" was.
awesome post...thanks.
