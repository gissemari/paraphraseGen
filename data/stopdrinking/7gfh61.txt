So this morning I dropped my wife at the train station and was heading to work. I was at a light when I was staring at a deli where I used to buy beer. Since my relapse I haven't had the urge to drink but for a few seconds I thought it would be nice to blow off work and the day and just go buy some booze and start drinking...The light turned green I snapped out of it didn't stop and kept driving. I know if I had drank I wouldn't just be blowing off the day but would be blowing off the rest of my life. After the last run I had I can't go back and that thought popping up in my head reminded me how much I need to stay on top of myself and make sure I'm taking care of myself...54 days staying strong and I will not drink today..
