 A little over 3 weeks sober (2nd time trying). Its been a long week and a longer weekend. I've been fighting off urges left and right and really been struggling. Whenever I feel down or stressed alcohol seems like  the perfect way to feel better and get my mind off things. ..I just went in the fridge and pulled out the bottle of wine. Unscrewed the cap and stared at the bottle for a full minute trying to convince myself to take the first sip. I knew in the moment that it wasn't worth it. Not worth the pain of drinking or of getting sober again...IWNDWYT

kudos.. it's fckin tough it doesn't get any easier in early days but stay with the voice of dissent the good voice...get that super man feeling in the mornings.. keep going..
Just remember...what ever you're down and stressed about alcohol does not heal it only temporarily paralyzes those feelings. Those stresses will still be there tomorrow. Try to think about what you need to do to eliminate those triggers. It's so hard but the cravings won't last forever. Watch some YouTube videos of This Naked Mind...it always helps me!
So proud of you! I will not drink with you today or tomorrow!   
You are doing great with that 3 week run hang in there 
Good job!! I will not drink with you tonight  
It *does* work for me...for a little while then the payback is with interest. I keep reminding myself of this usury and it helps me see through my convoluted thinking.
