(Trigger warning for discussions of self harm)..I know how badly it would end. I get even more depressed and uninhibited when I drink. ..I had to go to the ER for stiches twice in the last two months and got involuntarily committed once both times because of cutting while drunk. It wasn't minor either 70-some stitches the first time and like 50 the second. That was when I decided I really needed to quit drinking. ..Things are bad in my life right now and I know that drinking makes me feel even worse but right now I can only think about how sometimes it makes me feel better and I want the escape. I found some alcohol I'd forgotten about and haven't gotten the courage to throw it out just yet and right now it's all I can think about. ..I've been going to SMART meetings and they help; I wouldn't have made it this far without them. But right now I just really want to drink :/ I'm just trying to remind myself how upset I'll be at myself in the morning if I drink tonight. ..Sorry I just needed to vent a bit. Thanks for listening.

I'm with you. I've been told I'm a complete asshole when drinking but I don't remember it. We all go a little crazy in our own ways when we have some from the bottle. 17 days is longer than I've done lately. Rooting for you (and for me to make it that far).
Hey I used to cut when drinking too. My sponsor also cut and he said something I'll never forget. "We drink to not feel anything and then we cut because we need to feel something". I know that doesn't apply to everyone but it did to me and it got me sober for 100 days. I relapsed sadly but I'm still hopeful.  I hope things will look up for you. I will not drink with you today.
