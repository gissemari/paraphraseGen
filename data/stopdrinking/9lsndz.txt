I feel like I'm far enough along that I shouldn't have such crazy emotions. No reason to cry but here I am crying. How long does it take for emotions to not take such huge dips and dives?

Don't worry this is my second time getting sober...at 20 months and they can still knock me on my ass.  Last time it was somewhere between 3-5 years that they really calmed but they did get progressively better from day 1 both times.
Booze gets its hook in me by convincing me that any pain or anguish in life is too much to handle and that I can't make it through on my own. The reality is that life is fucking hard sometimes and we are all human. Vulnerability is human. Booze isn't the answer. It's okay to struggle. Hang in there.
I believe our physical bodies can store emotional pain for years. Sometimes I get the wave of emotions and imagine it's an old hard layer thats finally falling away. .Good luck to you. IWNDWYT.  
Me too. It's 2pm Sat afternoon and I'm crying in bed  
I found it's a benefit to have the emotions I routinely suppressed and numbed. The tears can clear my eyes to see the love around me!
