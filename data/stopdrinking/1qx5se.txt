So I became serious about quitting a few months ago but I seemed to be teflon when it came to sobriety. I had 11 days before this and slipped up for only a night so it's been about 23 days with only one of drinking. Today marks the longest I have gone consecutively. I've just recently started sleeping normally again and I feel really good already. I heard a lot of people in meetings say it took them well over a month so I guess I'm lucky. I've been waking up early feeling amazing! I just moved into a new big apartment on Saturday and I'm so excited to create new memories and good habits in a place where I have no memories that involve drinking. I can't thank you all enough for your kind words and support. I'm finally starting to feel happy and alive again! I hope everyone is has a struggle free day.
