Well I made it 5 days without drinking (4.7 days maybe?). Last night I went out with some friends and started with a coffee seemed great. Eventually we made it to a bar/cafe and I thought "fuck it it's Friday night". I had two beers and went home wondering what this all meant. ..For me the fact that I was able to go sober for 4+ days was a really big accomplishment. In fact I don't think I've been sober for that long in years. It's literally been a daily habit for me and I now see the benefits of sobriety in my daily life. My head is more clear I can reflect on my past much easier and the money I saved was amazing XD ..This community has also been a huge help. Seeing that little red notification after posting a daily accountability post made each day a little easier. I don't know how I'm moving forward whether I'm going for full sobriety or cutting back in the way I have this week. Either way I'll continue to be a regular here so thank you all for your advice and just being wonderful people.

Nice work!
congrats on 5. i didn't do 5 in a row until the day i finally quit. i used a whiteboard to hold myself accountable - forced me to be honest - was so easy for me to just kind of forget than i was drinking more often than not.
I remember I had quit for roughly two weeks and then convinced myself that I would become a normal drinker. I went to a restaurant drank only 2 beers and went home. That night before I went to bed I was congratulating myself for being successful at not drinking more than two. A day or two after that I realized that most normal drinkers probably don't congratulate themselves for drinking normally ha. For me it was quite an eye opener. Forgive the rant/story. Your post just totally reminded me of that insight I experienced.
