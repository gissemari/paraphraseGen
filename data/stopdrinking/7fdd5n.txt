It's a long story. I don't have the energy to type it all suffice to say I went out with my girlfriend to meet some of her family at the bar for the first time. They were nice I was enjoying myself mostly but I was anxious...Then the jealousy kicked in. When the whiskey came out I had to leave. I thought I could handle being around it by now. I was wrong. I'm left feeling as raw as week 1 tonight...I would have spent too much money..I would have drank more than anyone else..I would have gotten trashed..I would have needed a ride home..I would have needed a ride to my car in the morning..I would have ended up feeling horrible tomorrow...I would have had fun....I would have not missed out on getting to know some good people..I would have told stories sang songs stayed out late...I wouldn't be where I am now in my life..I wouldn't have the career success I currently do now..I wouldn't be with this amazing girl..I wouldn't be taking care of my debt..I wouldn't be any better off by having a drink tonight in the scheme of my life...So why do I fucking care. Why is it so hard. Why does seeing someone I love just having 1 whiskey sour set me off make me jealous make me bitter make me sad make me hurt make me feel so weak...I'm sorry for the long rant. Tonight I struggle and I know not why. I know why I don't drink I know that my life would not be improved by it in any way. And I know that I want nothing more in this moment than to be out with friends etc with a glass of whiskey in my hand...I won't drink with all of you today. .

Sounds like a tough situation. I applaud you for getting out of it with your sobriety intact. 
Thank you for sharing this. I also had an opportunity to hang with some good people and my boyfriend tonight. Something in my gut just decided not to go. I am glad I didn't. My story ends a little different they are all still over there and I asked my bf to stay and not drive home because they were drinking quite heavily..I don't know exactly why sometimes it's easier and sometimes it's harder. Part of being human I guess. .I was happy to read all the things you are accomplishing in sobriety.  The reasons why you don't have that drink. i revisit mine on days like this as well. .Nicely done. I will not drink with you today! Keep it up eh?
Feel for ya brother. Maybe one day it will be easier to be in a situation like that. 
&gt; all the great things that have happened because of my sobriety..A great thought to stay sober with. There's the flip side too which I also got value from and that's remembering some of the most awful things that happened when I drank...Thank you for your post!
