> How do it feel to be high without drugs?.>.> Some say it's the feelin' of love for yourself..- dead prez..Hi everyone..I've been listening to dead prez non-stop for months now devouring their lyrics trying to reconcile and challenge my own beliefs and behaviours about life as a white male.  I've come across a number of their songs which speak to alcoholism and living a clean sober life and I was thinking that maybe some others would derive some inspiration from their words...The following is an excerpt from stic.man's song [Sober Soldier](https://youtu.be/cScbD1jI10A).  (I hope this is an acceptable post--I had a look through the guidelines and thought that it would be OK but my apologies in advance if not.)..> This is an inner war for health a life long mission.>.> I see the victory discipline will conquer addiction.>.> ....>.> I ain't killin' myself I love the man in the mirror.>.> ....>.> Daily it's an uphill battle it's not an easy trip.>.> Learnin' from mistakes in the past so not to be at risk.>.> Already high off life I don't need a lift.>.> Still I know the haters is watchin' wantin' me to slip.>.> When you make a positive change people will judge you.>.> Some will take it personal but don't let it budge you.>.> ....>.> Through every struggle I come out a better man.>.> I've slipped before but I vow never again.>.> ....>.> I gotta be all I can be temptation gonna come but I'm strong not weak.> .> No I won't be a victim I'm gonna stand on my feet.>.> No retreat no surrender I accept no defeat!.>.> I'm a soldier..Peace :)
