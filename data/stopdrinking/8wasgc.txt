I made this account to start engaging on SD after lurking for many many months. I knew I needed to engage to start posting to start holding myself a little bit accountable. It was too easy to lurk and NOT engage...I wanted to commit a little deeper...I made this account two years ago today. My flair only shows 505 days (only! as if that's a small achievement). That's because I joined before I could actually get 24 hours of sobriety under my belt. Then I had several failed sobrieties usually lasting a couple weeks up to a couple months at a time until one finally stuck...To all you newbies out there we ALL struggled with those early days. We ALL made promises to ourselves to cut back to moderate to follow ever more complex sets of rules. We ALL have broken promises to ourselves and others. And that's okay. We can't undo the past. All we have is the here and now all we can change is the future. We've all screwed up. That doesn't mean we have to live our lives as screw ups. We can heal and improve and contribute and grow at least as well as anyone else. We're still human.
