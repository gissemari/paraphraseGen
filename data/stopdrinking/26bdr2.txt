I am writing this after watching the documentary Anonymous People on Netflix which I highly recommend. This makes me very grateful that I have struggled with alcoholism as long as I have and how my views and the views of others have evolved. The words "I'm an alcoholic" first left my lips 11 years ago. ..I credit my first home group of AA with much of the way I feel about my disease today. My home group was three blocks from my house I'd been walking my dog in that neighborhood for years so I knew there was a 7:00 am M-F and 8:00 on Saturday and Sunday. I was known as "Magnus's Mom" to everyone there who had played with my dog over the years. When I told my SO that I was going there the first time he was a little surprised relieved but surprised. "Everyone there knows you" for me I thought where better to be than somewhere I already have "friends?" My first meeting there I was visibly trembling when I walked in it quickly faded away. I have never felt so welcomed and so loved as I did that morning the last time I received that many heartfelt hugs was my husband's funeral...The meetings there were designated LGBT open meetings made sense I lived in a gay neighborhood. I was one of maybe 4 "breeders" that were regulars there. I didn't understand it then but I do now how lucky I was to be among them how lucky that was my first exposure to a recovery community. What most in that group had already overcome by way of disclosing their sexuality or "coming out" meant that I was in a group of very courageous individuals who already overcome an issue that carries with it a huge stigma...How anyone choses to or not to disclose their addiction is their business. I am a very private person my Facebook profile pic is a fictional character you could scour my profile and won't find a shred of evidence that I am almost 6 months pregnant or almost 9 months sober my marital status is blank as is my employment and education. Unless I was required by law to disclose my addiction recovery I won't. That being said if anyone point blank asks me why I don't drink I don't have a problem saying "because a I am a recovering alcoholic." I don't have shame I am still not going to splatter personal issues on my Facebook but after watching the aforementioned documentary I am contemplating how I can publicly better serve the recovery community to put a dent in the stigma that keeps many who struggle waiting in the wings. I want to help those suffering be center stage and face the disease head on without shame or secrecy so the focus is on recovery at the same time shattering the public perception of addiction which often is a roadblock to successful recovery..

That's the great thing about anonymity you can do whatever you want with yours and you have no business in controlling anyone else's. I'm glad you have found a system that you feel comfortable working with. I for one bring it up whenever I want to or whenever anyone asks...&gt; I don't have shame I am still not going to splatter personal issues on my Facebook..Do you mean alcoholism? In my opinion alcoholism is not a personal issue but that's only because when I was only able to properly treat it with the help of others. I don't rub it in anyone's face rather I would rather want someone to be attracted to me for seeking help if they needed than me promoting my own agenda. They still have to know I'm there though...Interesting read I still have to see the movie. We're trying to get it shown at my campus and have a director or something come out to answer questions. I think it could be very helpful in reducing stigma about alcoholism in a college setting.
