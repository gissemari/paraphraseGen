I have to say this journey has not been without its dark times. Working through guilt of wasting so much time thinking about alcohol shame of what relationships were ruined and shaking off the fog of depression and saying goodbye to my "friend" alcohol. Though with friends like THAT who needs enemies?!.I have to say though in the last few days something is changing... I feel brighter happier like I am becoming my best self and the cravings are waning. I know it's always going to be a struggle but today I feel okay..I just want to say no matter your journey you are a wonderful beautiful human and it is okay to think that. You are somebody. This is your one life. Please remember that any minute it can all be over and this is our chance. These small moments that you can overcome add up to a bigger mountain of happiness that you deserve. I will not drink with you today and I have lots of love for you and every moment you are on this earth. &lt;3

This is a beautiful sentiment.  I couldn't worry too much about the shame of things I had done it would've driven me crazy.  I'm just glad the way forward is brighter than the past is dark.
That's fantastic well done. I'm done with feeling guilty it has only caused me to drink more. So my mantra is fuck it and let it go otherwise I'll drink.  80 days sober is truly amazing. Today I Will not drink with you
