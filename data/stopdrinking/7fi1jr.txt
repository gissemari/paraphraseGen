To start I need that badge reset...I have probation monthly.  I have drug and alcohol counseling bi-weekly and group twice a week on top of that.  As a condition of my probation I need to remain completely abstinent of drugs and alcohol.  ..In my group (who my D&amp;A counselor leads) many people admit when they relapse and I would like to speak there too and tell the truth.  I am just worried that it may get reported to my probation officer.  I am on good terms with both.  I am just worried this may put my freedom in jeopardy; but I would also like to be honest in group because I think the accountability of it all is an important part of keeping up my sobriety...Has anyone been in this position before?..I should probably cross post into /r/legaladvice but figured I would ask here first since you all help keep me accountable as well.

I was in the exact same situation. However I read the fine print and saw all it said was that if I can't remain abstinent I would have to enter treatment. Lol. Already there! You are likely not the first to relapse nor the last. Imo I think they care more that you complete the program and get back on the wagon instead of relapsing and going on a giant binge where you stop going to treatment. Re-read your probation terms again..after I did I felt so much better. Hoping you have a similar situation!
Never admit to anything in AA that can put you in jail..At the Big Meeting in Atlanta a few years ago one of the main speakers was a man in a prison jump suit in shackles.  He had 2 deputies with him.  He spoke about his life as a drunk.  He spoke about a AA meeting where he spoke about a time he drove while he was drunk and he believed "he hit something maybe someone".  Well in that meeting was a sober police officer.  A week later the police were outside the meeting and he did hit someone and killed them and left the scene.  The officer did the right thing.
