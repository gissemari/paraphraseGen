It hasn't been easy. This weekend was especially tough. I was 90% ready to drink Friday because I was letting a personal relationship affect my well being. I made it through and woke up Saturday determined to seize the day. Glad I did with a road trip to Mt. Rainier. I took in some beautiful scenery and got some good pics. That little trip helped in renewing my faith in myself and my goal. I also would like to thank this community. I may not be a huge contributor at this point in my sobriety but to those who are and those who share your triumphs and struggles I thank you for your help.

Congrats on day 30 and between 30 and 60 days I saw a lot of positive change in my body and my clarity. Hope to see your 2 star in another 30 days.
Awesome! I visited Mt Rainier for the first time last year. Beautiful part of the country we live in. I've found getting out into nature helps me stay sober.  IWNDWYT!
