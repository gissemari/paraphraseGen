But it's so hard when I'm upset and angry. It's filling my mind. I can only think about things to calm me down or make me feel better. And going and getting a drink or 5 is all I want to do. I keep telling myself it would make things worse and I'm in control so we're not drinking. But damn. This is hard. I know everyone here will encourage me but I just wanted everyone to know that bad days happen.. I was just saying yesterday how my cravings have gone away and I'm doing great almost two months sober. Then I woke up and got in a fight with my SO he broke my trust really hard last night because he was drunk. It's funny how the whole problem revolves around drinking. And yet my brain says "go drink you'll feel better."..Sorry this is kind of ranty and repetitive. I just know this I the only place I can come to with my struggle right now. Thank you all for being here. I have an entire day ahead of me. But you can have my word I will try my hardest not to drink with you today.

Bad days absolutely happen. 2018 was one of the roughest years of my life - health marriage you name it. I'd be lying if the thought of "FUCK IT" hadn't crossed my mind but like you said in your post I knew that drinking would not help anything...In my first year I also had cravings pop up seemingly out of nowhere. One of the worst was around 11 months. One day I was fine the next I was hanging on by my fingernails - but the day after that **I was fine again**...Quitting drinking is hard. You're doing a hard thing. However I can tell you from personal experience that it does in fact get easier - way way easier. I know you've likely heard that many times before but it's true. Hang in there.
