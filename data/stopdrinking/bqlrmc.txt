A year ago and every year before that this weekend signified the start of summer and the start of copious amounts of drinking. This time last year I would have likely consumed around 30 drinks over the weekend. ..This year I have run a 10km biked 50km and taken my dog for two walks. If you had told me this a year ago I would have laughed in your face and would not have believed it for a second!..It's amazing how much positive change is possible when you rid yourself of what holds you back. I still struggle with quite a few things but I think it's important to reflect on the progress (and not perfection) and put it all into perspective.

Wow congrats on a year! Good for you! That is awesome! IWNDWYT
Wow!!  First of all congratulations  !!  This  was so inspirational to read for someone with just shy of three months sober.   I think a lot of people with drinking problems (myself included) have this idea of perfection and some of us have  perfectionist  personalities.  It's really important to be reminded how this is all progress and striving for more progress not for unachievable perfection. Thank you for the reminder and motivation!.IWNDWYT
I'm sorry but I beg to differ. The dog walks alone are perfection! Nothing better than spending time with your furry friend  ...Congrats OP! I'm assuming you're Canadian ( unless it's a long weekend somewhere else too ) so happy Victoria Day weekend! If not... ah well
