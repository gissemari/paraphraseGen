I got a Star with a 10 in it. Still on my longest run of sobriety. Some days it's so easy... some days it's not. Been having really bad cravings lately thinking it's because of the warm summer weather. My pool doesn't seem as much fun without a drink in my hand. Sadly I have been avoiding it. Drinking and the Pool. I keep hoping for that break through moment when I'm like yeah I got this. I feel it every once in awhile when I go through a day and realize that evening that I hadn't had a craving that day till now. It gives me hope. ..I wish I liked AA because it would be great to have some sober friends. The first month of my sobriety I went a few times but it didn't sit well with me. Now 10 months in I have been considering it again. Relapse scares the shit out of me enough that I would consider AA again. I know sober friends are a huge help in preventing relapse. ..For now I'm sticking with this sub and the while I'm not big a contributor I like the calming effect reading it has on me...I wish everyone the best.

Have you tried reading Allen Carrs  Easyway to control Alcohol? It really does alter the way you think about Alcohol and I am sure it would really help and work well alongside the support you get from this site. Remember how far you have come. Stay strong. I will not drink with you today
This Naked Mind also is a good read to put alcohol into perspective. As for AA sometimes you have to shop around for a comfortable fit. There aren't too many options where I live very rural but there are enough kindred souls to keep me going day by day. Having a sponsor helps too...I got one right away to help me stay accountable and connected.
