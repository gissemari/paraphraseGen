It's been a while since I relapsed I've had a couple sips of beer here and there socially to try a new flavor but I've discovered alcohol isn't for me.  It's not in my house and not in my life.  Even if don't think it resets your clock :p..I still struggle like tonight.  Tomorrow I have a minor wrist surgery but here I am awake way later than I should be thinking about how easy I could fall asleep if I had booze...But I don't.  And I'm proud I can afford the surgery now that alcohol is gone.  And I'm happy I can coherently type this...Anyway I will not drink tonight.  Or tomorrow when the pain comes :)..PS: anyone that's reading this is doing an excellent job not drinking tonight ! Keep it up!
