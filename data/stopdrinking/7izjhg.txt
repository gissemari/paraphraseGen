Hello. I am a Girlfriend to someone very special my boyfriend..He was 3 or 4 months sober and he relapsed. It makes me feel very lost and scared for him and I. He does have support but he quit going to AA because of the group leaders. The group leaders were supporting people and when they told them personal information the group leaders/ sponsers spread it around. ..He got triggered because of his birthday not one member of his family called to wish him happy birthday. ..His roommate isn't there much. he is gone or there for short periods of time. ..My boyfriend recently had the flu but he took the NyQuil that has alcohol in it. we didn't think because we were in a rush when we were there to buy some medication. ..I don't live with him but he has his own apartment. He does go to church but he didn't today and I wish he did. ..Any support tips or ideas would be so appreciated...- From the lost girl
