Not me thankfully. A client called yesterday to get some of their savings out. I asked what it was for to determine if we needed to change anything else. She admitted she'd gotten a DUI over the weekend. ..I wasn't surprised in the least bit. I met her at "professional drinking groups" as I'm calling them (craft beer/home brew associated groups). It really isn't a matter of if for most of those people but when. I was absolutely part of these. I felt bad for her. She struggles financially and this isn't gonna help. I suspect she's deep in the addiction circle. ..But there was some selfish satisfaction on my side as I thought "thank God that's not a possibility for me anymore". I was absolutely in the "not if when" group and buzzed driving is something I'm most ashamed about. Luckily I quit before the 'when'...So iwndwyt.

Up until I got married at 26 (now 43) I drove drunk all the time.  It is an absolute miracle I never got a DUI or killed anyone.  Hopefully this is her rock bottom.
I sometimes re-notice this. Trap shooting leagues golf outings bowling alleys bars social events concerts...all have intoxicated people leaving en masse. Those same people will look down their noses if someone gets a DUI. A DUI is never good but at least they've learned (hopefully) and aren't doing it anymore (hopefully). The shamers will go on doing it night after night until who knows what happens.
