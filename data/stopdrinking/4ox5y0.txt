I guess I'm not such a special snowflake that drinking and I can magically get along like I had hoped...I had made it to within a week or two of a year sober when I relapsed. As soon as I took the first drink though it took me. It's true what they say - the disease is patient. It does not care how comfortable you feel in sobriety it will take you back to where you were so fast that your head will spin...Looking forward to a more informed try at this sobriety thing...Thanks everybody

Welcome back. Remember that all that time spent sober is not time lost. Fall down seven times get up eight. Thanks for checking back in! 
Welcome home.
That's how I felt when I relapsed in January. Like I'd never left.
Glad you're back!
Welcome back! I will not drink with you today.
