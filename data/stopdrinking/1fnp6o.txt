I had one last night. It was pretty pathetic. Glad it was only a dream though.

I had one a few nights ago. Woke up scared to death I had actually relapsed. It wasn't one of those dreams that are purely fantasy but crosses that line where you think it could actually be real...Sometimes I wish I could just turn my dreams off. ..edit: grammar
The only good thing about these dreams is the sense of *relief* I feel when I wake up and realize that no I wasn't *actually* drinking. But they can be pretty nightmarish when they're happening.
It's pretty amazing how the mind works. All of the guilt helplessness and anxiety immediately are felt during my using dreams. 
Scumbag brain!
I had them a lot in my first year. They happen much less now. Usually just if I'm anxious about something. I would wake up in the morning and think I had relapsed for the first 5 or 10 minutes. They were terrifying! Now I know I didn't the minute I wake up.
Yeah I do this sometimes. Usually it's something as simple as having a sip of beer. That split second when I wake up I'm like "FIUUUUUUUCCCCK.". Then a second later I'm like "Phew."
I had one two nights ago. I have them all the time. They are awful. But nothing beats the relief of waking up and realizing it was just a dream and I am still on the straight and narrow. 
I have had a number of them although with less frequency over the last few months.  I would wake up with frustration as if it is was a real relapse (or some indicator that I was doing something wrong in recovery) yet glad it was only a dream.  You can't control your dreams so try not to think of it as pathetic.  I reasoned that for how long and much I drank plus my efforts at recovery it was a common topic stirring in my head that could be drawn upon to create that dream.
