I seriously didn't even mentally process that I put a bottle of wine in my bag at the grocery store. I realized when I got ID'd at checkout. I spent the entire walk home trying to rationalize how "one drink won't kill me" "its been a tough few days I deserve it" "ok I'll go work out and then I can splurge." finished my short workout and I said ."you know what I'm not going to drink today."..everyone struggling with the first few days like me trust me endorphins work wonders. ..thank you to everyone here I've been lurking on for the advice to just work out. you guys saved me today.

Darn that lizard brain!..Good job today! 
Nice save!
You rode it out! Congrats. Most cravings don't last long. If you can wait it out they usuall go away after a few minutes or less because most of us can't focus on a singular thought for any longer than that: even fantasies about alcohol! They do recur though for me sometimes more than once per night. I give in to my unhealthy urges in the form of treating myself to something relatively less unhealthy: cake ice cream coffee tea and I really make a ritual out of it. I even eat it on a plate instead of over the sink! ;)
