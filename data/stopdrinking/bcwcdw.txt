previous post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bc814m/planning\_my\_relapsehelp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bc814m/planning_my_relapsehelp/) ..I still have been skipping my antabuse. My parents are not going out of town until next weekend-which is when my alcoholic brain has been telling me I will relapse but today has been so brutal so far. I have been doing EVERYTHING possible to avoid relapse...&amp;#x200B;..Went to a meetup group yesterday to avoid boredome. Went to the strip club (I don't have a problem going to a strip club sober) after that just to get some interaction with girls. I might go to another meetup event tonight but goddam\*t all I want to do is drink.  Went to AA this afternoon just made me want to drink even further. ..&amp;#x200B;..I dont have the willpower to keep taking my antabuse. I suppose I can smoke weed instead? See a hooker? Take pills? I know there are so many options out there besides drinking but the brain wants what the brain wants. ..&amp;#x200B;..Idk what I can do besides ride the cravings out. I wish I had the willpower to keep taking my antabuse. ..&amp;#x200B;..F\*ck sobriety can be SO HARD :/

Remember to eat food drink water and rest.
I was really afraid I was going to be having crazy urges the first weekend I had the whole house to myself.  I honestly ended up not even thinking about it really so I got up in a worry leading up to it for nothing.  That being said I just ordered some food delivery from my favorite place had coke zeros on deck played some games online with my friends watched a movie and passed out.  Then next day I just went out and did some stuff shopping getting gas etc and did it all over again.  Even when I drank I hated drinking alcohol on a full stomach I dunno if you are like that but if you are treat yourself to some good ass food.
What's stopping you from drinking today? If its your parents will you be able to stop drinking in time for them to come back and not notice? If you do relapse how long will it realistically be before you can stop again? If I knew with 100% confidence that I could drink and then go back to not drinking the next day it would be a lot more tempting to drink. But then I remember all the times I tried to stop and made it 1-2 days before going back. ..I'm guessing you had good reasons to quit. Is it really worth risking them for a couple days of drinking? Maybe you could just drink on the weekend your parents are gone and then go back to sobriety again. It could happen. But is it likely?..I can't stop you. Your parents can't stop you. No one can stop you.  It's a choice only you can make. Just please think long and hard about this before you decide which way to go.
Do you live with someone that can administer the antabuse to you until you feel confident enough that you can hold yourself accountable without them doing so? I know a lot of doctors will suggest that a friend partner or family member give you the dose/ watch you take it for the first little bit in order to make sure that it' being taken on a regular basis...&amp;#x200B;..Either way no one can truly make you stay compliant but it might help if you're comfortable asking for help...&amp;#x200B;..Best of luck either way I wish I had more to offer.
Naltrexone can come in injection form would that help? No ability to skip pills.
What is the longest you stayed sober? Because this stuff passes and gets less and less
You could read 'Alcohol Explained' by William Porter. Or 'This Naked Mind' by Annie Grace. Both on Amazon and at your doorstep before next weekend. Actually rock climbing sounds pretty cool and is something to get your adrenaline pumping. REI has indoor rock climbing walls. Work out like a maniac. Call someone in AA. ..I felt like shit when I relapsed after 8 months. Not. Worth. It. Every time I hear myself thinking about getting a drink or how nice it would be I change the thought and say 'I never drink. It's poison.'  You have the power and permission to change your thoughts. I don't have any experience with Antabuse so I can't help you there. ..&gt;but the brain wants what the brain wants...I found L-glutamine helps with cravings. Our brain biochemistry is totally fucked up with alcohol. Check out fit-recovery website/blog...The fact that you're reaching out indicates that you know the right thing to do. You know you want to stop. Now convince yourself that you can and you will. Keep in touch here. We all want you to stay sober.
Distractions never did much for me.  They only worked for as long as I was doing the activity.  But I couldn't be running full steam forever.  It was a lot better when I figured out why I wanted to drink and addressed that...We will still be here when you are ready to return.  Best of luck to you.
Take your antabuse!  I'm on day 30 of taking my antabuse and it is one of the only things preventing a relapse right now. I want a drink but I already made the decision not to drink when I took the antabuse. It has been very helpful.
I'm also on Antabuse and I beg you to just take that pill. Just get up go over and do it. The craving will still be there but then eventually you'll find something else to do. You'll order a whole pizza or get that hooker (hey she'll appreciate the money) and you'll feel better and you didn't drink...You seem torn about relapse to me ... because you keep coming and telling us...Seriously the whole point of that pill is that it only takes one moment of resolve to swallow it.  You have a tool right now waiting to help you. I'm rooting for you.
