Happy Friday everyone.I am about 4 weeks in (I need to reset my badge) and I am having trouble figuring out how to have a social life without drinking. I play sports 3 or 4 days out of the week but since I stopped drinking again I have been sitting alone at home on Friday and Saturday nights. How do you suggest I find things to do and meet people outside of drinking? Going to bars seems like a bad idea as I am pretty good at convincing myself to "just have one or two" and we all know how that turns out. I am really struggling with boredom and I don't want to feel like I am missing out on part of my life that should be in order by now. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions on how to remedy this problem?

I went to an AA meeting when I started feeling this way and found some people around my age and asked them which other meetings to go to. I've been going for 3 weeks and it's still helping. It was scary and I was super nervous but it helped get me out of that  life will never be fun again  headspace. Even if it's not for you long term it helps to not feel alone. Other things that I've heard are good - martial arts classes hiking or backpacking groups meditation classes. AA is a good place to go to just ask around. The only qualification is the desire to stop drinking!
