I've made it an entire week without drinking. This is really huge for me as I've struggled for a long time to get into the right headspace to quit...For the last 7 days instead of abusing my body with alcohol daily for over a year and rarely eating anything nutritious I've been cooking myself healthy meals and am trying to substitute my urge to have a drink with going for walks and cleaning my house. ..It's been quite tough but I'm determined to keep going. Thanks for all the support on this sub it's been a real lifeline to me.

Hey me too! I've been cleaning my apartment and even threw out decade old clothes.....I always was drinking way too long 30+ years. Got 100+ days clean and many more sober days with moderation last year...The over xmas went nuts so I'm back to coming up for finishing my second week. Week 2 is easier I think because you are starting to get into the *routine* of not drinking and finding lots of new time on your hands. Keep it up and we'll not drink with each other today.
Congrats! Keep fighting those urges!
Good on you! For my first week instead of abusing my body with alcohol daily I was just abusing my body with candy =) But hey it was still a step in the right direction. ..Congratulations on a major milestone! Keep it up!
