I definitely struggle the most on weekends. It's not even Friday lunchtime here in Australia and I can feel the temptation already. ..I keep reminding myself that these thoughts were my old drinking self - I don't drink anymore so I just let the thoughts pass when they creep up on me. ..So I'm here to give myself some focus. ..I will not drink this weekend. ..I won't let myself get stuck on the excuses I could use to drink. ..I will not obsess over the fact that I could be drinking (like I did last weekend) ..It's just not going to happen because I don't drink anymore. ..Instead I'm going to have a sober clear headed weekend - and it's going to be great!

It's great that your thinking has turned a corner. Any plans for taking different action?
One day at a time! Have a fun and sober weekend!
