Mobile etc...Prior to this week I have been intoxicated almost every day since I got out of the USN (July 2017). I have been back at school and in work have an incredible boyfriend and making relative progress towards a better life but for some reason I have been compelled to drink myself into oblivion. ..I felt myself hating alcohol wishing I was more productive daily envying people who get up earlier than 10am every day. I watched myself gain about twenty pounds from it. I felt unmotivated bloated weak etc. I call myself an alcoholic to people in casual conversation and admit that I have an issue. I even started hating the taste and effects of alcohol. I felt like a puppet whose strings were controlled by some voice in my head urging me to have "just one". ..People who I am friends with and love dearly think that it's a joke every time I try to not drink. They've made bets on it or suggest that it's silly that I'm trying to stop. I think that they either have trouble admitting that I (and possibly they) have issues with alcohol OR that they think I'm too hard on myself. ..I work in a restaurant if you're in the industry you likely know that it is full of debaucherous (often alcoholic) misfits. After St. Patrick's day some of us made a competition out of who could avoid alcohol the longest. We pooled money and the last person to have a sip of alcohol wins the pool. ..I know it's a lighthearted joke  but something was different for me this time. Idk if it's because I can tell people that I'm doing this for a bet instead of for myself so they pressure me less or if it's because I have found a weird support system in the struggle to not drink... but it's working. ..Today is day four I have been having WILD dreams (my first wet dream in years). I woke up at eight this morning and felt like a fully functioning human. I did laundry cleaned my kitchen. I feel less bloated and lethargic. I'm hoping the spell is broken I finally feel like I may have the controls back. The next step for me will be joining the climbing gym I have been eyeing. ..Thanks for reading ya'll!

A couple of months ago a coworker said that she was gonna go 30 days without alcohol. Naturally as we bet on everything I immediately said I have 5$ against it! Then I thought about it and made it $100 bet for the first one that broke down. I ended up winning! You got this!
My sobriety started as a month long bet. :)
