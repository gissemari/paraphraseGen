*We may be anonymous strangers on the Internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..***. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...***. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---..Good morning!! (or afternoon depending where you are). This is a special super early edition of the DCI for my new friend u/quirkyhatgirl in Australia! I hope your Saturday is going well my friend. I'm about to head to bed but will catch you in the morning!..As this is likely my final day hosting after a very special and inspirational two weeks I wanted to leave you with something personal. Music is a huge influence in my life and here's a song I found soon after achieving 30 days sober: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XOjk9UuriE..While I LOVE this sound I've also found the lyrics to be encouraging and applicable to my struggle to find sobriety and happiness... I won't post every word but here's the opening verse - I hope this song gives you the extra push you need to get through the really tough days. I know it does for me!..***"You gotta be a little smarter  .Try a little bit harder  .You gotta do what you can  .To get on down the line  .You gotta dig a little deeper  .And push a little bit further  .You gotta do what you can  .And not be left behind  .You gotta do it for yourself  .And I will too  .You gotta put it all behind you  .Leave nothing to remind you  .You got to put it all away  .To get out what's inside  .Be honest with yourself  .And I will too  .You gotta do it for yourself  .And I will too  .You gotta speak a little louder  .You gotta be a little prouder  .Cause you know that someday  .Your bones will be in the ground"***..Much love to everyone here at SD I won't be drinking with you today! - xJT

It's just turned Saturday here in California 12:05 AM . I'm right on this pledge today ! I'm not going to drink today! 
Not drinking today!
I will not drink today. Got new patches so my day goes by sewing them on battlevest. Sometimes it is not easy to be metalhead. Especially when you get the sting marks on fingers from needles and supposed to play music. I will attend AA night group. 
Thank you xJT I have really liked your early morning check-in posts a chance to think about the day ahead and plan...Love the lyrics especially the last three lines...Happy to not be drinking with you today :-)
I will enjoy my Saturday sober and will happily not drink with all you good people out there tonight! Have a wonderful Saturday!
I can't believe I've made it to 30 days!! In over 20 years I haven't even come close to this long without a drink.

Still feeling a small bit mouldy after my binge on Thursday. So much more tempting to drink when I know it will make those symptoms temporarily go away but today I will not drink.

My newly rediscovered love of coffee means I ended up drinking coffee all day yesterday (including not just one but TWO fancy and expensive concoctions one from Peet's and one later from Starbucks) and now of course I cannot sleep. Oh dear. Regardless I will not drink alcohol today no matter what happens.

3 weeks down. Cravings are strange I've got the odd mental one creeping in but with how sick I made myself with my last bout of drinking my body is still physically repulsed by the idea. I suppose that's a good thing. I will not drink today..

Two weeks today! And not without struggle. Got dumped over the phone by more SO of two years less than a week into sobriety. Made it through a booze filled company get together. Proud to say my binge drinking days have come to an end I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!
I am not drinking today.
I will not drink today.
3 weeks sober today! I finally found an AA sponsor. The more I think about it the more I see the hand of ... something in all of this. Still I don't really have a faith or spirituality which makes me nervous about step 2: "Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity." I feel tired more often now and sleep every chance I get but I'm happy to be sober. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today..

I had a nightmare last night that I drank at a bar due to the stress of the hurricane and even in my dream I had one drink and was DEVASTATED at ruining my sober streak :P..I woke up relieved that it wasn't real. I'm not drinking today hurricane or not. 
I will not drink today!

Off to a BBQ today with lots of non alcoholic drinks. I'm not drinking today :)
I will not drink today (cigs I got my eye on you my lung is in agreement)!
A week ago today I woke up with blurred and missing memories bruises and scrapes and all of the hangover shame. Over the last week I had to beg my partner for another chance cover my physical wounds with band aids and makeup and face some uncomfortable realities about myself. Today I woke up with memories of a really nice night with my partner cold brew coffee and my new ritual of posting here and the energy to feel excited about the million ways I can enjoy this sunny Saturday. Plus my avocado seed finally sprouted roots overnight (!!!) and I can't help but feel attached to the little guy in some "I can't wait to watch us both grow" kind of way. SD has been so incredibly helpful over the last week and I feel like my successes are also your successes. I won't drink with you all today. 
I'm going to a lunch with girlfriends today; thought of avoiding it but I'm going to go. I will NOT drink with you today!! 
I will not drink today.  Thanks sobernauts for helping me have so much more time---quality time too.
So not drinking with ya'll today!

Fuck alcohol. I will not drink with you guys today.
I will not drink today 
I will not drink today.
Not drinking today!
I had a dream i could glide just above the ground. I glider over cornfields and even got as high as my house. There was very little fear. There was an old crone telling me how amazing it was. Clearly my subconscious is very happy again. ..I'm going to see It and maybe getting some BBQ after. 
**A Big Shout-out to u/xJToews19 for two weeks of inspirational and insightful Check-Ins!**  Thank you for your service to r/stopdrinking!..If you have 30-days sober and would like to host this very important feature of our community please PM the Mods...I join you all in not drinking TODAY and pray for those in Hurricane Irma's path.  (Stay safe u/CheeseWhistleMcStink as 'the path' now looks like it's heading for Atlanta as well.)
Good morning! I will not drink today.

Very happy to say I'll be not drinking with all you lovely people today.

Well it's fall 70 degrees football and I'm struggling. Last night was rough.. I think I got 4 hours of sleep. I'll be honest this first week has not been pleasant. Looking forward to easier days. :(

I will not drink today! Going to a surprise party for a friend's dad tonight and obviously there will be a lot of alcohol there. Some people that will be there don't actually know I've quit drinking yet (haven't seen most of them since before I quit). The first couple weeks of not drinking I've felt so much better and no way I'm going to screw that up now. I know people will offer me a drinks and it will be a challenge but it's a challenge I'm prepared for!
I don't want to waste one more day of my life hungover barely able to function...I will not drink with you all today no matter what!!

6 days. My baby daddy woke me up and almost gave me a heart attack...Now my anxiety is through the roof and he also left beers in the fridge. ..But I know it will just make me feel worse. So I am not drinking with you today. 
I will not drink today no matter what happens.
Heading out for a quick visit with very old parents who I love and am driven crazy by. And in past visits I drank -- heavily-- to deal with the stress. BUT WON'T DRINK THIS TIME!!
OH HAPPY SATURDAY! I didn't wake up with a hangover this morning and I won't wake up with one tomorrow. I will not drink with you today!
Out of friends can't find new ones...Marriage rocky.  Husband drinks every night.  Good things but bad things and nothing clear cut but distant. vanishing. drifting away. I try to bring it up but he fights tried counseling but it was like I pushed him and he isn't asking for more and I'm tired of pushing...My parents in florida.  My sister in tampa.  I told them tuesday to come to my house (north ga)...They are staying in place...My country is falling apart...Give. Me. A. Reason.
Have a great weekend everybody  I will not drink with you today!

Was at a friend's kid's 4th birthday party which I'm ashamed to say would previously have been an excuse to have 5 or 6 beers while other folk kept an eye out for my kids and my wife drove...Not today...It's nearly time for bed but I did not and will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today.  I had a first date today which didn't go very well.  This doesn't particularly bother me it's just a little disappointing but I feel like I need to work on myself for a while.  I'm feeling pretty depressed for some reason that I assume is just withdrawal symptoms.  Whenever I get like this I always get this sinking feeling about how I don't know what I want to do with my life and I feel like I don't enjoy my days.  I can at least know there is something I don't want to do which is be drunk/hungover everyday.  So I'll just go through the motions and hope it gets better.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today 
I'm going to a big party tonight where I know there will be copious amounts of alcohol. I only intended 30 days when I started this but I'm at day 34 and don't actually wanna drink.  ..I won't be drinking tonight. I can still have fun see people chug sparkling water when everyone's got their beers and be the DD for my girlfriend if she does drink.
Not drinking today.
I went to a small town fair with dad today. We drove on his bike together for the first time in years. I wouldn't have enjoyed this drunk. Or I would have but it would've been a chemically heightened joy sandwiched between anxiety and misery. I'm glad I didn't drink today.
I will not drink today. 
I won't drink tonight.  I'm not going to waste my time drinking and trying to get through tomorrow.

I will not drink today. .I have been posting regularly in the past using another account. I hopped to my alt (this one) because I think my main account has leaked to my colleagues. They may know I stopped drinking it is not a secret but it does feel slightly uncomfortable posting personal stuff. 
Starting over day 2 but I too will not drink with you all.
