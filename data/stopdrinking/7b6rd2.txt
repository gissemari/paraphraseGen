Had a dream about getting wasted and then feeling a lot of regret for doing so.  Was relieved when I woke up with a clear mind feeling well.  It was a strong reminder of how disappointed I would be in myself if I were to give up at this point.

I've had some dreams like that; one was particularly weird and scary.  You're right that feeling of relief on waking reinforces how much we value this path we're on.
