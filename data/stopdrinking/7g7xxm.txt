I feel absolutely horrible. Worst hangover ever. What triggered it was I had an argument with my girlfriend and absolutely did not react in a healthy manner. I felt so terrible at the thought of losing probably the one person that I have truly ever loved that I relapsed and got black out drunk. Which is fucking stupid because no one likes me drunk. Going back to A.A. tomorrow and I will get a sponsor didn't have one and should have listened when I was told to get one. Just needed to tell someone thank you all.

Thank you for your courage to post!..Instead of thinking of myself as a failure a fuck-up and a monster I had to learn to see myself as a sick person. You wouldn't beat up on another sick person would you? That's how I began to learn to treat myself with love and kindness unconditionally no matter what. I had to become my own loving parent...Here are lists of top-voted stopdrinking posts on various topics and the last link is for immediate relapse prevention: ..[consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=consequences&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[alcoholic](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=alcoholic&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[relapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=relapse&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[humility](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=humility&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[atheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=atheist&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=decision&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[attitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=attitude&amp;restrict_sr=on) -- .[prison](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=prison&amp;restrict_sr=on)..More Help: [Steps_1_2_3](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/477gm4/demystifying_the_steps_simply_a_set_of_tools_part/) --.[12 Steps No Religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3wdrft/after_some_editing_in_the_dino_den_an_agnostic/) --.Having an urge to relapse?
