Most of my work is done remotely so I had yet to meet most of my colleagues but today we spent a whole day working together. I generally consider myself to be pretty shy but since removing alcohol from my life this type of thing just feels so much easier I have a much higher level of bravery and self esteem now. I already knew that the plan was for all of us to go have a beer together after work. Determined to live a normal life I was not going to skip it but I was a bit worried that the others might make a big deal of me drinking NA beer. ..When we got to the place one of them asked me what I wanted and I answered that I'll figure it out and get it myself but he said that the company was paying so I should to order through him. Thankfully I had already spotted Innis &amp; None (0.0% and surprisingly tasty) on the list so I was ready. I told him the name but the bartender heard me and stealthily handed me a can and a glas so no one noticed that I wasn't drinking at first...I didn't hide it when people asked what I was drinking and the only response I got was that one of them said "That's smart!" and it sounded genuine. The biggest win for me though was hanging out with relative strangers and still enjoying myself and participating (more than usual if anything) despite not having the alcohol to lean on. I can't believe it but I had more fun than I would have had when I was drinking! Feels so great to be heading home with a clear head so I wanted to share with you how great it can be...If you're struggling just know that it is both possible and highly rewarding keep pushing!

Great job codegasm! Doesn't it make you feel so powerful and unstoppable when everybody around you is having a drink and you're not? Damn that feels good : ). .
