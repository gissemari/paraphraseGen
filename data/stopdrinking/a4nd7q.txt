Posting here to write it out and remind myself that a drink will not solve any of the things that are bothering me. It will not make me feel better - it will only temporarily lift my spirit before making me crash land and feel worse than I do currently. It will make work harder tomorrow it will make me more worried about situations on my plate. Drinking will make me feel bad about myself. It's scary to think of a relapse but if I take a moment to examine myself and past experiences I know where relapses lead and it is not pretty. I am an alcoholic which means I cannot drink. There are people who can drink but I am not one of them. For me alcohol is arsenic cyanide it will kill me if I have it. One way or another.
