Day 7 today. Struggled to get to sleep last night so managed to swing an extra 90 mins in bed before I go to work. ..Wow. 90 minutes of the most vivid and horrifying dreams and all so realistic I'm lying here scared to move in case I find out I really am divorced with a child who hates me a terminally ill dog and terrible parents. I remember everything as if it were a movie. And my head is thumping. ..Any advice on how to straighten my head out and become an efficient and effective member of society within the next half hour would be welcome!

My advice is to dwell on how great it is that it was just a dream and that your brain is so good to you that it's reminding you of all the stuff you are avoiding by being sober and in control....I am 74 days in and the dreams are no longer so scary but still incredibly vivid and frankly weird!...Last night I dreamt I was in the army and was worried that I didn't have the regulation bags in which to put my army-issued Camembert and nuts....I was also trying to carry a live blue chicken into battle with me....I think even Freud would have trouble working out the meaning behind that one!....Have a great day SuzyLou congrats on 6 days and I will gladly not drink with you today! x
Youre safe awake and you get to decide to act well and not sick today. ..I hate the nightmares that linger though it's easiest when I can just be glad it was a dream and move on 
I'd advise you to ride it enjoy it. You can get some scary ones but also get some pretty awesome ones too. Vivid as anything I've ever known
