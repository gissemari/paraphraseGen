Depressed and drinking and eating too much   
----------immediate responses--------

Welcome! We have all been in your same place. ..Whenever I get anxious booze and food were always my "go to" items. Then I realized the relief from alcohol is short lived and often brings the anxiety back so much worse. ..Anything specific triggering your struggle or just having a hard time in general?

Sorry to hear you're struggling. Any chance you can take a walk? Getting up and out the door and getting the blood moving always helps me.
