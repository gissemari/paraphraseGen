Since quitting drinking I've been shocked by all the benefits of living sober - things I didn't even realize would happen like laughing again!  I think starting a list (via sticky post) of all the pros might be a great tool for those considering quitting as well as a great reminder for those who might be struggling.  Anyone else agree?

Great idea!!!.Congrats on 20 days..IWNDWYT
Excellent.  I have been writing it all down.  I am much nicer and I think much clearer.  
Learning to laugh again was awesome. 
Not losing every argument by default because I was a bottle of wine in.
Going to bed remembering everything during the day and waking up remembering the night before...and having the best sleep in between!
Not having to worry if you're 'good to drive'...
Feeling like a good mommy   feeling like a good partner avoiding pointless arguments being present remembering everything clearly being healthier being more confident... countless benefits!
