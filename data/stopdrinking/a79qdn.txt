It frustrates me that alcohol is promoted via work. Surely there must be more people than me struggling in a medium sized company. I'm not taking part but will not make a big deal of it. Imagine the reactions if someone suggested a cigarette raffle. I don't think many people know alcohol is just as damaging.
