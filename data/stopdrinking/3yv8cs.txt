Having pizza tonight with my wife and kid. This would normally be accompanied by a bottle of red wine or more to myself. She is pregnant so it would have been all me drinking and sneaking more later. This would have been followed up by 3am sweats and groggy morning with me grumpy getting my kid ready and dropped off at school and hoping the teachers and other parents couldn't tell I was hung over. Then struggling through work all morning. ..Instead tomorrow's going to be great. Day 2 almost complete.

Well done!!
Great job Dad! Wine was my choice of poison. Do not miss those hangovers at all. Stay strong it gets easier and so much better! I am so very happy I quit. 
Good job!
Good job man you got this!
The 3am sweats are the worst. Lying there tossing and turning your heart and thoughts racing. And you KNOW that you're not going to fall back asleep until it's too late to provide any real rest if at all. ..That's honestly one of my biggest motivations to avoid drinking. 
Sweet deal. Have a great sober day tomorrow. 
Not worrying about other parent's noticing I'm hung over is so nice.  I used to hate Saturday morning soccer games around the other parents.  Especially since my best soccer mom and dad friend's were Mormon and complete teetotalers.  
Hell yeah! I've been the hungover and grumpy parent dropping kids off and struggling through work too many times as well. Goodbye to that!
Well done.
