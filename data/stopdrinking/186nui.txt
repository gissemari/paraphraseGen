Hello all if anyone is reading this I congratulate you on inching those feet toward a better you each day. My. Counter is off but I am going on a week sober today. Inside myself I am jumping for joy as my SO sleeps soundly next to me. This isn't my first time quitting. I have quit for a month due to doctors orders as my heart was starting to beat at such an odd rhythmic tone he was worried for my health. Another time I quit for 2 in a half weeks just before this Christmas and my last stint was 5 days before I caved and drank at a friends concert. That night after passing out in bed I awoke to what I hated most about this disease...  I was alone nauseous shaky head thumping and in such a deep mental canal I started to have a panic attack. My partner awoke to me shaking and violently crying and grasping for air anything I could tangibly touch to pull myself out of my own skin. I needed to get far away from what I now had become. My mother. A frantic avid drinker who would take any and all pain and anger out on my sister and I. I started following her footsteps very closely and after her demise losing to cancer I jumped right back on that beaten path and did any drug I could get my hands on. Alcohol though alcohol was my only one true love "my protector" this toxic liquid had veiled me from SO MANY things. From finding out my father was not my real father afted her death that I was made in a lab inside of a glass tube to watching the one person that struggled to bring me in this wolrd watching her time on this earth slip delicately through my fingertips like sand knowing there wasn't a danm thing I could do about it...My "protector" hid all of the ugliness from me knowing all along all of my fears trials tribulations discouragement etc were lying there waiting dormant. It was only a matter of time before my unraveling psyche would show itself and no longer be silenced.That night as I laied there shaking with hot tears streaming down my face enough was sure as hell enough.I My mother even sick herself instilled in me I was strong and better than this.I said allowed to my SO I will NEVER let alcohol control me.Never again will I punish myself or my body because of this disease. My mom sacrificed everything for me to make something out of myself because it was too late for her.My farther had too many ailments and due to a botched surgery that gave him lack of oxygen to the brain.he suffered from short term memory loss he could no longer work. I never knew what he was likebefore. The doctors got away with it by tampering with evidence. ..There was no hope for my parents but there is hope for me. I will have my own family and I will not let the destruction of alcohol pulse its way into my future. I thank whole heartedly to any who read this. I just needed to get this out of my system. No matter big or small by pulling yourself into recovery is one of the greatest stories there is.To all my brothers and sistes keep your head up it only gets better.
