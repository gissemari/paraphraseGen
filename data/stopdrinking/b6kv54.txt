I'm pretty much a bad person. My mom is fighting me for custody of the kid. My husband threw me out yesterday.  I'm 5 months pregnant.  It's unplanned and I don't wanna be. My life feels ruined in a sense. ..So anyway.  I've struggled for YEARS on drinking.  It's the one friend I have. It's also causes my to get two DWIs in two years. I was sober all last year. Got off probation Oct 6. Also drank on Oct 6. The same day!! ..I drank and smoked weed off and on w husband for two months.  Dec 7 I find out I'm pregnant.  I cried my eyes out. Not the good kinda tears. My first thought was  "now I can't drink" ..... ..So I'm sober again for nearly 4 months. Til last night. I keep reading how "a glass of wine a day is fine" while pregnant.  Yeah. A glass. I had two bottles. And still! Wasn't drunk enough. ..On my way home I ran my car into a ditch. Fucked it up bad. Husband helped me get it out. I was maybe four houses from our house. Almost there I think.  No cop drove by thank God. ..How can I have done this? I love my husband and don't was him to throw me out but that's where we're headed. I never wanted to be a mom. Ever. I cry and clutch my stomach thinking  "he's not wanted" .....Yes I see a therapist for this. She's so excited about baby that's all I hear about. Women aren't allowed to be scared about this kind of thing. ..I'm a bad human being  basically. I love drinking so much that I'd give my life for it. The whole year on probation I told all my counselors what they want to hear. All the while knowing I'd drink again. I used to purposely trigger myself and go to old gas stations that I would buy from etc. It was thrilling.  Isn't this sad? ..Now my husband wants me out I'm about to be a single mom my own mom is fighting me for custody of the thing.  How can I not drink ?? Really??!

You're not a bad person...I think you need a better therapist though. Is there a rehab or inpatient facility you could work with?..Also have you thought about adoption? You have choices and you do have control it sounds like you don't think you do. Good luck...
Drinking lead me to a place where those closest to me hated me my finances marriage and career were in ruins and I was on a course to be homeless very much sooner than later. They seemed insurmountable. I hated myself and how I felt and it seemed like the drink was the only thing that made life bearable...The thing is though all those problems were caused by my drinking. Even though it gave me a temporary break from feeling things the things it was giving me a break from were **caused by drinking itself.** The only way out was for me to be uncomfortable and face my problems without alcohol...The first year was lonely upsetting often a daily struggle and often boring  as I had a lot of spare time. I just tried to chip away at my problems as best I could on a daily basis and tried to maintain some sort of hope that things would get better...Well they did. My finances have done a 180 and I am now a homeowner. My career has taken off. My wife and I attended some marriage counseling which while painful was productive and we are now better than we've ever been. ..I know you're in pain right now and **I am not saying the above to boast.** I am saying them to try to give you some hope - if you stop doing the thing that is common to all your problems namely drinking those problems can get better. The tough part is that you'll have to face your problems without your current coping mechanism...I've only been sober about 4 years and my life is unrecognizable to where I was when I quit. Four years from now your life could be different too. Nobody can say what it'll be like but it's virtually certain that sobriety will make your life better.
You're not a bad person you're an addict. As an addict you're brain's natural instincts are being overridden to think alcohol is a priority over your family. ..I know you may not want to hear it (I didn't) but a meeting (AA NA etc.) will give you an outlet to talk to a neutral party a place to vent a place to find support. ..I wish you the best; please keep coming back here. 
Get a different therapist immediately
Man that's rough. It's a sad read quite frankly but I don't know what you're dealing with so I can only hope it gets better for you. Just try again. Try to stay sober again. Just do it. You've got it in you. IWNDWYT.
In no way are you a bad person. You just need help and understanding.  I strongly urge you to consider allowing you mother to have temporary custody unless there is a potential for abuse. If you do feel the need to give up the child. It doesn't't have to be out of not being wanted but love and care for the child.  It's hard but maybe with time and reflection it may be the best even if not ideal.  With help and some sobriety you can become a great mother.  I hope that you will consider AA and at the very least check out a meeting or two and see what you think of it.  I know it's hard. I know there is no easier softer way.  I hope that you can thrive once sober
You are not a bad person. There are no bad persons here on SD. Most of us here did some bad things I almost died because of it. We need to accept that our past is exactly that the past. Moving forward one day at a time will hurt but we need to keep on trying. We also need to forgive ourselves. Forgiving oneself is so important. I really hope that things will get better for you one day at a time. Please take care and know that you are never alone.
I second getting a new therapist. The fact that you are going and trying PROVES you're not a shitty person. You are not bad. You are in great pain. ALL of us have been where you are in one form or another. We love you and WNDWYT.
I am sorry about this unwanted pregnancy. The baby didn't ask to be conceived or to be continued so I hope you can find a way to not binge drink the rest of the pregnancy. My baby was planned but I was still freaked out as I never wanted kids and once we changed our minds it happened so fast we didn't have a chance to change our minds back to no kids. I had my iud put in place as soon as the baby was out. I hadn't even held him before they were popping it in. I love my Mirena iud. It's more effective than vasectomy or tubal with added bonus of no periods. 
.You aren't a bad person. You have an addiction and made some shitty choices while under the influence...Women (and men) are ABSOLUTELY allowed to be scared of pregnancy having a kid the whole lot. It scares everyone and it sounds like it's scaring you a lot. There are places and people who work with moms/parents in this situation. If you're in MA I can offer some links. Fellow moms who have been in this spot are a great support system. ..Of course drinking while pregnant isn't a good idea but you know that and no one here needs to shame you into remembering it. You are harder on yourself than we could ever be. ..And yes you need a better therapeutic relationship. This could be a new one AND/OR being more honest with yourself and your current therapist. 
Hey - your situation sounds really really tough - with lots of people telling you what is right for you. The pressure on women to have children is so significant even in difficult situations like yours - I hope you are able to find some support and options (like a new therapist!). And you are not a bad human being - at the very least it takes two people to make a baby and so it's not all on you. ..Thinking of you..IWNDWYT
I think there is a consensus at SD that no matter how bad things are things will improve by not drinking.  If you can manage a councilor or an AA meeting might help.  Everyone  on this SD loved alcohol too much just like you. What we don't  love are the consequences  of drinking that we've  experienced.  I hope  you  can  find a  way to try sobriety again.
It sounds like your therapist is not qualified I would strongly suggest you find someone that you can be 100% open and honest with and can work with you on identifying and healing your underlying issues   
Please tell your doctor what is going on. You are not a bad person you just need help. There are services and programs for pregnant addicts your doctor can help you. Sending you big hugs and praying for you   
Your baby needs you to slow down. You drank two days ago but today is a new day. If you decide that the little one would be best off with your mom or someone else that's okay. You're not a bad person. You're fucking stressed out. It sounds like you have a ton of pressure on you with your marriage your family your pregnancy everything. If you want to drink you got plenty of time to do that. Wait 6 months though. Don't hurt your baby. If you think you have problems now imagine how things will be if you hurt your kid. Babies are resilient. He's probably fine. Stop now. Just till the baby is out of you. Don't worry about anything. Just don't drink. Please. It's only 6 more months. Don't hurt your baby you'll never forgive yourself. Don't beat yourself up. You can only change today. Do the best you can. Your baby will love you more than anyone in the world unconditionally. Even if you don't love your baby let him have a chance to live.
