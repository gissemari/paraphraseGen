Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Inner Peace..**"Happiness can only be achieved by looking inward & learning to enjoy whatever life has and this requires transforming greed into gratitude." - [John Chrysostom](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/167415-happiness-can-only-be-achieved-by-looking-inward-learning)**..*What I get from it:* A friend of mine was asking me tonight how I have gotten to a [place of happiness](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/de/53/19/de531944023f8a42ffbe178bb7995ee8.jpg) and what it took to accept everything in my life for what it was.  I let him know that I am nowhere near complete in that regard and that life and happiness and contentment and gratitude are things I [struggle with](http://www.sheristaak.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/quote-struggle-231x300.jpg) every.  Single.  DAY.  I have certainly grown in this area and things are better than they were but this is hard work for me.  There are lots of things I haven't accepted and there are things I don't WANT to accept.  [But I try.](http://www.wordsonimages.com/pics/189963-Acceptance+quotes+best+posit.jpg)  And I am willing to keep at it.  I'm learning that just because I gave up drinking my life is not going to be a rainbow covered lollipop field in the sunshine.  And that's where my real growth is coming.  Now that I have put down the glass I get the opportunity to learn how to live life and deal with all of life's bullshit.  For me this whole thing isn't JUST about getting dry - it's about [finding myself](http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7h66ft7YM1rb3t22o1_500.jpg) and living a sober life through all of the ups and downs.  And yes it's hard and can be scary and intimidating and crazy - but it is also really rewarding for me and everyone around me.  What makes me happiest these days is knowing that I am doing my best to live a good life as a good productive person.  And it's worth doing [every single day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty31QY5ZGHo)  ..Have an awesome day all!

&gt;Happiness can only be achieved by looking inward..true.  I think happiness is a decision. 
The only thing I had to change was everything. Happy Saturday!
