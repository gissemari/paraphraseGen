Today was just really hard. I've been having trouble sleeping recently and when I do manage to get to sleep I end up dreaming about alcohol. I haven't relapsed in any way but man I could use a drink. One month and 11 days sober and the booze is still all I can think about. I know it's better that I don't drink but this is really quite hard.

It is hard. Sounds like you're making it though. A month and a half is no small feat. The thoughts and dreams will relent. No storm lasts forever. 
Sorry you're having a tough day. I know it's hard to keep going when you're feeling bleak. Keep it up though. It'll get better. IWNDWYT
The trouble sleeping and the drinking dreams really suck don't they?..It does get better though almost everything about early sobriety is temporary.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I think about alcohol - they are well worth a look.....Hang in there!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
