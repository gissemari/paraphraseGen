I know there will always be another "last" bottle of wine (or whatever drink) but I struggle endlessly with the idea of never drinking my favorite wines again. ..Also I did sample some wine earlier (many hours ago--I am not under the influence right now) so I feel that much more entitled to open this bottle since today is already ruined as a non-drinking day.  (Need to reset my counter again.)  Just posting this to get it off my chest.  Thanks for reading.

For the record I technically drank on my Day One. Two mimosas in the morning...I started the clock at noon.
Any moment is a good moment to stop; that day or for the rest of the day..."One day I splurged on a big coffee so I already broke by budget so fuck it I spend the rest of my money that day".."I already ate a donut so my diet is done; might as well eat some ice cream pizza fries and chips"..See the logic? :)..&gt; I struggle endlessly with the idea of never drinking my favorite wines again..That held me back too. Until I came here wondered how people were doing this thing and they were not drinking *today*..So [I went it it for today](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6vzpb3/i_can_only_look_so_far_ahead_today_i_wont_drink/):.."*I don't know how to do this. I don't know. I don't know what I'm aiming for if I'll never drink again or whatever.*..*I just know that today I won't be drinking. This is a new day a day where I don't drink.*"..Me I would pour out that bottle. The sooner you stop drinking the sooner it becomes easy
It's all just Ethanol dressed up in a fancy bottle and it's not likely to go off if you don't drink it immediately!..In fact since Ethanol is a flammable toxic solvent fuel additive and disinfectant as well as being an addictive psychoactive drug and is a Group 1 Carcinogen in the same class as Asbestos Formaldehyde and Plutonium I'd say it's probably safer to leave it in the bottle than to drink it on the whole.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look as they made it much easier to stop and stay stopped without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing out on anything!..The world isn't likely to run out of booze any time soon so it will always be there if I suddenly throw all rational thought out of the window and decide to go back to it.....Just for today I dodged the first drink and have done that for a few days in a row now... I'll probably do the same again tomorrow.....Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I know that exact feeling and way of thinking. In fact in my experience if you have a  last drink' it never is the last. I just wanted to put out an anology in regards to you feeling like you've ruined your intentions for the day;..If you got a flat tire while driving you wouldn't abandon your attempt to get to that destination and then flatten the other 3 tires just because you might as well since 1 is flat.  ..I often think of this when I'm ready for submitting to defeat over the smallest setback...Good luck :) IWNDWYT
As I sat there on my day 1 I realized something.. there could potentially be one last day every single day.  And that's exactly how a cycle perpetuates itself.  In fact however jumping out of the cycle is pretty liberating!  IWNDWYT
