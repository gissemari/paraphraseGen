Old patterns that provided comfort are hard wired into our brains. The insidious nature of this disease is that our brains aren't telling us the truth anymore. I am sorry that you are going through this friend. Keep taking good care of yourself. I won't be drinking with you today!
Try going for a run or a walk if you muster up the energy. It's hard sometimes I know but you can do it! 
Sometimes I try and zone out by watching a movie or binge watching tv shows. Just to distract my mind.
Hobbies are good.  I did a ton of baking.  What do you like to do?
If I'm feeling really incapacitated I try and do small "menial" tasks I've been avoiding. Like cleaning online shopping paying bills etc. This makes me at least feel productive. like I'm being of some use to my future self that will want to go out not do these chores. 
Audiobooks. I turn of the light put on my headphones and disappear into the world of the book. 
Podcasts are a huge help for me. They make me feel less alone but require no energy or effort for me to listen to. You can be doing other things while you listen too.
