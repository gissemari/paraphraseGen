Today is day 450. I've been getting a bit lazy with my spiritual/physical maintenance. Early on I was meditating and working out every day. I haven't done either in a month or two and I think it's making me feel stressed and depressed. I also do comedy so I am constantly hanging at bars and while I've powered through and stayed sober it's hard to not feel lame sometimes. BUT none of this is to say my life has gotten worse. My life has gotten exponentially better since getting sober. I'm working my ass off on my goals and I just need to refocus and keep it moving. I hope all of you are doing well out there and staying sober.

I read this and now know in my heart that i have to run my two miles tonight. .Sometimes we gotta show up even when we dont want to. .I hope you find the strength to meditate do breathing exercises or run tonight. .I know i need to for sobriety sake..I feel like a trillion after my runs..IWNDWYT!!!
I'm also at 300 days and I can honestly say these last 60 have been almost as hard as the first 60.  I'm at the point where quitting drinking was a decision that I made that I'm sticking to.  It used to be quitting drinking was something I needed to do.  I feel I will always struggle with the idea of starting again. ..&amp;#x200B;..You're not a alone.  I won't be drinking with  you today.
Hey great work despite the struggles!
