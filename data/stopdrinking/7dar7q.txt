I haven't had a drink since August 2016 and every day I still have the desire to drink. I don't know if this is ever going to change. It's gotten so bad as of late that  I've even been dreaming about drinking. I won't relapse because drinking while on the medication I'm on would probably kill me so that's a pretty good motivator but it's practically torture some days. Has anyone else had this problem?

Yes...It ebbs and flows. But yes. Just keep playing the tape all the way through. Relapse is a huge part of my story. It's not worth it.  Cravings suck. I have no easy answer for you. I'm kind of in the same spot right now. 
I'd love to hear how people answer this... especially those with multiple years of sobriety. I quit in June 2017 and had some stretches without much care for drinking. It got harder and caught me off guard. The coming holidays really seem to bring out the cravelings. I'm reading This Naked Mind for the third time. It's helping. And I know drinking hurts more than craving so there's that. Stay strong!
I found that the rate of change respecting the "desire to drink" was inversely proportional to "amount of work in my program"...Eventually the "desire to drink" has been extinguished...I. Am. Free !..Got a program?
