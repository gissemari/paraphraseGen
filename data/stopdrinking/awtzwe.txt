Hi all. This is my first post here. Today is my day 1 in making better life choices. While alcohol has not been a daily struggle for me knowing my limits when I did drink clearly has been one. Until recently I thought that this was purely self harm (not that that's ok either). Luckily a friend of mine made me aware yesterday of the damage it's causing to our and many other relationship. I essentially spent all day yesterday feeling extremely guilty about myself. I love my friends dearly and knowing that I have hurt any of them is enough for me to make a change. ..So I've committed to this change and plan to stick with it. The part I'm struggling with most right now is this constant feeling of guilt. I want to make things right and it's hurting a lot to know it's not an overnight solution. ..Any tips for holding yourself responsible for stopping but also not having it be all that you can think about and obsessing over the past. ..Thanks everyone for your inspiration.

If you look over the 12 steps in many programs you notice step #9 to make amends. First you need to forgive yourself. Take a look at the 12 steps  you may consider working them in order the way they are writing. ..IWNDWYT.......
For me the main relationship I hurt is with my husband. The biggest part of rebuilding has been him seeing me stay sober repeatedly over time. He was sick of me saying sorry or anything else. He needed to see actual change.  When bad thoughts of the past come up I try to just acknowledge the thought. "Yes I did that while drunk in the past". Then I remind myself I don't have to do that again. We can't change the past but we can be sober today and create a better future.
