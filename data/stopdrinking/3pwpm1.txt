There is a drink in front of me tempting me like a siren. And I'm afraid I'm weak and going to give in and I need to reach out right now before I make a terrible decision...My background:..So I got sober on March 3rd. A few days later I went to rehab in Orange County which is basically a rehab and recovery mecca. ..I went through the grueling process of the militaristic boot camp-esque primary phase of intensive outpatient treatment for a month and a half. And after that I stayed in that rehab's sober living network for a little over five and a half more months where I still regularly attended aa/na/ca/ha meetings and went to the rehab's center for group programming...I moved back home about a month ago and now that whole safety net is gone. I have no friends in my home area and a multitude of friends back in Orange County. Fortunately It's only an hour and a half's drive to visit there and I can still attend the center's programming whenever I want...But in this past month I've been languishing. I lost my 'get well' temp job in OC and decided it was time to move home. And now that I'm here I'm just doing nothing. I'm sinking into a slow rut of depression and inaction...I was going to the gym daily working assiduously and inspiring other people to work out with me. It became the fruit-bearing endeavor in my life that kept me stable and gave me the energy to do other productive things in my life...But I haven't been to a gym once since I got back. I can feel the slow atrophy working its way on my body and sapping the energy and life force from my mind...I've been dealing with cravings lately. They've gotten really bad. They haven't been like this at all since I first went to rehab...I went to the store an hour ago and bought a bottle of vodka. There is a glass right in front of me. Fuck. fuck fuck fuck.. .Help me. Encourage me. Anything. I thought I was so strong so resilient. I felt like a sobriety juggernaut. And now I'm going to be one of those fucking people that throws it all away the pride of an unblemished string of uninterrupted sobriety. I was so proud of myself for being one of the very few people that didn't relapse in my rehab one of the few that stuck it out and stayed sober. I associated myself with the winners the people who really wanted it and I tried my best to help the people who were still lost and struggling and at a different point in their journey towards sobriety. ..I've now been to hundreds of aa-style meetings and yet I'm here on the brink of relapsing. Some of my friends have relapsed and almost died. Some have actually died. My mom went to rehab 13 years ago and has been sober ever since. I thought I had her resiliency. Maybe I do? God the idea of flushing it all away seems so....... gah. I've almost died so many times because of it and yet like a moth drawn to a light I'm back in front of this malevolent beverage and on the precipice of falling under its ruinous thrall once again...Am I so weak that I'm going to throw it all away? Is drinking a little bit even throwing it all away? Should I loosen up the paradigm of aa-style time counting? Am I an asshole for getting to this point when my family paid so so much money to help me get well? Am I letting them down?..Fuck dude.

If you want to continue associating yourself with the winners you're going to have to overcome adversity.  Go out for a walk and when you get back dump that vodka out.  ..Just yesterday on one of my walks I almost started to veer toward my local liquor store for some vodka.  But my sobriety means a lot to me so I fought it and overrode that instinct to buy alcohol and stuck to my walk instead.  ..I'll be going out for another walk in a few minutes and I'll once again pass right by that liquor store but there's no way in hell I'm going in there.  It's a daily struggle but I'll be damned if I give in like I always have. ..And you know how it feels.  Addiction is a powerful thing but it doesn't own you.  Don't drink.  You got this!  ..
**Pour it out.  Now.  yes right fucking now.**..The rabbit hole is full of snakes - you've been there you know that...Now posting from the I.  I was there in the beginning.  I gave in and as they say in AA my misery was refunded...You know what to do - reach out to other alcoholics as your post shows.  Do it in real life too find someone to go to the gym with you - maybe even a meeting ( I know I needed them)  I can tell you sitting with my thumb up my ass and a bottle in my mouth was a pretty fucking sorry-assed existence   you can do better....
Hey I've been there just me and the drink.  You OWN the vodka the vodka doesn't OWN you...As Slipacre says **Pour it out. Now. yes right fucking now!!!!**  I would get out of whatever environment your in go take a walk or something.  ..Update us what have you decided...We're with you; you can be a Sober Juggernaut
Speaking from the I: **I would pour it out**...Also speaking from the I:  **I hope you do too**...Finally: **I would speak to your mom sounds like she's super supportive and knows what it's like. Not because you owe it to her for anything financial or otherwise but because you owe it to yourself to do anything not to drink right now.**..I wish you the best.
I am in costa mesa - drive over and we'll get breakfast. - I'll PM you - (phone number deleted thanks guys.)
&gt;Am I an asshole for getting to this point when my family paid so so much money to help me get well? Am I letting them down?  ..In my own experience  I think the voice that says this - an inner critic ruled by fear - might have good intentions (i.e. these critical words are supposed to 'whip me into shape' towards good outcomes) BUT in reality the fear and shame and self-doubt just make me want to obliterate all feeling to stop the discomfort.  You're not weak you're trying to deal with a tough situation.  **BUT make no mistake having a drink will only quiet that voice for a brief brief period and it will come back louder than ever.**  My advice is to pour the drink out and reach out for some assistance.  You've done a good thing by posting here; keep it up.
The fact that you're reaching out says a lot. Seems to me that you don't want the drink. Otherwise you would've taken the drink without a second thought. I'd pour it out and call someone. Just my $.02

I wanted to be strong and resilient too. But I'm actually kind of weak and brittle. Little things still shake me up deep inside. Sometimes I am chugging along feeling like everything's great then something happens and suddenly I'm made of jello and I don't know what to do or what's going to happen...I think it's okay to feel that way (helpless not-strong panicking). Sometimes my emotions seem so big an overwhelming it's like I completely lose perspective and I'm looking at the world through a fun-house mirror. When I feel that way it always helps to talk to someone and verbalize all the things I'm feeling (as much as I'm able to). Putting things into words and have someone else listen somehow helps me feel like I don't need to *escape* the panic I feel. I remember that it has a beginning and an end and tomorrow I'll have forgotten about it and it will be a completely new day with a new emotional weather report.
I am not going to drink TODAY even if you do.  I am not going to drink TODAY even if (someone I idolize like) /u/Slipacre decided to drink (which I'm pretty sure ain't going to happen).  If I make a decision not to drink TODAY a bottle of vodka and a glass have no meaning for me.  In other words for me to resist a ridiculous temptation even one of my own creation--I have to make a decision not to drink TODAY only--and doggedly persist in MY commitment.
I ran into this situation when I was cleaning out the house and I found a bottle I had hidden. I was shaking so bad. I actually just threw the bottle outside and then called my spouse and asked him to dispose of it when he returned home. This isn't the same as your experience but when I was in another different but similar situation I poured it out in the bathtub. Why the bathtub and not the toilet or the sink? I have no idea. I then found out that it stunk like alcohol so I had to burn incense so I wouldn't smell it.
