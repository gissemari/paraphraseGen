Hey everyone this is my first post here. But I live in a city where alcohol and bars are a pretty big chunk of the local economy. Hell I work making whiskey and get it for free but I really wanna stop for a while. I had a coworker die from health complications related to alcohol recently. But I am writing this post to tell you guys (and myself) that after today I'm gonna cut myself of for good because alcohol sucks.

Welcome aboard.  I still haven't regretted my decision to stop.  Freedom is the only word to describe what my life is now
I completely understand. I've made the decision Sunday that I can no longer drink anymore as it only creates more and more problems for me and I don't like the person I've become.  It very hard as we live in a small town and are constantly drinking every weekend- in fact in the past 8 years of living here I think there has maybe been a handful of weekends we didn't drink.  I'm scared to how our friends are going to react and their level of support but regardless I need to do this for me! 
Welcome! Quitting was one of the best decisions I ever made. I imagine you will say the same thing in a year. Stick around and enjoy the benefits! 
Welcome to the club we all have Drinking issues hangovers suck and IWNDWYT or tomorrow.
