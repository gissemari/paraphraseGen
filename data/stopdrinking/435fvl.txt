Nervous as fuck about it. Afraid that when I get to the airport early I will want a drink. Flying freaks me out a bit and I usually fly with some liquid courage. All I keep thinking is "if I have just one beer i can be fine." And that's a sad mentality to have. I'm still struggling with thoughts of "maybe I can drink in moderation" which I haven't tried yet and this flight is making me really think that.

I'm flying tomorrow (a long-ass international flight too) and I'm having the same concern. 
I went to Thailand last June by myself and didn't drink a drop on the flights or even in Thailand was awesome!. You can do it! 
I did this last week. It was ok. But I enjoyed being better hydrated when I landed and not having to worry about the drive home from the airport. And not being as exhausted from travel as I used to be. It turned out ok! Good luck on your trip.
Me too I'm getting ready to fly next week and I hate flying.  Probably cause I'm not in control.  I've never been able to sit on a plane and not freak out every time we hit an air bump or some turbulence starts getting us.  I'm worried too man.  I'm gonna try and bring as many distractions for myself as possible...and tons of candy.
I flew 11 hours today and got to my destination feeling sooo much better than I used to feel when I'd have a few drinks onboard. Highly recommend bringing some herbal tea bags in case they don't have any. Any of course lots of sparkling water the elixir of the gods. Good luck you got this!
