Made it 8 days and went out with an old friend to drink (posted about it last night). Tried to not go but I ordered a drink anyway... I tried to compose myself by doing something else but I gave in. I hate it so much... I want to be better and I want to keep this going. I'm trying to think of this as a hiccup in my recovery. This is the first time I've tried extremely hard to be better. It's very difficult and I'm struggling. I thought about drinking all day yesterday then my friend invited me out and it kind of set it off. I'm not sure where to go from here. I still have the thought of getting better and I'm going to the gym in a few minutes but it has been rough...This badge puts a lot of pressure on me and I can't decide if it's a good thing or not.

It sounds like you may have to put yourself in a situation where drinking is easily accessible at least for the very early stage of your sobriety. .For the first couple weeks I quit I basically isolated myself from friends and family where there would be alcohol present and it helped. 
Have you talked with your friends about your newfound attempts at sobriety?
Dry people and dry places in early sobriety.  It is a premise that works extremely well.
I didn't start to get better until I got a team of people on my side
This kind of thing can be a necessary part of recovery. Through trial and error we realize how we would become naturally happier without anesthetizing ourselves. Be proud of your 8 days those really are the hardest. Good job! ..It is rarely a bad thing to do what makes you happy. But you have to decide for yourself whether or not drinking actually makes you happy.
