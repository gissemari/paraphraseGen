I am moving through a transitional phase in life. I just turned thirty and am extremely happy I quit drinking when I did. I am much more confident in my health and hope my previous decisions have not hindered my health in a serious way. ..I struggle every day with the fact that I want to have another drink. I don't really want a drink but I want to be part of the party. The social gathering aspect of stopping drinking is the hardest part of the task. I have to remind myself I can still have a good time completely sober...I live in Austin Texas and it is a city of drunks. I work at a place where people come in at 9 a.m. and start drinking literal buckets of alcohol. Working there helps cement my decision to stay away from the devil's nectar due to the stupidity I witness daily. People vomit all over the restrooms and they get obnoxiously drunk then choose to drive...I don't miss waking up hungover. I don't miss worrying about how I am going to get home. I miss having a BBQ and drinking a beer with my dad. I miss going out with coworkers after a rough shift and pounding shots. I have that battle often and I like to win...I am currently looking to improve my status in society by looking for a new job. I have a B.B.A. lots of experience a marginally acceptable personality and am a quick learner. However couple job hunting with depression and you're looking at a difficult mountain to conquer. Every day I wake up happy I have been blessed with another day. Life would be boring if it were a cakewalk...Things weren't just given to me. I've had to work very hard for most things in my life and my sobriety is the best return I could ask for...I will not drink today.

I am so happy for you congratulations on this mile marker.
Congratulations on 1200 Days and turning 30.  I was so glad to be over that 20's shit.  ..Are you involved in any types of meetings or ongoing types of support?  You mentioned depression is this clinically diagnosed or do you just feel like crap most of the times?  Sometimes depression goes in waves and it will go away on it's own...Best of luck in your job search...
