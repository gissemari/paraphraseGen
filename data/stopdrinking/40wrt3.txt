Happy Thursday sobernauts!..Thankful Thursdays is a weekly thread here where we can focus and reflect on what we are thankful for. I'll include something on thankfulness and invite you to take a moment to reflect on what you are grateful for **today**...---..**Thankful Poem**...>*Be thankful that you don't already have everything you desire.*..>*If you did what would there be to look forward to?*..>*..>*Be thankful when you don't know something*..>*for it gives you the opportunity to learn.*..>*..>*Be thankful for the difficult times.*..>*During those times you grow.*..>*..>*Be thankful for your limitations*..>*because they give you opportunities for improvement.*..>*..>*Be thankful for each new challenge*..>*because it will build your strength and character.*..>*..>*Be thankful for your mistakes.*..>*They will teach you valuable lessons.*..>*..>*Be thankful when you're tired and weary*..>*because it means you've made a difference.*..>*..>*It's easy to be thankful for the good things.*..>*A life of rich fulfillment comes to those who*..>*are also thankful for the setbacks.*..>*..>*Gratitude can turn a negative into a positive.*..>*Find a way to be thankful for your troubles*..>*and they can become your blessings.*...~Author Unknown..---..I get so much from this poem it reminds me of the power of gratitude in transforming my outlook from negative to positive from lack to abundance. ..Just because I am sober doesn't mean that life will always be easy that I won't find challenges nor that I'll have things exactly how I want them. What's important is I don't dwell on what I don't have or what I've done wrong; instead I focus on what I do have and what I am discovering. I can choose to see things differently choose to acknowlegde my achievements choose to recognize my growth choose to appreciate everything in my life today and become open to learning. I can step back from writing off something as "bad" - I look to what I  can be thankful for and just keep stepping forwards as best I can...I am so grateful to this sub it helps with my perspectives and each day brings fresh insights: each story each struggle each journey matters. To see the community support each other along our paths is a wonderful thing to witness...---..**So sobernauts**..**What are you thankful for TODAY?** 
----------immediate responses--------

Today I'm thankful for my friends they're always there for me even when I'm not at my best and being a jerk. I'm also thankful for all of my extended friends here on SD it's awesome to know we're all in this together. ..Hope everyone has a great Thursday!
Today I am thankful for my marriage. We've been through some really tough times but my husband and I just 'graduated' from counselling with much better communication skills a 1000 time stronger marriage and a commitment to continue to communicate and not let things get bad again. 
I'm in the throes of nicotine withdrawal today and man it *sucks*. I've been so agitated irritable downright foul for large parts of the day...But I'm just so grateful for these chances to improve myself and my life even though I don't always feel I deserve them. I'm so grateful to my body for tolerating my shit for so long and still doing its best to eliminate this crap from me (let's get on with this body I was ready for nicotine to be gone yesterday). And I'm grateful for the incredible people who have stood by me when I haven't been at my best...And now I'm crying man addictions are so powerful and so strange and I might just go back to bed
I'm thankful that I have finally come to the realization that I'm an alcoholic and that I am now seeking help. Including joining r/stopdrinking
I'm thankful for the love and support of my husband he is on this SD life journey with me..For my children who are thankful for sober mom it feels good . Last thankful for SD helping me get through the day to day struggle 
I'm thankful for my job. I love teaching. The classroom is my sanctuary--a place where I forget myself and it's all about the interaction with students the exploration of fields of knowledge of ever-shifting ideas and arguments.
As always this morning I am thankful to be alive and sober...I'm also thankful for my yoga practice. Yesterday was one of those breakthrough days mentally and physically. It sparked a long wandering and joyous late-night conversation with my wife.
Today I am thankful for technology. The world has changed/evolved so much in the 42 years I've been alive it's been incredible to watch and be a part of. The fact that a place like SD exists and we are writing the framework for a new type of recovery community that couldn't exist without technology is pretty cool. ..What a time to be alive!
I'm thankful that most of my problems are first world problems. I have shelter abundance of good food money means of living lavishly compared to those in developing countries...Yes I have my own problems that I face every single day and I consider them serious and threatening. But I never have to avoid saying bad things about my country/leaders in fear of getting beheaded or worry about sending my daughter out on streets because I don't have food on my table...I live in a world where half of the people more than 3 billion   live on less than $2.50 a day and I managed to win the buttered side of the bread through pure luck...Thank fuck.
Today I am thankful for all of my fellow sobernauts. I drank Tuesday night and was in a really terrible mental place when I posted here yesterday. All of the responses on my post were so kind.... They truly helped me keep a one night relapse from spiraling into something much worse. So thank you all SD.
I LOVE THIS POEM..I am thankful for my husband his support and how is he stuck with me when I thought we weren't worth it/I wasn't worth it/dealing with my crazy ass. He is amazing and I don't know if I deserve him but I sooo grateful to have him. .I am thankful for all the crazy things I witnessed while I was in inpatient. I know how strong I am and that I can get through almost anything as long as I stick to it..I am thankful for all the pain and shitty feelings I had while detoxing because I can reflect back on that and know I don't want to EVER do that again..I am thankful for SD without you all I do not know how my first 2 weeks would have gone. I feel at home comforted challenged to think more into things inspired to be a better person and the opportunity to help others...High five!
I'm thankful to be alive on this beautiful morning in Bucks County PA.I am grateful for the ability to plan the day ahead and feel fairly confident that it will unfold as planed. To know it will be alcohol free is a blessing also.  I'm thankful for this forum to see other blessings. I'm inspired and spirited to begin the day.  Thank you
I'm thankful that the therapist I just started seeing seems to genuinely want to help me feel better. I usually feel like I'm just a patient and an income to them. 
I'm thankful that I have the support of my friends in AA.  I'm thankful that even though I am going through a rough time in my life- my Higher Power is with me.  
I'm thankful for God aka flying spaghetti monster. I'm thankful for my family. I'm thankful for new beginnings. I'm especially thankful for a $10 an hour raise that I just got! Even more thankful that I'm finally prioritizing other aspects of life over work. Thankful for food and warmth. Most thankful that I am learning to be my best friend as opposed to my biggest enemy. And thankful that I have your support!
I'm thankful for this giant report I am writing (it is for a training program that I have wanted to attend since beginning my career). I have been dreading it a lot lately  but this thread reminded me to appreciate struggle. Most things worthwhile are hard  and I am very grateful to have this opportunity. 
I am thankful for finding the SD community.  I am grateful to be healthy.
I am so grateful for /u/j_light for meeting me at my very first AA meeting last night. I was terrified and almost didn't show but I kept putting one foot in front of the other and walked through that door knowing that someone from SD would be there. her kindness and encouragement kept me focused and accountable. she gave me a huge hug afterward (and permission to go home and cry a lot!).  thank you j_light!!! see you next week. 
I'm thankful I'm sober and forced myself to clear the air with my bosses on an issue that happened in August. I'm thankful for having courage today and speaking from the heart when it's hard for me to be honest with superiors and let them know their actions hurt me. I drank over this event so many times in the past months last year and now I'm free and I don't have to think about it anymore. I'm getting myself back. I'm crying my eyes out in the middle of the work day but with a grateful heart. I deserve to be honest and be myself and be sober.
I am thankful for recognizing that I want to live better....that I deserve better.
I have been going through some medical stuff again. And I was thinking today (After reading the daily budda)  about how much easier it is when doing this alone than when I had to take care of another while I was going through the shit last time. Emotional care taking is fucking exhausting and having the space to just take care of myself is a blessing. I'm going to be okay. 
I'm grateful that the apartment is quiet enough to hear my son sing nonsense songs to himself while digging in the bottomless bucket of legos looking for darth vader's head and that he wont grow up to be the adult child of an alcoholic.  
I love thankful Thursday because I'm usually a cynical person and I'm so happy to see this trait fade away. I'm thankful for sobriety being alive having a job running a loving boyfriend and being able to go to school. 
I am thankful that it seems to be a little easier to handle my work.  I have had a fairly busy week so far with some meetings and big calls that in the recent past would have had me in knots; and of course drinking more to deal with that anxiety.  The work was still a little stressful but it just seemed easier somehow.  For that I am grateful.
I'm grateful that I'm tired because it signifies I have the opportunity to care for my mom and make her feel loved. I'm grateful she is doing so well in the face of breast cancer. I'm grateful I have a strong healthy body that will take me for a run as a healthy coping method for stress. And I am grateful for the lovely people on this sub!
/u/Finally_woken thank you for posting. ..&gt; Be thankful that you don't already have everything you desire.   .If you did what would there be to look forward to?..I have this feeling with any large sum of lottery money - especially the latest Powerball. There's no need for that nonsense. It would be nice the first year (if you made it alive) but it gets tiring no?..&gt; Be thankful for the difficult times. During those times you grow...It makes me appreciate showers a roof over my head a refrigerator that will not freeze my food! ..&gt; Be thankful for your limitations because they give you opportunities for improvement...My limitations on my first day of car living - I froze at 32F. Now I can get down to -9F and I'm working on the day-to-day living better. The biggest challenge is -20F this weekend. ..&gt; Be thankful for each new challenge.because it will build your strength and character...Indeed...I am thankful for libraries professors /u/bigndfan175 and Saturday morning coffee folks over on the IRC chat window and so forth.
A little late to the party but I'm so thankful to have had another sober day off. My flat is clean and tidy my cats have been walked I went and bought milk I learnt something new on piano I started a new book. Old me spent my days off trying to snooze off a hangover or drinking myself in to oblivion. It has been a cold but beautiful day and I'm grateful to be in a place where I can enjoy it being productive and positive.

I'm grateful for my sobriety and my sponsor.  This is the longest I've gone without drinking in a very very long time.
Today (just barely today) as I was running and my back hurt each step I thought to myself that all my aches and pains that I feel on a daily basis (they just seem to take turns as to which pain is the greater) help me feel gratitude for so many small things. Kinda like when Francis Bacon said: "In order for the light to shine so brightly the darkness must be present." So in a weird way I'm thankful for my pain.
