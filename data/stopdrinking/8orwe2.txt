So I for sure don't miss this anxiety shit.  It was completely gone after six months. Now I feel like I'm starting over again with my mental strength. This relapse has been really hard.  I will not drink with you today.

Try taking a walk meditation play music loud clean play a game... anything that can get your mind focused on anything but anxious thoughts..Hang in there.
Daily meditation has been so incredibly important in my recovery. It has had a profound effect on my mood and anxiety. I wish I had started sooner.
Hang in there. IWNDWYT 
Can you do some cardio? Even if it's just vigorous dancing in your house/apt. For me this can soothe anxiety quite a bit. Or I listen to / watch something that makes me laugh out loud - you get the deep breathing that way. Or just plain old deep breathing of course if that's all ya got. IWNDWYT. Anxiety please leave this person alone will ya??
Thank you everyone for your kinda words!
