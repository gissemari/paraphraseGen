Made it six months but had a cancer scare out of nowhere. Have to go in for a colonoscopy in two weeks. I immediately freaked the fuck out and started having extreme anxiety. It was too much for me. I couldn't deal with it and I drank. ..I am very scared right now...

Everything will be okay! ..Forgive yourself for relapsing!
Every day is a new chance and a new start!
You have my sympathy and I'm not sure what to tell you but after your relapse did you feel better or worse about your situation?
Dealing with a chance scare is really hard. I cant imagine it. Be kind to yourself and start again. Those six months are not lost. Here's hoping you get a clear bill of health after the tests are done! 
You were sober 180 days out of 181? That's a 99.45% success rate. You've got this! I will not drink with you today.
I have seen a lot of people getting pushed into colonoscopies over the last several years including myself and my uncle. (They actually did two on him and wanted to do another before he said enough is enough).I'm starting to think that this is a way doctors are trying to stay afloat during this healthcare upheaval. This is assuming you're in the US. .My point is odds are crazy good that you're totally fine. And one relapse doesn't undo all the healing your body has done since you quit. .Keep quitting everyday!!
Just think your liver got to heal for 6 months.
Dang.
I can't promise that everything will be okay but I can tell you it will be how it will be. My hope for you is that the process of things playing out isn't too terrible on you; that you get a favorable outcome; and that whether the news is good or bad that you remain resolute in receiving it.
