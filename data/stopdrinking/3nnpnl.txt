*"Yes it's going to be messy. Yes it's going to be worth it"* - at 409 days clean and sober I can relate to Formula 409's marketing message. I have had so many good days lately it is beginning to get a whole lot easier. My wife has commented my children my boss coworkers etc. All of them have made remarks about how different I have become. Some "know" and others don't but the message is the same. At day 409 I have sure cleaned up my mess. Not all of it of course but I am going to keep cleaning. If you are new and struggling... Keep trying. Follow those baby steps. Reach out and ask for help. Yes it's gonna be messy. Yes it's gonna be worth it.

Haha just glad to hear this sobriety cure doesn't include drinking household cleaners. 
Congrats to you.  409 days.  I cant wait till i get there but have a long way to go.  You should be very proud of yourself and way to go!
409 I like it!
So worth it. And things get less messy with every cleaning...Dude you are on a roll tonight with responses!
Congrats on the cool milestone! The marketing message is a perfect match in sobriety...Hey somebody ought to create a list here and figure out how each day has something significant related to it (I'm sure certain numbers have several neat connections). I remember someone once posted on day 404: "alcohol not found" or something hilarious like that. I'll bet that all of us working together could find some interesting and fun connection to just about every number up to around at least 1000. I'm pretty sure /u/Slipacre could find a lot of interesting connections. He likes to do that and is pretty good at it.
