I very much appreciate those that share their achievements and struggles here you have all helped me a great deal in getting where I am today (68 days).  I check in here at least once a day to re-affirm the reasons why I felt so strongly about stopping drinking more than two months ago now.  It is still a struggle but it HAS gotten slightly easier as time passes and so like others here I have begun to question whether or not I really have a problem. Perhaps moderation could work...  I know the answer is no but I am a rational person by nature and so naturally I've tried to rationalize this.  I've found that if I focus on the reasons why I felt so strongly about quitting to begin with staying sober is the only option.  The list is long but I thought I would return the favor to all of you by sharing a few of the key ones here:..1-  I can never take back the regretful things I've said and done while drinking but I can take ownership and prevent them from happening in the future. ..2-   (continuation of 1) I no longer want to use alcohol and intoxication as an excuse for making bad decisions.  I don't want to look myself in the mirror the morning after a bender and say "you wouldn't have done that if you hadn't been drunk".  This is a cop-out and I need to be accountable for my actions...3-   I am an active outdoorsman and I literally hate myself when I waste a weekend being hung over instead of doing the things I love with my friends and family...4-  The obvious and many health concerns which in particular for me are high blood pressure and issues with blood clotting..I've been a heavy drinker for more than half of my life (20 years) but that doesn't mean I have to continue that trend for the next half of my life.  I saw a post here recently that boasted of the 12345 milestone being achieved (12345 days = 33.8 years!).  I forget who specifically posted this but thank you for your inspiration I also want to achieve this goal and beyond.  If I can do this we can all do this!  Thank you SD I will not drink with you today..

Awesome. Congratulations. I am just a little ahead of you in sobriety. My wake up call was my health as well. I have always worked out been very active and my checkups at my drs were usually good.  This year I had elevated cholesterol levels high blood pressure and pain in my liver. This came after a year of every night drinking and my consumption was way up.  Now 11 weeks and 16 lbs lighter all my signs are back to normal. They belly bloat and constant heart burn are gone energy and focus are thru the roof.  And I hardly think of having a drink anymore. Waking up feeling rested without pain has been a huge motivation for me. IWNDWYT!
Oh - I hear you . I relate to the not being able..to go outside part. I remember so many times that I had to..figure out how to cancel plans because I was hung over...I started to plan what excuses I could give to get away from ..responsibilities a day or two in advance. ..I feel so much better already and I can go places today...For sure we can all do this together!..IWNDWYT!!
