Today was day 80 for me and I had a really difficult day ahead. This evening was my husbands work place annual Christmas party. Lots of people lots of conversations fair few people I don't know and an incredible variety of alcohol all of which was a free bar. It had been on my mind all day. Not that I wanted a drink but anxiety around how I would be able to talk to all these people totally sober. I struggle with that a lot. It's a shyness really. It makes me feel very awkward around people. Apparently I don't come across this way it's only me that sees it which is some sort of relief. ..Anyway. I just wanted to celebrate with everyone that I managed to make it through the entire evening without alcohol!!!!! Yay!!!  .. It was my first proper social engagement and I came back out the other side unharmed. I am over the moon about it. Talk about a buzz! ...I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this sub sharing their stories. I've been reading every day since I joined this week. It's really helped me stay on track and it's good to know there are other that can relate to my struggle. I no longer feel so alone in my sobriety and I thank each and every one of you for that. x

Great work! I am 87 days sober and have a friend's wedding coming up on New Years Eve that I have been a bit nervous about. Hearing your story boosts my confidence that I'll have a good time even when sober. 
I totally know how this feels! Enjoy that feeling it's one of the things that keeps me going.
