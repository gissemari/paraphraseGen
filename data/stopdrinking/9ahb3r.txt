The lies we tell our self's is astounding! The alcoholic brain is great at rationalizing why we can still drink and is sometimes relentless at trying. I like the fact that I am a better ( or trying to be) at every thing I do. A lot of the shit storm I was living was a direct consequence of my Alcohol consumption. The winds of change are blowing for you put up your sail for the new journey sobriety brings.

I fought the idea that I shouldn't drink alcohol for quite a while. After reading *Under the Influence* by Ketchum and Milam I finally understood and accepted my alcoholism. At that point I knew I needed lots of help. A therapist rehab and AA gave me the tools to build the sober happy life I have today. I wish the same for you.
