Every time you make an attempt to quit you get stronger and you get closer to winning.  Each time could be the final time.  It took me many tries but it eventually happened i'm sober.  Every effort counts.
If you are fighting you are winning. Wanting to change is the first step!..Pay attention to your moods and fix the underlying problem rather than throwing alcohol at it...IWNDWYT!
Welcome.  Keep reading...What do you want for yourself?
Relapses are very common (I should know!).Don't beat yourself just get up and start again.
I quit 38 times now counting a month or so ago. I finally feel ready to kick it this time. How do you use? Too often too much or both?
Every day sober counts. I've quit twice &amp; am drinking again but very little. I made it 50 days two years ago &amp; 83 days from January-March. I used to live to drink basically but now I live to be productive do things I enjoy &amp; only have 3-4 beers a day after work. I'm trying to control the beast &amp; am doing well with it so far. I find that I don't like to be drunk-a little buzz to take the edge off is fine but not completely out of it. I'm trying to keep my  new  tolerance low which is kinda easy to do bc I know that after 2-3 beers I can't drive &amp; don't like being so out of sorts. So I guess it does get easier with each try. 50 days the first time 83 days the second. Gonna help a friend detox when she's ready. Will likely abstain completely when that happens &amp; I think it's doubtful that I will have withdrawals as I'm drinking so little. We shall see! Don't give up! You can do this. Even a few dry days in a row is good &amp; yes this is a very strange fight indeed. If I start going over the edge I will be back to day one. I like being  present ! Best of luck to you!! You can do this &amp; you are 100% normal. We seem to all have had the same experience.
