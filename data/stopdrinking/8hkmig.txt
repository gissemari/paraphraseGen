I did it! Holy shit I did it. I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far. In this month I have kicked ass at my new job and felt present and ready to go for every moment of it. I've cleaned my house more than I ever have. I adopted a guinea pig that's given me a renewed sense of responsibility and love. I've reconnected with old friends and strengthened my relationships with my loved ones. And most importantly I've learned to be confident without alcohol. Yesterday I got a tattoo to commemorate my new life. But it hasn't been easy and every day is a fight. I think about drinking 24/7 and I have to say no all the time. But it's worth it. This subreddit has helped me so so so much. Hearing all of your amazing stories has made me believe in myself. If you are struggling today remember that you have it in yourself to not drink. Sending love and strength to all of you today. IWNDWYT.

Congratulations !  A month is such a big accomplishment! IWNDWYT 
I want a tattoo as well. No date or whatsoever but for some reason I want one. Is this a side effect of sobriety ?
huge congratulations - go you!
