It has been since last year that I have accomplished such a feat. I feel a bit bittersweet about it because when I compare myself to those who do not struggle to self-medicate one week without drinking is pretty much a normal thing. ..It has taken me quitting a job at the bar avoiding certain friends that are not sympathetic/try to sway me a new diet & exercise routine and daily journaling to get this far in...So far in the last seven days I have lost five pounds made progress of my French studies coped with a tragic family event (ate a whole bag of chips but that's okay!) and generally enjoyed my evenings quiet at home with my SO...A full week without memory loss or drunken emotional breakdowns. Thank you for listening friends. This subreddit has been very good to me so far. :)
