 I've done well in the past. Have quit multiple times and usually once I get rolling I find it easy to keep the sober days coming. I recently made it to around 35 days. Was super excited and then due to life events I allowed myself to sink back into my drinking habit. I believe the farthest I've ever gone was about 50 days. .. I've lurked here for a long time and have always found help in just reading about what others have gone through. I know I have friends willing to help me. Whether I decide to drink or not I know they'll have my back. Yet while I have that knowledge I set myself up by not letting them know I have a problem how serious it is. I am getting better about sharing and have received nothing but support. However it is me that's sabotaging myself. I want to stop once and for all... This community is amazing so supportive and so positive. I've lurked for a long time and most of my sober days were made easier by reading through this sub. I'm going to start my day one again tomorrow/today. It's late I'm tired but I will do this again and this time I won't be afraid to share my struggle with the world. Guess that's why I'm here. You push me and I'll push you. I will not drink with you today.

Similar to me - I roll along and put together chucks of sober time then I get bored or stop doing daily checks on here and am back to square 1. I've realised I've got to check in here daily and continue working on myself every day or I will slip up again . Got to take it day by day .. best of luck
