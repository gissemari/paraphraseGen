Ms. Mario Will She Ever Defeat Bowser?..I look at you and I see me..But then I look back at me and see all my anxiety..So I take the drink and then I'm free..To be who I want to be but in all reality..It's a false reality..I so badly want to choose sobriety..Yet I am a prisoner of my own mind which holds me back from that destiny..Brings me back to questioning a disease..That's most definitely inside of me..A vicious cycle this thing and me..In my heart to gain my wings..I know exactly where to start..I throw my darts tiredly trying to hit that specific target..But at the bar this game I'm playing I give up and I forget..However the next morning on this seemingly never ending bender..I wake up and always remember..My fearfulness is something I have to face..Before and if I ever reach that blissful place..But right now my mind is winning this game..It chooses to erase the truthfulness ..It overrides my heart telling me she's to blame..I run at a fast pace without a trace I'm gone not reaching that ..particular destiny that in all real reality..Is what's meant to be..It was placed inside of me to reach..So first..I have to slowly but surely..Walk back..Scared as hell..And defeat
