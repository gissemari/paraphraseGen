So last Friday (4/7) after 6 days I went out to dinner with my wife and her cousin and new boyfriend. Upon meeting him realized he was an insufferable douche. 63 year old dating a 35 year old and acting like a frat boy. Cringe was strong and I used it as an excuse to get trashed. ..My wife and I spent Sunday through Thursday apart after that night of events I won't get into. I overreacted to a situation and let it get the best of me because I was drunk. I felt weak and upset I sacrificed my hard work and effort because of this fucking guy. That I allowed this guy to be my excuse to drink again and almost end my marriage. ..While she was out of town I cleaned my house did laundry got everything cleaned up and put in place. I had drank Tuesday and Wednesday while doing that. Not sure why. Tuesday I ended up drunk and Wednesday I just had a beer. But looking back on it I wish I wouldn't have. Maybe it was a test for myself maybe a farewell maybe just out of habit. I'm not sure. But those beers were not nearly as satisfying as I thought they would be and I find my sobriety to be more so. ..Last night my wife and I talked again about what happened. I was caught off guard by her response to an additional apology i made that I hadn't thought about and got defensive. But at the end of it we both got everything we needed to say off of our chests. I told her I've thought about us and the many potential outcomes for our relationship including divorce and how my behavior has contributed to all of it. She is still really hurt and hung up on my past transgressions and I can't blame her. I told her I understood and have made peace with the fact we may get divorced some day because of my behavior. There may still be things I've done she can't truly forgive me for or forget. I made this bed and must lay in it but I also said I am moving forward staying positive and sober and she can be with me in the journey or not. I need to and am focusing 100% on being the best version of me right now. And if I can do that everything will take care of itself including our marriage. If it still fails I at least can find comfort in the fact I am giving all of myself to becoming the best person I can be...I have strengthened my resolve beyond what I ever thought was possible thinking and feeling more clearly than I have in years. And in a way I am thankful for this shitty last Friday for being the catalyst. I want to thank everyone here for reading this I know it's long but it's nice to get it out there. I'm grateful to have found all of you and appreciate everyone for the support you give to not just me but everyone struggling with breaking this habit. ..I will not drink with all of you today!

welcome back. and good job using past experiences to take advantage of your future. 
Alcohol being out of the equation you might have a chance to make amends to some of the transgressions you mentioned. We all fuck up. I have fucked up more than I would prefer. The only nice thing is knowing you have the power today to change that. I hope the best for you and also myself who is going through a similar issue.
