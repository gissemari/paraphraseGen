One week! This is the longest I've been sober in probably 7 years. I slipped up last week but before that I had been sober for 3 or 4 days. So out of the last two weeks(ish) I've only drank once. It has been for a very long time the inverse of that...Reading posts here has helped a lot especially the "day by day" mentality posts. So thank you all for that. It's too much to worry about being sober forever. Just be sober today. I went to the corner store for smokes a bit ago and the beer was right there. "Just don't buy it this one time" I said to myself. And here I am writing this no beer. I will cross the next bridge when I come to it...But it is a struggle for me in a way I didn't expect. My moods/emotions are just completely flat. Not up and not down. I'm not stressed. I'm not depressed. I don't feel happy sad angry or much of anything...As a consequence I'm not being as warm to my girlfriend. I don't crack as many jokes at the office. I don't feel like asking about how other people are doing because I can't muster the empathy...Has anyone else undergone a sort of disappearance of emotions/flat mood? I miss my warm loud laughing corny joke cracking magnanimous self..

A shift is mood is almost guaranteed when you stop drinking... give yourself some time. Also congrats on a week. That's huge.
I think its the dopamine pathways dude when youve been blasting your reward centres for years takes some time for them to come back to baseline.
Yes I would give yourself time. ..I am now back to goofy and now it's goofy(squared).
