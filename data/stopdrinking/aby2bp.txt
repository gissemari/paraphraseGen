Hey all I've been lurking for a couple weeks and decided to finally make an intro...I'm 28 and have had substance abuse issues since I was 14. I made my first attempt at long term sobriety when I was 24 (2014). The most recent and longest sober streak I had was sobriety starting December 3 2016 which lasted until late July of 2018. A little over 18 months. I dusted myself off and achieved almost 3 months in the fall of last year but toward the end of the year various stresses and excuses had me going on all kinds of benders...In AA they usually say not to date in your first year of sobriety. So in 2017 I was focused on myself my career my friendships and my sobriety. In 2018 with a year of sobriety I was feeling pretty good about getting out there but I guess I wasn't ready for the uncertainty of the dating world. Between rejections bad dates bad relationships and the complications it all made with other friendships in my life my sober practices took a sideline. Now I finally understand why there's the unwritten rule of no dating in early sobriety. Dating can get messy and was certainly a major contributing factor to my relapses...Luckily I don't feel that all is lost. I learned a lot in the 18 months I managed to live sober. Cravings are stronger than before but hopefully subsiding now that I'm a couple weeks in. I recognize a number of resentments that I've let fester and grow. There are a lot of areas in my life where I was starting to get lazy again and that complacency eventually manifests in utter chaos. It's kind of amazing how that works. It's like the chaos slowly builds up under the surface while I try to ignore it and when I finally look at it it's this terrible three headed monster...I still have a good career good friends and a lot of tools to help me overcome this. I'd like to add this subreddit as one more tool for me even easier than picking up the phone to call someone although certainly no replacement for help from people I know personally...Let's get through one more day and take back the peace and joy that substance abuse robs from us.
