I don't know how to make friends as an adult. I lost friends after I quit drinking. Now I just do nothing in the evenings. I used to even socialize more online and now I'm just lonely. Being sober has been hard and I'm struggling without having that fake drunk confidence and late nights out.

Being a server really helped me come out of my shell. These days I work in IT but have actually been considering picking up shifts just to practice my social skills...Maybe you need a new job? people often befriend coworkers. And there are plenty of videos on YouTube that can help in this. There are men's support groups as well...God speed my dude. 
Are there are any volunteering opportunities around you that you think you could enjoy? Do you have any hobbies outside of work that you could new people in? For example I am part of a hiking club that puts socials on some people go to more of the socials than they do the hikes! There is a website called 'Meet Up' here. I'm not advocating it as I've never used but maybe you could try something like that? Even going to the same gym class every week you can start talking to some of the other people who go regularly. ..Well done on 252 days. 
Are you religious at all? If so maybe try going to.a place of worship regularly? They are usually less focused on alcohol than other social events. 
I joined a gym (crossfit) a few years ago.  Through that I have met a ton of people that LOVE to do things without alcohol!  We go rock climbing mountain biking coffee meetups we even organized a weekend hiking trip last year!  We are all awkward and goofy but it's great!  
AA. It was the only way for me. And I am very awkward.
100 percent how I am feeling as well this is tough but I am seeing how great this is here and hopefully can find lifetime friends. Hang in there I and all are here.
