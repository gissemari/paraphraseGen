1. Escaping my addiction was a complete and total relief. Being able to release and confess that I had a problem to close loved ones was a big weight off my shoulders from the start. I just finally said to myself I had enough - and MEANT IT. I try to revisit this feeling as much as I can because it's the cornerstone of my recovery. Reminding myself of that dark place and the freedom that ensued is so liberating. ..2. Throw everything at your disposal to beat this. I voluntarily admitted myself to an intensive outpatient program regularly attended AA meetings got a sponsor etc. I went in every meeting with an open mind used the numbers and shared as much as I .could. I gave up a shit ton of my time privacy and ego to attend IOP and AA. Worth. Every. Second.  ..3. The feels oh the feels. Emotions come alive again and they are not easy to deal with. I had been masking them for so long with alcohol that they all felt new. I'm still learning how to deal with these but I keep my expectations in check because this is a life-long process. Using your numbers early in recovery can help dissect these feelings and give you a better perspective. It worked/works for me. ..4. My humility. I made it 5 days? Good for you. I made it 15 days? Get my chip at 30 days? - don't expect a fucking parade waiting for me outside. This is a deeply personal journey where I can't keep patting myself on the back because I shouldn't be here in the first place. After receiving my 30 day chip - I sat alone at the dinner table sober and quiet pondering the past 30 days. Exactly as I should have.  ..5. I had no cards in the deck. I refer to this when I'm confronted by a loved one about my dishonesty in the past. I faced some speculation on whether I was sober at times during the past 50 days. All I could do was sit there and take it because of my track record. I learned to not get upset and let THEM deal with rebuilding the trust. All I can do now is consistently be consistent...6. I was honest with myself my actions my emotions and my past on a brutal level. I know what triggers me and I know what I can and cannot do. Don't fucking do it and you won't be in a situation where a drink seems like a good idea. I also reminded myself that even ONE was not okay. I read a lot now spend a shit ton of time in /r/muticopter and other things to keep from idle hands.  ..7. I couldn't compare myself to anyone. Someone else had 3 DUI's? Killed someone? Lost their entire fortunes and family? Has nothing to do with my situation. I continually struggle with this because of the high functioning alcoholic that I was. Addiction is addiction - the others just had a different life path. ..8. God it feels great to be sober and I just want to spread the happiness I feel. I try to help others early recovering alcoholics as much as I can without getting over my head. I know my limitations and never give advice - I speak only from experience. Those of you early in recovery - just try to keep in mind this journey gets better gets hard gets better gets hard. But the end result will astound you.
