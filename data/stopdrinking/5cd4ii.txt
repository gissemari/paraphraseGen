I have a history of depression and recently got out of treatment I've been in for 8 months from suicidal tendencies. During the time leading up to my hospitalization I would commonly use alcohol and drugs to cope with the day to day shit life throws at you. I've been clean from weed for over a year now and I've drank occasionally since discharge. However I think that I am reaching the crux of my life. ..I have stolen alcohol from my parents but I never get to the "hungover and fucked" part. Sadly this causes my desire to drink to go up along with my apathy towards life. I have tried drinking cough syrup knowing that I would get liver damage before I got any type of high and still did it. I'd steal alcohol knowing my parents would realize some's missing. I just feel like I am losing everything I've worked so hard to get over the past year. ..By my title I'm basically saying that I feel the only reason I haven't rekindled my addiction again is because I haven't been able to. I try to go to parties but I can't. I try to drink with friends and I can't. It seems like every time I try to get high or drunk something falls through. And even though deep down I know this is a good thing I feel stuck in between a really fucking hard place and a fat fucking rock. ..I know this was a lot to read but please give me some advice. I have really been struggling lately and I figured submitting this would be worth a shot. I don't want to go back down the road of addiction and depression. Please help me.

I would find a meeting and be around people like me with the same struggle. Strength in numbers. Good luck.
