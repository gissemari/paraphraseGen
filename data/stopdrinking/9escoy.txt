Hi all  10 months out of the bottle here  I I just got a text from my GF saying that she relapsed today while I was at work. She was almost 6 months sober after a short stint in rehab I should mention.  I'm posting because I need some advice on how to best support her. I know guilt can lead to more relapses and even though I am disappointed  I don't want to make her feel worse and threaten her renewed convictions.  So I'm reaching out for some advice and perspective. How to approach being a supportive and loving partner when I'm also on that sober grind.

I think it depends on how she's feeling about it. Does she regret it or is she interested in drinking regularly again?
