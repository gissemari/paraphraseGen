I've lost some weight in sobriety and look sort of like my old self.  I've been motivated to lose more and have been skipping breakfast to hasten the process.  In doing so today I got so hungry that my mind went into relapse mode.  I was starving and angry that I couldn't just consume whatever I want including booze.  Pissed off that I can't just be normal.  So I went to a meeting and then ate a huge meal.  I have to remember that just because I look like the old me I'm not.  I am an alcoholic.  I have to take cues from my body and ignoring hunger almost sent me straight back to hell.  I will hang on to my four + months sober.  Let's not drink just for today.

Nice work!..I'm also down a nice chunk of weight in sobriety with a lot of focus on what I (don't) eat. I think you're right. Sometimes I just have to take a break from being so damn healthy ... in a good way and eat a burger and a cookie.
Fantastic job in realizing that HALT (hungry/angry/lonely/tired) played a major role when your mind was about to enter relapse mode! Going to a meeting and having a huge meal? AND coming here to post about it?! Magnificent dear SRC. Keep up the great work!! :)
Change takes time - don't push yourself too hard too fast. You're already doing a great thing to your health by dropping alcohol. A protein rich breakfast will help keep your energy levels even and hopefully prevent mood swings. Don't deprive yourself. You're doing great!
One step at a time slow and steady wins the race and all that. Sounds like you're doing great!
