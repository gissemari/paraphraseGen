Hey team.Just gonna check in. It's Sunday here and 89 days dry. I think the biggest change for me so far is the improvement in mental clarity and reduction in anxiety.. I still have fog and forget words which is frustrating. My digestive system has not recovered and probably needs less coffee and more veges. .I'm really struggling with motivation - couldn't choose what to have for dinner last night; I couldn't tap into any sort of feeling about it and I love food and usually know just what i feel like..I just observe cravings when they arise and let them pass Buddhist style. .Im starting to enjoy the journey and am anticipating nice changes.. Thanks to you all that post I lurk a lot and appreciate your stories struggles and triumphs.Chur

Congrats. Do you do cardio? Among the many benefits it seems to help lift the fog and could help with your motivation. On the topic of motivation what worked for me more than anything is motivation speakers such as Les Brown Jim Rohn Zig Ziglar and Tony Robbins. Their lectures are all on youtube. I used to listen to them for hours a day every day in the morning and as I fell asleep to the point where I memorized most of the lessons. It feels dorky to be recommend them but it fired me up and changed my life entirely.
