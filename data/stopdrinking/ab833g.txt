Every Monday morning I get to open my work computer and look at my sobriety counter.  Today it says 192 days I am grateful for every bit of support I have received from complete strangers my wife and my therapists.  This holiday season hasn't been easy and I have been tempted on many occasions but I have used all the tools at my disposal to successfully navigate this time of year.  I have had so many new years eve celebrations where I didn't even make it to midnight because I was passed out.  This year will be different I will watch the ball drop with my kiddo's and head to bed with the love of my life.  I will not drink with you today and my thoughts will be with each and every one of you.  If you struggle please reach out to someone on here a support person or even myself.  Together we will make it a successful New Years and start the year out on the right foot.
