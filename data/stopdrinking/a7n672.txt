I am 10 days in and I am constantly fighting low blood sugar and the headaches that accompany. ..Caffeine is a trigger for me rum and coke. So I ditched that too. All freely available drinks at work are either coffee tea or water. So I drink water and have my bagel for breakfast. 2 hours into my day headache and vision loss. Scramble to get sugar in. Lunch. Yep hours later headache and vision loss another scramble.  ..I don't want to just constantly eat but don't know what to do to combat this. Struggling because alcohol was my main caloric intake for last 15 years.

I'm sure you know this but you're also going through caffeine withdrawal.  I'm on day 7 woke up with a banger but it went away as soon as I drank some coffee.  In addition to water I've been drinking lots of juice to keep my blood sugar up.  Good luck to you- it'll pass!
