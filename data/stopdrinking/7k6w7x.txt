Earlier this week I had a relapse which lasted for two days and which I really regret. (And once again I want to thank some of great people here who did their best to try to talk me out of giving in to my craving.) Yesterday I was sober again thank goodness. So now it's the weekend - and that's always tough. And I'm in a pretty "high risk situation" right now: I'm alone at home (my SO went to a party and he'll be there for most of the day). I have no plans for today (=nowhere I'll need to be). There's an **opened bottle** of white wine in the fridge which I can't pour down the drain because it's my SO's and he'll want it tomorrow...The choice I **don't** want to make today is this: I'll take the wine out of the fridge and finish it and then go buy another one to replace it plus more booze at the liquor store across the street. And drink all day doing little else - besides listening to music and sitting at my laptop. And then keep drinking tomorrow starting the moment I wake up. (And as a result becoming the "idiot" I wrote about in my post yesterday: https://redd.it/7k277k ) In short the choice I've made countless times over the last few years...The choice I **want** to make is this: I ignore the bottle. I'll hit the gym and do a really intense workout. After that I'll go to the supermarket and buy something delicious to eat (but will not even go near the beers and the ciders.) Then I'll spend a quiet evening at home enjoying my dinner and watching something nice on tv...I **want** to choose the latter option but it isn't and will not be easy. I'm having a craving even now as I'm writing. But I **really** want to fight it this time!

Perhaps think about which decision you'll regret more. I found that I never regret *not* drinking. 
I really believe that you can do this. Think about how good you're going to feel after that workout. What delicious things you can treat yourself to for dinner. Or...since it's a replaceable bottle of wine...why not dump it down the drain right now and make it easy? Then you and your SO can go replace it tomorrow. You got this!
Glad you're here...I needed support to be successful.  I went to meetings and immediately found people who understood what I was experiencing.  They were warm welcoming and non judgmental...They were sober wanted to stay sober and amazingly wanted to help ME be sober!..Evening meetings were especially helpful!
