I haven't made it *around* the world in 88 days but I have been *sober* that long...Looking back I was really struggling with PAWS (as I have posted about frequently).  I feel that is ebbing now so I am grateful for that!..I am also grateful for the support here and from others in my life...Happy 24 everyone!
