This guys YouTube videos pulled me through I wanted to share in case someone was in need of some thoughts: https://youtu.be/8mckF0WWUco..He has others too but as I was laying in bed last night and didn't make it to a meeting I found this one which is newer...My biggest take away is when he talks about ones higher power giving lessons in ones alcoholism in the form of incidents that happen to awake us- receiving a dui losing a job losing a relationship or close calls and if we continue to relapse the lessons progress and eventually lead to ones demise. ..Save yourself while you still have the chance. Don't create more destruction we all have enough past destruction to weave through. ..Something a guy said in AA recently was that 'alcoholism is suicide on an installment plan'...With that I'll take another 24.

&gt;'alcoholism is suicide on an installment plan'..That's a keeper...I always remember that Alcohol has a plan:  Destroy my relationships ruin my life kill me.   Sometimes the order varies.
