Ever since I relapsed back in June I have had such a hard time finding the motivation and traction to get back on the wagon.  I was finally able to yesterday.  I called in sick to work and spent the whole day at home watching movies and spending time on SD.  Feeling great today and will be glad to have day two under my belt tomorrow morning as I return to work ready to protect my sobriety.

Excellent.  Here's the thing about all Day Ones.  You never have to drink again if you don't pick up the next drink.  Good luck and congratulations on your new beginning.
I really admire you who are able to climb out of the debachery  and get back on the wagon. My relapses are years. Ugh. At any rate Welcome Back!
