Due to these intense winds on the east coast my office was closed today--which meant working from home...I loved getting to sit by my huge window and soak in the sunlight all day in my pajamas while I worked but for some reason it led to a growing feeling of restlessness and agitation. It doesn't help that it is Friday I do not have many (or really any) friends or plans for the weekend and am now feeling stressed lonely and frustrated...I still have a half-finished bottle of Jim Beam stashed under my bed. I put it there in a frenzy when I first decided to go sober and have been too afraid to touch the thing to dump it for fear of dumping it into my mouth instead of the sink. It's felt safer to leave it where it is out of sight mostly out of mind...Except now that I'm stuck inside unable to go out anywhere because of work and the weather I can't get that bottle out of my mind. I want to drink so badly. I am tired and my brain hurts from thinking too hard and I'm bored and I just want to shut everything off.

Ok - forget one day at a time let's take this minute by minute. ..What can you do for the next 10 minutes? Post some comments on recent posts in need of attention? Run a bath? Get a pen and paper and draw a picture of whatever comes to mind? Cook dinner? Drink a glass of water? Play a video game? 
I work from home and I am familiar with those feelings of stress loneliness and frustration. I often just go out to a diner to sit amongst other people in an environment that does not encourage drinking. I would strongly suggest dumping the alcohol but if tonight is not the right night to attempt that find something to do outside of the house for a while. Best of luck from Upstate New York; the winds missed me but took the power out just to the North.
Just because your office is closed doesn't mean you can't leave the house does it?
What was your reason to quit drinking? Were you having bad experiences? How will the rest of the weekend play out if you decide to drink. When I am feeling desperately tempted these are the things I think about.  Also I like to read relapse posts to help me remember why I ..Keep checking in with us. IWNDWYT.
Also - 166 days dude. 166 days. You are fucking ROCKING this shit. You are awesome. You're doing great. 
I know you don't want to think about it or look at it but I would get rid of the bottle immediately.  I can't believe you've had it there 166 days actually!.Cook something that requires time and patience.  Read or watch something that requires focus.  .Or my go to just take a nap!  Ice Cream and Naps!  .Or drink some water.  Your schedule might be screwed up because of working from home.  You could be dehydrated and just need water.  .Hope one of those helps....but I'd get rid of the bottle.  Especially if you are thinking about it after all of this time. ..I will not drink with you on this Friday evening!
Yeah these winds are crazy. It makes me feel stir crazy too. Like even if I wanted to go anywhere I cant really. Nothing is really open and the power is out almost throughout the town (not here though). I think you can make it through though. And you have much more strength than I do. I would never be able to have any booze under my bed and not drink it.
I do too. They just broke out the wine at my office. 
We're being hit by the Nor'easter right now - what a mess huh?..Me I'd get rid of that JB. I know it's scary because I had to get rid of wine bottles on too many occasions. But once it was gone I felt it was a major NDV and it made it all the more difficult for the 'voice' to keep haunting me. Instead it was a way of saying STFU ;)...Just get through the next hour. Think - you'll be going to bed early and *sober*. You'll wake up feeling victory and ready to have a great Saturday. Hang out here visit the IRC we'll keep ya company! :).
Hope you're making it through those cravings buddy.  Willing you on.
Oh it's Friday? **really?**.There's like thousands of people on SD not drinking tonight watching Netflix chilling why not join us? **ok fine whatever.**..see what I did there?     
How are you doing r_f_ok_w? We're still here for ya!
How are you feeling today?
