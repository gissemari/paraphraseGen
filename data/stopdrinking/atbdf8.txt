I'm struggling with excess in nearly every aspect of my life. It's not that I'm straight up binging booze food and sloth but I'm certainly not making any headway in trying to moderate anything...I feel like I'm apathetically going down a spiral getting fatter more depressed and angrier all the time. I don't know exactly if drinking is the source of this all or rather a reaction to something bigger. ..I've been drinking for 16 years since I was 13. I have only ever taken a month off twice for Dry January (this year and a few years ago). This year wasn't even a full month -- made an excuse to drink for a friend's birthday weekend--pathetic. ..I've tried Naltrexone a couple times literally a couple times. I was never consistent with it. I slept like shit on it which pissed me off because I convinced myself that if I didn't drink then the least I deserved was a decent night sleep. I feel so powerless to change anything even though a know a handful of folks in AA. ...I don't know exactly what I'm looking from ya'll in this post. Thanks for reading.

I can't moderate. My life significantly improved in the months and now years after I quit. AA is one way it has helped a lot of people. Why not go to a meeting?
If whatever you're doing now isn't working -- try something different. Have you read the book This Naked Mind? It really flipped a switch for me in the way I view booze and cut my cravings dramatically. The author Annie Grace also has a This Naked Mind YouTube channel. You could also try AA SMART Recovery or Refuge Recovery. If one thing doesn't work then try another thing. As long as you keep trying you're not failing.
