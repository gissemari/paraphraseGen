I posted a month ago that I was done. Drinking and driving was enough for me and I was done... clearly it wasn't. Now it's blacking out again. Twice this weekend. I didn't do anything bad in my blackout(s) but just the fact that it happened scares me...What I'm struggling with most is that I'm only 23 and that sometimes I drink in perfect moderation and it's no big deal.  Everyone around me even my boyfriend whom I live with and has been with me when I was sober and since I've started drinking again says that its' just normal 23 year old stuff. As I sit here hungover again on a Monday I feel like that's not true. ..Can anyone offer advice about what it was like in their 20's? Or being able to moderate sometimes but not all the time? ....

Welcome back /u/princess_peach413 -- I can't emphasize enough how important consistent sober daily actions a la [the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) made all the difference in my life.  Oh and I don't give a damn about what other people think about my drinking.  Blackout drinking is not NORMAL--it's life-threatening.
