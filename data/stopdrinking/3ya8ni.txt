Hey all..It has been two months: 60 days without alcohol for my first time ever in my life. I stopped feeding my sadness and I look forward to the future!..I feel confident fit and overall happy! This was a good Christmas not because of gifts or food but because I *was there*.....Best wishes in this holiday and a lot of strength for all in the struggle! We can do it!.

Those 2 month stars look awesome don't they?!
Congratulations on the big 6-0!
Present and accounted for for once in my life. I agree one of the best presents I could give myself! Congratulations on 60 days!
