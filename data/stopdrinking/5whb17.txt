Five days sober today after another nasty relapse. It's always the same and I want to avoid it so bad. It's crazy how I get some time and then for an instant justify and I'm right back where I was. I will begin checking in here regularly which is something I haven't done. Feeling grateful today.

Checking in here even when I don't feel like I _need_ to has been a great help to me. I'll see you around. Keep up your momentum you've got this!
Stay strong. Keep coming back to this sub. You can do it.
It's all up to you.  I won't drink with you today.
