Been clean for 2+ weeks now scared sober after some health problems. After a ton of tests it seems like I'm in the clear healthwise. Saw my doctor today and he warned me about relapse as he sent me off...45 minutes ago I found a bottle that I had hidden in the back of a cabinet. I left it there. As I did some other stuff I thought about having a drink since I had just been told I was healthy. Then I realized there'd be enough for the whole night and I could just have one night since I was doing so well. The amount of mental gymnastics I was doing was astonishing in retrospect. I ended up dumping it down the sink and I'm very thankful I did. It made me realize that even though I'm on the best streak I've had I still can't trust myself around booze completely and it's going to continue to be a challenge.

Good move. That bottle was taking up a lot of space in your head.
A while back someone left some beers in my fridge. I caught myself thinking about them too much i.e. should I save them for a guest what if I have a hard day etc. Once I poured them out I wasn't obsessing about them.
