I'm looking for recommendations for any good drinks to replace alcohol on a Friday or Saturday night. Those are the two days I really struggle to not use alcohol. I'm open to anything (preferably in a glass bottle and carbonated because I enjoy that). I just want a little treat to look forward to.

La Croix is a favorite on this sub. I have my fridge stocked at all times. Grapefruit and coconut are my favorite. It's cheap tastes great and has no calories. It's my go-to NA substitute. I bring it to any social gathering where alcohol will be flowing. Cracking open an ice-cold can after mowing the lawn on a hot day is really refreshing.
My favourite weekend beverages are ginger beer (virgin Moscow Mule) and tonic water w/ lime (virge gin &amp; tonic).
sprecher root beer
Non alcoholic ginger beer is the way to go. Diet versions too. Gosling's  brand for a bite. 
If you're feeling fancy mineral sparkling water like Perrier can be really tasty although a bit pricy.
