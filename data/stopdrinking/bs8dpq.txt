I am feeling like I can conquer the world after hitting one year officially sober a couple weeks ago. What a journey it has been and will continue to be I suspect for the rest of my sober life. So many lessons learned. From failed relationships due to my alcoholism to self love lessons. ..Still learning a lot and healing old wounds but one thing about today is I feel like a badass! Sobriety saved my life. To anyone struggling to decide if it's right for you then I hope this gives testimony of mental benefits. ..IWNDWYT!

Yes!  I'm on a roll too.  Feels supremely better now no end in sight.  This just keeps amassing good stuff as I roll along!  Congratulations on one year of freedom!     
Congrats. I am in the 'self love lesson' phase.  I now like myself. Used to actually say out louds to me: I hate myself.
You are a badass! Wow what a great time of year to get sober and really be alive.

Congrats! It's incredible how hard it is to imagine going a year without something that we spent most of our early years going without...
