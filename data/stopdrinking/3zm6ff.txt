I've been visiting this sub for a while and reading all the different posts to find strenght to stop drinking. For the past few years I was living somewhere I really didn't like working a pretty stressful job. I started out with a great friend group there and things seemed tolerable with my drinking. It was more about fun I didn't feel out of control. Then one by one everyone left and I was stuck in a rut...I left the country and couldn't drink a lot so I had hoped that would turn me around and I would come back and not be quite as bad. However when I got back I went further down a hole. I binged for a few weeks then tried to exercise to take my mind off things. My home life wasn't great and the days I tried to not drink were such a struggle I was losing my mind. As you can guess I did not do very well and caved more often then not...I was able to move recently to a much better place and cut back significantly but I still found my self having a fair amount every day. Definitely enough where I had a buzz. I started to feel significant guilt in the mornings and would beat myself up pretty consistently throughout the day. I am happier here why am I turning to booze so much still? I also couldn't wake up in the morning and it was making me miserable...I am happy to say that since the new year I have found the strength to not drink and have stayed away from temptation. I know I have a lot of work to do but I am slowly working on setting achievable goals to stay positive.. .I just wanted to say thank you everyone for posting. It feels good to not be alone in the struggle...
