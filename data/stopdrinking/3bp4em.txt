A few weeks ago I decided to try and drink normally.  That did not work out and I ended up drinking a lot (not drunk even just always wanting a beer with dinner etc)..Well last night instead of drinking wine i decided to drink vodka.  one thing led to another and i blacked out.  I wake up to see that at 2 am i called back a manager at another job that I was going to be considered for.  My current manager is the one who got me in.  Its a very professional organization and the only way to get in usually is by referrals.  Anyway i called him twice at 2 am (around 40 seconds each time) and he called me a few minutes later (around 20 seconds).  I have no idea none what our conversations consisted of.  I guess my drunken brain thought i was calling someone else...I also called my ex multiple times included a 8 minute conversation.  I tried texing him today and all he sent was a pissed emoticon...This could get me fired.  I took a vacation day today but I am scared to go see what my boss knows about what i did.  She put her reputation on the line by recommending me and that is how i repay her.   ..I am just terrified right now.  I let drinking give up my 500 day progress.  I don't have a boyfriend or kids or any family nearby and i am so lonely and scared that i might get fired.  ..you guys were the only people i knew to talk to.  thanks for reading.

I have been in far darker places in my journey including federal prison and the disciplinary court of my profession.  What did I do?  [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) back to sobriety and life.  I feel like I turned it around you can you.  Start TODAY and let's see what tomorrow brings.  We will be here to support you.
The title says "I need your help."  Yet you didn't ask for help all you did was tell us that you got drunk and it ended poorly. ..Exactly what help are you asking for?

I relapsed many many times and it was important for me to analyze WHY I did it. What changed? Did sobriety lose it's priority? It is important to understand your mental state before you took that first drink. What is your plan going forward? Nothing changes if nothing changes.
Welcome back...&gt;A few weeks ago I decided to try and drink normally...Any idea why? When did you decide to do this in your mind? I know when you took action but when did you internally decide you think?
Ugh I am so so sorry. The only thing that makes me feel better in these types of situations is knowing what happened (instead of guessing) facing up and starting to repair the damage. It may not be as bad as you think. ..When I've done things that I've regretted (from drinking or just being human) I say to myself "I can bear the weight of my actions". Sometimes it brings me to tears but it always gives me fortitude...You can bear the weight of your actions. People have done far worse. You will survive and live another day. Good luck friend.
