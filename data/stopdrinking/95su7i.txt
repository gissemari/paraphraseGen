I am trying to give up alcohol for awhile. Have used it almost daily for 3+ years mostly after work and not to the point where I've drank at work or other times when I shouldn't. I have anxiety and it worsens when I try or even think about not drinking. I have a fear of quitting and the drinking makes the anxiety go away.  I am struggling to get past that first hurdle.   I really want to do this for my wife and child.  I would appreciate any advice.

Read The Naked Mind.  When I was drinking I too would get anxious and some booze helped that.  Problem is it makes me even more anxious later.  ..Read this sub tons of good advice here.  And it is very helpful for many of us to see we are not alone - that we share common issues with this nasty stuff.  ..And don't quit quitting.  Relapses mean you have something to learn something to figure out something new to try.

It's hard to take that first step because of the anxiety.  I used to drink cos I thought it would make my anxiety go away.  After the first couple of days it does get better for me anyway.  It's that dreaded thought of taking that first step but you can do it.  Best of luck IWNDWYT!
