It took me a while but yesterday I opened up to a fellow sober alcoholic about my relapse a few weeks ago. I felt I ought to share here in case it may help others with their choices...I was at a company startup party held in a bar. Lots of food that I was stuffing my face with. I order a Topo Chico (sparkling mineral water) but the bar was out. I get to talking to the bartender cute girl who stopped drinking herself. She offers me a Beck's Non-Alcoholic Beer. I figure hey why not!? Hot girl offering me something for free non-alcoholic so it must be ok. I did not really think much of it. It tasted... *good.* Very light and refreshing. I jokingly told my friend I probably could drink 12 of them easy. I went on with my night went to a BBQ then on a date with a girl. Pretty uneventful...The next day I felt like SHIT. Later in the afternoon I began feeling this intense anxiety like I fucked up bad. mind was racing and I felt ill. This lasted into the following day. I almost felt like the first few days of when I got sober back in February. Beck's N.A. Beer is 0.05% alcohol. Orange juice has more than that. But what I had was a complete and total **mental relapse.**..I have read both good and bad about N.A. beer on this subreddit. It definitely went badly for me. I did not think before drinking it and it is that same lack of thought that could lead to a real and powerful relapse. Needless to say I do not want to risk my life so no more N.A. beer. Too risky that it could lead to me wanting the real thing. The mental relapse has since led me to redouble my sobriety efforts. Lots more contact with my sponsor and more participation in meetings. I just want to warn anyone contemplating N.A. beer that it tastes deceptively good and probably not worth it.

I do not drink it too many memories cautious about it being a trigger why bother?  ..My sponsor did.  There are no hard rules here but I am cautious.
Okay I may not be the best person to be giving my opinion but really what have you done that's wrong? Let's review:..* you asked for a sparkling mineral water (good move!) but the bar was out .* after conversation you took the word of a former drinker to try a Beck's non-alcoholic beer (no problem here except perhaps that the first thing you had to say was that she was "cute." Did her cuteness jam your radar? If so note to self: be on guard. But maybe it didn't. So far so good.).* you said that you could drink "12 of them easy" but you don't indicate that you had any more than one. Fantastic!.* then "I went on with my night went to a BBQ then on a date with a girl. Pretty uneventful."..Okay so you woke up feeling like "SHIT" and. clearly feeling remorse. But I'm not sure why friend. I am truly sorry you felt crappy but as I see it you didn't relapse. However what I think doesn't matter; it''s what **you** think that matters to **your** sobriety. And you're right: 0.05% alcohol is ridiculously low and likely is something we may encounter everyday if we are unaware if it. The problem as I see it is that you were in a bar hyper-vigilant about how you would handle things -- and you did well -- but your secret punishing former alcoholic self goes into overdrive playing those stupid tapes that tell you "you can't do this" that "you're just a relapse looking for a place to happen" "it's only a matter of time" "you can't be trusted to walk among those who don't have past trouble with alcohol" "you should feel like a piece of dirt **forever**"  -- you loser you. What a load of crap. And yeah you **did** think before drinking it. In a nano-second you evaluated the situation trusted the server had one enjoyed it and continued on with your evening. ..There are any number of reason why you might feel like "S**T" the next morning: food poisoning (not to be discounted during barbecue season) allergies unpleasant company too much pleasant company the alignment of the stars whatever. You just don't have a large enough sample size to determine the cause of your malady. ..But I do know two things: ..1) if you feel you relapsed with the non-a beer don't do it again. Simple. Stick to H2O (or whatever) that will not make you crazy afterwards with worry. And if you have to beat yourself up do it with a feather (which I have read here so many times before!)...2) Do not DO NOT give in to the fear that "oh no I ruined everything after 99 days!" 99 days is very admirable work. Be proud! Hold your head up!  But the fear that you have wrecked everything can consume your life and will more surely drive you screaming into a full blown relapse than anything else. As I see it despite what others may say this is not an all-or-nothing deal. You have nothing to be ashamed of friend. Shame will kill you as fast as alcohol (in fact its alcohol's best friend). Don't go there...I'm sorry if I sound cross; I'm not but impassioned? Yes I am. I wish you the best and I trust your judgement. Yeah you had a problem in the past that you have managed in exemplary fashion for the last 99 days. Don't diss that accomplishment. Be well friend.
I don't drink near beer either or anything like an alcoholic beverage. I'll drink sparkling apple juice for a wedding or something but that's as close as I care to get. I don't feel like I'm missing out or depriving myself at all. It's like turpentine--I don't think about drinking it.
Here's the deal with WRATX and NA beer if I am at a social function and I grab an NA beer I am instantly the guy that loves beer so much that he has to have an NA beer but if I grab a diet coke I am the guy that just wants a diet coke it's a small difference perhaps but huge in my mind NA beer guy is an alcoholic diet coke guy is smart and knows what he wants in life 
Happy hundo!!
I don't believe in non-alcoholic beer myself. I believe that if you drink it you really want a beer too bad and someday your willpower will fail. I look at beer as not really something I would drink if it had no alcohol. I mean beer os OK I guess but not as good as a Coke or a glass of water. I honestly asked myself if I would drink beer wine or liquor if there were no alcohol in them and I find myself thinking 'probably not'. I know a lot of you will say that you genuinely like the taste of beer but I'm not so sure. Your brain has just tied positive thoughts to beer because it makes you drunk. At one point I honestly thought I **loved** scotch. Would I drink it without the alcohol? NO FUCKING WAY. After much contemplation I think beer and wine are in the same category. I really do like water better...TLDR; Watch alcohol it has ways of finding its way back into your life. You are playing with fire by drinking non-alcoholic beverages. Water is more refreshing and you know it...My Update: 41 days 15 lbs gone hangover free living and I have saved at least $300 at this point.
