Day 3 of sobriety. This time I don't feel shame on the past I don't feel regret. I accept that it is part of my process and I have new tools and insight to take me forward...Tonight poses an interesting challenge. It's my husbands birthday and he wants to go to a popular BBQ joint. We used to go there for beers. Instead I will be enjoying the extra calories in the form of BBQ. No beers for me tonight. Thank u next!.
