When alcohol is in my life it takes priority over all my relationships. My commitments to myself and others wash away the moment it enters my system...You wanted me to come home after our busy work days to spend some time together? Sorry I'm meeting someone after work but I'm sure you'll find something to do...Plan something fun for the weekend? Yeah sure that sounds great. Oh but now I'm hung over. I'm going to need a couple days to recuperate...Do some self-care take care of those small anxieties and guilt building up from your previous bad decision making? Or you could just call your friend and waste away some more. The problems will still be there...My last attempt to stop was only half-hearted and I knew it in the way that part of your mind knows you are going to relapse again long before you go through with it...I've reset my badge but I don't feel bad. I actually have reached out for help this time trying all the things I bullshitted myself into believing I am above. Beginnings are delicate but I already feel some peace in knowing this one is sincere...Here's to us and those who really need us. I will not drink with you today.

Well said.
Friends and family would never be okay with you staying with such a lover. But we can break up with them and set ourselves free. Congrats IWNDWYT!!!
You are spot on. It took me 20 years of relapses and shame to realize that i was learning until i understood i needed help. No shame in relapses i advocate stopping completely now but i understand them. You seem to have gotten the lesson much faster happy for you!
