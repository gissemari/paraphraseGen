If it makes you feel any better I have a shitty job and shitty life but haven't stopped drinking yet which is making my life even shittier. You're on the right track and you not drinking gives people like me hope that I can quit .and create a less shitty life for myself too. 
Life is hard without our crutches! You can do it. One step at a time. One change at a time. One realization at a time. You got this.
Can you call out today? If so sit down with a big pad of paper and pen (doesn't have to be a big pen :D) and answer these two questions on it  What do I want or How do I want to feel?  And  What steps can I take in the next few days to head in that direction?  I think this helps to start to feel like you have choices / an out from feeling bad.
