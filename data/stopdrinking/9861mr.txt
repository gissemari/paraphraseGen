I'm trying to get clean after a major relapse. I keep getting to two or three clean days and then I break-- drinking half of what I was to "self-medicate" but that's still drinking and not okay. . .In the meantime my psychiatrist (I have PTSD and neurodevelopmental disorders) has been sanctioned so he can't prescribe anymore. This has created a massive problem because I take Adderall and Klonopin two highly controlled meds that terrify doctors.  .  .My primary doctor agreed to prescribe them for one month to give me time to find a new psychiatrist. I have made dozens of calls (not exaggerating) but I have yet to find a replacement because they're all swamped. . .So I'm forced to cut back on two meds that are essential to my daily living while my brain is flailing about looking for alcohol to trigger a dopamine release. If I run out of Klonopin before I find someone willing to prescribe it I will be hospitalized (benzodiazepine withdrawal is often fatal without intervention.). . .And to really put the tin lid on everything I had a massive allergic reaction to something and am now on a high-dose prednisone blast. One of the side effects of prednisone is making you feel like you've gone crazy. It also causes insomnia which I tried to combat with doxylamine (Unisom) which zombified me. Needless to say I've stopped taking it. . .I almost forgot about the constantly changing anti-inflammatory meds for a muscle injury that has rendered me nearly non-functional-- the meds and the injury. . .Even though a part of my brain is screaming for a drink I am *not* going to break this time-- I've finally realized that this chemical chaos inside me is made worse by drinking even though I "feel" better for a few hours after. I'm not better after a drink-- l am worse off because I've reset the clock on my brain taking control of its own regulation. . .Seeing all of this written down makes me feel even more crazy. If I were reading this post instead of writing it I would mentally tag it "nutjob" and move on. . .Advice/kind words/Internet hugs would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading all of this.

Bud I can't speak on the medication part of your post as I don't have experience. But alcohol WD's I'm familiar with. I know they suck bad. I'm on day 6 and the insomnia has me feeling loopy as hell. ..What you say is so true. Using booze to cure the affects of booze is a real spiral. I know it's tough! Sending good thoughts your way you aren't alone!
Stick with it. No one really knows what you are going through. I can only imagine the crazy making situation you are in. You are right - Drinking will never help it. Never. Not one bit. Plow through as long as you are safe - get medical help as needed. When you explain Your situation to doctors it will be much more credible if sober    you will be clearer and able to explain yourself with less frustration and you will be less reactionary as you deal with this. Good luck!
