Woo hoo!I never thought I would make it. My naltrexone is still not refilled and I had cravings last nightbut I just walked away until I told myself I really don't need a beer. My psychiatrist is going to supposedly call me Monday and talk...which is bullshitbut I'm so glad I have not relapsed. ..I will not drink with you today.

Its worth being sober even on the bad days. Good Job. 
Yay... Congratulations on 100 days. That's awesome. IWNDWYT:-)
I'm on day 4. Currently exhausted because the doctor prescribed Librium which I have to take for 2 more days. I'm on Naltrexone as well but after the first 30 days I'm supposed to switch to the Vivitrol injection. Have you asked the doctor about it? Sounds easier than getting refills each month. 
Nice!!!! Congrats on triple digits!!
