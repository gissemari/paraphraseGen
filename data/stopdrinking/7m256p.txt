There are plenty of stories of people struggling and doing their best to navigate the stresses and temptations of the holidays but is anyone out there finding it way easier than they expected?..For some reason I'm cruising and enjoying every second of it without the slightest temptation. It's truly become part of my new routine...Not sure why...aside from discipline and a promise to myself...but I'm on a new level with this.

Way easier than I thought. I'm finding that it's not ackward to be sober around the holidays...I've been drinking coffee and eggnog instead. First Christmas without a hangover in pretty muchas long as I can remember. I'm really taking it all in and able to savor the moments this year.
Seconded. Having no issues whatsoever after drinking HEAVILY for close to 20 years. For me it's just a conscious decision to not drink with a passing thought of having a drink sprinkled in every now and again. ..After reading many many accounts in this sub I wish it were this easy for everyone that is struggling..Edit: I'm well aware of the fact that just because it's been easy for me it doesn't negate the fact that I'm a full fledged alcoholic and always will be..
Yep - no issues here.  
Easier than I thought. I was so proud of myself for taking the day 1 plunge on Christmas Eve that I had only a few struggles. Most mental rather than physical 
Some days easier and some days harder.
Easier than i thought to say no ... but i also spend more time thinking about it than i would have expected. 
It's definitely easier than I thought it would be. Especially when those around me are suffering hangovers and I'm feeling simply fabulous!
