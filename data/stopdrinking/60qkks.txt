I have always struggled with having grandiose plans to do things that I cannot possibly accomplish.  Once I write them down on my to-do list I think I have to accomplish each item no matter what resource it takes or the day is a failure.  So when I arrive home at 8pm after a day of Board meetings errands family commitments community projects and more I say to myself "I can't possibly get these last two things done without a glass of white wine." So I get one. Or two. Someone once said to me "It's not your drinking that's so much out of control it's your life." This is what happened last night.  In building a tool kit for not drinking I hope to use the to-do list to reflect a realistic expectation of what I can accomplish without drinking.

Most excellent plan!  I got tired just reading all you do in a day...
I built a tool kit for a happy sober life by getting a therapist seeing a doctor going to rehab outpatient and getting involved in a support group. I had no clue how to stay sober without help. 
When I am getting down on myself because I'm not accomplishing everything I could I tell myself "As long as I hit the pillow sober tonight the day was a success."
I relate to this. I make to do lists and find myself thinking.. well I can knock out these next couple things no problem if I'm buzzed. I get those couple things done buzzed then proceed to reward myself by taking it too far for completing my list. Problem is there's always things to do and I can't include drinking as one of them. 
I relate to this in a way that sometimes I feel so accomplished for getting so many things done that day that I "deserve" to have a glass of wine so I want to REWARD myself!
