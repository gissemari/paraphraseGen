The last year I've been getting really out of hand with drinking. I started a new job that has me traveling everywhere a new city every week. Hotel life is a lot of boredom so what's a great way to pass the time? Why a drink of course. But I can't just have 1 or even 6. I have to have 30. But right now is slow season and I'm stuck at home twiddling my thumbs and the last 5 days I've been on a bender that I haven't done in quite some years. Shit I'm drinking as I'm writing this. Tomorrow is thanksgiving and I'm nervous about going to my best friend's parents house because I don't know if being sober is going to happen. I called her earlier tonight and told her about it and my thoughts. There's only so much someone else can do for you in this situation and I don't speak with my family. I feel super alone right now especially since there are other people that I'm close with but don't want to tell them about this struggle (which leads me to just assume they have no idea there's a problem to begin with). I really want to get it out and tell somebody especially someone that understands but I don't feel like I have that in my life... don't really want to go to AA because I just want to go back to how it used to be where I drank maybe once or twice a month and could keep it under control in that I still got to getting out of my system but didn't fill everyday around it which is what I feel like is happening now. I'm scared. And I've never been scared about it before which scares me even more... I thought maybe posting to here might help get my thoughts out and you folks may be able to lend a helpful ear. I know I can conquer this it's just the fear that has really sent for a loop. Anyone else ever gone through this?

yeah. boredom and drinking alone. hoping for a break to rein it in but that never happens for me. some people talk about methods to reduce drinking back to 'normal' levels - whatever that means. but I guess I always drank to get loaded.
My story sounds a lot like yours... I was always a binge-drinker and kept it under control to the weekends for the most part.  The last 4 years my drinking accelerated vastly...from 3-4 nights a week to 7 nights a week.  And the drinks started getting poured earlier every day.  5pm...then 4pm then I would justify pouring myself a glass of wine at noon.  My life started revolving around alcohol and I was scared when I realized I couldn't go a day without it.  That's what scared me.  I could never moderate personally.  Because I do not like moderation when it comes to drinking lol... I want to get drunk every time I drink.
