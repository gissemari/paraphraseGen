I have a very close friend who is  constantly battling a close relationship with alcohol. There's no denial by him and he wants to get sober but he just struggles. I want to give him a pick-me-up and am making a care package for him. Right now I am planning on including a book I think would interest him and some vitamins that I know every alcoholic needs. What are some other things that he might appreciate? ..TLDR; Need ideas for a care package for my drunk BFF.

Bottles of water a bag of coffee beans or ground coffee maybe some candy or chocolate a piece of paper with "www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking" on it...That's very thoughtful.
That's very kind of you spagyrist. I would only caution you to be wary about investing any of yourself into his (hopefully) sobriety. In other words: keep your distance from it emotionally. If he is really planning on quitting in the near future I know many people get a major sweet tooth in the first few weeks. I made some of these [browned butter caramels](http://foodnessgracious.com/2012/01/brown-butter-caramels-2/) over the weekend for some thank you care packages. They were hideously delicious and would definitely quench that sweet tooth.
