I've had a lot of stressful situations come and go and I've avoided drinking just fine. Some of the more mundane things have taken more deliberate action to avoid drinking...For instance I used to go out after work and neglect my family in order to grab a drink or eight. Avoiding the weekend beers have been somewhat easy as well...However the Friday night date night is a struggle to get used to. Habitually I'd get 2-4 drinks. This new behavior is fun to learn from. Then I went to a cabin over the weekend stocked with beer. I avoided it there as well new and interesting. Last week I took a two hour train and just soaked in a the beauty around me and it felt odd not taking a six pack on there withbme. Today I took a LaCroix on my daily train commute and it felt so odd cracking a water vs beer...It hasn't been easy my life is getting a lot better. Feeling more and being more intentful in learning how to do mundane things without drinking.

I have found the adage "Old habits die hard" to be very true. It takes time to make new habits. IWNDWYT
