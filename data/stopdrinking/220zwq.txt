Title kind of says it all. Breaking up with a girl I love very much. Its really hard but our relationship isn't really very healthy and it hasn't been for some time now. A lot of hurt on both sides but for my part I take responsibility for the lions share of it. Alcohol was the cause of a lot of very angry and abusive arguments. The fights were the reason and the catalyst for me to stop drinking. I keep saying to myself "Thank yourself that you're sober". If I wasn't I don't know what I would be doing right now. Climbing the walls. It still hurts though as any break up does I guess. She is such a great person and I completely ruined our relationship with my behavior. And alcohol isn't entirely to blame. I have myself to blame too. I don't want to stay in her life because I'm just a source of pain for her family and friends. They all hate me and want nothing to do with me. And that hurts. But that's the price of your actions in life. She deserves so much better than what I have given her and I need to continue on my path of healing and get myself into a better place so I don't hurt anyone else like this ever again. She feels a lot of resentment towards me because of the fact that she stood by me through all of it and against all of her family and friends wishes. She is such an incredible person. But that's just another reason why we shouldn't be together. She deserves better than what I have given her. She is angry at me also because I have "given up drinking now" and I "think I'm great for that" which isn't really the case. I am proud of myself for stopping but I'm ashamed to death for the reasons I had to stop. And I always will be. I don't know why I'm posting this really. Just wanted to share. I checked if there were any AA meetings on in my area tonight but there aren't. There is a bottle of wine sitting here which was hers. I don't feel tempted really but I guess I should pour it out? I'm scared if she notices at some point in the future that its gone and thinks I drank it though. But that's probably just silly talk. On a side note I just noticed I got my 7 month badge now. That makes me feel good. :-) ..Thanks to everyone for being here. It does help. And to anyone out there struggling hold on strong! Sobriety is worth it.

You have SEVEN months sober. You are doing awesome! Break ups are hard as fuck. I just went through one in January. I can tell you a couple months out it was the best decision for both of us. Focus on yourself forgiving yourself and healing. She has to do the same and that's her responsibility not yours. Your only responsibility is staying sober and crafting the type of person you want to be. Time does heal most wounds to some extent and I think there will be a day when you can both forgive yourselves and each other. Get rid of that wine don't worry about what she thinks and stay true to yourself. YOU are the most important person in your world right now. Change all that regret/love/sad/resentment into some positive energy use it as fuel and keep pushing!!! Congrats on 7 months man!! 
Pour out the wine and make plans to celebrate 7 months +.  ..Sheesh heart aches are tough.  I'm so glad you shared this with us it may help someone else going through what you're going through.  BTW the IRC chat might help why don't you give it a try.   Someone might have a link to an AA IRC chat--I believe that there are AA meetings online.
