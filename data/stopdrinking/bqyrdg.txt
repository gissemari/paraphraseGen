Hi all..&amp;#x200B;..I have been drinking for the last three years and I'm struggling to quit. I found an AA meeting near my house which I would like to visit. I wanted to attend the meeting in the past but I have high social anxiety specially if I have to speak in public. ..&amp;#x200B;..I would like to ask the community how the experience going to AA was like. Do you have to stand up say your name and make a speech? What was it like for you going in for the first time?..&amp;#x200B;..Thank you in advance.

My first time everyone sat in a circle and we went around the room saying "hi I'm ___ and I'm an alcoholic/whatever". No standing up no speech. After that I didn't speak the rest of the time. People volunteered to share their stories and I just listened. You can always say "I'll pass" if you don't want to speak.
