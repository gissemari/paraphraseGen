**For those of you just seeing this you can get back story in my previous posts. I dont know how to put the link in this post im just a lurker!!   I don't know why my flair says 365 but I'm actually 364 and it's fucking crazy ...During the spring and summer of 2017 I wasnt "taking breaks" from drinking like some do I was white knuckling every fucking minute. And surprise surprise I was miserable sober too so maybe drinking wasnt my problem maybe it was me. My hair was falling out in patches I had broken both my arms at the same time just a couple months before (falling while drunk and carting more beer home) my stepdad had a double lung transplant. Things got rough...I'd set a goal and get through a week/weekend. On my color coded calendar I saw a pattern. Five six seven days in a row of zero drinks then massive binging/puking for a couple days. That was my life. I'd (figuritvly) lock myself in my apartment to keep my werewolf self from rampaging. I had serious fomo but knew I wouldnt find anything I was looking for in the bar I never had before and it was getting worse. Dangerous sad unpredictable. Lonely....When I say SD saved my life it really fucking did. I decided to quit after 15 years of heavy drinking by myself right before Halloween. What the fucking fuck. The weekend of a bunch of parties I couldnt go to I jumped on the IRC until the wee hours of the morning and distracted myself with a bunch of Aussies and Kiwis (thank goodness for the upside down). Dying Johnny specifically made me laugh and enjoy myself. He passed not too long ago. From this disease. This struggle. He was only 31 I think. ..To that point I had tried EVERYTHING except AA. My first AA meeting was depressing and my second was a damn godsend. I stood my chipper ass up and said I'm new and have no idea what I'm doing. People straight swarmed. Not kidding. I picked a sponsor (didn't tell her she was my sponsor until later) got shit ton of numbers and a big book and began my journey ..I know AA isn't for everyone I myself dislike(ish) organized religion and still inwardly cringe at the word God. The only reason I knew the Lord's Prayer was because it was in a Prince song Metallica song Motley Cr e song......Side note: In the first MONTH I went up a dress size because peanut butter m&amp;ms and oreos exist. ..The struggle is no joke. I got on SD nightly read books followed YouTube channels about not drinking watched documentaries. It all helped. But social interaction and step work in AA was necessary...Step one (powerless over booze) no prob  step 2 (no human could fucking cure me) check. Step 3 (give my will over to God) = GTFO. I cried and fought and mustered through it. It took months and I'm not great at "let go and let God" but damnit it helps. ..I was voted into a secretary position at 3 months sober and it was the best thing that could have happened at the time I hated it and everyone there. Jerks. I eventually came to love it because I got ATTENTION   Also helping my fellow alcoholics   At month 5 though (for those if you following last nights post it was March again) I was stuck. I didn't want to drink but I didnt want AA. And I declared as much at a meeting. "I'll give it a week." A woman came to me and said "You leave here and you'll either drink or put a bullet in your head. Start step 4" And now I'm on step 4; resentments (LoL at a year in go at your own pace people)..Even during this stressful and hard year of working on myself and being stuck in my head with no escape its better. It was miserable at times and remembering those first two weeks of withdrawl kept me sober. I didn't know if it would ever get better. I was scared to look forward to 30 days 60 days. What happens then? Am I cured? Do I get to go drink? The answer was always no each milestone I knew I had at least one more day in me...It took me a year of 5 meetings a week weekly talk therapy and sponsor sessions anti depressants and and whole lot of long days. My stepdad told me that the days last forever but the weeks fly by. And it's true for me. So that's been my year each day I hurt inside but each night I was glad I made it to bed sober. ..And with that I'll sign off so fucking long winded!!! Tomorrow I'll post what its like now....if you would like to know the what it's like now. ..Thanks for humoring me thus far this has been so theraputic. I hope something resonates...TL;DR: SOBRIETY IS HARD.
