I'm around the 4-5 months now but I can feel it rising in me. I know that all it takes is one sip and I've broken the promise to myself. I guess I need to not do that then. ..I won't be drinking today. .

My fear of relapse is one of the reasons why I had lots of support. Staying sober is hard. I could never have done it without a therapist and AA. What has also helped me over many years is remembering what happens when I drink. I have no doubt that if I took the first one eventually all the misery would return only multiplied. Since I do not want that to happen I don't take the first drink. 
Good luck!  I find support at meetings!
I like to play the tape forward when the cravings get bad - it always ends ugly and keeps me from picking up that first drink!!! Wishing you well on your journey.
Is the change of seasons? Holiday approach? Maybe if you can make the dynamic conscious you can form a targeted plan to see yourself through.
4-5 months of sobriety is amazing! Keep strong you're doing so well I hope I am where you are one day! I will not drink with you today.
4-5 months is *awesome*. Have you thought about strategies to get through the season? I had to give myself extra leeway around the holidays and identify stressors triggers and front-load my schedule with a lot of self-care activities. Coming to SD and being accountable is a great start.
