after such a long time sober and then willfully choosing to not be this fall up until the new year . . . i hadn't had to deal with.  my whole central nervous system feeling sooooo tired. yet my heart racing.  sweating.  that sticky feeling you get from your body trying to get rid of the toxins.  tired eyes.  tired mind.  tired soul/heart. just that reeeaaaaallll down deep burned out feeling...emotionally all fucked until the mind and body clears itself.  lonely.  sad.  overall tired...i haven't found a ton of reasons since my life blew up this summer (hung on until mid-September--almost to my year sobiversary) to feel like . . . i don't want to hurt myself. to feel like i want to love myself to quit drinking.  all of that shame associated with relapsing after having had a successful run...but if nothing else today man. just the hope that in a week or two's time i don't have to feel this way.  ..idk if anyone can relate.  just wanted to send this out today.  i unfortunately have to be home alone for the next week+ my worst times and i'm just so tired and work such a . . . complex job.  i literally can't even think about.  and yeah you binge drinkers out there i'm one of you.  the days/weeks it takes me (as noted by science) to get my body bad to normal is enough to keep me sober today.  even if i'm home alone.  and my creep shit mind wants to start playing with me...i just really want to go home after an extremely long day take some melatonin.  eat some food.  sleep. ..so for that iwndwyt.  ..also i need honesty in sobriety we all do. so imma be honest and just say i am really vulnerable right now.  lonely. probably needy.  so thanks for anyone out there who has sent love.  that's helped me more than anything in the world right now. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Ohhh... Sending you a big hug and lots of love. I'll sit here with you. Will you be okay alone dealing with withdrawals? Do you think it might be an idea to get some help?
