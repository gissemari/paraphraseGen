So close. It's so sunny here in Spain it's beautiful. I know I should be happy but this struggle is getting to me. I am so close to drinking. I wish I wasn't I wish I could just abstain. I don't want to drink I really don't but I might have to. I wish there were AA meetings here in English but I can't find any. I wish I had a support system or a sponsor I could talk to right now. I'm really taking this one minute at a time.

Cravings won't kill you. Not giving in won't bring you any harm. This is not starvation hunger this is not bleeding to death. You can work through this...The *hardest* part of a craving is keeping the door open. "Shall I" "maybe" -- your brain hears you and as long as the choice isn't made it's an open loop and your brain keeps coming back with it...Close that door...*When I get a craving I tell myself "I'm not even going to think about this." Paying attention to cravings starts the cycle of aversion negotiating and discomfort.* (via u/Circus-Water) ..Giving in wont help. There is no "one drink" and there is no "just a drink today." Play the tape forward...Don't forget [why you don't drink](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6wqfaf/peace_of_mind/)..Use your [strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6s4q3b/what_works_for_me/)..Realize [you're worth it](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6qnr2c/why_i_drank/)..And don't forget the con man has [tried to con you before](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6pxt7j/forgetting_the_reasons_why_i_want_to_not_drink/)..**Stick** to not drinking **today**. Close the door. Tomorrow is another day.
There are meetings there.  And the big book and 12 and 12 are available on your smart phone.  You can follow right along...I'm been to meetings in other countries and sometimes they switch to English if a visitor is in town.  They'd be thrilled to have you!
