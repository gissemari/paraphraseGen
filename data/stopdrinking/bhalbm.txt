This is the first time I have attempted to get sober. I am feeling great and so happy that I did it. I know how to get past the awful cravings and how to keep busy. The thought of a drink right now makes me feel sick to my stomach...My concern is I am told that relapse is part of recovery. So what makes those of you who have been sober for a while relapse? It scares me even though I know not to listen to my lying brain. I so much want this to be the end of my relationship with alcohol and never plan on drinking again. However I am human just like everyone else so I wonder what makes a person give up being sober and drink again?  I know everyone has a different answer but if I can gather any info to make me prepared then it will help. Thanks

Complacency for me.
Relapses are very common. Like you said were are all only human. I try not to get content. We are always in recovery. Play that tape in your head over and over. Try and keep your past fresh. Cunning powerful and baffling this alcohol is. Know your triggers.
&gt;My concern is I am told that relapse is part of recovery...Relapse does NOT have to be part of recovery. It can indeed be "one and done." I had my last drink (room-temperature boxed white wine) almost four years ago and have not had a drink since...Congratulations on your month plus! You are doing great.
My relapses have all been because I thought I got it under control.  That I could have 1-2 drinks and not overdo it because I'd been clean for (2 days 2 weeks 2 months insert time here).  And if I had one night where I only drank 1-2 drinks then surely I could have a couple more tomorrow...At the end of the day I like drinking but I don't like the consequences of it.  So I have to realize that I can't drink only one.  And if I don't want to have a hangover tomorrow I shouldn't even drink one...I will not drink with you today.
Relapse **can** be a part of recovery.  And from my personal experience - it happens a lot...But...**not always and not for everyone.**  In the end it is different for everyone.  Avoid complacency (I see you doing that now) stay accountable with as many people as you can and avoid situations that endanger your sobriety.  That is the best advice I can give...Stay strong - you can do this...IWNDWYT.
Relapse is NOT a necessary part of recovery. It has not happened to me in over 36 years!
I have relapsed hundreds of times in sobriety into old ways of thinking.  If these go on long enough for me I will have to do something about it.  Luckily I have not had to drink...I woke on 100's of mornings and said I won't drink today and then drank.  But since i started going to AA and working on my ism i have not had to get drunk.  I have seen thousands of people come in on day 1 multiple times. so far it hasn't happened to me!
I'm a worry wart and am in the exact same place. Reading other's stories on here about relapse has really helped me. I need this to be the one and only time also. I know for a lot of people each consective relapse sends you into a worse spiral than you started with. I don't want to have to go through this again. Good luck to us both!
Relapse absolutely does not have to be a part of sobriety. I think that phrase is around to encourage folks to keep going if they DO relapse. But in my experience it is not a prerequisite to becoming sober. I have not yet relapsed and I don't plan on it (God willing and the creek don't rise!).
Relapses are always a possibility in the recovery process but they are a setback in the process rather than a part of it. Most of us are one drink away from backsliding into our old drunken habits. The comparison with quitting smoking is quite good.  While I know a few people who can have a couple of smokes and then go back to being a non smoker most of the smokers who I know who started smoking again kept smoking and some of them never quit. When you have been sober as long as I have you start to think you can drink moderately  that you can drink like a normal person. But nothing has really changed and you are still a dry alcoholic who wants to drink. There is no fairy dust that changes us into " normal drinkers".
My longest streak of sobriety was 66 days. Around the 30 day mark I started having this feeling of "I can drink one night. It won't kill me." Unfortunately that one night led to a binge that caused me to lose my girlfriend job and apartment within a two month span...&amp;#x200B;..I think boredom plays a large part in it for me. My routine was essentially work eat Youtube/Netflix sleep. I think being more active would be helpful for me at least. I'm not sure what your schedule is like but if you are staying busy that will probably be helpful.
