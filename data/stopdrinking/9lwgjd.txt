Finally made it to 4 weeks after trying what's felt like a million times. The last time I made it to 3 weeks but had a planned drinking day on a camping trip with friends. I think this is the longest I've been sober since I turned 18 which is pretty amazing. I've been trying harder this time I think which has helped. I listen to Home podcast basically everyday come here everyday and I've read/listened to 4 books on sobriety about women who were like me. I think that's what has been the most helpful is finding others with similar experiences within my same demographic. ..I never really fit what I saw as the typical alcoholic because my drinking seemed pretty normalized. And I still don't call myself one as it doesn't seem to fit me but I have a problem with alcohol and it's that I don't want to stop drinking once I start. ..My grandma has been an alcoholic for my moms entire life which never used to phase me. We always used to joke that she just loves her wine except now it's different. She's much older and her health is declining. The dementia is coming in faster and stronger than before as well as some heart problems. My mom gave her an ultimatum that she can either keep drinking and be put into a care home sooner or she can cut down drastically and my mom would do her best to keep her home as long as possible.....well you all know how that went. Not well. And that scared the crap out of me. I'm only 25 and I already saw myself in her. My family constantly says how alike we are but I don't want to be THAT much like her. ..My drinking really started to decline these last two years. Over the winter I could probably go through 5/6 bottles of wine in a week and that's not counting all the drinking on the weekends. It was absurd how much I was drinking. I was embarrassed because my old roommate is sober so anytime I brought a bottle home I just felt this heavy guilt. It's funny because she's probably one of the reasons I really started to think about my relationship with alcohol. ..When I first recognized it I started drinking more because it felt like it would be my last hurrah. My SO and I would go out and when we could come home he'd go to bed and I'd continue drinking downstairs. Just thinking about how I'm going to end up like my grandmother with my daughter asking me to cut down for my health and telling her no. That's what really killed me. The thought of my non existent children having to do that. So I decided I needed to stop and re-evaluate my relationship with alcohol. ..I'd like to say that the first week was hard but it's been a breeze from there...but it hasn't. I've had more bad days than good but the good days are freaking phenomenal. I was definitely self medicating. I was trying to fight off the depression I've struggled with since I was 13 but I'm able to recognize it better now and I'm being forced to deal with it instead of just drinking it away. I wake up and I'm clear headed. I'm able to go into work and see and feel that I'm doing a great job instead of thinking I'm going to get fired all the time. Heck I even got promoted. ..Being sober has been one of the best decisions I've made. I feel like I'm more present and more myself. I haven't made a single anxiety inducing decision in the last 4 weeks. I realized that every bad decision I ever made was fueled by alcohol and I don't want to live like that anymore ..This ended up being a lot longer than I thought it would be. I guess I just needed to get it out. ..Thanks for reading if you made it this far haha. ..IWNDWYT..PS. Does anyone else get headaches towards the end of the day? Feels like everyday around 2 I start to get a bad headache that doesn't go away until I go to sleep. Any other experiences with this?

Hi there!  There's a lot in the self-reflection of your post that resonated with me - thank you so much for sharing.  Like you I saw cautionary tales in my family and I definitely didn't want that to be me someday...Four weeks is amazing progress and it sounds like you've been working very diligently and intentionally toward that goal.  I hope sobriety continues to be a positive and rewarding state of being for you...Headaches?  Sometimes.  My sleep cycle is still extremely messed up.  No matter what time I go to bed I tend to be wide awake very early and  really drag through the second half of the day from exhaustion.  Feels like someone's been beating me with sticks by the time I drop into bed...Do you drink a lot of caffeine in the morning?  Headaches at the same time every day could be withdrawal from that perhaps.
