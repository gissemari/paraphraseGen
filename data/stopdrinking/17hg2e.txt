Now that I have been enjoying a stretch of sobriety I find that I come to this subreddit lesser and lesser. I am happy every time I see a badge reading 1day because it reminds me that the disease is still destroying my comrades. I am happy being sober but I must always remember how this subreddit helped me deal with my relapse. It now up to me to make sure I drop in everyday and pass on my message..

Good to read you're doing well!..I too drop in to share my experience strength and hope.  I also spend time reading these threads here and on the other recovery subs to learn.  I don't believe in ever being a finished product or having it down pat.  I must remain teachable.  There's always more book learning/memorization and additional methods to reach the alcoholic who's still suffering basically trying to prepare myself the best I can cause I can't share something I haven't got.  I believe that rings true at 6464 days or 23 days...Definitely continue to be apart of we're all better off from it!
