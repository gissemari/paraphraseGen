Fuck alcohol. I'm sick of thinking about it. I hate when my friends talk about the relief alcohol gives them. Now I feel like that relief was always fake.. the anxiety that followed the bliss FAR outweighed the bliss................................................................I'm 30 now. I have 6 months again. I have some other addictions I'm struggling with and it makes me feel like I'm still just a fuck-up but I know my life would be so much worse if I was drinking. At least these other addictions don't have consequences in my life as far as I can tell. I don't know. I've relapsed twice since I started getting serious about ditching the booze which was about 2 years and four months ago...I don't have any friends I can talk to about this. The only AA group within 100 miles is basically falling apart because they don't know how to structure themselves (South America). Not to mention my alcoholism was WAY more extreme than the other poeople in my group and people would seem surprised when I mentioned that I woke up on the street having pissed myself and stories like that... In the States I could say stuff like that and no one would bat an eye.. down here I'm like where are the other REAL alcoholics? haha...I'm extremely lonely. I'm afraid of my friends and family because I feel like they'll always just wait for me to screw up again. I love them and I want to talk to them but I'm always worried they're judging me or think I'm back on the sauce...I don't know SD I don't know why I'm writing this-- I don't even know what I feel exactly but it's not good. I wish I could cry either with happiness or sadness. I'm grateful I'm not drinking but I don't know how to deal with all of my problems...For a while there it seemed like I was okay and I was figuring things out and life was lush and full of possibility again. Now I'm back to feeling that constant sense of guilt and impending doom even though I can't really put my finger on why...Most random disjointed post ever. Just wanted to type something out to clear my head. I'm caught up in this weird cloudy mix of emotions and I also have a gnarly cold that's been making it hard to think even since Trump got elected...Well much love to all my fellow drunks out there. Thanks for reading. Let's not drink today. Sound good?

30 is so young you have so many good years ahead of you.  I'm sorry you're feeling in a rough spot right now sounds like you are a little isolated where you live.  Can you maybe participate in some online meetings?  I've seen links for them elsewhere but haven't participated in any yet.  You should be proud of the success you've had with your sobriety especially since you've done it pretty much on your own.  Sending you a virtual hug I will not drink with you today!
I have battles some other addictive behaviours too thankfully they weren't as destructive as alcohol was for me. I've made progress with them partly with support from SMART I was careful not to tether them to my drinking so when I slipped with one I wouldn't use that as an excuse to also drink. I just keep stepping forwards and doing what I can - I find strength in acceptance and just taking small steps on the things I can change today.
