And it's a Friday. Funny I don't really feel like taking a drink and I don't feel like I will later today. I plan on playing some video games tonight and chilling out. ..On a semi-related note I started doing some reading about AA and consequently Bill W. and stumbled onto his niacin megadose therapy for anxiety and depression and possibly alcoholism (it's just vitamin B-3 not a drug). I started a couple of days ago and I am feeling very... balanced. It's hard to explain but I think it may be helping. 1g three times a day following meals. Here's a link (one of many - Google is your friend) for anyone interested: http://www.foodmatters.tv/content/how-to-take-niacin-vitamin-b3-for-depression-and-anxiety. The Food Matters documentary talks about this stuff as well...NOTE: this is not medical advice. Do not take it as such. I like to use myself as a guinea pig. That said I am feeling one hell of a lot more balanced and in control than I was last Friday before I relapsed.

Good work /u/VerdantOasis.  So as to following Bill W's alternate therapies just avoid the LSD!  At least in Bill Wilson's day it wasn't "postage stamp."  
Good plan for tonight. Hop back on here if you start to get the itch!
http://www.doctoryourself.com/BOOK1BILL_W.pdf..Here's one of Bill W.'s letters to the doctors of AA. This is some fascinating stuff I must say.
