After some rough times in my life I made the decision to go to treatment and get clean from alcohol. I have never made a better choice in my life. Shout out to my mom for letting me back in her life and all my family and friends who have been there for support and of course to everyone in this sub! I still have a lot to work out but it will be so much easier without the burden of drinking everyday. I know I still have to stay on point and not relapse but I can honestly say for the first time in a long time that I am living a sober life!

Awesome.  Right beind ya..Keep it up!
Congratulations bruh. Rebuilding relationships and other things that alcoholic you completely destroyed is terrifying at first. Now that I'm a few months in and have a very sharp head on my shoulders it is really enjoyable and kind of gives me a rush. Good job and good luck on your sobriety.
