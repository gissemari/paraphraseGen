I've been looking forward to being home and reading posts here all night. I am a little emotionally overwhelmed as I read through all of your stories. I am especially struck by those who are/were struggling tonight. I was. And I didn't expect to be. This is hard work but it feels so good to know that we are in this together. I'm so proud of everyone who struggled and got through tonight. And I'm proud of anyone even thinking about recovering if they didn't make it tonight. This is an awesome group. It means a lot to read about you all. Happy New Year.
