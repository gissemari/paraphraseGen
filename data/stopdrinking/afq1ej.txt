I had almost 2 years at one time then sadly relapsed because I convinced myself I wasn't an alcoholic and that I didn't have a problem. After multiple bouts of struggling to put a few days together and being sick of the blackouts and constant insanity I hit a little milestone. I'm surprised I made it this far but I'm just gunna keep taking it one day at a time and remind myself that even though I fell I can always get back up. Thanks for listening (:

Great job great attitude!
Congrats! good stuff!
So cool I guess you feel so much better now. Keep going strong friend. :)
I wish I could say that I had a 2 year abstinence from my own monsters. I ruined too many relationships that were amazing. Sober for me for the rest of my life - because this is life and dead for me. I'm proud of you. We'll all get through this together. I will not drink with you today! 
Good for you. I'm laying here wishing I were you.
