First off let me say how thankful I am to how found this subreddit. I spend hours lurking yesterday and today. I've been battling alcoholism for years. My first real try was 5 years ago when I signed up for a six week out patient. That program did not really work for me because even though there were random urine tests I was drinking so much water that I never got caught if I had a beer the night before. It definitely slowed me down for a bit though....Fast forward to a year and a half ago after drinking super heavy 2 dui's countless job hoping broken relationships I went to rehab. I was only going to stay for 28 days but stayed for 4 months for fear of relapsing once I left. I couldn't afford 10k a month for the last 3 months but I got sponsored by my friends husband on the condition that I convince her to join me..She joined me for the 3 months and we got better...had fun even! As soon as we left the very night we got wasted. The next day I said "nope no more" but she didn't and I had to make the choice to stop our association. She died a month ago from alcohol related complications. I had randomly texted her the night before she died to check in (I felt that I was strong enough to handle being friends again maybe I could help)....I'm not certain if by the time I sent the olive branch text she was already dead....Then I got fired (what?wait!I have been good-how?!) got my car impounded (had no idea that I was driving on a suspension licence <Dr told dmv I was having withdrawal seizures years earlier>) and I just BROKE. .My BF went out of town (he doesn't drink) and I went into a full 7-9 day beinge that ended up with me in ER..It's been 14 days sober now after about a year and a half sober..I have the usual helplessness that comes with withdrawal. The initial 5-7 days of crippling anxiety and severe nausea. Still have the isomnia and anxiety (lessoned) just got back to healthy movements....I can't fathom a couple of things:.1. Why didn't I have any major physical complications? I deserve them!.2. Why can't my brain remember the good in being sober? My life didn't seem to get any better!.3. And of course how long are these awful feelings of guilt regret and shame going to last?..You would think that I would know by now.

Thanks for sharing that. I'm so sorry about your friend. That must be very painful especially on top of everything else. Keep coming back here. I'm new too. We can do this.
