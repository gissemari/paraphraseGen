1 year ago I decided to stop drinking!.1 year ago I decided I wanted better for myself.1 year ago I decided to start living a life I was proud of.1 year ago I decided to wake up out of the hypnosis...You fine folks here at SD helped me realize this was a completely doable option in life. Everyday I woke up and immediately declared "Today I will not drink!" I struggled sometimes I still struggle but I will not drink. Not today...I love my new life. Nothing has changed other than me not drinking. That is the greatest gift I have ever given myself. I feel whole again. I feel love again. I feel again! I am no longer numb to life's ups & downs I feel ever single part. And I love it all of it!..I can honestly say this is the probably the happiest day of my life..I am grateful!  I am happy! I am sober!....
