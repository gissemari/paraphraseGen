Something my friend texted me this morning I relapsed last night and my boyfriend broke up with me because I hid my bottle...I did this before my recovery...I'm miserable but I'm trying to stay positive.

Wise words...I found success when I let go of my pride and asked for support...The costs were far less than my mind imagined and would ndeed it was a net gain.  ..Whereas before I created false pride now I have authentic sobriety.
Sorry about your break up and well done on trying to stay positive through this. I'm sure you learnt a lot in the time you were sober before last night\- I hope that makes it easier to get back to it this time and you feel happier soon!  We're all rooting for you. IWNDWYT
