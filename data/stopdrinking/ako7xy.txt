I am  AWAKE - chillin' with the Lack of Sleep Monster. Been up for an hour -  the sun's not even close to being up FFS - mighta had 4 hours of sleep. I'm not drinking - so it is NOT that "wake up at 3:07 AM gasping for air running to chug water and waiting for my heart to return to a semi-normal rate and stop pounding" thing. I have not written in a  while so I figured I may as well purge a bit. Time to come clean...&amp;#x200B;..Last year when I began this journey to heal following a diagnosis of PTSD and complex trauma turning up a bottle of whiskey and a failed suicide attempt I was on here daily. This sub helped me immensely - to stop drinking and smoking cigarettes - but it was much more than that for me: I felt like a part of a gigantic loving family. It felt good to know that we were all in this together to be allowed to be a part of and assist in whatever small way with everyone's struggles cheer when we hit milestones and to help pick each other back up when we fell helped me get through some incredibly dark days. If I truly think about it I have never had anything in my life be so consistently positive for me as this sub has been. ..&amp;#x200B;..Things got better for me.  I rerouted my escapist tendencies into positive outdoor activities (escaping into the woods for long hikes/runs etc.). Running was my therapy...&amp;#x200B;..After coming off of substances there I WAS. There IT was: PTSD and a lifetime of lingering trauma that I somehow had/have to deal with. Tried AA meetings SMART meetings therapy etc. but nothing stuck...&amp;#x200B;..I heard on more than one occasion:.."So you have effectively spent your whole life trying to avoid dealing with this."..Correct. In fact to prove how good I was at NOT DEALING - at some point in October - I just gave up completely and went into a free-fall...&amp;#x200B;..I did not simply stumble and fall - I blasted off akin to a double back-flip triple twist FAIL resulting into a face-first pavement nose-dive off the rails $hIt-storm at the mid to end of 2018 into extreme self-destruct mode. ..&amp;#x200B;..This is not a resetting my badge post - that would take away from all the work that I have done - but it is time that I am honest with you and with myself. While I had managed sobriety and getting off the coffin nails I did nothing to remedy that aching loneliness I had - I just retreated further inward...&amp;#x200B;..So I'm back SD cause it turns out I need you...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT..&amp;#x200B;..tl:dr SD I have missed you. Gonna be around more if that's ok?..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
