sorry for the bad title. .TLDR: I'm unable to consistently get wine as a daily drinker and i need advice/support from people in similar situations thank you &lt;3..I recently injured my leg meaning i'm i've been off work for a week and the next week and unable to drive meaning i'm unable to sneak a cheeky alcohol purchase.... (im a daily drinker) A few days ago i managed to get to the shop alone to get a few boxes of wine but got caught so really i can't purchase anymore wine in front of anyone without them questioning what happened to the two boxes everyone in the house knows i got. I'm very very anxious about running out (which i def will tomorrow) both for my dependency reasons and withdrawal reasons. Has anyone been in a similar situation and how did you cope?? You guys have been so good to me and i'd very much appreciate some support right now thank you &lt;3

I'm sorry about your injury...Are you seeking to stop drinking?..If you're seeking info about alcohol withdrawal click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_alcohol_withdrawal) and PLEASE visit your doctor. WD's are dangerous and can be fatal...If you're under the care of a doctor for your injury perhaps you can be honest with him/her and let them know about your concern? Let them know how much you're truly drinking?..Believe it or not there's no shame and nothing to be embarrassed about. Doctors *want* us to get well and they are here to *help us*...Also if you're on medications for your injury please remember that mixing alcohol and med's is very dangerous. I hope that you have someone staying with you that can help you...Please keep us posted I'm wishing you the best and hope you feel better soon :).
The best first step for me was being honest...I told people what was going on and I needed support...Then I didn't have to lie have secrets and I got some help!..The weight of the shame was lifted.
