Hey all. I'm struggling to get through the weekends without binging. I can do mon - thurs with relative ease but as soon as it hits Friday I just go into autopilot mode and buy/drink alcohol leading me to feel crap every single Monday. ..I've tried AA before and it didn't really ever make me want to stop drinking.I would still just go onto autopilot come Friday. I love reading so could anyone recommend any good books on sobriety (and sticking to it?)..Thanks

I do not know about sobriety but reading books on improving myself as a person has helped me greatly because it helps me focus on why I am sober- to make me the best functioning human I can be...7 Habits is a great book. I also really loved The Wealthy Barber and The Rules of Work.

Why do you expect to want to stop drinking?..I've learned to accept the feelings that are inside of me including the (now occasional) desire to drink. The key is to understand that just because you have the feeling you don't have to act on it...The way I was able to stop drinking was to be *completely* ready for the Friday autopilot you speak of. Have a plan. For me I ate a big dinner and hung out in the stopdrinking IRC channel all night.
Welcome /u/BlueprintMew to r/stopdrinking.  There is lots of information on recovery accessible at the ------------&gt; sidebar.
AA can't make you want to stop drinking; that willingness is the thing you have to bring to it. It took almost dying for me to reach that point--but I'm glad I finally did!
My big book is One Breath At A Time Buddhism and the 12 Steps by Kevin Griffin. Not directly about addictions but you will easily see the parallels is Malcolm Gladwell's David and Goliath. 
Basically what I have been doing is waking up early 7-9am and just finding DIY projects around the house...Being unemployed sucks but I have been able to keep myself into a working schedule that involved projects like replacing a vanity tree work property clean up and just general maintenance for my parents house. ..These 2 things have really helped me overcome my lethargy and befoggment of my last few months of sobriety (especially this last month) I also hit the gym 4x a week and do strength training and i love running at twilight/night. ..I have a job interview in a few hours and I am praying on that. ..Find a beginners meeting and a sponsor that isn't super fundamental but more of a realist and work yourself tired so you want to sleep by 9-10 PM. ..I hope some of this helps and take care friend
Not necessarily about sobriety per se but I found The Untethered Soul to be a great book. ..Here is a little detail about it: ..The chapters of this book are nothing but mirrors for seeing your ''self'' from different angles. And though the journey we are about to embark on is an inner one it will draw upon every aspect of your life. The only requirement asked of you is the willingness to honestly look at yourself in the most natural intuitive manner. Remember if we are seeking the root of ''self'' what we are actually seeking is you. As you read through these pages you will find that you know much more than you thought you did about some very deep subjects. The fact is you already know how to find yourself; you have just gotten distracted and disoriented. Once refocused you will realize that you not only have the ability to find yourself you have the ability to free yourself. Whether you choose to do so or not is entirely up to you. But upon completion of your journey through these chapters there will be no more confusion no more lack of empowerment and no more blaming others. You will know exactly what must be done. And should you choose to devote yourself to the ongoing journey of self-realization you will develop a tremendous sense of respect for who you really are. It is only then that you will come to appreciate the full depth of meaning in the advice: ''This above all: to thine own self be true.''
