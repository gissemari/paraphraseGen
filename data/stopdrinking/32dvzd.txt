hey SD..Checking in here - happy Sunday! Last time I posted was about 2 weeks ago the morning after my first night of going to bed without drinking. I'm thrilled to report that I haven't touched a drop since then and am super stoked to hit two weeks tomorrow! This may be a bit of a ramble fair warning but I thought I'd provide an update.....**Improvements**: ..* Sleep: I'm sleeping so much better! I'm still adjusting but already love going to bed sober. If/when I get a bad craving I think about how much I used to hate how I felt when I woke up after drinking the night before and the craving goes away. My bedtime time fluctuates but I go to bed when I'm ready and love being hangover-free in the morning..* Nutrition: I'm eating WAY healthier. When I was drinking I craved grease ALL the time. Now I'm craving super healthy stuff and my body is thanking me for it. My GI tract is very thankful as is the rest of my body. I'm also taking a ton of vitamins. Not sure what sobriety/recovery would feel like without taking them but I don't want to risk knowing. .* Physical health: I went to the doctor last week my blood pressure was great. I've also started exercising again and love the idea of regaining all the muscle I lost over the years due to atrophy whilst drinking..* Mental health: It might be in my head but I feel more mentally stable considerate and way less angry. Also I went out last night with friends and I thought I was hilarious. :) I'm laughing so much more and thinking more clearly! ..**Struggles**: ..* Sleep: Week 1 was hard. I had shakes and sweats while sleeping and very vivid dreams. I'm still waking up at times during the night to eat but I'm taking the advice of this sub and being kind to myself while I'm recovering and letting my body have what it wants. .* Nutrition: Yes I've been craving sweets... and consequently I've gained a couple of pounds. I've always loved water and seltzer and I drink about 2L a day at least now just without the need to try and cure a hangover with them. I pee ALL THE TIME. Overshare? Maybe but at least my body isn't trying to process alcohol now. .* Physical Health: Day 2 was the worst so far as I had a day-long headache that can only be compared to what a migraine must feel like. Otherwise this one's a double-edged sword. I'm struggling with the fact that now that I'm sober I have more energy but still am very physically weak. That whole "couldn't walk a flight of stairs" bit I keep seeing across your posts? That was me 100%. I'm anxious because I want to feel better NOW. I know it won't happen overnight and while I try and keep that in mind I can't help but feel a little sad that I've hurt myself for so long. The other part of this struggle is that I might be overdoing it on the physical exercise as a response. That is I'm exercising like I used to before I fell down this hole and my body is aching as a result. .* Mental Health: Whoa Nelly. /r/stopdrinking friends - WTF mate? My emotions were in a glass case and it feels like [the bad man punted Baxter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fmHCNfowbQ). I know I know.. I'm experiencing raw sober life. But shit man this is crazy. Being more aware of my life and surroundings makes me over examine everything which makes me feel lonely and sad and I don't know how to shake that. ..Also the brain fog. It needs to go away ASAP. I want to get on with living my life!..I guess I'm just looking for advice empathy encouragement something. This is all so new to me and I really wanted to share. Perhaps I should start keeping a journal? ..[Thanks for reading SDers!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiQzUEc_FmI)..TL;DR: I'm 13 days sober for the first time in 7 years recapped the good and bad of the last two weeks... and I guess I have a lot to say.
