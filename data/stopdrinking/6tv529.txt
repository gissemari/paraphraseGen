And it had been about 30 days since my last drink.  Why should I pretend I'm as weak as these other idiots that can't stop after a few drinks?  I just needed about a month to get it under control and everything was going to run like clockwork now.  Why should I deny myself a small token of enjoyment in this life when the day looks this nice and I'm out here doing yardwork with my shirt off?  .Well I found out why.  It really is impossible isn't it?  To go back and enjoy a drink and call it a day?  I didn't go overboard I even had enough restraint to only buy 3 airplane bottles instead of another pint (or more) on my late midnight run to the store after the big bottle was gone.  I sucked those down and sat on the edge of my bed while my wife rambled on about something.  A few weeks ago I was more fit and trim.  I was getting up at 5:30am and working out before work.  I had increased my business and income significantly.  I was just STRONGER.  I didn't even get an enjoyable buzz from my adventure all I felt was weak.  And of course the crushing blow of starting over again is so sad.  But no damage was done this time to any relationships or the house framing.  I hope this is my last relapse.  I'll not be drinking tonight.  I hope.

Funny how something we "loved" turns into just a monkey on our backs and not worth it. Good for you for starting fresh! I will not drink with you today
