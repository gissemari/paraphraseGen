I have been keeping this past week of beginning my sobriety journey to myself my husband and one other person...but today I decided I needed to seek more support in my immediate circle of people.  I told my mother and step father and two of my closest friends.  My friends knew I had/have a problem and apparently my stepdad suspected for a while...but every one of them are supportive of the struggle I'm going through and my Mom is going to accompany me to an open AA group meeting this coming Friday.  It is a huge relief to be able to share with the people I love.  I'm still afraid I'll disappoint everyone if I relapse and I know I'm so early on in this process but I think I'll be more likely to stick with it with people in my corner in addition to the AA people.  Hope all of you are doing well this Memorial Day.  Stay sober my friends!

Good for you.  I normally tell newcomers not to talk too much about trying to stop drinking or get sober via AA--largely because over a long time my words and promises were pretty damn empty.  And trying to come clean about alcohol and recovery sets up expectations that might be too hard to live up to--then cause further disillusionment.  Instead I suggest that our friends family and co-workers should learn from our consistent daily sober actions.  ..On the other hand I'm excited for you /u/NonnyMouse69 I figure you have the right attitude out of the gate.  Good luck with this.
