Hi all!..I thought Tuesday might be a difficult one because Tuesday is usually the point in the working week where I really fancy a glass of wine after work. ..Prior to this sobriety thing my pattern was - drink too much Friday or Saturday (sometimes both) spend Sunday recovering spend Monday resolving to be better - get to the end of Tuesday and feel like I deserved a drink for getting through 2 work days. I would open a bottle of wine on Tuesday finish it Wednesday drink with a pal Thursday and then have a blowout Friday. Rinse repeat...Anyway this didn't happen because I got this tummy bug thing which is going around my office (well I think maybe I did? part of me wonders if I succumbed to a social contagion. Either way am off today and I was off yesterday)..This made not drinking easy as I didn't feel I 'deserved' a drink hell I wasn't sure I deserved to be off work at all - but there you go!..Today am off again so I don't think this will be that difficult either. ..Still eating too much sugar but that I will deal with later. ..Anyway - thanks for the continued support!..Anyone else here not really an alcoholic but giving up to get control back? Like I definitely drank too much and often drank more than I wanted to but I could always stop.  I am inspired by a lot of the stories on this reddit and send out support to people who are struggling with addiction it seems like a different harder path. ..

I think a lot of us don't self-identify as "alcoholics" and I also think the thinking on that term has evolved. The medical mumbo-jumbo is now "alcohol use disorder" or something like that which acknowledges that there's a broad spectrum of drinking problems.  I think we have all known "problem drinkers" who don't necessarily meet the stereotype of an alcoholic but that doesn't mean they don't have a problem that they should address.  Indeed many (if not most) of us ARE that person. Some people binge and make asses of themselves four times a month some people secretly tipple all day some are knock-down drag-out drunks all of us feel like enough is enough and it's good to have friends in the struggle.
Alcoholism is progressive. I could stop just fine until I couldn't anymore.
