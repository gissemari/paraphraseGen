I hit my one year sober the day after Thanksgiving and it came and went like any other day. This didn't bother me much but as Christmas Eve rolled around I began to struggle with my sobriety and with being around people who were drinking. From then until a couple days after New Year's was a roller coaster ride I hadn't experienced since first deciding to not drink. I'm sporadic on the sub but I happened to be on when I saw u/Nika65 's offer to send a 1 Year coin to anyone who replied. I wasnt sure I deserved one since I'm not here consistently but Nika assured me I did and said the coin would come a little after the New Year. I got mine a couple days ago and have kept it with me since. It's the physical representation of my sobriety that I needed to help me re-up my motivation to not drink. It's not just the coin but the serenity prayer on the back of it; this is a prayer I've said to myself in my darkest and most trying moments. ..So all this to say a heartfelt thank you to Nika and this sub. You guys are always here when I need you most. Thank you thank you thank you...[Picture of coin plus bonus of dog just because](http://imgur.com/a/pcZxH)
