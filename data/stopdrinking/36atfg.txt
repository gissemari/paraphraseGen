I had a pretty strong urge come over me today and one of the things that helped me was the quote from House of Cards "Fuck the Zero". For anyone who hasn't seen or read this quote I highly encourage you to do so...Video link: http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=12b_1384285231.Image link: http://imgur.com/r/GetMotivated/zTc0MFR..Also for anyone who hasn't watched House of Cards I also highly recommend that. There are a couple main characters who acknowledge themselves as alcoholics and the show does a good job of laying out their struggles.

The struggle is real. I think House of Cards has helped me visualize just how much I do NOT want to relapse!..FTZ!
I use a "don't break the chain" calendar app on my phone to keep track of a few things but also my sobriety.  My sober chain is titled "Fuck the Zero".  Checking into it every day makes me feel like Success Kid haha.
I'm not a fan of counting days because when I relapsed last year the *zero* literally demotivated me. I knew how much work It would be to get back to my 400something days so I simply continued to drink...Now I'm living day by day without any pressure. 
Damn now I have to rewatch Season 1... HOC is my shit
Just a side note if you're interested in political dramas and/or strong TV characters that struggle with alcoholism then check out The West Wing. One of the main characters (Leo who is the chief of staff for President Bartlet) is a recovering alcoholic and it's great to see how his character deals with it and how it affects his life. ..Plus it's an AMAZING show. 
(Quickly setting down soapbox...ahem) Watch **The Wire** if you want to see amazing portrayals of what addiction can do! Also has lots of politics as well. Best show ever! Thank you (steps off soapbox)
That is a lot of high recommending and encouraging. 
Just can't comprehend that level of addiction. 5185 days and he is still counting in days and struggling. Wow. I am glad that I never reached that point. But doing it a day at a time works and is way better than drinking.
