I woke this morning laid there for a bit wishing I could go back to sleep. My sober self rises every morning at 5:45 ready for the day. But having a few beers guy is not that motivated...So VE reset my badge or actually removed it at my request. I did have a moment of clarity this morning over coffee on the deck. I want to share because I know I am not alone here...I need to approach this at a slightly different angle for it to work for me. I like goals but I mostly look at the sum of things. I take the good and bad and mix them together to arrive at what I hope is a good place...I have been reading and seeing the struggles of people it takes a bit of a toll on me. I do not like to see people hurting or even a dog limping lol...I am going to view my sum of sober days to my beer drinking days. Today I have 55 days of the last 60 I have been sober. It is more than I have before...I have to take the 55 and hang on to that for me. I can build on that is my feeling. I want to build on that. I am still here...So that's me my struggle. My struggle is small comparatively. I wish you all good health. .OTC

Yes!  The percent Sober is a useful ratio!  You've been sober 91% of the last 60 days.  Quite an accomplishment no?  ..Keep adding to it.
Great way to look at it!.This is the kind of math that makes sense to me!
Thank you for this. I have not been perfect but I see progress. I am choosing to focus on the positive rather than beat myself up over the negative as shaming myself becomes a trigger. I try to make more choices that I am proud of (not drinking) that will continue to crowd out and replace the decision to drink. I am being mindful of whatever choice I make and how it makes me feel physically and emotionally.
