I was about 140+ days sober previously and relapsed last week. got sobered up this week and got past the anxiety/shakes/etc. I have always played and enjoyed music this evening I'm out with a friend's band who's playing a wedding as I help with all the grunt work &amp; running the board. the kind folks who are paying us all super well insisted there's no amount they mind paying for at the bar for us. months or years ago I would be slobbering...I almost wish I was on Antabuse or something
