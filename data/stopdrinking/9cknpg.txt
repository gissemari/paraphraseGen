Hi everyone..First off IWNDWYT! I am quite new but I feel as if I have found a new home in this community. TY!..Yesterday I shared a quote that many here found helpful. This made me think it might be nice to crowd source a list of useful quotesmantras or short stories that could help us get through a tough day. ..So I'll get it started with the quote I shared from Barrack Obama's eulogy for John McCain. It is a quote from Sen. McCain's favorite book For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway. It is a book about one man's struggle during the Spanish Revolution. .. Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today..." - E. Hemingway

Not so much a mantra but a little motivational clip from Jocko Willink that has helped me a lot as of late:..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdTMDpizis8."If you can say the word 'Good'; guess what it means you're still alive. It means you're still breathing."
Gil Clancy to George Foreman going into the 5th round of his Elric battle with Ron Lyle." who wants it most" 
Breathe deeply stay calm and the perceived threat will pass...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKV9dJzqDs &lt;--- Watch with the sound on.  :)  
The present moment is an arrow shot into the future.
