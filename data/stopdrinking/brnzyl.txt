Finally broke down. I told my boyfriend of 6 years whom I live with about the severity of my awful secret drinking habits. I feel so relieved. He was so kind and loving he just understood the hell ive been going through and saw the struggle in me. I finally feel set free like I can do anything and that we can conquer everything together...The fear of being found out actually made me so anxious that I drank more than I ever wanted to. If you look back at my first post here I was so stressed and miserable every moment I was awake. Before he would get so mad when he found out I drank without asking or drank to excess which turned me into a huge liar and in return made me feel like shit. I'm going to finally be able to be straight up and honest when I slip up. I really feel like now that I'm not hiding anything I don't even really feel the desire to drink secretly. Whew had to share! ^__^

Good for you for being honest with him! That has to be a huge weight off of you!  Now you both can support each other in your sobriety! IWNDWYT
Telling my SO and immediate family was one of the better things I did. ..That was the biggest difference between stopping this time and stopping other times. Previously it was "... to lose weight" or "... just taking a break" but telling family that I really just wanted to stop outright helped them help me.
