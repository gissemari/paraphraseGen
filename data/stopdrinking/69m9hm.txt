Typical: relapsed again. Day 2 of my sobriety. .- 7 day bender drinking 1L of whiskey a day..- Missed 5-days straight at a new firm - after being off work for 6-7Ms - b/c I was in no condition to pretend. Barely notified them. Don't know what to tell them before. Was admitted into the ER so I could say "medical emergency". .-I'm a lawyer and I have no idea if I'm ready to go back to work (my parents think I need to quit my job focus on my health and will support me financially)..- Fortunately single so not ruining much more lives than my immediate family/friends. And my own. .- Considering a Treatment Facility but the costs are so substantial. Parents can scrape together their savings to send me but I'm scared I'll just waste it; I'll do what I did from Sept 2016-Present-Day: quit for 30 Days-start drinking casually-10 Day binge-quit for 30 days-7 day binge-quit for 6/7 weeks-10 Day binge-quit for 4 weeks-small relapse-quit for 30 days-present-day..- Not sure what to do in the alternative 90 meetings 90 days AA. the books the podcast the counseling etc. ..No idea what the best course of action to fight for my health. No idea whether to quit a job I'm so lucky to have. No idea how to talk to my firm. .

Parents will support you while you take off work and focus on health?  Man I would so jump all over that.  I do 90 days inpatient get healthy mind body and soul you can make all the money after that!
That's tough.  I have the same job as you so I know how stressful it can be.  About two years ago I did 5 days at an outpatient dual diagnosis program - it went until 2:30pm every day so I went to work in the afternoons for a few hours.  It was a great decision as it gave me some new tools to manage stress and drinking.  I personally had to get myself healthy so I could focus on work.  Otherwise I was a mess and not doing a great job.  This sub has been awesome for support.  Glad you're here!
