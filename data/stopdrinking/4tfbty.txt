I've been tracking my progress and pitfalls since I joined here a few months ago and I realized that if I make it through tomorrow I'll have beat my most recent streak...If I make it through the entire week I'll have surpassed the streak just before the most recent one and have accumulated my highest number of consistent days sober for the year...This time around feels different. There's not so much of a struggle because I want to get better far more than I want to drink. There's almost nothing in the drink for me anymore but self-destruction inner turmoil weakness and pain. There's still that little delusion that places value on an intoxicated sigh of relief but the price tag on that elusive fleeting sensation is now beyond anything I can afford...Though I'm looking ahead I still have only today to work on. My commitment to sobriety is for today first. I'll not drink with you today.
