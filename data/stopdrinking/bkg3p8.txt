All it took was a couple of alcohol withdrawal seizures. Then I knew it was my life or the booze. ..I chose to live. ..I'm lucky that happened before my dependency grew stronger. I drank from 16-22 approaching 6 drinks per night every night. I finished my career with my second seizure. The first I thought was an anomaly -- the second I knew was the booze...Thank God I was asleep when it happened instead of driving.....I'm 25 now. Relapsed a couple times but overall I feel blessed to have faced such a clear and timely choice. ..My uncle died of drink. My mom has 10 or more a night. ..I take 500mg of Keppra instead and fall into a deep and restful sleep.
