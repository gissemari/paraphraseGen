I know I'm probably not alone in this. I've been struggling with binge drinking since it's been legal for me to drink. ..I love being amongst people and when it's time for me to go home I never ever do of free will. I am always the last one out. I'm always out too late I never chose to go home. ..It used to be because I was unhappy at home. It's not really the case anymore. I just stay where the drink is...I want to be able to have a good time with my friends but also being able to have the strength to say I don't want a drink and to not feel pressured into doing it...I've got such a shit weak will. I know I shouldn't be drinking and then I have a bottle in my hand and drink away the sinking feeling that I shouldn't be doing it then it comes back with vengeance but also with a free hangover...I do drugs when they're offered to me I can never say no to these sort of things. It ends up with me wrecked at someone's house and they just want me to leave...I'm sorry I'm ranting. My partner bless him he likes trying to fix my problems. He never understood why I couldn't just have one drink. He is joining me in quitting drinking after we had a stupid argument encouraged by me not wanting to go home and him angry and screaming at me because he was drunk...I'm happy to be leaving it behind. For good...I will not drink with you tonight. Nor will I ever stay out too late out of obligation.

&gt; I've got such a shit weak will...I used to think that about myself. I still do sometimes. Drinking cigs drugs ... anything that was offered to me I couldn't say no. Reading This Naked Mind really helped with the drinking part. It totally "flipped a switch" on how I see alcohol so I don't really crave it anymore. Definitely recommended it you haven't read it yet. She also has a YouTube Channel. ..Since I've had some success with not drinking the last 3 weeks or so I've cut way down on smoking which is a great feeling. And now that I'm not hanging out with a bunch of drunk folks all the time I don't have drugs around to tempt me. ..I've been hearing the term "JOMO" around here -- the Joy Of Missing Out. I know it sucks when you can't go out and party with your friends but chilling at home and doing something low-key also has it's advantages. So I've been embracing that while going out and doing some social stuff but definitely not over-doing it. ..I like to keep lots of seltzer at home. It's a good substitute for a drink. And whenever I go out I always have a club soda with a lime in my hand. You got this. IWNDWYT
A few things about your post stick out to me.  You don't "suck" at partying and you don't have a weak will.  Having addiction issues isn't a moral failing it doesn't mean you're not trying hard enough or you're "bad" at something.  You are biologically programmed to keep drinking once you start.... that's exactly what addiction is.  Trying to get better at drinking isn't going to work its just not humanly possible for someone who's addicted.  It's like the idea where you keep getting into the boxing ring with booze and fighting it hoping this time you'll win this time it'll be different.  But you CANNOT win against this opponent. no matter what you do.  The only way to "win" is to not step into the ring.
