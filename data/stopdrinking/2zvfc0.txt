Accidentally realised I've hit the 90 day mark for being sober. This'll be a short post but I've made it this far - have never been this long without a drink since I gave up teetolling in 2005...These three months haven't been without their challenges (I haven't gone to any gigs for example and have skipped work EOW functions) but given I was largely a solo drinker this milestone is pretty freakin awesome. ..A key thing I found was treating going sober the same way I treated giving up cigarettes. Change my habits substitute when I needed to (gained 2kg from chocolate in first month) expand the areas of my life that have always been alcohol free...The struggle is not over but this feeling right now is so freakin good.

This is inspiring to read. I'm on my 42nd day and sometimes it gets rough. I hope to never have a drop again.
Yes keep doing
