Hey guys. I'm not new to the sub but this account is here so I can talk some stuff out without messing up my other account (that's what happens when you get in too deep with reddit!)...I'm sober at the moment. 24 days today. I did have 8 months last year. Fell away from AA when I moved house thought I was doing ok. Thought I was sorted both on this side of things and the issues I was dealing with on the side...I wanted to believe I was ok. I had to convince myself that I was ok because my career matters more than any other thing. I'm in the military. It's my life and I love it. And because I had asked for help with the shit that is wrong in my head I got help saw a psych - but also got made medically unfit to deploy...Long story same as for everyone here. Issues at home as a kid. I was a good kid the good kid. Made up for my sister and her bipolar. Undiagnosed for a while. Sh caused hell. So much fucking trouble. Always has to be the centre of attention (I'm maybe a touch bitter yes?). She would threaten me with a knife sometimes threaten to kill me. Or to run away. Different options. Didn't go down real well for me did it. I thought I was doing the right thing by handling her not telling our parents. And then handling the fallout from all the other fucking games she would play with our family. She could be a bitch...Didn't drink til I was 18. Good kid remember? Did well in school came home on time all that. Boyfriend introduced me to cans of rum and coke and man was that shit good. Not his fault that one day a bottle of vodka split between us one night morphed into a way for me to try to drink away the fucking darkness. I was having nightmares by that stage thanks to my sister's crap I'm guessing. Stressed from final year of highschool and applying for the military and family shit. Standard shit. Nothing special at all. But nightmares that I was being raped by people I knew or chased and attacked by shadowy figures. Fun times...Join the military it's good. We all drink though that's military life. That's what we do to relax! Getting hammered every weekend and then some...End of second year we're at out end of year piss up. Dinner and drinks then after drinks at a pub. That's where and when I got raped. It happened in part because I was drunk off my face. My fault for letting myself be in a risky situation not having the sense to realise I was seperated from my friends or that talking to this guy wasn't good. Too drunk to remember the details when I reported to the cops. So drunk I questioned myself...Life happens it sucks sometimes...So drinking now as a way to numb the pain a way to get to sleep a way to relax. Chase off the nightmares and the fear. Drinking is always a part of life even though some days and some periods were better than others. Had whole periods where I thought I was ok. But drinking. Still the military way of life. Get away with it mostly...2013 five years after I got raped things fell apart. I fell apart. Had to take some leave after a stressful busy period. Two weeks of sitting on the couch not wanting to sleep just wanting to drink barely functioning. Suicidal keep picturing hanging myself from a tree in the backyard. Wanted that fucking relief from the pain of it all but could never bring myself to because I didn't want to fuck up the day of some cop or paramedic who would have to cut me down. Thought family and friends and boyfriend would all be fine without me. Better without me. But I didn't want to fuck up some random emergency service member's day. Guess I'm considerate like that. ..Man up. One of my friends has PTSD from going overseas and doing the job. If he can ask for help so can I. See a doc get to see a psych after a month or so. In the meantime get drunk so I can have sex and be intimate. Get drunk so I can socialise and feel like a real person even if I never actually relax. Get drunk so I can feel something. Sometimes get drunk masturbate and cry afterwards with how much I hated myself and everything about myself. But I felt something I guess...Stop drinking after a couple of months of seeing the psych. Helps me get a clearer head. Helps me see a way ahead out of some of the mire of crap in my head. Things get better...But I don't really do enough with the psych. She away from going deeper. She doesn't push as much as I had hoped. And then I need to wrap it up so I can get made medically fit to go to sea. Can't let this fuck up my job...And I said I was fine. I thought I was fine. But now the fucking depression is creeping back into me. Can't remember when I was last happy. Can't remember when I really felt ok. This sucks. It sucks a lot. I'm doing all the right things. Eat right. Exercise often. Get outside. Take the meds. Ok only most things. Sleep I still fall apart a bit on. I don't like risking the nightmares so I don't sleep enough on purpose.  But I try...PTSD and depression will be what kills me. Alcohol is just one of the tools and a very good one. If I had been getting drunk in this last week I probably would have followed through on some of those shitty suicidal thoughts. Not planning on doing anything don't worry. But the bad periods of depression drag me down. They're hard to accept hard to deal with...So I have to stay sober not just for that though. I don't want to fuck up my professional reputation. I don't want to be that one who always gets drunk. Don't want to be sitting in the gutter after being kicked out of bars. Ruining my work performance by being hungover. Worried about random breath tests both while driving and at work. Can't do that. The extra stress of trying to keep everything in balance is hard. Very hard. Too hard. Can never really keep it all together...I'm staying sober for who I can be. I might have a worthwhile future. Have to stay sober for that...But neither drunkeness nor sobriety help quiet the demons in my mind. I am struggling still. I will admit that I'm depressed. That's hard enough. I will admit I am an alcoholic. Because I really am. But I still don't have things figured out I'm still far from feeling ok in myself.

Thanks for the post.  I am a lot older than you and I managed depression/ mania by drinking for years.  Met a shrink who helped m w CBT and meds. But The longer the drinking. went on the more depressed I got.  Sounds to me like maybe your depression is not well treated and I bet that would be a big help to you!
My mind was really all over the place the first 2 months.  Once I got past it I started to feel a lot better.  FWIW I also attend therapy both by myself and with my partner (I also go to recovery meetings alone which helps me sort through the head crazies).  Is digging in deeper in therapy an option for you?  Can you maybe talk to the therapist about your concerns?
