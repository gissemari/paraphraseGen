I'm struggling. I'm going to be a bit vague here but I might be burning some bridges with a few friends right now and I'm wondering if I'm the asshole in the situation. I don't know. I might be....It's making me want to get very drunk. I find myself planning relapses. Ever since a close call in september I've had moments when I just wanted to go out to get a bottle. And tonight I really want it bad. I've changed my mind several times already tonight...Damn it. I think I'm over the worst of it for today but goddamn....I need to address this craving soon. It's a problem.

  You might be the asshole won't be the last time.  Drinking will not improve anything.  You almost have a year.  Take a walk take a deep breath.
Wow 339 days is impressive. That is worth cherishing and protecting!
When I do asshole things I know I have a choice: be an asshole or be a drunk asshole - and then go through weeks and months of craving and drinking which will make me an *infinitely* bigger asshole.
