Have struggled lately (year or so) with big benders. Have been stressed financially lately then recently landed a side job that will be a temporary boost until hopefully something more permanent comes along...Worked a couple days on it and thought well I feel good guess it's time for a little celebration... with booze. It wasn't a bender this time in fact worked the next day but God I felt like shit! Reminder to self: Moderation is not in your DNA.

I hear you. I used a vacation week to experiment with moderation and basically even without overt hangovers I knew I was getting poorer sleep and I felt my motivation to accomplish things dwindling. 
Hey buddy!! Always a pleasure to see you around here man.  Glad you cut that bender off!  Yesss!  Hi5s!
