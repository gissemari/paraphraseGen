After multiple attempts of quitting and two weeks of sneaking drinks getting drunk alone and lying to my wonderful boyfriend I am quitting again.  I hope this time it sticks.  Going to my first meeting of this year tonight.  ..The emotional pain isn't worth it and I'm disappointing the closest people in my life who know me and love me.  I relapsed really hard because my case will finally be settled.  I want to put all this past me...I'm just so tired.

Welcome! I could've written your post. Complete with the DUI not making me stop. Why don't you request a badge? It's fun to see the days pile up! Good luck.
Don't drive by the liquor store. I get an almost physical reaction to the places I bought booze. Try to go another way. It might sound stupid but for me it's easier if I don't see the place at all for now. Maybe for you too? 
Everyone starts at day 1.  Enjoy the ride.  Good luck
