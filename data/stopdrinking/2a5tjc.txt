It hasent even been a week yet and I haven't been able to make it to ten days. (Ive reset my badge three times) Ive adopted a small set of rules that I thought might help with my sobriety and Ive been following them (AA morning routine eating healthy). When I relapsed I realised that I also had to have an honest conversation with my family and friends that it was necessary to my sobriety. Each time I relapse ive been trying to add on something different that I wasn't doing before. I'm a firm believer that if something doesn't work once why expect the same result a second time. ..Anyway my first thought when I woke up this morning was "I really want a morning beer." I guess i'm writing this to stay accountable to remind myself that I both want and need this. I'm going to a meeting later on and I made a promise to myself that the only thing ill be drinking until that meeting is water and coffee. ..Thanks for listening!

Good on you! Wise to learn early that when you start again doing something different is necessary. If for no other reason than if you pick up and do the exact same thing expecting a different result is the exact definition of insanity....which is what got us here to begin with!
If you can get some phone numbers off a few of the members in AA just for tough times. It worked for me.  Good luck.
