Kinda of a long story but I have always been a little paranoid about buying alcohol.  I tended to rotate stores and always paid cash didn't want anyone to get suspicious after all...A lady at one of the liquor stores Janice always tried to be nice and ask about how life was going.  She always struck me as someone with a similar struggle to mine.  I always did my best to not be rude but share as little as possible.  I certainly didn't want anyone to know ..I moved on with the rest of my life I of course haven't seen her in over a year or so now.  Kinda feel bad for being rude over the years hopefully she finds SD.  :)

Personally I've only ever been able to process regret over my past as a motivation to do better going forward.  Which is helpful because I regret a LOT of how I treated people when I was drinking.
