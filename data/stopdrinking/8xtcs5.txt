Today was a struggle. My trigger is the drive home from work. I got off early which usually would end with me binge drinking so I past all my spots and just talked myself out of it. Ended up at home and not drinking at some hiding spot. Once I am home I am good. I have to cook walk dog and have my mom here. Kids are out of town. I wont go back out bc I would have to answer questions and honestly I am too tired. I made it home without stopping. I want a nice cold beer right now. Instead I am having pasta and ice tea..lol ..Day 4...I am in the clear for tonight! Thank you all!!!

You did it! Well done    
The drive home was a trigger for me.  It was such a battle! It got easier one day at a time and now I don't even think of stopping for booze.  Trust the process and it will get better!..Congratulations on day 4! IWNDWYT 
Great job! Keep the focus!
