Today is day 5 without drinking after I fell off the wagon when I had 40 days. For some reason I've still been feeling really hesitant about AA after my relapse. I think I'm embarrassed to see people after I drank and anxious about really committing to the program and a sponsor. Yesterday I bought a Big Book to take a look into everything myself and while I haven't read too far I feel like the thoughts described in the first few chapters mirror my exact thinking. I don't know why I've been shying away from meetings but this book is speaking to me and it's thrilling terrifying and encouraging. Did anyone else read the book before really jumping into the program? Keep up the sober Saturday friends. Thanks for reading.

My situation is very similar to yours. I had just over a month sober before my relapse last weekend. It made me realize I had just been "going through the motions" of AA during that month.  I started reading through the big book a few days ago and was blown away by how much it sounds like it was describing my life and thinking.  My approach has to keep attending meetings every day and force myself to be honest with people about my slip and how it opened my eyes to some of my own weaknesses. I think reading the book has helped me to appreciate more of what the program is all about and how I can make it a more productive part of my life. I definitely get more out of meetings as I read more of it each day...Good luck with the continued sobriety and enjoy the rest of your sober Saturday!
I had the dumb luck of stumbling into a group that gives away big books (hardback no less!) to people at their first AA meeting. I was unaware that ~~some~~ most people go more than once a week and so by the time I went back to a second meeting I had read the book. I was hoping to be able to go to meetings follow the directions in the book and just kind of sneak in and out. Turns out that isn't how it's works. The attempt to self-sponsor was a joke too but thankfully that was very short-lived...I'm of the opinion that it's important for newcomers to become familiar with the book as soon as they can. People say a lot of shit in meetings and it's crucial to know what's one drunk's opinion and what is a part of the program outlined in the book. It used to annoy the shit out of me when people quoted page numbers in meetings but over time I've come to see it as a gesture of humility rather than arrogance. The big book is a somewhat clunky read but behind the odd structure and pitch-like tone there's a lot of good language.
