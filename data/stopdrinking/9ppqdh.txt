All of you...You guys are such a strong support system to me right now. I read your posts and your comments. I see you struggling and succeeding. We fight a battle that's mostly misunderstood in the "outside world". But we fight it together. ..I know I can come here when my head is getting squirrely... And you all give me hope. And I know I can come here when I'm doing well and you cheer me on. And I know if I relapse I can come back here and you'll welcome me with open arms. You are always here... For everything. ..So thank you SD. Thank you for being you. Because you're really helping this alcoholic get through the good the bad and the ugly.   ..Wishing you all a safe and sober weekend. And here's to us for fighting the good fight...IWNDWYT
