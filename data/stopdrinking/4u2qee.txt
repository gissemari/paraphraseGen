Been in treatment for a year or so couple of relapses that I totally own. At the suggestion of my counselor who thought I was ready I went to my first AA meeting last night. About 17 people there compared to the 2-3 in my other sessions. Since it was my first time they did a Step 1 review with everyone going over their story of acceptance and admitting that they were powerless over their addiction. I was truly inspired by those people in that room. They are in my thoughts constantly right now. I don't want to drink today because I know they want me to succeed. And I want my story to embolden them no to give in to the beast. I have only known them for an hour and I feel like they are all my best friends.

Your post made me smile and remember my first meeting so many "days" ago. Kudos for 53 days!
Wow awesome!
Yay! Glad you are enjoying it. It's easy to be friends with people who are going through the same struggle you are. I love meetings - I cried happy tears yesterday because the shares were so heartfelt and inspiring...&gt;  I don't want to drink today because I know they want me to succeed...This is a really powerful thought for me when I have thoughts about drinking. 
Here's what I (still) get from AA meetings: experience strength and hope.
