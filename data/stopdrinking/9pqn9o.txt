So I've got about 13 months sober. I'm working staying in a rehab for now and I've felt less than thrilled about my progress. I've been looking for a place to move out into so I can find a higher paying job and keep moving forward but it's been a struggle. Finally this Sunday I'm going to look at a place I think is going to be a good fit. The best part is I finally feel like a deserve it. I have people in my life genuinely happy for me. I feel good about myself physically and emotionally. I'm back in touch with my family for the first time in years. I feel like a real whole person in a way I haven't for ages...I finally feel grateful. I finally feel like I can look at my life in the moment and accept it. It all started with and is all contingent on me not drinking. I know how far I can go with alcohol and it's exactly where I'm standing when I take the first sip. Thank you all for being here. You can bet I won't drink with you today.

Congratulations on your progress. Even if it doesn't feel like you haven't gone forward much... you haven't been going backward for 13 months! I hope the living situation works out for you!
