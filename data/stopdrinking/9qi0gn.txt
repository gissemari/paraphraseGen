I've been trying to quit for about a year now had a couple of good streaks and have been sober at least 60% of the days in the last year. It's been rough but I'm truly committed this time around and decided to do some stress-cleaning until my cravings went away. I'm on day 8 after several 7-20 day streaks. Going to make it to a new record this time around - 21 days! As soon as I start thinking about never drinking again I freak out a bit and I relapse. So one small goal at a time is what I need to focus on right now I guess. ..Found a whole mess of empties and two half full bottles hidden away in my closet in a drawer I haven't looked in in months. Must have hidden those away while blacked out a while back. ..Six empty handles of Makers Mark..Four empty fifths of Bulleit..One empty fifth of Jack Daniels..One empty handle of Tito's..Two half full fifths of Svedka. ...I dumped the vodka down the drain and hauled off all the empties. Then thought about the fact that that was over $500 in liquor. $500 I spent on destroying my body and mind and don't even remember doing. This may have been one of the more eye opening experiences of my sobriety. That $500 worth of liquor represents about a months stash for me at the time that I think I hid it. It also caused me to blow $20-30 a day on takeout and easily $200 a week on online shopping while blacked out. I'm seriously kicking myself for the financial impact of my drinking. ..IWNDWYT.

Been there. Pouring stuff out is one of the fondest memories I have of my sober journey. It's been three years and I still vividly remember finding a bottle of whiskey that I'd blacked-out stashed between my bed and wall. How long it'd been there I wasn't even sure. I poured that sucker out and felt like a champion for doing so. Hope that it felt good for you too...The greater financial stability that comes with sobriety is certainly a lovely thing indeed. With time you'll see the results. There's even apps you can get for your phone that estimate what you'll have $aved...I will not drink with you today!
Yep the empty and adding up the money got me too! Especially when I kept finding them... and full ones too. How the hell did I loose a full bottle? Must have been super blacked out drunk. No thank you. [High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) for dumpin the b!tches
