Hey guys.  I've been having a rough time.  It seems I've traded the crippling anxiety that comes with drinking all the time for intense depression.  I feel like I'm in constantly in crisis mode and can't sleep at night / don't want to get out of bed in the morning.  I'm guessing this is the fallout of dealing with my problems for the past 15 years by getting f***** up.  I knew I would have to deal with all of my neglected emotional baggage sooner or later.  I just didn't anticipate how intense it was going to be.  The sober honeymoon phase is over...To be clear I'm not on the verge of relapse.  It's clear to me that drinking is not a solution.  I'd rather be sober and dealing with this baggage than drunk pretending like it doesn't exist.  ..I feel so alone but I know I'm not.  So I'm asking for some encouragement...Thanks.

Hi there blu! You're definitely not alone. I was surprised too by a wave of depression and anxiety after I quit there was a lot of pent up stuff needing to be handled. Hang in there you're doing great and it will get better! I will not drink with you today!
Hey you! That's my biggest fear at the moment is the fallout from the years of hedonism to cover up my trauma.  I just got a therapist today and am really looking forward to it.   As difficult as it may sound outside of that in my case exercise really really helps it's honestly my next fave addiction after getting fucked up :).Best of luck xo
