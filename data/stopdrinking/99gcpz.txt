Hi - stumbled across this group whilst reading about struggling with sobriety. Have made two attempts (half heartedly) to quit in the past feel as though after a summer of heavy drinking and damage being done to family relationships that I need (and truly want) to nail it this time. I rid the house of all alcohol on August 6th (our wedding anniversary - lol) and have not had a drink since seen a therapist last week who is going to work with me regularly emotions are a bit like a roller coaster if I'm honest - frustration and a bit of resentment - hopefully it passes ..Having the curious head that I have more than anything I really want to understand why I abused alcohol for so many of the best years of my life - hoping to find some identification amongst other things - first time ever sharing on an online forum.......Baby steps.....

Welcome and well done on bettering yourself. Alcohol consumption isn't normal or right no matter how hard society tries to convince us it is! ..It will be a tough road if addiction has overcome you. Stay strong and remember: all you can control is your actions right now. All you can do is not drink right now. ..This little mantra helped me a lot. I tend to over complicate things and think "never again!" But the brain doesnt work that way because it isn't necessarily a sustainable goal when thought like that. "I will not drink in this present moment" works. 
Hey welcome and good for you!  Any step in the right direction is a good step no matter how big or small.  One of the things that cleared up a whole lot for me about *why* I kept drinking even when I wanted to stop was the book This Naked Mind.  But that is not the only good book on the subject there's a bunch of them linked in the sidebar &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;..&amp;#x200B;..Congratulations on making an appointment with a professional to talk about these things.  I found that having goals laid out on my calendar beyond not just drinking today was a very helpful way to mark milestones of achievement along my journey.  ..&amp;#x200B;..You've picked a good subreddit to share on.  There are a lot of supportive people here. 
Welcome aboard!..&gt;I really want to understand why I abused alcohol for so many of the best years of my life ..Addiction is a complex condition arising from an interplay of bio-psycho-social factors.....It's usually something like emotional trauma/ chronic stress/ insecure connection with others during childhood (leading to mood disorders like anxiety/depression/ADHD etc) combined with a genetically-inherited susceptibility to finding mood-altering substances *particularly* rewarding and addictive plus early exposure to the addictive substance (before the age of 25 when the brain has finished developing)......Alcohol just so happens to be culturally-encouraged in a way in which similarly-damaging addictive drugs are not! It's no wonder that so many of us develop problems with it......[This article](http://real-recovery.co.uk/addiction-treatment/addictive-behaviours/12-characteristics-addiction/) helped me understand my addictive nature along with [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2emgrRoT2c&amp;t=182s) on YouTube... They are good starting points but there's an enormous amount of information out there to explore.....Glad to see you've already started 'This Naked Mind' (check out her YouTube channel too it's fab); I also found 'Alcohol Explained' by William Porter very helpful.....Best of luck and keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
This Naked Mind helped me a lot and so does this sub. I find that filling my schedule with stuff to do keeps some of the emotions at bay but if it's starting to feel overwhelming I don't feel bad taking a half day off to reset myself. It's better than turning to a bottle when it won't help.
Welcome!  This sub is great.  IWNDWYT!
