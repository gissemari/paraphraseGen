Today is a day I have been dreading sometime and likely caused several relapses since August when I had 90 days sober. Today with my family I'll have to deal with two people who I really hurt (emotionally) with a massive bender that cost me a job and landed me in detox for a week. ..I'm not going to drink over it because it will do know good and will only makes things worse. I've progressed to where even a single drink will lead to several days of morning noon & night drinking trying to chase away the horrible shame and sickness. ..I hope all in this sub are doing well and I will not drink with you today.

You are not the only one wired this way many here are as well. A drink or two and we are off to the races. I'm two weeks in and feels real good. Keep up the good work. I finally got why everyone kept saying one day at a time and that they only needed to not take that first drink. In time things will get better.
&gt; Today with my family I'll have to deal with two people who I really hurt (emotionally) with a massive bender that cost me a job and landed me in detox for a week. ..Obviously my context is very limited so the following may or may not be good advice...It may help to consider saying "thank you" to these two individuals.  A little less "look at me I'm all better now" but rather something closer to "thank you for encouraging me to live a sober life."..It's a bit of irony how alcohol creates the reasons for which a person might want to drink.  However by not drinking you are thereby undermining alcohol's power and giving yourself less of a reason to drink...I too cannot drink a little so I will not drink with you this Christmas.
