I quit for 60 days early 2017 for a race. I found new motivation to clean things up after letting it snowball the past few months but haven't delivered on it for unknown reasons.  ..The logic in me knows I should just quit but the demon gives no fucks and I feel uneasy with the decision. I keep thinking I can moderate and then I'm back to old habits. ..But mostly I let myself be OK with going against my values. I don't want a rock bottom or a wake up call. I just want to feel good about myself and be proud of the choices I'm making. ..I realize that I should  just do it  but everyone here knows that is the struggle. ..I'm seeing a counselor and working on mindfulness.   I feel like it's positive but I'm still not changing my behavior. I want to train for races competitively and know that giving up vices like alcohol are a big part of it. ..I'm reaching here but   any advice?  How can I give myself a wake up call without having to hit rock bottom?  How can I strengthen my willpower?

Do an audit of your credit cards and bank records and add up how much you've pissed away on alcohol.  You might be shocked...Also if you want to read depressing stories of people who've sunk to rock bottom don't care gave up any hope of a happy healthy life and have accepted that they will die slowly from alcoholism check out r/cripplingalcholism
