I never tasted alcohol. I don't drink neither do I have an addiction problem. I just wanted to say that this is a really loving and supportive community in Reddit. I really appreciate and wish for the best to all the people here who are trying to help others with their addiction. You guys are a blessing in disguise and I'm happy that people like you exist. So much love for everyone here. Really hope that people who are struggling make it better for themselves. Love everyone on this community for so much support and care

What are some tips you have for young adults to stay away from addiction in the first place. I have teens now and I know peer pressure is tough to overcome. I was not inclined to say no when I was younger how did you do it?
