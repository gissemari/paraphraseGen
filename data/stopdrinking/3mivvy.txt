I am on day 5 coming off a 10 day bender. Over the last 18 months I have made it to 60 days several times only to relapse for 5-10 days then I'd recommit to sobriety. Anyway historically the 72 hour mark was my golden point where I went from having awful anxiety/stomach issues to feeling normal. I've read that withdrawals get worse the more you detox. This is the first I'm experiencing that. It's day 5 I still can't eat and still have really bad anxiety. I'm going for a long run in the morning and I hope that helps kickstart me feeling normal again.

It may not be a bad idea to check things out with your doctor if your still not feeling well.
Running and walking especially away from civilization as much as possible has always helped me feel better. Keep up the good work!
I didn't sustain drinking quite as long as you usually 2-3 days but I experienced something very similar to what you describe.  Always by 10-11 pm the day after drinking I would feel normal again even if getting to that hour was a bit rough.  Then for whatever reason the reversion to normal stopped and I decided to quit for good.  That was last December and I've had 2 short binges since then.  It takes months to get back to 'normal' now.  If I manage to get out and exercise which doesn't happen nearly often enough it cuts the recovery time down to a fraction...It gets a bit rougher every time from this point out I'm afraid at least in my experience.  A relapse isn't the end of the world but it sure as hell isn't pleasant.  Definite motivation to stay away.
