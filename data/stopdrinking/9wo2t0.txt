I was able to quit for three months and then my grandma died I relapsed and my boyfriend dumped me earlier this year...I was able to go to therapy for my demons (a 7 year abusive relationship not related to my most recent ex) and met the most amazing guy ever...I've been mentally stable and now I need to get my ass physically healthy! Feeling great !!!

Good luck and way to make positive changes! Remember to pair keto with developing good exercise habits diets come and go but as we all know habits stick around. 
Hell yeah! Keto helped keep me sober since the diet is so strict. Lost around 40 pounds. You got this let me know if you have any questions. 
That is fantastic! I am also trying to make health progress by eating better and logging in MFP. I didn't drink yesterday. 
I've done the keto thing. Make sure you stay hydrated.  If you start feeling weird you may need to add some additonal Magnesium and potassium to your diet. Ketosis gives me heart palpitations no matter what I try so I had to give it up. I did lose 12 pounds pretty fast while I was on it. 
I'm on day one and decided to do keto along with getting sober.  I'm not going to go hard core at first but I'll definitely be cutting out the gluten and all those carbs.  I believe the term is lazy keto.  After a few weeks or so I'll probably get more strict with it.  I just need to get through the withdrawal stuff first.
