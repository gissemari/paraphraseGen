Was just reading a post about alcohol related health problems and remembered that during the last few years of my drinking I had a persistent painful tingling in my hands (especially in the morning) that has now gone since I quit. I really noticed it when I relapsed for a year last year.   ..Not looking for medical advise just curious if anyone experienced similar symptoms and if it's common what it is?...

Alcoholic Neuropathy. I believe it is fairly common among alcoholics.
Sounds like alcohol-related  peripheral neuropathy.
&gt;what it is?..This is seeking a medical opinion which only a doctor can give you and your post has been removed.
