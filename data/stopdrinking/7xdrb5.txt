   Wish I could say this is the longest I've gone but unfortunately it's not. My last sober stint lasted over 2 years then I relapsed. Ended up after 1 week having to get medically detoxed for the 2nd time..ugh it was such a dark place to be. I would pray before I went to sleep that I would die and not wake up. I ended up going to rehab in Florida for 30 days which was horrible to be honest. I could have just went to AA and saved a bunch of money.. but at the time seemed like the only route to go and very well might have saved my life.. It's still hard.. pretty much every day.. some better than others. But I still think about it at least once a day almost like a craving in my chest or mouthwatering feeling. My God how much better my life is... Got my wife and daughter back and now I am a week away from having a new baby girl better financially then I ever have been care about other people besides myself my interests are back. I could go on and on.. Every single aspect of life is better but I cannot get complacent with time as I have to keep my guard up every day. This community is freaking awesome you all are awesome and give me strength every single day to keep on.  Hope I didn't ramble too much. I will not drink with you today my brothers and sisters. Keep on fighting.
