Sitting here at work...feeling pretty good today :) The weather here is cool and fall-like :) I love fall!! Bring on pumpkin-spice everything :) I have a co-worker who got a DUI and instead of spending 3 days in jail he has the opportunity to do a 3 day AA type thing in a local hotel. He was talking about it and said that he doesn't understand how people can be addicted to stuff. He wanted to know how someone could not go three days without drugs or alcohol. Really? He has had 3 DUI's. Maybe he can go days without a drink but don't judge someone who can't or who is struggling to stay sober. Ok......I feel better now....rant over!.I am proud of each and every one of you here! Don't let people judge you or say your struggle isn't real! We are doing this and I will proudly not drink with you all today :)

It's so normalized. What a shame. Plus sounds like he's projecting his problems outward. You are a role model for him whether you both know it or not keep it up!
Everyone's journey is different. Some stay in denial and some admit it to themselves. Glad you have and I will not drink with you today.
For me I have to take it one step at a time! I get stressed and anxious and like this morning was like maybe a glass of wine tonight but I don't know how to moderate! I will not drink with you today
He has 3 DUIs and doesn't get it?.Sorry made me laugh. .Bright guy. ..
