I do all the normal things a "normal" person does but don't drink even though many of the people I am with do.   I don't really discuss my sobriety with anyone at all but the folks on here.  And if I see a response to a post that I think is really off the mark I don't let it upset me I simply voice my opinion on the OP's concern.   This is what has been working for me.  If being around recovering alcoholics pushes your buttons it might be helpful to find friends that aren't dealing with these issues.  MeetUps are a good start if they are available in your area.  Good luck to you. .   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|47|SarahSiddonscooks|*Best wishes to /u/sarahsiddonscooks today!* by coolcrosby|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dz2r4/best_wishes_to_usarahsiddonscooks_today/cjul7cr)|.Hey everybody!!

In fact I never went to a single meeting. After I read *the easy way to stop drinking* by Allen Carr AA didn't sound appealing to me. I don't want to feel like I'm constantly missing out. I don't want to be reminded about drinking at all. I don't want to dwell on it or justify why I'm not doing it. I want to move on. AA isn't necessary for everyone. We're all different. I go out to bars with friends often. Bars where there are games firepits fun people. I drink a diet coke and I enjoy myself go to bed sober wake up feeling fine. There's a bottle of booze sitting on my table that someone left at my house. It's been there for 6 months. I am not a powerless slave to alcohol! It's empowering to trust myself. .   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|29|SarahSiddonscooks|*u/sarahsiddonscooks and Blossom!* by coolcrosby|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2e2ls5/usarahsiddonscooks_and_blossom/cjvizth)|.With the exception of immediate entry she hasn't even cried yet just snuggles close an sounds like a quietly squeaking door.

How many meetings would you suggest the OP go to to accomplish helping the newcomer? Once a month? Once a day? What if the OP happens to miss a meeting where he might have helped a newcomer with his story? If AA is supposed to be a selfish program and if the OP feels like the AA community is hindering his recovery than shouldn't the next logical AA-approved conclusion be that it's okay to leave AA instead of sticking around for another year or two?.   .   ..|Score|Author|Post Title|Link|.|:--|----|---|----|.|19|pollyannapusher|*Favorite parts about sobriety?* by ebayofpigs|[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2eby45/favorite_parts_about_sobriety/cjy0p9t)|.I remember what I did last night!

It wasn't for me. So I quit going and found an alternative...People can still root for you even outside of AA. Not going to aa /= falling off the wagon. ..What you do need is support and wisdom from people that have done this before you. /r/stopdrinking is one of the ways I substitute not going to AA.

I'm not in AA because of it. ..I finding it's what they have to say to themselves to make it through another day. They need a fear of their own potential behavior mixed with reassurance that they are enjoying life without alcohol. (Hint: Many of them aren't) ..It's not unlike organized religion. When you have to constantly lie to yourself it helps to have a group of people who will construct that new reality with you. If it works for them great. It's not *a priori* a bad thing. I've got my own lies for myself when I need them. ..I prefer to hang out with "normal" people who might also drink. The difference is that we do things not centered on getting wasted: playing music flag football hiking etc...Some people in AA build their social lives around it and I think it is limiting in its own way. They say that the only thing they had in common with drinking friends was booze but the only thing they have in common with many/most AA friends is also booze. ..Then again a lot of broken people come into that program and they aren't really ready to make friends in a normal setting...I'm not really the type who joins communities. I lurk in the back and show my face sometimes. You might be similar. It's normal.
