We welcome anyone who wishes to join in by asking or giving advice sharing stories or just encouraging someone who is trying to quit or cut down...The problem you'll find is that most of the people here have not been able to be successful in moderation.  Many of us believe that moderation is a myth.  The people that **I** know who are able to drink moderately do so without trying.  The only time I've ever heard one of my friends say "I have to watch how much I drink tonight" it's because they have something big going on the next day and don't want to feel bad for it.  It's not that they think that they can't control their drinking (which was the problem I had)...That said you are welcome to post about your progress at moderation.

I had drank many hundreds of pints there. Before I even said a thing she brought me a frosty pint of my favorite ale.She had brought me many.My buddy asked if I really wanted it as I had been not drinking for months. I said " One would be fine". It was a hot day. It was delicious.

It's something I've been thinking about and hoping someone would raise as an element of this discussion.  In sobriety you really do get to this moment where you have to ask yourself one simple question:  To what lengths am I willing to go to stay sober and to gain the promises of sobriety?  Your answer ultimately determines--in my opinion--whether you are going to get this long term or not.  Understand this about sobriety: sobriety is whole new dimension it is not: my old life minus booze.  Sobriety is a whole new way of living new opportunities new potentials and a whole new outlook on the world as it is and my place in it.  To achieve sobriety I need to be willing to let go of my old me my old way of living and yes most of my old relationships and open myself up to the universe.

That was like 3 years and some thousands of beers ago.  Personally I don't think I can moderate.  Truth is that's not what I want.  Sure I like drinking craft beer apart from getting drunk; it's fun visiting the breweries and it's nice tasting a wide variety of flavors.  But in the end getting fucked up is what I really enjoy about drinking.

I've seen a lot of posts lately where the poster has a couple of weeks or months and brags that he hasn't changed any of his social habits still goes out with friends to bars--the usual. I've given up on commenting on those posts; as Ben Franklin said "Experience is a dear teacher but fools will learn at no other." I just hope they get back as soon as possible once the inevitable happens...I did the same in my early early sobriety. My later-sponsor told me that one night I would have an urge to drink so strong that I would not be able to resist it and that if I were in a bar when the urge hit the odds were overwhelming that I would give in and drink. I laughed it off; after all I had 30+ days and knew everything there was to know about staying sober...Needless to say that night came. I was leaning against a bar and watched the bartender pour a straight-up double shot of Johnny Walker Red Label my favorite. All of a sudden I knew that if I stayed there one more minute I would order myself one. I bumped into a couple of people running out that door and I didn't even apologize I was so terrified that I would be sucked back into that hell I had just gotten out of. I went to the meeting the next night much chastened and shared my experience. It was a long long time before I went into a bar again.
