I woke up this morning in the middle of a divorce in a new city in a job I'm struggling at and I realize....I am an alcoholic. Not because I drink alone. Not because I drink to get drunk but because I have a dark side that comes out when I'm drunk/hungover and I don't or can't be that person anymore if I am going to get things together...I guess my dad was right. Drinking is dangerous. I wish he wasn't right. I feel like quitting means he won. If I keep drinking then I win then I'm right. But no my relationship with alcohol is not fun or entertaining. It's sad and dark and grey.

I think quitting means *you win*. I don't care what anyone else thinks about my sobriety. I do it because I need it to be the person I really am...I'd suggest forgetting what your dad may or may not have to say about this. It's about you. And you can do it.
that about sums it up the good news is that a life without alcohol is a lot brighter - to some degree because we no longer lock ourselves in tiny cells with not so nice people.
I had to get over the thought that my quitting was for someone other than myself and realized that it was 100% for me and my life.
I think it has to be about what you want out of life. Nit who wins or looses or what someone else thinks. I wont drink with you tonight
Just curious is there a score somewhere?..How did this become a win/ lose situation?
Being right isn't all that it's cracked up to be. I try to let that stuff go and focus just on what I need to do now to be the person I want to be. Trust me when I quit drinking I started to win. I wasn't winning anything as a drinker. I will not drink with you today.
Remember how Charlie Sheen looked when he was professing to be a winner?  
"You can be right *or* get what you want." So I decided what I wanted more than being right and that was to be sober.
