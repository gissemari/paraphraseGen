So a few weeks ago I stopped drinking and made it to 19 days but relapsed last Sunday. Yesterday was my 7th day sober this time around. Just to give some background I'm a manager of a pub and restaurant that I live above so am constantly around alcohol and drunk people. However I absolutely love my job and it's a dry house anyway (staff aren't allowed to drink there). Anyway work has never been a trigger for me really as I can't just finish and jump around the other side of the bar and start drinking plus I've been closing up a lot lately so all I want to do is get out and go to bed...I finished at 6 yesterday and had some pizza and a few bottles of Heineken 0% while watching Game of Thrones with my fiancee not a bad way to spend an evening. Around 10pm I got a call from a supervisor that we have working there who is allowed to lock up on quiet nights like Sunday nights. One of the fuses kept tripping which was connected to where the internet and our whole till system runs off so a bit of an issue. I came downstairs with a level head and tried to solve the issue. Ended up being a faulty socket so just left 2 unimportant things unplugged and got everything back up and running...Now I came back upstairs and was surfing through reddit and was going to put up a post saying how easy today was. However I realised how difficult the day had been earlier on. I live in the UK so Sundays are usually a day where families and friends head out early in the day for a roast dinner and few pints and watch the football. Serving all of these people made me really jealous. What made me really jealous was the fact that there were so many people standing around having a good time and happy to just sip on 3 or 4 pints and call it a day. It was almost as if their drinks were just add ons and that the reason they came to the pub was so that they could spend time with friends and watch the football. I was jealous as I know I can't do this. My reason for going to a pub is to drink full stop and I would have drank until I'd had too much. There were also some people doing an "Ale Trail" which is essentially a pub crawl where you try a different real ale in each pub and then once you get a stamp from each one you get free entry into a real ale festival in November. I used to absolutely LOVE doing stuff like this. Used to love trying ales with different percentages different colours different smells. Then I remembered that the last few times I drank ale it was just a means to an end to get obliterated not to enjoy the taste of it. You will not believe how tempted I was to drink while I was working it was killing me...However I went straight to the off licence after work and got myself 4 bottles of Heineken 0% ordered pizza and told the supervisor to ring me if there's any issues. Where I'm going with this is even though yesterday was so hard with temptations once i'd resisted them and stayed strong by the end of that it all seemed easy looking back on it. The only thing that I could think of was that if I went for a few drinks I would have gotten in an argument with the mrs not been any help with fixing the problem that happened in the pub and would have woken up this morning full of regret. On the contrary I had a really nice evening with my fiancee solved a potentially big issue downstairs and woke up this morning fresh and ready to enjoy some time off...I know it's long winded and might seem small but yesterday was a huge win for me and a reminder of what it can be like for all of us if we stay strong.

You're right - it was a HUGE win!   The Sunday pub lunch is a big trigger (I miss them too) but you were able to avoid it by remembering why drinking is bad for you and also appreciating the good sides of being sober.  These tools keep us all strong.  Stick with it my friend.  IWNDWYT.
