Last night I went to a diaper party for my friend. (Diaper party-all friends bring a pack of diapers for a soon to be dad hang out booze and eat. Guy version of baby shower).   These are my college buddies we are in our early 30's so drinking has always been "the norm" for us.  It was my first event after my true admission to myself that I have a problem and am staying sober...I drank water and diet pop.  I had no temptation thankfully. I was offered beer had a whisky bottle passed to me (which I refused) and was asked to play drinking games several times.  I refused politely said I had a long drive (which is true 1 hr).  I didn't feel it was the appropriate time/place to say "actually I am an alcoholic so I'm trying to live sober the remainder of my life".  Plus they are good guys and would of felt awful for offering up alcohol to me in my current state.  My best friend has an idea who was there and when I am ready I'll tell the rest.  For now the goal is to stay sober day by day.  I love watching my badge increase. ..Not once did I even have the slightest inkling to give in. .  None of them struggle with alcohol and they are still my good friends that I want to be around.  I know it may not always be that easy.  I am just happy the first test was. Thanks for listening. ..
