[Urge surfing](http://www.mindfulness.org.au/urge-surfing-relapse-prevention/) has been useful for me to help deal with cravings. The visualization makes sense to me. I associate surfing--in river and on snow--with being [in the zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29) a feeling I've chased for most of my life...I spent last week on a beach vacation and got to practice urge surfing a LOT. Alcohol was everywhere and inescapable--billboards stores restaurants and the condo since the rest of my family are normies. Again it was the quiet times when I was alone in the condo that the urges were strongest. I could surf them for a minute or two consider them and then they broke and were gone...I also watched the ocean waves a LOT. I love the ceaseless repetition and endless variation. One morning we went to a beach with big enough breakers to dive through and get tossed around. It was a week of making the visualization actual...I discovered the next levels of urge surfing that I want to aspire to. [Brown Pelicans surf along the front of waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEFrSycTvRk). There's some cool physics going on with their flight but the metaphor--INCREDIBLE. They're surfing gliding with few wingbeats coupled to but no longer *in* the waves. That's what I want some day to decouple from my urges and obsession with alcohol...Then maybe I can break free of the ocean entirely. [Frigate birds soared effortlessly along the shore line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyNHH5l0puY) surfing the air currents. In the video they're surfing in the wind created by a ship catching a ride to another island. They dip into the ocean occasionally when a fish is in a good position to catch but otherwise are far above and floating in another medium entirely.

Beach thoughts are best. I'm more relaxed just reading these ideas. :-)..Gads I need a vacation. 
Welcome back from vacation e_j!  ..Thanks for this post and the beautiful imagery and this line:..&gt;I love the ceaseless repetition and endless variation...This is the best description of waves I've ever read...For now (from my non-beach alcohol free zone) I am enjoying frigate bird moments mixed with brown pelican surfing occasionally interrupted by a few mud puddle plops... it's such a mixed bag.  ..I really like the way you planned for this vacation and processed your experience.  Thanks for taking us along with you!..P.S.  Did you get to do any yoga on the beach?..
I love it when folk share different ways of visualising things here. It can be very powerful! Thank you for this one!
