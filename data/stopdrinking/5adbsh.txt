Good day all. So here's my story. I'm 25 and today I've been sober for 6 days. I've struggled with alcohol for nearly 10 years. I got sober for a year and a half a couple of years ago but went back out after convincing myself I wasn't an alcoholic and that I could "control it." ..Up until 6 days ago I was drinking heavily every night (usually a bottle of wine every night but often a pint of vodka or whiskey). I've had run ins with the law in the past but luckily/miraculously do not have a criminal record. 4 years ago I attempted suicide under the influence. It's not pretty when I drink I turn into a vicious and aggressive asshole who thinks the world is out to get me. ..Needless to say I'm tired of alcohol creating all of these problems in my life and last week I got to the point where I was absolutely sick of myself. I was tired of feeling like shit everyday and know that if I don't take control over this now I won't be able to accomplish everything I want to accomplish in life. ..I know that if I don't stop my life will go nowhere. I don't want to be that person. When I was younger I would blow it off as "I'm still young who cares!" But it's gotten to the point that the game is over. It's time to grow up. ..About a month ago I quit a job that I was very unfulfilled at to focus on getting sober and finding my calling. The job I was in was very unhealthy for me and was making me miserable. I pulled the rug from beneath myself and told myself that life is too short to be unhappy any longer. It's time for me to get sober and focus on what I want to do in life (something I've always struggled with). ..I've admitted to myself that I have an alcohol problem and discovered SD last night when I was up late and couldn't sleep. I'm so grateful to have found such a supportive and wonderful community of people going through similar situations. ..I've been to several AA meetings in the past. I'm looking into an alternative SMART recovery as I believe AA isn't the only option for recovery and I have always struggled with the fundamentals of AA in the past. ..I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life and it's hard. For years I've pondered going back to school to get my masters in social work. I've started applying to grad schools but the programs only start in the fall so I'd have to wait until Fall 2017. ..I guess I'm just confused and don't know what I should be doing in life right now. I am dedicated to staying sober as I know I can't live the life I was living any further. Ive had trouble sleeping and feel like a crazy person the past 6 days lol. I know this will be a long road ahead of me and I won't start to feel great for quite a bit of time. ..Do you guys have any words of wisdom? Greatly appreciated -N ..

It actually sounds to me like you've gotten some things quite straight for yourself (I was nowhere near your level of awareness at 25! wish I had been). Can you take a few classes here and there even online ones? To help narrow down what field you might want to go into. Since you have some time maybe take up some hobbies that interest you too or get into yoga/running/some sort of exercise. Lots of us rely on that "natural high" we get from exercising as a healthy replacement for our alcohol obsessions...As for support groups this is a great one to start but if you want IRL support and dislike AA you can also check out Refuge Recovery meetings. I'm glad you're looking into SMART too. I do RR and it helped a lot to have a group of sober people to lean on who understood what I was going through...Best wishes!.
