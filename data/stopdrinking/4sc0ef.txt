Title says it all. Weekend drinking. I knew I was going to drink on Friday and I'm so angry at myself because I drank alone at home. ..I don't even like drinking. I don't like the taste I don't like being drunk and I certainly don't like the hangovers...I've been telling myself I can enjoy a drink at weekends but I don't enjoy it. Now to struggle through the anxiety and self hated of day 1.

I'm with you. I made it six days and felt awesome on the last day. Went to the store and bought wine and drank most days of the past week (starting on a Friday). But it's Monday it's a beautiful day and I'm not going to drink.
Oh my heart hurts for you. I am so sorry.  I have felt the same way you describe so many times.  ..In the beginning nights were really tough for me.  I REALLY wanted to drink after work.  So I had to change my routine.  I had to do different things at night than what I was used to.  Sometimes I just went to bed at 7 so I could sleep through the desire to drink.  I also had to stop going to all of my favorite restaurants for a while bc they had bars and wine lists and it just made me too sad and way too full of cravings. ..I know it is easier said than done but please try to not hate yourself so much. Today is a new day full of new possibilities and new chances to get it "right."  You'll be OK friend.
My last drink was a tearful mess. I was so confused why I felt like I had to drink buy at the same time didnt want to. ..I felt like I was being torn apart.
I found that the only way I could stop was to somehow get my unconscious mind to figure out drinking is doing nothing good for us. It's back there telling me "Come on! Don't you want to relax? It'll be *fun!*" It's all lies. An illusion. A little monster desperate to get his greedy paws on the poison. ..Since the unconscious mind only learns from experience and observations I had to educate myself on the myths and truths of alcohol. How it does nothing good for me ever. How it's just ethanol and that drunk feeling is a fleeting moment followed by intense despair. How it's hurting my stomach my heart my nerves... all for nothing. I get no good things or enjoyment whatsoever from alcohol. It's simply an addictive substance I have become addicted to. A chemical reaction in the mind. The low I feel when I'm not drinking is not offset by drinking... it is caused entirely *by* drinking. I had to reteach my mind that it's not good or fun or relaxing or worthwhile. I know that consciously but it took some work for my unconscious to learn that. Once that happened the cravings cleared up right away. I'm no longer using willpower to not drink. I simply have no desire at all to drink. **I feel free.** I learned how from [*This Naked Mind*](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDbookclub/comments/4khj4s/this_naked_mind_available_free_to_sd_users/).

I've been relapsing since Thanksgiving. 2 weeks on 1 week off over and over. THIS time (oh hi 2 weeks) I've hit a meeting almost every day and made it my second job to read pray and talk about recovery nonstop. I'm not drinking today and you don't have to either.
The more you try the more likely it is to be successful. Breathe.
