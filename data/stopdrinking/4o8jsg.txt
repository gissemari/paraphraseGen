Hi everyone.  I am a long-time "heavy social drinker" who over the past year morphed into a textbook alcoholic.  I am currently battling with PTSD (not of the combat variety) anxiety depression and a cross-country move that has left me without a good support network.  I work from home (in IT) so I don't even have normal irritating work interactions to distract me from my deep and fervent desire to check out of my own brain.  Hence the alcohol.  I have attended two AA meetings but I am still struggling with staying sober for more than a day or two at a time.  Even just reading the FAQ for this site made me want to go and get a drink.  I am so tired of feeling like this.

I was able to stop drinking and get sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  
Hey!  Welcome to SD!..I understand what you're going through.  The first few days can be incredibly hard to get through.  For me I basically have to do anything and everything I can to get through that first week.  Eat comfort food occupy myself with anything I can drink tons of soda water - with lime because it makes it seem like a drink...It's easiest to just think about it one day hour or even minute at a time if need be.  When an urge hits find something distracting to do.  For me a bowl of ice cream helps.  Even if I don't really feel like ice cream I make myself eat one and I rarely still feel like drinking after.  Or a glass of soda water and lime immediately.  Play a video game or put a show on.  Call a friend.  Come here to SD and read and post replies.  Whatever it takes to not give in...After the first few days it only gets easier and easier.  You'll start to see benefits of complete sobriety very quickly.  Then you can really start to focus on building yourself a support system and making a plan for how to stay sober...Hope to see you stick around.  Keep us posted on how your recovery goes!..Good luck and I won't drink with you today :)
I couldn't stay sober until I got professional help. That's what got me started on my recovery journey.
Thank you for taking the time to reply to my post.  I am definitely going to work the baby steps into my daily routine.  I am also working with my therapist on both the alcoholism and the underlying trauma that tipped me over the edge.
