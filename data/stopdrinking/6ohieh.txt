I've just recently relapse after about 6 months of sobriety. 6 months is the best I've been able to do. Now I'm afraid that I will spiral out of control again. I feel the obsessive thoughts gnawing my will breaking and deluded drinking plans fill my head. I've now ridden my bike half way to the get alcohol before I've repented and turned back. This happened twice today. I'm terrified of facing life without a numbing device. I need coping mechanisms. So please I ask for whatever help you can lend me.
