Background: Been drinking since I was 17.  I have a family history of alcoholism on my dad's side of the family (his brother is a bad alcoholic who has since sought treatment and gone sober).  He also has multiple cousins who continue to struggle with alcoholism.  I myself have been hospitalized from drinking approximately three times and have had consistent streaks of blacking out/getting extremely intoxicated.  I know I know that's bad and as a college student that sort of drunken behavior is accepted up to a certain point  but that's not necessarily my main concern.  What's really concerned me recently is how whenever I stop drinking after 4+ drinks so basically every time I drink is that I don't get hungover in the typical sense of a headache or stomachache but I feel very on edge have this "pins-and-needles" sensation in which I feel like I have to scratch things that are crawling on my body.  Even as I type this I am feeling this and I only had five drinks from the span of the afternoon until early in the night.  It's difficult to fall asleep because   I've been tossing and turning and bed since the alcohol has left my system.  I don't drink often during the summer but when I do I am starting to feel this.  So how troublesome is this?  Should I really consider stopping drinking all together?

There are a lot of red flags in there yes.....Addictive tendencies can certainly run in families and starting young (pre-25 before the brain has finished maturing) is a strong risk factor.....&gt;I myself have been hospitalized from drinking approximately three times and have had consistent streaks of blacking out/getting extremely intoxicated..Red flag!!..Hangovers changing into actual [withdrawal](http://hams.cc/withdrawal/) symptoms is also a step along the slippery slope... I didn't get to that point until I was in my late 20's.....Alcohol Use Disorder is a condition which progresses through predictable stages and levels of severity the more and longer you drink and it's only likely to get worse if you don't do something about it.....[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/45bndo/the_myth_of_the_functioning_alcoholic/) describes the typical trajectory of a drinking problem very accurately... I made it well into Stage 3 by my early 30's and it was awful... have a read and see how many similarities you can spot in your own situation.....I found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' really helpful for understanding my drinking problem and permanently changing the way I view alcohol - they are well worth a look and made all the difference for me in stopping for good without feeling like I was missing anything or depriving myself.....Help is out there if you want it!..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;..
 sounds like a very good idea indeed.  Especially since alcoholism runs in the family.  I will not drink with you tonight.  And tomorrow too
Itchy skin like that can be a symptom of liver issues. I'd consider seeing and being honest with your doctor.
I'm only 24 and have used youth as an excuse to not have a problem. My family is riddled with alcoholics and I thought I could be better. Do I really want to wait until it ruins my life to completely stop? Maybe by self awareness of what my potential with alcohol could be I can stop it and not hit rock bottom. Maybe you can too! I don't think anyone is too young to have a problem. My hangovers started getting shaky. I was slow and couldn't think throughout the day. Nothing too crazy. But why do I have to wait until I'm having unbearable withdrawals for there to be a problem? Maybe some of this will apply to you I'm not sure. Just know you aren't the only young person out there! This sub showed me that. I would recommend to keep coming here and soul searching whatever decision you make. It's here for you when you're ready
