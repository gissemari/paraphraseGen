I love to know that my higher power works in mysterious ways. I pray that he take away that desire and obsession to quit drinking. today he has. I know that I don't need alcohol. I have a good career and better things to focus my energy on. Why would I want to fill my spirit with the shit that kills it. Spiritual suicide is not my route. I love myself to refrain from killing myself today. I pray for all of those who struggle with this disease. have a great rest of your day.
