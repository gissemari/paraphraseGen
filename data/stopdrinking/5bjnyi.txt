Day 1 of not drinking. I was not an alcoholic but definitely a binge drinker. I rarely could go out and have just one or two drinks. Within the last year though I was drinking til like 4 or 5 am making other shitty decisions (smoking and occasional cocaine use) and feeling like absolute shit the next couple days. My anxiety is through the roof the day after drinking and I'm just exhausted. I've gone months in the past without drinking but never stuck to it. The way I feel after drinking recently just isn't worth it though and I'm committed to stay sober! Luckily my best friend who also struggled with the same issues is doing the same and very supportive..I can do this..
