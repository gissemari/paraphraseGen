Hey all I'm on day 12...A baby in sobriety everyday is a struggle. My SO and I just moved into a very nice 2 bedroom apartment. We've been living in cramped one bed apartments for years so this is like a dream. ANYWAY apparently this dream apartment has its downsides: thin walls. Could be the hardwood flooring who knows. So today we are setting up cleaning and I hear fighting. Out of boredom I stop and listen to the shouting I hear from next door.... You're drunk you're drunk you're shit faced at 1:00!! You have a problem.   I'm gonna stop   You're not gonna stop. I'm done get away from me!*    crazy screams* *crying*  you had jury duty today I can't believe you're doing this again !!  it goes on and on...Man my heart kinda dropped. It's a young couple I briefly met last night when this stray cat was meowing at our door..They seemed normal and happy.  ..This problem we face.. it's so common and hurtful. I think of my boyfriend begging me to stop drinking like a week ago.. If you're not drinking tonight i'm with you and so proud of you. This shit is so hard and with my recent relapses I question how i'm even going to make it another day....IWNDWYT
