I am so grateful for AA and the help I have gotten. I am 26 and have nearly drank myself to deatg 3 times this year. This last time I decided to throw in the white towel after struggling with alcohol and drug addiction for the past 10 years. I had my first sober and normal Christmas in almost 10 years and my mother and father told me how proud of me they were. my mother called me the "new Austin." It felt amazing. The greatest feeling about this program is when the mental obsession was lifted. It feels amazing to feel so free!

Well done! It's great to know your parents are not only being supportive but are clearly communicating how happy they are now to have the true you back. It's nice to get rid of the mental fog isn't it? I have to say the mental obsession I had with alcohol shortly after quitting was awful as well sort of like being haunted by the past. On to better things!
Congratulations. Three months is a big deal!
Good for you.  I'm so happy for you.  But remember when posting on /r/stopdrinking that this subreddit is NOT AA and as another active and grateful AA we do the best job of helping others when we talk from our own experiences.  I'm so glad you're here.
