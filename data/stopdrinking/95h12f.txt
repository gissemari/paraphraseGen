This may sound so trivial but I'm actually worried people are going to know how bad I was drinking by how good I look now. I look healthy for the first time in a while. My eyes are clear my skin has lost the redness and is clear I don't have bruises on me. I even put a little bit of weight on cause I'm eating food. It's nice that people recognize but the change is pretty drastic even for less then a week...Tonight I was getting in the shower and I stopped and looked myself right in the face and liked what I saw. I haven't liked what/who I saw back in a long long time and I dam sure didn't look myself in the eye. I fleetingly passed by mirrors checking my outfit but never really looking myself in my eyes.  It was a nice feeling. One I hold onto when I struggle. I like posting here cause I can quickly go back and re-read some of my own thoughts to myself and remember the pride of the post

I was out riding my bike after dinner and reflecting that almost 4 weeks of sobriety has already improved my health so much. My face is not red my eyes look good I have lost 12 lbs. Sobriety is an awesome thing. IWNDWYT. Hugs.  
You're doing awesome!  ..IWNDWYT!
I need a bike so bad! 
I like the idea of holding on the what it feels like to look yourself in the eyes when you're struggling. Beautiful. I'll remember this one for the rough times.
If you feel like you don't want people to know what's happening (and I totally get it) you could say you changed your diet started doing yoga at home or something like that. Take your time things will only improve from now on.
