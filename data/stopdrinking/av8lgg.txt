I've been struggling with alcoholism through the majority of my 20s. I've spent a year sober twice throughout but recently I've completely isolated and fallen into that vicious cycle again. I vowed to go to a meeting tonight but instead failed myself and gave in to my urges. My sponsor was disappointed in me bailing on him tonight but offered a positive outlook   that it is within my power to stop drinking and that once I can stop for 24 hours and to go to meetings everyday I can call him to begin the steps again. ..I'm furious with my myself but refuse to completely give in and feel anger and sorrow for myself to the point of giving up. I know I can do it. One day at a time. Tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity for me to change. I pray to my higher power tonight that I will overcome this not because I need him (or her) to do it for me but to do it for myself. Thank you all or reading. I love y'all.

It's frustrating when it doesn't stick I know. Glad to know you have people who care and the desire to change. Those are hugely helpful. I hope you can find the determination you need to break the cycle you're stuck in. I believe in you. ..IWNDWYT
You can do it! Never give up never surrender.
Yes don't give up! I tried to quit for 2.5 years...never making it more than 13 days.  But eventually it clicked for me. For me it was coming here every day.  But regardless just keep trying and keep going! IWNDWYT 
Keep goin mate you can do it
