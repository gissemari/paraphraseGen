It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I had a lousy last day in Florida I had to give bad news to someone I love very much so I was upset and depressed when I got onto the plane back to San Francisco. We all took our seats and then of course twenty minutes after takeoff along came the drinks trolley. Gah! The drinks trolley: my archnemesis! The Professor Moriarty to my Sherlock Holmes!..I was still feeling troubled and the woman sitting next to me ordered Stoli vodka on the rocks with a wedge of lemon. WOW did that give me a craving. (I know that there are people on this sub who say  After being sober for X amount of time I don't even *think* about drinking anymore.  I do not happen to be one of them.)..**Triumph:** I quickly thought  Okay Mary no need to panic. You know what to do here because you have tools from r/stopdrinking.  I knew that there was no way one drink would satisfy me to be honest I knew that there was not enough liquor on the whole plane to satisfy me. I also knew that what I really needed was some food and a distraction so I asked for tomato juice and then got a snack and a magazine out of my carry-on bag...I don't care how long I've been sober. Every single time that I get through a moment like that without drinking it's a victory. . .**General:** My brother was waiting for me at the San Francisco Airport. He's very tall and usually stands out in a crowd. It's always such a comfort to catch sight of a loved one after a long and difficult trip..

Struggle - Usually the day before I swing to nights for work I stay up late and drink and watch YouTube. I didn't do that last night and I didn't get any sleep today. I feel energetic almost manic but I don't feel terrible. What I am dreading is swinging back to days this weekend. ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph - I stopped into a gas station and only got a bottle of water and a pack of gum!..&amp;#x200B;..General - I am now the proud owner of a free piano. I don't know how to play it and it won't fit anywhere else in my house except my kitchen. Hm.
Struggle:  I got in a huge argument with my SO walked home &amp; just cried. In situations like these I REALLY want a drink...Triumph:  I passed a CVS &amp; liquor store on my way home &amp; did not buy a bottle but instead went to CVS &amp; bought some soda :)..General:  I've been binging The Haunting of Hill House the past 2 days &amp; I am really enjoying it.
**Struggle:** Economy. The upcoming "one year and now what"...**Triumph:** My wife and I are starting our own business in January and in the midst of preparations. Even before we have started we have customers!..**General:** I spent all day yesterday preparing the garden for Winter. Oh I love it!!!..Mary; well done. Sorry about your troubles you re my everyday hero.
Struggle: Trying to get used to a new prescription. Sent me wave after wave of depression these last two days.  No way will I drink but geez. Going to keep pushing through these side effects as I build up some tolerance. ..Triumph: We will see if I can actually go through with it but made a decision to drive up to my property on Friday and stay until Monday. I haven't been there since last Thanksgiving. It is 63 acres of woods 3 hours north of me. I have been too anxious about driving that far by myself but I am going to do this. I need to walk through my woods. ..General: A dear friend of mine had a stroke about this time of the year 5 years ago. He was my duck and goose hunting and saltwater fishing bud. His wife had him placed into assisted living yesterday. Very sad. Getting old sucks. Sucks even worse if you get an debilitating condition. 
I'm sorry there was bad news to relate.  It's hard to disappoint those we care about.  But good job with your triumph!  Flying is so taxing even under the best circumstances and just a downright pain when things aren't great to begin with. ..**Struggle:** I'm unemployed and back to the job hunt.  I hate everything about job hunting.  I'm secretly loving being unemployed while I study but I know that I need to get a job lined up pronto...**Triumph:** I had a grand adventure with a long time friend and didn't drink or smoke throughout the trip which is a first for me with this friend.  It really is getting easier for me.  I only had a couple of brief twangs echoes of former cravings that were easy to ignore...**General:** "Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value." -Albert Einstein
Struggle : I'm having a lot a lot of trouble getting motivated for work when I have some pretty big deadlines and people counting on me. The need to meet those needs of others is going up against my need to coddle myself so I don't feel like drinking...Triumph : I stood up for myself yesterday and it felt awesome...General : sad that winter is coming and I won't be able to futz with my plants as much which has been a real pleasure for me. At the same time enjoying to cozy feelings.
Thanks mary &amp; congrats on dealing with Pro. M...Struggle: I must be getting old. My mind says go but my back &amp; knees say NO. Finding I have an hour of two at a time of semi-strenuous labor then it's break time...Triumph: Long term neglected yard work is moving along fairly well. I can now see the road out in front of the house from inside the house. It's been a while since that was possible...General: Grateful for friends who come &amp; help. George R. Kirkpatrick said..."Nature gave men two ends - one to sit on and one to think with. Ever since then man's success or failure has been dependent on the one he used most."  Peace
Just deciding to keep riding the Sober October train into No Beer November! 
My colleagues are planning a Christmas night out at some point in November (don't ask why it's in November I have no idea). Previous experience has told me there will be lots of alcohol involved mostly by my boss and senior figures...In previous years I've matched them drink for drink and then some and it is expected again this year. I'm trying to work out how to either a) get out of it completely or b) go but maintain my dry run. Not an easy task unfortunately.
Struggle - Final day of cleaning out the home I house I bought for me and my ex to start our family in. When we split I fixed it up and now have sold it. The closing is Friday...Triumph - I'm making a good bit of money on it and I have a new kind and loving partner who I want to stay sober for. I plan to use my home proceeds to build my own PC a goal I've had for maybe 10 years. ..General - Nanotechnology is now the major focus at most engineering research universities and deans believe it will be the thing that drives science in the next century. 
*Struggle:* I'm tapering off an antidepressant. A friend suggested it saying I wasn't normal and it would help with anxiety. Just slowed me down and unhinged my confidence. Honestly it felt like any other high in my life - wasn't myself and my mind tries to wish me sober/clear which is anxiety inducing in itself. Each his own each med different not for me. Careful who you listen to...*Triumph:* Kicking it at work. As the meds go away I am reminded that I am a machine of work both in the office and at home. House and property look great and it feels good...Been out and about a lot lately. Sort of embraced the who cares attitude with dating and that is paying dividends. What fun to talk and enjoy others with a light hearted attraction for the moment. Meeting more people invited into more groups enjoying the time. This weekend should be a blast...*General:* Mary the best feeling is coming home and seeing someone at the airport waiting for you. I used to travel a lot and my wife and kids would always be at the bottom of that escalator waiting for me. People around me would stare as I got the hero's welcome home. Good times. 
Glad you had a safe trip back Mary. I hope you're feeling better in knowing that *you did the right thing* ;)...**Struggle:**     I stay at my mother's on Monday night's only so that I can drive her to dialysis and go to work in the morning. Yesterday I woke up to find her laid on the kitchen floor from falling out of her wheelchair. It took me a while to change her (accident) and get her back in the chair but I did it...(more struggle below...)...**Triumph:**     Even after all that she and my sister have done to me I put it all aside and did the right thing. I guess the more positive news is that she *actually thanked me*. In view of our relationship that's like hitting the summit of Everest...**General:**     She has swallowed her damn pride and after thanking me decided she wants to communicate with me again. I'm civil to her. I will no longer tolerate and/or accept her abuse. She's my mother and I will help her like any human being would...but yea it's still a 'struggle'.

Struggle: Kitchen renovations are leaving me mentally and physically exhausted. Last night we did a dishwasher install from hell because why would things just go right when we research plan and measure ahead of time. A late night run to Lowe's followed by an even later dinner had me ready to throw in the towel or at least say screw it I don't even need a dishwasher. ..Triumph: Like Mary I'm not one of the sobernauts who doesn't think about drinking anymore. I think about it lately I've been thinking about it a lot. The kitchen problems are really just minor inconveniences and they actually take my mind off of the real issues that I'm struggling with. But I'm still here I'm still not drinking and I'm still pretty happy about that fact. ..General: One of my fond memories from childhood was seeing my dad off at the airport. Back in the day when anybody could go all the way through to the gate we would all keep my dad company until his flight boarded. Even better was when his destination was within driving distance and we got to go with him and stay at fancy hotels with swimming pools :) 
**Struggle:** I am smoking way too much at the moment. I keep telling myself at least I'm not drinking but it's making me feel crappy and I know I have to stop soon! ..**Triumph:** I'm feeling a lot better in general. I am re-learning how to deal with my emotions again. Yesterday I woke up feeling really sad because I am still feeling a bit left out by certain friends. I realised that they have their reasons for not seeing me BUT also it's not good for me to put all my energy in trying to make amends or hang out with people who don't want to do that...**General:** Went round to a friend's house (who is also sober) and we did some writing games it was pretty fun. Nice to work that creative muscle. 
**Struggle:** It's getting more and more likely that my parents will adopt my young dog. He will be happier with them I'm sure. I might be happier without the pressure of making him happy. It's breaking my heart and I keep crying everytime I think about it...**Triumph:** I feel better. Not grand but definitely better than I have since my burnout. It feels like I'm slowly pulling myself out of it. It gives me hope...**General:** Going to the university later to ask questions about documents I need to join to my application and hopefully give them those documents on the spot and then there will be nothing else to do but wait and hope.
**Triumph:** My second job has been going really well! I'm getting through to most of the kids plus it's a lot less nerve wracking the second year into a job...**Struggle:** Diet's gone to hell the past couple weeks plus I may be out of a job come the new year...**General:** My cat is an utter sweetheart. I love her to bits.
Struggle: I have court coming up at the end of the month and I'm anxious about it. This is the first time I have really been in legal trouble. I'm going to call a couple lawyers today and see about a consultation. I think I have a strong case to show I wasn't actually driving (my car was totally disabled with a flat tire I was parked keys in my purse) but part of me wants to just get this all over with and take whatever deal they offer as a first time offender. ..Triumph- I got a job! And it pays better than the one I lost! And it's in pediatrics which is something I've always wanted to do! And I get a $1000 sign on bonus which is going to be a freaking life saver after being out of work for over a week. Also my relationship with my husband has never been better- he is staying sober with me and we are reconciling after a painful separation. ..General- idk but here is one of my cats https://imgur.com/YMbvJjV
I'm sorry to hear about you having to give bad news but hopefully time will help heal that pain...**Struggle: ** I'm scared that I might drink again and what will happen if I do. I'm trying to keep my energy directed towards being sober one day at a time but sometimes it's hard for me to ignore the long term when it comes to drinking...**Triumph:** After a week of not exercising due to drinking I finally got back into my old routine and had good workouts Monday and Tuesday. It feels great to be back in the gym and working on getting stronger...**General:** I've been reading more lately and I forgot how much I love it! *The World According to Garp* by Jong Irving is a fun and funny read that sucks me in. Also I'm going on a camping trip with a friend this weekend and even though we used to drink together he knows I'm sober and supports me so I don't have to worry about drinking during that trip!
**Struggle:** Work is just down right abusive. From 40 hours and calling me in on days off to a 12 hour week because of their own negligence and lack of caring. I worked one day 9-6 when I suppose to be 11-4 (I am a work-a-holic so I didnt mind) but then wanted me to stay until 1am (I had just done tha t 9 days with 4 doubles I was posting about). Sooo I left but came back at 10om and helped them close since they were 4 people short staffed. I just dont understand if I jump through hoops for them why they can't bother to look at the calendar they provide telling us to put days we need off on there. Also pretty nervous about tomorrow - trying to keep the anxiety at bay...**Triumph:** I have stayed pretty positive and productive this October. I was stuck in a vicious drinking cycle and super depressed and sick for like months.... like only left my room to go to work and pee &amp; not eating. Anyway removing the booze has helped a ton and it is a lot of hard/busy work to be happy but I am doing it and enjoying it.  :) I have started the ball rolling going back to school and going to get a traveling job where there is zero cost of living and all income :)..**General:** u/sfgirlmary I didn't know you were here? I am just gonna tell myself you were in a different part of the state - I think it would be interesting meeting someone from on here. ..[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
I figured out my most common drinking trigger! ..Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! ..I got the powah!
**S:**  Trying to obtain a copy of daughter's baptismal certificate.  That's not going so well...**T:**  Ex wanted me to pick her up to take her to parent teacher conferences.  I didn't even hesitate and said no right away...**G:**  Full Moon.
Ugh what a challenge Mary!  So glad you got the seltzer.  I had a similar happening on one of my last trips.  Guy next to me got a screwdriver and I thought how "fun" it could be to enjoy a drink and feel a little naughty.  And then I ordered my seltzer with lime and pigged out on the chocolate I had brought!  One drink might not bring me down but the succeeding ones would...**Struggle:**  Working on making new patterns to encourage flourishing instead of just coping.  Realizing just how much I let my emotions and avoidance behaviors run my life.  And at 43 it's freaking hard to make new grooves in this record!  ..**Triumph:**  I'm aiming for a keystone change that will lead to additional changes in an easier manner.  For me that's getting to bed at 9:30.  If I go to bed earlier I'll be well-rested and more willing to engage in new behaviors and will have time in the morning to work on myself.  I'm not beating myself up if I don't do a whole lot yet in the morning keeping my eye on 9:30 right now as the big goal to reach on a consistent basis.  It feels a lot less overwhelming and manageable.  I've done it 2 days in a row and am aiming for the whole week!..**General:**  Going to therapy and AA today that's a first!  Determined to give this AA thing another try to see what I can glean in spiritual growth.  Realizing that sobriety has always been key to the spiritual growth I desire.
Struggle: I've been having thoughts about drinking lately. Just feeling envious of the folks who can drink socially. But I haven't given into them and I won't. I've completely changed my outlook on alcohol since sobriety. Booze just leads to emptiness and I definitely want my life to be full and happy. ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: We have a boil water ban here in Austin. Happy to say unlike my friends I haven't boiled water for ICE for vodka tequila or anything else. It's no longer necessary. My agency has an alternating work schedule until the ban is lifted so I am working every other day for this week and next. The break is sorely needed. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: It's a first world problem but I took advantage of an upgrade and ordered the new iPhone. On pins and needles waiting for it to arrive. 
Struggle- a week sober has shown me just how much stress/discontent that I've been trying to drink away...Triumph- I'm not trying to drown these problems I'm getting to analyze them with a clear head and less likely to make any rash conclusions...Neutral- sober isn't how I usually spend my favorite time of year before Halloween. Musing about what other activities I've never even thought of to spice up the season 
S:  teaching my kid how to drive. I'm an anxious mess but it's happening. Slowly. A drink would have been nice after last night's lesson but not worth it...T:  Got a great performance review @ work after a tough year in which my husband died (and I worked my ass off). ..G:  Life is better now.
S: More and more work hoops from external sources... Which I worry is upsetting my current employer because it's getting me off track for a timeline we agreed upon. It is my fault it some ways for procrastinating over the past few years but also nothing I can control now. Just trying to avoid letting my thoughts spiral into anxiety ("They are gonna fire you!!"). Meeting with a supervisor today to discuss it all.  .  .T: I am mostly caught up on day to day stuff. Paperwork healthy meals exercise household. That is honestly a triumph for me this week.  .  .G: I looked at the veins in the back of my eye last night thanks to Reddit so...that was neat? Lol.
**Struggle:** I've been feeling a bit low and even slightly bitter lately which isn't normal for me (luckily).  I don't know exactly why but it seems to be tied the conflict of wanting answers to some of those little life questions (why am I here; what is my purpose; how can I be a better; happier person; how can I be at peace; etc) and my general laziness to really seek the answers and do the work (and thereby remain feeling unfulfilled)...**Triumph:** I am thinking about these things something I rarely did with any consistency when I was in the alcohol loop...**General:**  Welcome back to the West Coast u/sfgirlmary sorry you had a lousy last day in FLA and then had to deal with the alcohol pusher on the flight.  I've found that getting a window seat having my own water/snacks playing music on my headphones wearing and eye shades or sunglasses and pretending to be asleep helps me a lot in that situation.
I'm sorry about your struggle. That sounds really hard and I commend you on your solution. I will also always be someone who prefers an alcoholic drink over a NA one especially on a plane! ..&amp;#x200B;..Struggle: I'm just not feeling a lot of motivation at work these days. Having trouble getting my head back in it.   ...Triumph: Went to a kettlebell class last night - it had been a while since I had done weight training and it felt good! ..&amp;#x200B;..General: I forgot how much I love scented candles! 
Day one. Gonna refocus on lifting weights studying manuals from new job. Determined to keep it going and give myself the Christmas present of looking better and being smarter. 
**Struggle** As u/sfgirlmary says &gt; After being sober for X amount of time I don't even think about drinking anymore.  I do not happen to be one of them..Yeah me neither. Last night after posting several comments about how great sobriety is I started journaling and ended up sobbing after writing about my feelings about never drinking ever again. Watching BF sip IPAs night after night after fucking night isn't helping lately. I think what's going on with me at this stage in sobriety (think my badge hasn't added a day in several days for some reason) is that I'm realizing that this is for real and forever and not just an experiment or a phase. ..**Triumph** After a brutal summer and difficult early Fall in this job I'm finally getting the hang of it and I'm seldom working more than 45 hours a week anymore. Also my good bill of health at the doctor was a major fucking triumph so I have a lot to be happy about and thankful for and should quit my boo-hooing about not "getting to" drink anymore!..**General** Looking forward to a nice quiet weekend of projects around the new house reading and sipping hot tea. Peace ya'll.
Happy Wednesday guys!
Struggle: I had an incredibly triggering day at work a coworker was arrested for doing something absolutely abhorrent another called out sick and another was just being irritating..Triumph: I have meditated every day so far in October on forgiveness a challenge from a recovery friend. One week left and I've actually increased my sitting to twice daily the last few days...General: It's 1pm and I haven't got to sleep yet since getting off work at 7am so I'm a little sleepy.

Struggle: I've had some pretty annoying cravings this week. There's a fairly large music/beer festival in town this weekend - usually it'd be a no brainer but I think I'll find something else to do. Sometimes it feels like I'm missing out on things being sober but usually this feeling passes after a bit. ..Triumph: I'm starting to see the financial rewards of not throwing away a shit load of money on booze. I have a little leftover to save this month and payoff some debt a little faster. ..General: I've been in a pretty crappy mood this week. Not sure if it's PAWS or something else - but I'm feeling better today.
Struggle: I've had a hard time getting motivated for work. I just find it exhausting. I think it has a bit to do with working on myself so much... I just don't have the mental capacity to stress myself out so I just don't do things. ..Triumph: I went on a trip to Vegas and had a fabulous time without drinking or smoking. I know who the fuck am I?!?!? I would have laughed in your face if you said that was possible six months ago. But it's given me a great feeling of possibility. What other things might actually be better while sober?..General: Halloween is fun. I like how it's not summer anymore! (I'm from a hot place lol!)
I came home today to find my bedroom has been turned into a kids room. My roommate just rented out our house to a family and just forgot to mention it. He works away 3 weeks of the month. So now I have to move all my stuff to one room in the unfinished basement. I really want to drink. But drinking won't make this any better I guess. 
My struggles today  None.  Zero.  Nip.  Naught. Not a thing..My victories I am sober I have my Reddit friends...I plan a meeting with a guy from work tomorrow Friday local time. He does not know I will be going...I have been talking a little of my problem last couple of weeks. Yesterday this guy comes in. Court order to pay fines...General I have had a good week. No desire for old life. ..Your Friend John
