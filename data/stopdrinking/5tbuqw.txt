As the title says I have just finished reading Elizabeth Vargas' memoir on addiction and panic. Wow just wow. I am in awe...I have previously read similar books on addiction all by women. And I have liked all of them. They are so eye opening. But this one this one really struck a chord with me. She describes her Anxiety and Panic attacks just as I would if I could: crippling. Her addiction to Alcohol is still a daily struggle but as she and we on here say "I take it Day by Day."..I would love to hear your thoughts on the book if you have read it! And I hope you all are enjoying your Friday evening. I Will not drink with you tonight!..  onward & upward

Oh cool. I will def check this out.
I've read it.  And her story is scary she is very lucky.  I just saw she is speaking at the She Recovers conference in NYC this spring.  
I listened to the audiobook and enjoyed it. I can't imagine the pressure she was under to keep it together and coming clean to the tv execs. 
I'll let you know! look forward to reading
