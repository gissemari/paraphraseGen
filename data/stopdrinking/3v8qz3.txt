It's been another good year overall.  I've been doing well in my career and spending lots of great quality time with my two young sons.  Had some struggles lately with other addictive substances (gambling binge eating cigars) but making some progress in recent weeks in part thanks to getting back into reading this sub on a regular basis and realizing that it all stems from the same root cause as my alcoholism.  Each day I'm inspired by everyone here.   Thanks for reading!

Good for you thanks for this update!

Yes!! updates like this give me the drive to continue and thanks for the honesty. All is not fixed by sobriety but sure is more manageable.
Way to sustain focus.
