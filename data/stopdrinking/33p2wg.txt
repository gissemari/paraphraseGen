I've been so good/disciplined/whatever the last 40 days. Today I'm feeling tempted to drink - not tonight but next weekend. Some friends of mine are coming up to visit me. I'm kind of tired and stressed. I guess it was always a way to wind down for me and now I feel constantly wound up and full of energy. Life has been good a lot better than it used to be but kind of boring recently. I'm living in the kind of small town where all there is to do is drink and there isn't much else exciting I can get into. I don't really have much to look forward to in the next 6 months or so which is maybe the bigger problem. I don't know. This is right around the time I relapsed last time and it took me 8 months to get back to this point again. I feel like I've lost focus on why I stopped and I know I need to find it again but I'm not really sure how.

Someone awesome posted this: ."One whole month! It's not much but it's pretty significant to me. Here's to the next one :). ".http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/32f7ol/i_got_my_star/
Remember this worry: .So I'm incredibly anxious and stressed out today. I can't stop worrying about how many brain cells I've lost or reading up about how alcoholism increases the chances of breast cancer and infertility or thinking about whether my liver is all messed up. I'm just really worried about the permanent damage I might have done in the last couple of years (about 2 years of really heavy drinking with 'normal' drinking for a few years before that). I hate the fact that I might have ruined my body and there's nothing I can do to change that. Help?.http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2zx62w/how_do_you_stop_panicking_about_the_damage_you/.
Just remember: if you can make it this far you can keep going. Find a hobby or obtain a new goal if your town is small or boring. Get out and try something new or find something that you're passionate about. Your friends can always drink and you can be the DD. ...Alcohol is just a temporary solution and all it is is detrimental to your health.  ..Congrats on your sobriety! I know it's hard sometimes but alcohol just makes things worse.
And this post should bring you back " I've been trying 'moderation' for a long time now with predictable results. It doesn't work for me. It's time to stop making excuses as to why I can justify alcohol 'just this once' for the fourth time that week. Day one. Lets do this.".http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2z00vf/i_think_im_ready/
Wow!  I was just hearing from Rufus about how relapses happen before a person drinks again.  I didn't understand it.  And here you are already realizing it!. And he explained that before the drinking comes the loss of doing those things that you do to stay sober.  I myself didn't know that I had things I did to stay sober but as I thought about it I realized that I did:  meditation prayer supporting people on r/sxd reading these posts trying to do good for people on a one-by-one basis..As I read your post I wonder if there is anything you do to stay sober?  Have you stopped doing it?  Can you get back to it?.Then I wonder if you are worried that you won't be able to entertain your friends w/o drinking.  If it were me I would let them know right off that I'm not drinking but they can (I know that is hard for some) and plan to do some fishing board games etc.  I wish you best of luck and continued sobriety!
These feelings will pass! :)
You're mulling over a lot of long-term thoughts there. Remember we win this fight one step at a time. One day at a time. ..Next weekend six months from now... They're not here yet. Today is here. And you're not going to drink today...You're awesome MessedupMakeup!
Don't do it! I was just over 40 days when I relapsed and I was kicking myself and regretting drinking g again within a week.  Once I pop the fun stops. 
This is called planning a relapse. ..Get out of your head and end the debate about drinking.  When you feel those thoughts start penetrating your mind you have to change course and not engage. ..If you have a sponsor this is exactly when you call them and talk it out.  ...If you give up now you will soon be back where you started. ..And when you started you were desperate to be where you are now.  ...That voice gets a lot easier to control in time.  But right now you are deep in the danger zone.  ..Don't give in man!!

/r/audiomeditation should help there are lots of 10 min guided meditations and you can filter on the length of time if you like.
