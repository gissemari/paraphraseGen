Where do you people get all that motivation to do things?.I was drinking because I was stressed and bored. I haven't for 12 days but life hasn't become all shiny and beautiful I just don't wake up with a hangover (which is great) but I spend most of my time reading books and still struggle to get up and do things. ..I have close to no friends here no boyfriend no job and the weather is terrible so I guess it's not helping. But I feel that after a week the only thing left is being proud of myself for resisting. Life is still shitty as always. I need to study and I don't clean the house and I don't... I just lay there with the cat. I read all your nice stories - going for walks playing with the kids chatting with the husband... it all seems so far away...I'm going to an AA kind of thing on Monday until then I'll just have to pick up my ass and try to move a bit.

You know I think if it were winter where I am I would do what you're doing. There's nothing wrong with that. Last night I retreated to the "library" at 8pm and read books with the cat. ..However it's really nice outside so I have plans to do stuff with people today. I think what's helped me is that it's REALLY EASY to make plans with people. Like "hey I see that you're a runner wanna go for a jog on Saturday?" It's very easy to just say those words and then hey you've got something to do!..I'm also reveling in stuff that felt too "dorky" to do when I was drinking. ..Give yourself a break it's early. You don't need to be out changing the world right now. You're doing an awesome enough job changing yourself. Good luck!
I think that things will start changing as of Monday. When we are alone in our thought process time can stretch out very thin. But once you get a support system going and get yourself involved time starts flying like crazy. This is what happened to me since AA became part of my life. I suggest you get involved and see what happens.
There are no big successes without small ones. Give it time and just keep doing the right thing one day at a time. It takes a while for the self-confidence and drive to come back but if you work at it the best you can I'm sure things will start falling together sooner or later. The most important thing is to not drink though - if you can get through things now without a drink you'll set yourself up well for real joy in sobriety later on. Stick with it!
good for you on resisting the urge. it sounds like drinking wasn't fun for you anymore so you stopped before it ruined you completely. ..IMO the first month is all about not drinking. ..be active or lie around do what you have to to re align your mind and body. the weather inside of you will clear up eventually. ..and feel free to use the chatroom offered in the sidebar!.
The problem of "why do anything" exists whether or not one is drinking.  Solving it is called "life."

I know exactly the feeling you're describing...It's the proverbial "hump" people refer to when they say you have to "get over the hump." It will get easier and your energy will increase you just have to give yourself the best opportunity possible to make that goal come true. Try to get a good nights sleep eat healthy. If you dont have any friends put yourself out there. Join a club or online dating website. Anything to get you replacing your dormancy with activity. That's whats been working for me and I was notoriously stressed tired and doubtful through my first 30. The AA group thing on Monday sounds like a fantastic start. It helps to be part of a supportive community:)

For me it's as simple as just going and doing things. I clean do housework call friends instead of waiting for them to call me exercise joined a soccer team signed up for bjj classes starting cooking classes soon read more... I just go do
It took me months to get motivated to do things. I also never really got that super happy excited feeling of sobriety like so many others got. But I do know that my awesome life now is a direct result of quitting. All the good things in life that you desire aren't there right now but with sobriety and time they will surely be yours :)
Man I've been where you are. I've been there so many times. Spent most of my twenties there actually. ..I agree with /u/sustainedrelease. It's the accumulation of small efforts over time that eventually transition you into a different way of living. A different way of being. ..Every day is different and presents its own challenges. (I've lapsed four times in the last eight months thanks to some days that threw me for a loop.) But overall my quality of life has come roaring back in so many ways. It will for you too but it won't happen overnight. For me it took a few months before I could even blink into the daylight with any semblance of clarity.
A little perspective - you're at 12 days and simply not drinking for 12 days is a huge accomplishment. Monumental. The first couple of weeks are pretty tough for most people...That said I'd add that long term not drinking takes away the pain but it doesn't necessarily add joy at least not on its own. It allows you to get to baseline to a point where other positive life changes are possible. I don't know anyone who was content with just not drinking long term. Almost everyone layers on friends hobbies exercise spiritual growth volunteering service work etc. ..tl;dr Not drinking is the key that unlocks potential in your life but you have to turn the key step through the threshold and meet life halfway.
Other than dragging myself to meetings I barely went out my first four months or so. I was miserable angry lonely worn out and raw. I started with little stuff a fellowship here and there a movie with new sober friends etc.  Some people start feeling better and social instantly some need time to heal. And it's ok to give yourself that time. 
Keep going! Life gets weirder. Your head keeps getting clearer. It took me 30 days to start dreaming again. ..If you still don't like life after a while 30 days or whatever go change it. You'll have sobriety on your side and realize that you can do whatever you want.
At twelve days in I don't think I felt like doing much either. It was still fresh scary depressing and confusing. Give yourself credit and give yourself time. ..I am glad you are going to AA to find people to talk to. I don't go to AA but I couldn't imagine doing this with nobody to talk to!..I know that sometimes I've just got to force myself to do shit. I started exercising and eating well during my first and second month and I just started feeling amazing and it was no longer a chore. Last night for the first time I got a huge craving and I sat around feeling depressed and confused. I thought back to what I have been doing and I realized I stopped working my plan my routine. I haven't worked out except for a paltry effort or two in a week and a half and I've been eating like total crap. The one thing I always said about my recovery was that it wasn't enough for me to just quit drinking I had to do something else. And here I was ignoring my own advice and wondering why shit started to slide downhill for me. ..I don't really feel like working out today but I am going to. I don't really feel like making a huge breakfast with lots of vegetables but I will. Because I've figured out what makes me feel better. Find out what makes you feel better. I can't speak for you but I am so used to making choices that please me instantly (like getting drunk) that some days it feels hard to wrap my brain around doing stuff that I don't always feel like doing to get what I want. 
It'll be a marathon and not a sprint and some miles will be tougher than others with the first mile always being the hardest but if you stick with it I promise you that it will be worth it.  You'll find the friends the significant other the job the hobbies and the happiness + serenity 1 2 punch.  We'll be here to help you every step of the way.

&gt;I haven't for 12 days but life hasn't become all shiny and beautiful I just don't wake up with a hangover (which is great) but I spend most of my time reading books and still struggle to get up and do things. ..First off it's only been 12 days so settle down a bit. It likely didn't take 12 days for your life to get to the point where it was so it may take a bit longer than that to fix...Second not drinking is not all that it's cracked up to be. Simply not drinking will not automatically make everything better on its own. Simply not drinking is just the first step in changing your life. Not drinking gives you the time clarity money and energy to really fix your shit up. Some would even posit that not drinking can be the easy part. ..The real benefits start to accrue when you free yourself from the torture chamber that is getting drunk and being hungover all the time and begin to **work** at making your life better. ..I started by making achievable realistic goals. These were things I *knew* would improve my life and were in my control. You can't just say "Goal: find a husband in six months lol!" However you could make it a goal to engage in more activities. Once you make that goal look at ***exactly*** what steps are needed to get there. Or maybe you want to be in better shape to attract a more desirable mate. Make a realistic action plan based on what people who have done what you want to do have done. Personally I choose a barbell program from the sidebar of /r/fitness and just started despite all my apprehension. Six months later and there's a different motherfucker staring back at me in the mirror. Maybe you want to go back to school? What is literally the first step in making this happen? What is the second step? Third? Etc. ..Don't be a victim of this shit. Get up and do something about it. You have literally shrugged off the yoke that holds millions of people down. Get up. Get out. Be exceptional. There is no one stopping you but yourself.
