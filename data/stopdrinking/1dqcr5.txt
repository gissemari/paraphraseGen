I've been struggling on my own to get and stay sober and in all honesty I have failed miserably.  I am not crazy about going to AA my local meetings are held at the church and tend to be heavy on the religion side.  .I found Women For Sobriety it seems like it could be a really good fit for me.  I contacted them to find out about meetings and hope they have some in my area. Has anyone had any experience with the program before? ..I have to take action before this gets more out of hand. I'm completely ashamed of myself for getting into this place and my lack of control. I have a social worker who in the past has really helped me but haven't ask for help because I'm both embarrassed and don't want to disappoint her. I realize that is pretty stupid and am meeting with her on Tuesday. I'm gonna write out what's going on and pass it over because I need her help.  Least that's my goal.

Welcome. You are reaching out which is a good sign. As a woman I too was "ashamed". However once I learned about alcoholism it was clear I had a disease and was not a moral degenerate. You're normal not "stupid". Asking for help takes courage and humility. Your social worker will respect you the opposite of being disappointed. ..Although AA is not "religious" it sounds that way sometimes. Meetings are in churches because the cost for the space is low not because of they are religious. Did you actually go to a meeting? Every one has its own personality so judging AA by just one meeting or by rumor is selling yourself short. AA saved my life even though I don't agree with everything and you don't have to.  ..Sobriety for Women is a good support system too. I have only online knowledge of the program however and am not aware of any meetings in my locale. I strongly encourage you to be involved in a support group. It makes it much easier and more fun to stay sober...It's a good idea to write out all the ways alcohol is causing problems because there's something powerful about dumping the words out on paper and seeing them in black and white. This will increase your confidence when talking to your social worker. You don't have to tell her everything but enough to let her know you want to stop drinking and don't know how to achieve it. ..What works for me is one day at a time. Don't drink today. I wish you the best. 
WFS isn't active in my area but you should look into the Booze Free Brigade which I mentioned in an [earlier comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1do25t/clarity_and_emotional_support_realisation/c9s7nc4). It's mostly women and very helpful. It's all online via a Yahoo list and a secret (private) Facebook page.
