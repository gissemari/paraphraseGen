 but the amazing thing is is that I don't have to drink no matter how good or bad I feel...I've been posting a lot lately and wanted to update that I'm still feeling a bit funky but there is a bit of sunshine on the horizon. So I'm feeling that maybe the worst is over which is really nice to know...I'm also really proud of myself for not truly entertaining the urges to drink I had to come out the feelings I had. I have sporadic thoughts and sometimes I had really intense cravings. But the healthy part of my brain reminded me that introducing a depressant when I was already feeling depressed would only make things worse. 2 years ago I wouldn't have cared. But now I have built some sober time and seeing the Miracles of sobriety that I won't give that up for the world...I want to thank everyone here for all of the support the past week. Knowing there are such compassionate people out there who share my struggle has been an immense help. Thank you!

great job. it is worth it i was just thinking this morning how I don't miss the hangovers - particularly a summer hangover - ..excessive sweating... that goddamn headache that gets worse throughout the morning. aww man my stomach turns thinking about it. ..sobriety is a funny thing because I went through a doozy of an April and the entire month I felt mentally awful - as if I were back on the booze. just a truly wretched month mentally and emotionally. that was the worst I've had it in my sobriety thus far a real challenge and a test of patience. good luck to you stay strong and keep your health in mind
Agreed. There are rough times and bad days and sometimes cravings but none of it compares to my sobriety. 
I hear you. I've been struggling with depression for a while and yesterday I voiced my "restlessness and irritability" at a meeting. I had left beer-guzzling relatives to find some sober peace of mind. I felt better or maybe calmer--no magic words of wisdom but I know that I can live with these feelings no matter how painful they may be. As you said the alternative is much much worse. Add alcohol to the mix and we court disaster. I have to remind myself that feelings can be dealt with one day at a time too.
So true. Sometimes it's a shitty Memorial Day weekend that everyone **but** you seems to enjoy. *Sigh* ..I wonder how many of our SD brothers and sisters didn't make it through the holiday.
You had me at "puppies"!
I've got a killer headache today to rival my worst hangover and to echo u/oldethel the summer hangovers can be the worst. At least I know for certain mine is not from alcohol. Sober on.
Wow amazing I thought the universe tilted upside down everything sucked for several weeks in a row and I felt weak and my cravings were pissing me off!  The past few days (knock on wood) things have been better and I've stared down and refused drinks almost under my nose. Nothing is worth it. Not for me anyway. Thanks for posting. 
You have had a ton of posts in the last week on here. Are you doing ok? You seem to be on a roller coaster and you have a decent amount of sober time at this point so this is concerning. 
This is Such Great News my friend!!  .I'm still sending daily Blessings to you!  **: )**
Today started full of dead puppies and darkness because I filled it full of Wrath Vengeance and ruminating until I shook it off.  I was being a big dummy. Picking up would not have helped. I &lt;3 me some deedeethecat. 
Here comes the sun little darlin'; here comes the sun and I say "It's all right."  &lt;3
