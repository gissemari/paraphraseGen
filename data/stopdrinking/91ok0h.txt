The Daily Check-In for Wednesday July 25th: Just for today I am NOT drinking!..We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!..Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..This pledge is a statement of intent...Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...What this is:..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning...What this isn't:..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread...This post goes up at:..US Night/Early Morning..Europe Morning..Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...I just hung up the phone with my father.  We live about 3000 miles apart but have talked at least once a week most of my adult life - we have always had a good relationship.  He used to drunk dial me quite regularly but he quit drinking 5 years ago.  The last few years I have been the drunk dialer.  I don't know how many times I have not even remembered what we talked about the next day. I have been fairly open with him about my struggles lately and in a weird way I guess it is nice that he understands.  Today is 10 weeks for me - I'm proud of myself for making it this far.  now I've got my sights set on three months.  Things aren't perfect but I feel like they are getting better.  IWNDWYT!
----------immediate responses--------

Congrats on ten weeks u/msmith83!..I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today (or tomorrow since it's just before midnight for me!).
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
Morning from Maine. I'm up late doing the laundry because it is going to be hot and sticky tomorrow. Folding clothes when it is cool is so much nicer...IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today! I had a situation earlier that gave me every opportunity to drink - nice cocktails I didn't have to pay for. But I did not indulge and more than that I did not even feel much of a desire to. It was easy for me to turn down....I'm sure other situations will present themselves and that's part of life but for tonight I wasn't even tempted
Today marks 26 years of continuous sobriety.  AA saved my life.  I didn't go to AA because ai was an alcoholic. I had checked myself into a pysch hospital for depression and this pretty little girl said she was going to a meeting and asked if I wanted to go with her. I joke now that I entered the hospital for depression and came out 4 weeks later an alcoholic.  ..If you are new to sobriety all I can say is that there are ways to quit. Find a program with people that you can meet with in person.  The Internet is a great resource but nothing can replace face to face discussion with people that have been through it as well. ..IWNDWYT 
I will not drink with you today 
Sober in serenity in action in service today.
Catching rainbows with you guys today   
Morning from the UK! ..Well done on 10 weeks mssmith! .Another hot day and am just off to work. Nowt much to say today except take care out there sobernauts! IWNDWYT   
Another night shift another sober day. You are all beautiful people. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
Wednesday already... we're getting there! IWNDWYT 
one more day
Not drinking with you all today!!
Morning /r/stopdrinking and happy hump day from a cloudy but toasty Scotland! As always Wednesdays are my deadline days so I'm currently steeling myself for a Category 5 shitstorm at work with coffee and Riverdales' Tarantula (as recommended on a previous check-in by/u/Bewareofgirls - thank you!). There's a comedy open mic tonight that I might go along to afterwards out of a perhaps-misguided optimism - I'm sure it'll be great!..Today is Day 206 - IWNDWYT!
No booze today!
Not drinking with you this fine Wednesday evening in Sydney town
Just got home after finishing work for the week. I won't drink for the rest of today/tonight.

Another stressful day in Aus. One thing was good then some shitty stuff came along. I will not drink tonight because I don't need a hangover *and* the problems I've got tomorrow.
I'm not drinking today!

IWNDWYT 
Hump day done and on the countdown for the weekend .I have a touch of post holiday blues and a bit of jet lag but not drinking tonight!
I will not drink with you today! 
Went to the psychiatrist yesterday to do a med follow up and I noticed this time all the empty bottles of wine in his office mostly they are staged in a decorative way anyway thought it weird and asked about it he said he loves his wine. I really don't have a problem with that just weird to have them in the office. Anyway he pissed me off when he stated at the end of our session that he was glad to hear I was not drinking to much at this point I was standing up and had to make it clear to him that I have not had a drop of alcohol since Dec. 29th is this info not in your notes you keep writing kind of pissed me off that he did not seem to pay attention to my progress.Anyway I am doing very well but perhaps I need to look into a new shrink. No drinks today.. Peace
Day 2 - I will not drink today. Have a great one :-)
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today.
Got my eyes on the 2 weeks mark tomorrow. I will not drink with you today!

I will raise my glass of sparkling water to not drinking.
Good morning everyone I hope you all have a safe and sober day IWNDWYT 
Good morning. Today I laid in till 10am! And I should've been at work too! I don't mind though I have been unbelievably tired since I stopped drinking and stopped caffeine also. I needed this sleep and my mind and body feel a bit better. Still a lot of tiredness in me but it feels good to be slowly paying off that debt rather than continually adding to it...I will not drink with you all today   
I will not drink today .
I will not drink with you today.
Not today.
2 weeks today. IWNDWYT.

I wll not drink today.
Did not hit the Mega Millions jackpot. Still IWNDWYT! Good day everyone!!!
Yesterday was "one in a row" alcohol free days thanks to stumbing onto this subreddit.  Best sleep I've had in a long time may as well go for two.  IWNDWYT indeed.
Day 4 today. ...Already feeling the tug of a craving and it's only 0530. I think it will be a long day. ...I will not drink with you today. 
Congrats msmith!!  I will NOT drink with you today!  Peace

IWNDWYT
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
Here and feeling strong! I will not drink with you today!
Glorious sober morning soberniks! Had a bad Monday on a Tuesday yesterday but overcame evil oppressor's attempt to place shackles upon me.  Vigilance!  IWNDWYT 
Good morning from Prince Edward Island IWNDWYT 
(Sigh) I didn't win the half-billion plus Mega Millions lottery last night. What a surprise right? My (sole) $2 ticket was a clean miss. Another surprise right? ..But the good news is my betting on sobriety is paying handsome dividends!
Good for you u/msmith83. I had a friend mid conversation say to me "I shouldn't even bother telling you this story because you won't remember anyways. You're constantly repeating your own stories because you don't remember telling them.". Ouch. It was the past and now talks are much better...I will not drink today. Coffee tastes good got a plan for work going to skate this afternoon. I'll be alright ya know?!   :)
Here.
Day 1
Now  more than ever I need the support of this group..I will not drink with you today and I will repeat this to myself hourly all day.. Peace and strength to all who come here.
Good morning! I'm in a weird place with a lot of stress and insecurity but IWNDWYT 
I am learning that vacation is just as much fun without drinks. Swimming is fun. Relaxing is actually relaxing. Parks are fun. IWNDWYT.
starting day 2 IWNDWYT
Ain't gonna drink with you today!   
Checking in. I will not drink today. Some days are harder than others but im happy to struggle through if it means I can keep my sobriety. Onwards!
Ah! There's my red 6 I've been waiting to see! So grateful to our awesome mods here at SD. ..Good morning from rainy Minnesota. I'm still having a hard week and I'm trying to get my head in a better space. One of the sober Insta accounts I follow had a post over the weekend to the effect of "try replacing 'I have to' with 'I get to'" and I think that's a great sentiment. I'm trying there. What I'm going through here is first world problem stuff for sure that I'm lucky to experience. Somehow the stress is making me petty AF in my current daily life while also having me lying awake in bed at night thinking about old griefs and ancient sorrows. I think this all will pass. I know drinking wouldn't help. Here's hoping for an easier low stress hump day. I will not drink with you today.
Just got home from yoga and wont be drinking. IWNDWYT and namaste 
I won't drink with you today
Checking in!  IWNDWYT!
8 Days in the books. On to Day 9. IWNDWYT!
Msmith:  Congrats on 10 weeks!  Nothing weird about being able to relate to your Dad and he to you. That's good...Let's keep on keeping on...And even though I face my biggest test so far - a visit from a very old friend who drives me totally nuts I Will NOT drink with you today...I keep reminding myself of what someone on here said:  Whether I win the lottery or somebody dies I ain't drinkin'.
Thought my working day and first part of this project is finish.Well it's another day done.Guess what?I dislike civil engineers stronglyfuck them and fuck their little architect buddies.
I will not drink with you today.

I did not drink today in Sydney. I will not drink tomorrow...Still tshirt weather in the middle of winter. Pleasant but scary..
Today Jul 25 marks 105 days or 15 weeks or 3.5 months. Anyway I look at it .. It sounds fantastic to me. Never been this "sober" before!..I've said before.. It ain't easy. But every day I wake up sober it seems worth it!..IWNDWYT..
Good morning all!..Day 2 for me. I'm feeling pretty good today. About to leave for work. I hope everyone has a good day...IWNDWYT

I will not drink today..
Had a stupid drinking dream last night glad to wake up and realize it was just a dream!  I WNDWYT!

Good day to you all!  IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today
I haven't checked in in a bit due to some issues going on with my feet last few weeks. Been in a lot of pain and can't walk at all doctors have yet to find a cause. I haven't really been able to work or anything but lay down and it's taking a toll on me. I couldn't get alcohol even if I wanted to and while there's still a little part in the back of my mind that wants to - I do not want to. IWNDWYT.
Up early getting to it! Definitely gonna have a nap later! But not a drink! IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT  
Nope not today! 
I will not drink today
I will not drink today!
Damn I miss being able to call and talk with my father. It's frustrating as hell. Anyway I've been working a job from hell for quite some time now and it is destroying my body due to the intensity of it and it's a night job. Today I have a job interview at a cool place that is within walking distance of my house and yesterday - an former co-worker submitted my resume to the hiring manager at my old company for a really cool job. Things are going to change! I will not drink today!!
Aldi makes a Girl Scout cookie knockoff with coconut caramel and fudge and I bought myself a package so I could take them to work with me (otherwise my rotten kids will eat them all) and I forgot them at home. Cue copious pouting. ..Went to trivia last night and they had THREE different types of sour beer on the menu. I was sorely tempted but I didn't get one. I just squeezed extra lemon into my seltzer. 
I will stay sober today.
DC to Chattanooga for 5 days and here is one thing I always take with me ...my mantra...I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
I will not drink with you today!
10 weeks is awesome! So is 26 years! Congratulations! IWDWYT!
Good morning all. I will not drink with you today. Have a good one!
Day 2.  Still nauseous and anxious from  a brutal hangover.  IWNDWYT. 
Sleepy...I will not drink with y'all today!
Three more days and nights at the beach house with the in-laws...I will not drink with you today..
Cake please! (Eddie Izzard reference) Hope you have a great one SD. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today!
Happy 10 weeks /u/msmith83 ! it will be three months before you know it really :)..I got a bona fide miracle today - after busting ass and stressing out ahead of our house inspection - the person that showed up to do it was not the mean troll! The troll got sacked - and the new agent is super-reasonable pleasant and was entirely happy with how the place looks even though daughter's playroom is STILL a crap-filled catastrophe! But the rest of the house looks pretty damn awesome so afterwards I also got to enjoy that feeling of having a clean and mostly tidy house and not post-inspection angst. Bliss! So no booze for me today and none tonight [but I did make myself the most delicious and super-strong dirty chai for the drive to and from the city to get Kiddo to Cub Scouts!]. And I won't be drinking with y'all tomorrow :).
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
I will not drink any alcohol today.  Going to try to control what I can and let the rest go.
I won't drink with you all today!
I will not drink with you today because I do not drink.
I swear if one more thing in my house breaks I'm going to eat this entire half-gallon of ice cream but I won't drink. Please send love and maybe cash.
Day 24: I will not drink with you today. At this point this daily pledge is the only thing keeping me going.
I will not drink today
I will not drink today!
Not drinking today!
not today!

Conference this week which will likely be full of booze. My plan is to check in here daily and head back to my room if I start to get any goofy thoughts in the moment. Making sure to take time to be mindful and play the tape forward. I WILL NOT drink with you today!
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink with you today my friends. 
I will not drink with you today.

Working on day 20 and IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
Day 1 got delayed a little bit. So -2 from the badge. But I'm here again. This time with a few more tools to help me through than last time.  IWNDWYT.
I missed a couple check ins because I was out of town for a long weekend. Here I am for day 17! IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today. 
Good morning msmith and SD. Happy hump day. I will not drink with you today. 
Good morning. I will not drink with you today. Taking my "baby" (is he still a baby now that he is 2?) On his first backpacking trip!!! So exciting for me since backpacking is my thing. I hope he has fun but how can he not have fun?  There will be so many rocks to throw in the lake!
I will not drink with you today! 
Will I stay alcohol free today?..Yes I will not drink with you all today.
Good morning SD I will not drink with you today!
Here we go again.  My brain is constantly trying to think about quitting forever or how long this break should be.  All I really need to think about is that today is 24 hours.  I will not drink for 24 hours and I'll be back here tomorrow.
I will not drink with you all today!.
I will not drink today. 
Another rough night but a sober one.  Sleep has been difficult to obtain but once down I am sleeping deeper.  ..IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today!
Instead of drinking today I am going to hydrate and try to drink a gallon of water! Might sound dumb but it's a fun a challenge and nothing beats the feeling of being truly hydrated 
IWNDWYT!  
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink with you today
IWNDWYT!!!!
I will not drink with you today!
I'm really noticing how highly irritated I am at 'drinking time' when I'm not drinking. The beast is nasty. I hope this gets easier. IWNDWYT. 
I will not drink with you today.
Happy Wednesday from the Mississippi Gulf Coast! I will not drink with you today  
I will not drink with you today  
Hello SD! I won't drink with you all today.

I will not drink with you today
Been having bad dreams lately possibly due to stress. I know it's not from alcohol tho. IWNDWYT!!
Day 2. IWNDWYT!!!
Keep going!
I'm day 77 so right with you.  Thanks for doing the check in.  I won't drink with you today. 
I *will not* drink with you today!
Not drinking today! 14 days today! I am really proud of myself :D
I will not drink today :)
Things are tough today but I will not drink!
Not drinking today
I will not drink with you today
Wow ten weeks! Amazing congrats!..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT even though my children are driving me crazy  
I will not drink with you today. msmith it's wonderful that you and your dad are getting better together.
I want to stop drinking I keep saying I'm going to. I my last drink was Sunday when I was day drinking. I was spinning in my head nauseated and pissed off at myself. But I still managed to cook dinner for myself and my partner (he had to help me because I was too sick feeling to deal with the smell food) ..I don't normally feel like I have a problem. I will drink a couple times a month but get totally obliterated to the point of throwing up. I'm not in my 20s anymore and it just isn't fun to be that trashed. It wasn't fun then but I'm still chasing the idea of drinking as "fun"...I see now that it's not the decision to "stop drinking". I dont have a problem with deciding that today. My problem is that each time I'm faced with the thought of drinking that I have to make that same decision each time and it just doesn't happen that way...IWNDWYT
Good morning from Boston. I am headed to 1 year sober. I've relapsed around 1 year before so I'm trying to stay active on this subreddit as another way to be engaged and stay sober. Everyone's been really nice thank you!
Trying to focus on the positive things going on right now:..* I managed to post in this sub for the first time in a few weeks..* I got the courage to see a therapist last week and again today..* I get to see the Tedeschi Trucks Band tomorrow :).* I have food in my fridge and a climate controlled apartment to live in. A luxury that some/most in the world don't have...IWNDWYT! 
I will not drink today no matter what.
I will not drink today. 
I'm here my head is clear I'm getting used to it. No booze in this body today! 
I'm in. Today is a tough one. I took a mental health day because I was feeling burned out and all I can think about is a glass of wine. I'm going to push through it though.
Day 1. IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT 
today i am grateful for community...i will not drink with you today. 
Will not drink with all you fine folks today
3 months today. IWNDWYT
I did not drink last night for night one of the Phish shows in San Francisco  and I will not drink tonight for night 2.. feels great to wake up after a show like that feeling good for a change .
Grateful for moments of peace these days...IWNDWYT    
Today makes on week.  IWNDWYT
Gonna crush a 12 pack today. Of chocolate milks. 
Not today!
I will not drink or use today. 
Last night was hard. I was at two weeks and feeling down. I felt like I hit a wall and that newfound energy that came after quitting was fading away. I *really* wanted to drink but I didn't. I won't today either...IWNDWYT
Hey everyone! I haven't had a drink for 24 days now. I feel amazing. I'm losing weight without trying too hard (all the alcohol calories + drunk eating is gone!). I'm sleeping better. I'm in a better mood overall. I'm less depressed.  Life isn't suddenly perfect and there are a lot of issues I need to deal with now that alcohol made me unable to see but now I at least CAN deal with them. IWNDWYT 
Not drinking today. Need to get back in my literature and back to everyday check in complacency is the enemy. IWNDWYT 
Resetting badge to today. I was pretty disappointed in myself and immediately told my partner that I had a drink. He immediately hugged me and said "it's just another opportunity for a new high score." I love and am grateful for him and for all of you. I'm not drinking with you today.
Checking in on my day 7. I'll be going to a 730pm AA meeting on the way to hang out with this girl's place. She's really cool and we're kinda "in like" with eachother. But we used to have a few glasses of wine together so I'm being sure to go to a meeting right before and go in with a plan not to drink.  ..Wish me luck!
Not gonna drink today. 
I will not drink today!
A bit late to the game but I won't be drinking today
I won't drink today 
I'm too young to be an alcoholic. I didn't think it was a problem until I got really drunk around my friends and acted awful towards them. I dumped all of my frustration and loneliness on to them and they don't deserve that. I'm 22...I don't want to leave my friends at 32. Today is the first day I will actively stay sober.  24 hours isn't such a long time is it? Stay strong everyone. .IWNDWYT
40 pages away from finishing "The naked Mind" ! Such a great book !!!   Opening my mind and curiosity to not only the benefits of no alcohol but questioning  what a life without other things may eventually be! ...IWNDWYT! 
Hey guys--IWNDWYT...Quick question!  How do I get a badge?  I'd like to start tracking my progress here.
I will not drink with you today   
Agitated AF pissed at my sponsor but not drinking today!!!
I will not drink with you today!
Two Week Club 
I spent the day in a Swedish coastal town where people where drinking on the decks of their boats by the harbour many of them visibly drunk by 1pm. The best of summer eh? I did not envy them one bit. ..I did not drink today and I look forward to a nice sober sleep with crispy clear dreams. Good night all you good people!
happily not drinking with you all today. 
Happy wet Wednesday from NY- Total downpours today YUCK! My body and feet are getting wet but at least I don't have wet brain anymore! Still so happy to be sober with a clear head once again. Cravings are still mulling about but I am fighting them off. Thank you to everyone for all the kind words and support. I will not drink with you today.:)
I have never actually tried this before but something's gotta give and I need to turn things around. IWNDWYT. Thanks for all the support.
IWNDWYT.
Haven't check in for a while but I'm still doing my thing of not drinking with you all today!
Iwndwyt
First check in post - I had my last drink ever around 19 hours ago. Thanks everyone for contributing and thank you in advance for the support. I hope to be able to pay it forward some day...I will not drink today for any reason.

A couple of smouldering hot days here. Last night there was even a sound-system out in the park rinsing out some lovely lovely drum and bass. My partner's away and I'm bored. Had all the triggers but kept it together. ..Not drinking with you all today.
Day 10. Double digits! I will not drink with you today.

Not drinking today
Happy to wake up sober today after turning down a work outing yesterday after work (by pretending headaches)..My coworkers feel like shit cause of course they got many drinks and came home past midnight...What did i do afterwork? Go to the gym walk in the park had quiet dinner with my wife catch up with her (wad on business trip for the past 2 days) did things I had to caught up with a tv show went to bed early got a good night rest woke up early had breakfast and coffee..Yep no regrets here :) IWNDWYT
Didn't drink today not drinking tonight
I will not drink today. .
Hey all. Day 1 for me. I'm a Demi fan and the news yesterday was a weird wake up call for me. I'm glad she is alive. If I keep drinking while drinking to work or doing shots in the office bathroom or anytime I just want to feel ok and happy then I will probably be in a serious rock bottom situation very very soon one that could kill someone (at least with the driving buzzed). I've got a lot to learn and have questions like can you have a problem but not be sure you fit the label of alcoholic? And things like that. But anyway I'm here and IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today
Not drinking. Day 2. Keeping it going.
I will not drink today. It's getting easier but I will stay vigilant. This time it's for real I can feel it. 
Day 3 today. Had a bad craving on the way home but fought through it. I can do this...IWNDWYT!!
Iwndwyt 
I've been so busy today I almost forgot to check-in. Thankful that I am not hungover today nor will be tomorrow. IWNDWYT!

I will not drink with you today 
Days almost over for me &amp; I did not drink today! Cheers everyone! 
11 days sober. Having hell of intrusive thoughts about my most recent ex. It feels like I'm going crazy sometimes but I also recognize that it's my issues that are the problem and to go easy on myself and do the work that needs to be done. Trying to get serene. No drinkin' today!
IWNDWYT...Peace and Sobriety All

Happy Thursday!  Looking forward to today and ready for the weekend!  IWNDWYT!
I'm not drinking with you all today. Wish everyone  a great day and to live and love life with a clear mind. I'm only day 2 but I will never be touching it again.
Just need to post here because after the monthly meeting I'm about to head to I always stop off and grab a few bottles of wine for afterwards. Not tonight though. IWNDWYTonight. 
I don't see a Thursday check in so I'll do it here. I feel like my stress levels have been maxed out for the last 3 months. It's not from quitting drinking but rather the consequences of my actions when I was drinking. I know this will pass eventually but it's exhausting feeling this way. I also know drinking would just make things worse. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink with you today
Looking forward to double digits. IWNDWYT!

Today is the first day of a vacation for me.  I'm pretty nervous.  Someone I love is counting on me to not drink and I don't want to let them (of myself) down.  I know this trip will be so much more fun and have only happy memories if I don't drink.  I don't want to wake up and piece together the events from the night before. I want to have only happy memories of this trip.  So I won't drink today and will concentrate on tomorrow when it come.
Today marks a week for me! I'm pretty sure that this is the longest I've gone since I started drinking. This time really feels like it's going to stick! I've been around my roommates while drinking and only had a slight craving which I was able to talk myself out of. I've gone multiple times to dollar General walked past the beer cooler and just bought food for once! I feel mentally and physically better than I ever remember. IWNDWYT!
Thank you for the input and help!
