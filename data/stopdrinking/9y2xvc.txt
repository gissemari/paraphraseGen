I just posted but something just occurred to me. Here's what I'm working through. ..When I drink the moment I realize other people can tell I'm tipsy/drunk/mildly intoxicated I feel this deep sense of shame. I slur my words really easily just takes one drink for people to start teasing me. When people poke jokes at me for how I am when I'm drunk yes.I'm adorable fun and the description is always what a cute drunk I am... I still feel deep shame.  ..Do other people who don't and/or.do struggle with alcohol feel these same feelings. Is this something I created after fearing I was an alcoholic. I wrestled for years with that fear something I now realized is something my mother imposed on me not something I chose for myself. He judgmental looks drove me crazy. When you have a hammer everything is a nail. ..I tend to have an over active guilt complex. Let's just say my parents never really needed to ground me as a child.  But I don't want these feeling anymore. ..To be clear my choices around alcohol are now more preventative. I bartend and I know what can happen in my line of work so I'm nipping it in the bud. I also just don't like the draw backs of alcohol. But more importantly I'm realizing the relationship I have with alcohol needs to change. Not really so that I can drink but just because alcohol is a thing not a person. Having a relationship with it is ridiculous. And I think working on this actually will make not drinking easier...ANYWAYS! Rambling...What about you guys I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. ..

For me it happened in phases. Drinking was fun and I was good at it. I'd hit that sweet spot where I'm firing off jokes and being attentive and having a great time... and then I'd leave. Enter phase 2: As my tolerance went up so too did my proclivity to stay out longer later... being the guy who was like "c'mon! one more!" and my mornings got worse. ...Phase three: Kept chasing the way I felt during phase 1. Would go out drinking thinking "hey it's still you admireablelow! grab a couple beers and you'll be charming them in no time!" Well this was a lie. By this point I was drinking a shot with every beer and my conversations would often (not always) slip into frivolous arguments that would leave me feeling guilt for 2-3 days after... even after I'd apologize. ...To me it sounds like your friends are just joshing you and don't mean anything serious by it. I couldn't imagine seeing a friend with a real problem and saying to them: "Well aren't you just the most adorable thing!" I can't answer your questions for you but if you feel that way it's a valid feeling. Therapy is always a wonderful option that's helped me tremendously. ...For me... not drinking -- and waking up refreshed with no regrets from the previous night --outweighed the shame and guilt I ended up feeling far too often in my Phase 3 days. I'm a firm believer in living this one life I have to the fullest and nowadays I don't have much time for drunk arguments forgotten conversations and awful hangovers. But every one of us is different and have different experiences. I think in the end it's about finding what works for you... a life preserver if you will... that'll keep you afloat when the storms roll through. ...Good luck! 
This is SO me. I am a lightweight plus I have some nerve damage from a sports career so one glass of wine has me over-focusing on finding my words and the second glass exacerbates my normal tendency to stumble a bit. Most of my drinking was done alone for that very reason: I didn't like talking or walking in front of others when I drank. ..To this day I feel crushing shame when I recall the last time my son saw me really drunk and that was four years ago. My badge shows my fourth (and most successful current) attempt this year at stopping but the previous attempts showed me quickly how much better life could be without that shame. There is nothing I've done while sober that causes that old feeling of self-loathing and it is liberating. 
When I was drinking I felt guilt and shame about all sorts of my different behaviours then I'd use so I didn't feel that guilt and shame. Then I'd feel guilty and ashamed of my using plus I'd feel anxious so I'd use again to stop those feelings but then I'd just feel guilty and ashamed again... And even more anxious. That cycle went on and got worse for years. ..It wasn't until I stopped drinking that my present became clearer I stopped having to worry about what I'd done or what was going to happen tomorrow... I only have to worry about today. I don't always make the best sober choices but I don't have to deal with the anxiety guilt and shame that gets added on top of any poor choices I do make. 
The blackout worries. Worrying what you did when you blacked out. For my also worrying if I did blackout. I would recount my whole night looking for holes. I was so scared I blackout that's something I do not miss in the slightest. ..Now I just forget things like a normal person of my age hahahahahahaha
Yeah the shame is why I'm stopping. I always feel like if I drink too much in front of someone they are judging and will talk about how much I drink behind my back.  I don't do too many embarrassing drunk things (that I can remember) other than posting on social sites cringy comments but I just get nervous people notice the sheer volume of how much I drink. I don't want people to know me as a drunk. I want people to know me as someone who has goals and self control.

For me after a few months off the sauce any guilt and shame vanished --along with my anxiety and depression.
