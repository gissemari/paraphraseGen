Woke up today after having a dream I relapsed. Last time I relapsed was at 90some days so this 100 was a big deal. Anyway I felt terrible when I woke up and all day hav2ent been able to shake the feeling I did something wrong. Stupid brain please stop this hahaha

My wife will have dreams where dream-me does something shitty and when she wakes up she's pissed off at actual me. Don't be like my wife dreams are just dreams. You're doing great!
Last night was my first alcohol-scare dream.   I dreamed I had missed a wedding because I was instead sneaking a six pack of beer.  ..During the dream I was disappointed that I didnt enjoy drinking and I felt glum that I had actually slipped.  Then a voice in my head said "dont worry-its no big deal."..I woke up shortly afterwards.  No harm.  No foul.  ..That voice was the voice of my addictive behavior.  It's still prowling around in my subconscious mind.  I expect it will still be there for a long while...If you havent dread the "drink dreams" post in the FAQ section it's worth a look.   ..IWNDWYT!
