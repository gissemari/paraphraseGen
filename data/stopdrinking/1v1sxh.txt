I'm really having trouble getting started for some reason.  I logged 6 months last year and another month and half shortly after that relapse but this time I can't seem to get by days 1-3.  I'm considering trying to go to a detox unit just to help get started. I did it at the start of my 6 months and I think the comfort of safely detoxing was helpful.  Not sure what else I'm going to do but I need to do something.  The depression and anxiety is just too brutal for this to continue.
