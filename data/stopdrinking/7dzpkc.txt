5 weeks is the point I cracked last time in early October then again a week later. It was demoralising but meant I felt I had to make good on my promise that I'd go to my doctor and say I couldn't do it on my own. Now five weeks later I'm doing well and feel positive still. No drinking at all no horrible cravings (it's not been *easy* but not awful like it was before). I put this down to the support from actually telling some people I trust that I'm struggling but trying to get better the promise of help to come from an NHS referral for counselling and anti-depressants that I clearly needed for depression and anxiety. ..So I suppose my advice to anyone struggling to decide if they can do this is yes you can but don't be afraid to ask for help as it can make all the difference. ..I will not drink with you all today.

Hey Pippin! I'm SO happy to see this post! Congrats on 35 Days! So glad that you have sought counseling and antidepressants - for me that was a big help. I raise my coffee to you! &lt;3
This could have been my post! Going to see my doctor and being completely honest - then going back for a check in and antidepressants was a huge step for me.  Such a relief to be here after several badge resets at the start. ..Huge well done!
Congratulations!! Being honest with my doctor was a huge step for me. It makes such a difference!
