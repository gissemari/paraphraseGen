I woke up from a dead sleep after the dream so I'll try to make this coherent. This also explains the rambling...Come Wednesday I'll be on a vacation that ends with Boston in St. Patricks Day. My mom was diagnosed with cancer in June and while she is in remission it's a bucket list item to watch an Irish punk band Dropkick Murphys in Boston for such day. I relapsed once on March 17th so already the day is stressful. On top of that a dear friend has asked if my alcoholism may be due to the circumstance I was in at the time of quitting and since that circumstance isn't happening anymore... He did say that he wasn't trying to make me feel like I should drink again he openly admitted to not understanding my situation. I did try explaining it but it went over his head apparently...The dream was any other drinking dream so I won't get into it in detail. I guess what I'm looking for is words of encouragement from like minded people. I've gone on vacation since quitting I've been in bars and around alcohol as well and it hasn't been an issue. I don't use AA because it wasn't a good fit for me I like the complete anonymity of the internet. Has anyone gone to this event or maybe Mardi Gras in New Orleans Time Square on New Years and have a success story? I've never been to Boston let alone during St. Pattys Day does someone from the area have an idea of what to expect? ..Thank you!

&gt;I've never been to Boston let alone during St. Pattys Day does someone from the area have an idea of what to expect?..C'mon now. I think you know exactly what to expect. St. Pattys day is the same in any big city: lots and lots of drunk people and oceans of booze. It being Boston doesn't really mean anything. Denver is going to be the same way. So is New York and LA and Chicago. ..I don't mean to be snarky but it bothers me when people feel the need to explain that the city they live in offers temptation to drink. So many posts mention something like "...and I live in *(insert major metropolitan area)* so drinking is a big part of the culture."..Anywhere in America where there are thousands of people and access to booze drinking is going to be a big thing. ..Ugh. Sorry. ..By the way Dropkick Murphys does a great live show. I'm envious.
