I guess I always sort of knew this but I slipped up last night and drank. I usually struggle with depression and it's always been worse the next day after a night of drinking. Like I can't find meaningful reasons to live worse. I'm not suicidal or anything like that but I just find I have strong feelings of meaninglessness and uselessness after I drink. Why do I always forget that I have those feelings before I take a sip? In any case I'm not drinking today so there's that.

I so can relate to you.  That inner voice the next morning... I won't wish it on my worst enemy!  So you slipped up... onward and upwards.  I too suffer from depression and am on medicine for it and it has made all the difference.  Well kinda of :)..IWNDWYT
I had depression my whole life and a sense of extreme meaninglessness. Something that really helped me was watch "Maps of Meaning" on YouTube by Jordan Peterson. Maybe it could help you too :)
