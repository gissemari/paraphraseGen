*An alcoholic is someone with problems who self-medicates*..*An alcoholic in recovery is just someone with problems*..I celebrate six months sober today. To start here's what got me here:../r/stopdrinking - I lurked here for a long time before posting. I kept telling myself I didn't have a  problem. When I finally acknowledged I did I posted and this sub has been incredibly helpful in sobriety. Reading about others' triumphs and tragedies strengths and struggles has been a tremendous boon in overcoming my own...AA - I'm not religious and I did casual research showing that responses to AA were mixed. I decided to try it because I was willing to give almost anything a chance. Sobriety was that important. I went and attended weekly meetings reliably for a couple of months. While I haven't gone recently I will start going again as the holidays approach. I didn't have a sponsor and I didn't do the steps. I might if I need to but for now AA is an inexpensive way for me to sit in a room full of people with the same goal. Their stories are always from the heart and often insightful...Therapy - I found a therapist that I work well with and I've seen him nearly every week for the last six months. This was crucial. I knew I drank for a reason and I knew I was going to need help in bringing that reason (or reasons) to light. He has been very helpful and I have come to see my life differently both past and present. There's still work to do but it has been worthwhile...The big fallout from drinking was my marriage of thirteen years.  My wife and I separated six months ago (well a week and six months ago) due to my drinking and we'll probably get divorced. She gave me an ultimatum last year to quit and I reasoned with her to let me just drink on weekends. To her that was me choosing alcohol over her and she wasn't wrong. I did and it drove her away. We still care for each other but there's no romance and there's no intimacy. She moved a few states away a couple of months ago. We'll still be friends at least for now but we'll have to see what happens. So I'm alone. I don't mind being alone but it's hard when you have no one to celebrate achievements or commiserate over failures with. Life itself starts to seem kind of pointless...So how am I actually doing? Honestly I'm not sure. I often feel sad but years of numbing myself has left it hard for me to really feel comfortable with my emotions. It's getting better but I feel like I lost a part of me with the booze and I'm struggling to find it again. All of that said I'm not going to back to drinking. As hard as it is now it will just be harder with alcohol. I'm keeping my eyes forward and working to determine what my future will be. There is no going back.
