Last Wednesday I checked myself into the hospital because I was afraid that I was going to hurt myself. I walked to two liquor stores and I was crying and calling my girlfriend and she told me she didn't know how much more she could take of this. I ended up going and after a 5 hour wait in the middle of the night was told the psychiatrist wasn't working for another 4 hours. So I left. I went back later in the morning and while waiting in intake heard a woman who was clearly out of it screaming that the doctors were raping her. I heard the nurses complaining about the people in intake. I thought that I didn't want to be in a psych ward where there were more psychotic people than me being taken care of by people that didn't care. Maybe that was unfair but it was what I thought so I left intake. I walked around the mall looking for a liquor store and I was tired and sad. I thought about coming here but I thought in my mind that I had already given up. I managed to book an appointment with a psychologist tomorrow and hope to make it a regular thing. So that's where I'm at. Everyday has been a struggle like early days but I just didn't. I know it won't help me.
