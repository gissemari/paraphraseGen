Its hard to believe I've gone this long without any problems with cravings or relapse. But I have! I've gone to places where I used to always have a few drinks have had a few spats which previously would have had me heading for the store some other triggers and I haven't even come close to having a drink. Many thanks to my wife and kids Serenity House AA you guys and a weekly Life Group. Next stop a year.
