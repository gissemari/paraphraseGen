So I wrote about a work function earlier. Said I wasn't going then almost talked myself into going again... been going back and forth about it for the last three hours...Decided on crossing the border for Chinese food instead and getting some frozen yogurt. Seems to have calmed me down. Not sure why I struggled so much today but I'm in for the night now and I'm thankful I didn't go. Still feel a little guilty but I'll just need to get over it...Asshole-brain at its finest... I found it asking me if I really expect to be sober for the rest of my life. Might as well go have a few it said. No way you won't give in eventually anyway... ..I kind of feel if my partner wanted to go that I probably would have. Fortunately he didn't want to.

"Asshole-brain at its finest... I found it asking me if I really expect  to be sober for the rest of my life. Might as well go have a few it  said. No way you won't give in eventually anyway..." &lt;-- Oh man this one is like my brain's favourite trick. And it works on me often in all sorts of contexts. My best defense so far has been to say "Well you might be right but at least I can be free of \_\_\_\_ (bad things) for \_\_\_\_\_ days/hours/minutes and if I listened to you then I'd never be free of anything bad!".
Why will you give in eventually?  You just might surprise yourself taking things day by day one day at a time is relaxing for just this purpose.  We don't have to worry about tomorrow or eventually we do what we're doing today.  And you did great!  I'm happy for you   iwndwyt
