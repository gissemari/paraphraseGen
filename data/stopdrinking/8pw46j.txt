I don't know if this is going to turn into a rant (probably) but I've just been having such a hard time lately and need to get it out. ..My husband is out of town for work this month so I'm at home with our two-year-old and our animals. I was doing really well had like 21 days without a bender and then Thursday happened and I gave in to temptation...I struggle with depression and anxiety (like I know a lot of us do) and I've felt myself slipping back into a hole despite taking my meds daily getting fresh air and keeping busy with little home improvement projects. All of my family and best friends are on the opposite side of the country and my friends out here were coworkers/drinking buddies so I'm not exactly going out of my way to make social plans right now.  ..Anyway my younger brother (who also has a drinking problem) confided in me a couple of months ago that he had gotten into some trouble with work due to him and a friend getting wasted doing coke and getting into a fist fight with another coworker at a work event. This was the first time I'd heard about him messing with hard drugs but turns out he was also making a habit of going out to breweries/bars getting drunk and then doing a line or two to as he put it  SOBER UP so he could drive home.  What?! Total shock to me but I decided I would keep his secret under the assumption (and reassurance by him) that his incident at work would have been enough for him to stay away from drugs and focus on cutting down his alcohol consumption. I tried to reason with him share stories about my own experiences and friends experiences and he seemed to be listening but when I talked to him on Thursday he lied to me about an upcoming trip he's taking to visit a friend who did/does coke. ..Now where I messed up: I decided to pour myself a drink as I contemplated telling our parents so that they could at least be aware and watch out for any signs of him getting in too deep. He doesn't live with them but lives close by and they see each other often. I just knew that if anything happened to him and I hadn't let anyone know what he was dealing with I'd never forgive myself. My brother has always been the golden child and I've always been considered  distant  and  bitchy  because I bore the brunt of my parents drunken rages growing up and yeah that'll tend to drive someone to withdraw. But with all of that I've never resented my brother for any of it until now. I poured another drink. I got more resentful thinking about how arrogant and flat out mean he can be and that he somehow still comes out smelling like a rose. I guess it's also important to note that he talks all the time about how much he hates my parents hates everyone and he certainly acts like he hates me if I say anything he doesn't want to hear but he's so good at turning on the charm when he wants to. It makes me angry because I've always been treated differently by our parents despite the fact that I grew out of my  shitty teenager  phase close to 8 years ago now and have been working really hard to repair things on my end. Doesn't matter apparently. ..I called my brother after a couple of drinks (bad idea admittedly) and asked why he lied to me and if he had plans to do drugs on his visit. He was instantly angry and defensive and we hurled about a million insults at each other until we finally just got pissed enough to hang up. ..I woke up with an atrocious hangover and felt so defeated hurt and disappointed in myself for failing again. I also felt the need to make peace with the fact that my brother and I probably aren't going to have a relationship for a while. ..Today I decided to call my parents to let them know what had happened and my concerns about my brother's decisions. My parents weren't necessarily  upset  with me but I definitely felt like the bad guy since my mom immediately jumped to his defense and pointed out how I need to get a handle on my drinking (Um hello I've been working very hard at it). Conversation didn't end on the best note but not the worst and now my conscience is clear. ..It's just been a very tough couple of days but I didn't drink my hangover away yesterday and I won't drink tonight even though I really want to. Just desperately hoping to fend off the triggers and feel better soon. If you made it this far I appreciate you.

::Virtual hugs:: We don't get to choose our family unfortunately. You did what you needed to do and said your peace. Now work and focus on you. There's nothing in the bottle that's going to take this situation away.. even if you forget about for a while it will be right there the next morning.. and you will feel awful... and you will have a 2 year old who by my guess will still want you and pancakes at 7am. ..Head up to the nearest pharmacy and grab a mask or something.. ice cream.. whatever will make you feel good and after you put the LO to bed treat yourself. IWNDWYT  
Hang in there you and your plans are worth it.  You quit for reasons right?  Keep going it does get better than you can even imagine.  I won't drink with you
