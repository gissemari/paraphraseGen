Yesterday I came the closest so far in sixty whatever days to drinking again. ..I switched depression meds three weeks ago and they have been playing havoc with my emotions. Up in the morning down in the evening. Dr told me to double the dose and it basically made me manic in the morning and a total mess in the evening. ..Last night I was ready to have a beer. I know where I am with beer. I didn't though. I white knuckled through the evening and saw my doc first thing this morning. ..Meds have been changed again. Let's see how this works out. ..Not wanting to reset was a big determining factor in not relapsing last night. Thanks stopdrinking :)

Congratulations for sticking it out.      .Quitting alone is really hard. Do you have people to call?..My path included AA.  There are other groups Smart outpatient etc..I was so alone in my drinking.  My isolation wanted to keep me drinking..Results may vary.    
That's a nice looking number you've got there fer sure!
I'm not on any sort of medication but around 60 days was *incredibly* hard for me as well. Really volatile emotions like you describe. It was exhausting and a little scary too. ..Not sure what to say other than that I know what you're going through and I know how hard it is. Great job on getting through the evening. Don't give up. You can do this.
