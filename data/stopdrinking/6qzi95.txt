22 years old moved across the country to start graduate school a week ago. While I'm making friends in my program I spend a lot of time alone/in my 1 bedroom apartment. I'm scared I'll get lonely or stressed and want to drink...Luckily it's an intense program so I'll be doing lots of homework/also applying for med school right now. But I'm thinking about actually committing to AA right now which is new. Also starting with a new therapist so I should be busy. I guess it's more just weekends that scare me. ..Today is another day two sadly.. I was in detox literally three weeks ago but just came off of an 8 day bender. After experiencing some scary withdrawal symptoms I'm finally feeling physically and emotionally better. If only I could stop sweating so badly lol!..I'm surprised how committed I actually feel right now despite not telling my family about my relapse (shame) so it's great to have this page. Sorry for the rambling. Still in a weird place/brain is foggy. Thanks for letting me vent SD <3

Great job on getting onto a graduate program. If you can try to get work done in the library or in your departmental study area. Spending a lot time alone in the accomodation is never good. Studying with friends is a good idea as well...Try to keep busy. If you get cravings go for a walk and try to think about what your therapist has been going over with you.
I'd def find some meetings to hit up. Getting a commitment at a meeting is a great way to meet people. They have young people meetings conferences fellowship. You can find people your age (if that's what you want) to connect with that can help show you how to be young and sober and have fun. 
You will du just fine. Just hang in there friends will pop up the next couple of months.
