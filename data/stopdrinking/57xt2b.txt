Well I almost made it two weeks.  Saturday and sunday I ended up having a beer and some wiskey it wasnt nearly as enjoyable as I imagined it would be.  Tonight I'm moving my husband's booze to the garage out of sight out of mind.  ..  Sometimes I feel like a hamster on a wheel.  I want to quit I make it to two weeks and I relapse.  It makes me wonder if I really want sobriety?  I think I do but wouldn't it be easier for me to say 'no' to my mind if I were truly dedicated to this?   Gah just feeling so down on myself today.  I'm taking responsibility for my actions.  My Badge is reset and for today I will not drink.

I had to get the alcohol out of my house all together. Actually my husband took it upon himself to clear out the bar after I relapsed. My house might not be dry forever but for now it's what I need. ..I will not drink with you today. 
I also had to clear the house of it. I thought that if I gave in to a craving driving to get it would give me more time to come to my senses. Not drinking with you today :)
I realized about 3 years ago that I had a problem and it needed to change but what would always happen was that I would convince myself around two weeks in that I didn't have a problem and that I didn't need to stop.  3 years of low after low and rock bottom after rock bottom and now I am 40 something days deep and still determined.  Took me a long time to be really truly ready.  Sometimes it just takes some time for things to click!
