Just coming back from drinking three days in a row. Last night I had two beers out of the 12 pack I bought. Well one and a half and I tossed the rest. I had fully intended on having some and saving the rest to continue my relapse. While I was sober. I had a beer and a half and I had the wherewithal to toss the rest. I am surprised by myself. I feel like I am confident more than I have been in awhile of my ability to have some control. Not in drinking but around the ability to say no. I think I am starting to really want sobriety more than when I started this journey towards sobriety two years ago. I have fallen so many times. Countless. Millions. I tell you people. If you fall its fine. I know some people can put it down and never relapse. Or only relapse once. I am not that person. But I feel like something has finally clicked in my head about how I want to live the rest of my life. Anyway that's my share. I need to find the badge reset link. I am strictly mobile. And for once I really feel like I have the power to make it and not fall agian.

Sometimes all it takes is that one paradigm shift! :) I tried to stop or moderate lots of times on my own but this time has felt different. I'm not gonna question it I'm just gonna run with it! I'll not drink with you today! 
It really was a shift last night. In my mins I was like what the hell my inebriated mind no less. I said to myself I can feel Im stupid when I drink. I didnt get my car cleaned and making cookies didn't happen either. I did throw away ten beers and had that realization. I knew it but I know it deep in my soul now not just cerebrally.
