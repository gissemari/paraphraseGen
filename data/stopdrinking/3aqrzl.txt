I always tell people that I'm just taking a year off. It just seems more casual and it takes the spotlight off me a bit. In truth I don't see myself going back. This is my only go at sobriety and I've read a lot. Some of which details how horrifyingly bad a relapse can be and how sobering up again can be that much harder. So no thanks. In 100 days I plan on just telling people the truth it's not worth my time...Some updates/notes on things that I've noticed lately...-People like to take credit for my sobriety. Warranted or not...-Others admit they should sober up while insisting on some undetermined time in the future while not actually doing anything...-I don't over sleep anymore. Alarm clocks are worthless...-Chocolate remains a problem. I avoid it because I know I can't stop eating...-I'm thirsty most of the time now. Maybe it's from pounding club sodas all the time when I'm out...-Smoking is an issue but I'm certain I can tackle that when I decide to...-Anxieties are still there but I'm still mowing through it. Progress seems to have slowed a bit but I remind myself how far I've come. So it makes sense to me that the next few levels I mow through will be tougher. I'll get through it though...I haven't really wondered what I'd do after a year. Now I'm beginning to. I wonder how much more progress I'll have made. I wonder what I'll be thinking and what type of mentality I'll have. I guess I could just look back to the past year and compare my current self to that shit show. Good enough for me. Enough reason to keep it going.

&gt;-People like to take credit for my sobriety...Literally? People saying they're responsible for you not drinking? Pshaw! Fools. Only you are...&gt;-Others admit they should sober up while insisting on some undetermined time in the future while not actually doing anything...Did that off and on for nigh on 25 years...&gt;-Chocolate remains a problem...I don't know what the fuck you're talking about here. What language is that?..&gt;-I'm thirsty most of the time now. Maybe it's from pounding club sodas..Club soda contains salt or at least some of it does. I guess you knew that...&gt;the next few levels I mow through will be tougher. ..We get stronger though. It's pretty amazing...Great check-in. Thanks!.
