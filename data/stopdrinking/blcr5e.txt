I just wanted to let people know if you're just starting out or if you've been through a bad weekend just keep working at it one day one hour one minute at a time. It does get better. ..I'd never kissed a girl sober prior to quitting. Now I get to marry the love of my life in a month. I'd relapsed before the most recent attempt at quitting. This time stuck thanks to a great support system in this community (seriously I was here multiple times a day for year 1 of sobriety). And working the steps other things just started to make sense too. I'd always thought about writing a book and now I'm in the process of writing my third published one!..The steps work if you work them and I'm so proud of everyone here trying to better themselves. Especially you lurkers! This shit is scary and you take as much time as you need to lurk :)..IWNDWYT
