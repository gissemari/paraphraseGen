They gave me a phone number list while I was there. I'm having trouble building up the nerve to call? I feel embarrassed and ashamed even though I knew none of these people and they probably weren't really judging. Plus I don't know any of these people so I'm nervous to talk about the relapse with them.

You know people understand. You are struggling. You are not the first person to do that. 
'The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.'..I think of it this way.  Being embarrassed never stopped me from getting drunk again why should it stop me from helping myself...Good luck.
