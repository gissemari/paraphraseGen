600 days...trust me if I can do it so can YOU...I have noticed a lot of posts here recently of folks in early recovery who have moved through the "pink cloud" stage. In this new stage of recovery the novelty and excitement of quitting drinking has worn off and facing the reality of an alcohol-free future seems daunting at best. At the same time our brains are struggling to thrive without the easy access to dopamine that alcohol provided. Life can seem flat dull and void of enjoyment. The good news is that our brains are remarkable organs that have the ability to bounce back. Every day that passes in which we don't drink we are slowly replenishing those precious neurotransmitters that make us feel good. This process requires time and patience. Considering that I drank for *20 years* having to wait 20 months to feel a little better each day is a small price to pay. I CAN honestly say that after 600 days I have 100% acclimated to a life without alcohol. It feels natural not to drink poison every day believe it or not!   .    .Quitting drinking isn't the panacea to life. Did quitting drinking solve all of my problems? No...but it sure as shit made them more manageable. Am I a happy-go-lucky guy all of the time? No...I still have my good days and bad days just like every other human on the planet. Sobriety does take work. Therapy exercise this sub and daily meditation have been a crucial part of my journey.    .    .**Meditation: Cheat Code to Life**    ..I know I tout this a lot here and I know it's not for everyone but daily meditation has had a profound effect on my mood and anxiety levels. It has also allowed me to live mindfully in the present and make "one day at a time" that much easier. Having started only 6 months ago I really wish I started sooner...meditation would have been so incredibly helpful during the emotional rollercoaster of early recovery. [Here is a link on 76 scientific benefits of mediation](https://liveanddare.com/benefits-of-meditation/). There is real science behind it! Want to try it? [Here's a great introduction to it by Thich Nhat Hanh](https://www.lionsroar.com/mindful-living-thich-nhat-hanh-on-the-practice-of-mindfulness-march-2010/). 20 minutes a day is now a crucial part of my daily routine and is just as important to me as exercise. A lot of people say "I can't do it because my mind won't settle." Your mind isn't supposed to! "Monkey mind" is a perfectly normal part of the human experience. As long as you are able to direct your attention back to your breath you are doing it right...Anyway thanks for reading my rant. As always I am proud to be a part of this amazing community and could not have done it without all of you to lean on. This sub is truly something special and I am grateful for it.    .I will not drink with you today..    .    ..    ..

Great post Papi_Queso. Congratulations and nice work on the 600 days. And I'm with you w/re: meditation. It is very helpful in ways I didn't expect. Iwndwyt. 
Yes thank you for posting.  I have been toying with the idea of trying mindfulness meditation.  I am saving your post so I can reference the links you added.
Thats really interesting about meditation I'm going to try it for a month or so as part of my self care routine!
Wow what an inspiration you are Papi_Queso! I've only begun to feel like sobriety is the new normal for me but I'm looking forward to continuing on the journey.  Thank you for sharing your story and all the support you provide to others here at Stop Drinking.  Best wishes! IWNDWYT 
Thank you for the encouragement to try meditation! I've been thinking about it and will give it a go.
Incredible post and I agree 100%.  I was in therapy for about a year and meditate 15 minutes a day using Apps (mostly the Headspace App)...Quitting drinking solves a lot of problems but it also REVEALS a lot of problems that used to be solved with alcohol.  I had a lot of anxieties and self esteem issues that emerged when I quit drinking.  These were issues I hadn't faced in decades and they laid dormant until I quit drinking.  In a lot of ways I was still a 15 year old emotionally...A therapist helped me work through those issues and discover root causes from childhood that I had never thought long and hard enough to consider.  Every week I got a little better.  Meditation then helped me to limit all of the incessant negative self talk and judgments that my monkey brain was running around with unchecked...I'm still a work in progress but at least I feel like I am making progress.  I am so grateful for this sub as well.  It really got me through a few rough patches and let me know that I am not alone in this quest and that there is a whole world of people going through what I'm going through.
I developed a mediation routine early in my sobriety and kept it up for about 5 month it really helped me transition out of the pink cloud stage. It fell by the wayside after a bunch of changes in my life but it remains a practice I want to incorporate into my life permanently. Meditation is wonderful...A buddy of mine has always seemed like the most laid back cool guy and I just found out the other week that he has been practicing mediation for years. When I asked what caused him to pick up meditation he told me that a psychology teacher told him that there are four things people can do to increase their baseline happiness they are: meditation exercise vitamin D (get some sun or take a supplement) and fish oil. 
Congrats Papi    IWNDWYT 
Congrats! Always appreciate your posts. ..IWNDWYT
One of the "neat" benefits of meditation is that it is one of the things that has been shown to build brain volume something alcohol reduces.
Thank you for such a great post and congratulations on 600 days!! Wow!.I've not tried meditation yet. I try to fit yoga in most mornings before work (on my own following YouTube ha ha).Very interested in giving the meditation a go.... when I've stopped making myself so busy to keep myself occupied ha ha!..IWNDWYT
You're a complete inspiration Papi - and what a glorious milestone too! I have a few little moments of meditation time carved into my day that are part of my routine. I don't do the whole sit in lotus position and do nothing - often I am holding a nice cup of tea while I do it! But it works for me. And it does seem to reset the equanimity meter rather well too..
Keep up the good work!
Hi Papi and congratulations! It's been an honor to be in the sober trenches with you...I've also found meditation helpful along with gratitude. The Thursday posts here at SD reminding me to be grateful have been so helpful. There have been many days where I grumble sarcastically "Grr yeah whee I'm grateful to be sober." But then I think about how much better I'm doing than I was when I was drinking and I realize that I'm profoundly grateful. 
This was helpful for me. Thanks!
Congrats on 600!
Congrats queso that's so cool dude. I see your posts all over the place and they help so much. ..You said you weren't in aa right? Did you try it? I'm asking because i don't really identify with people there and i think the meetings might actually be bad for me..Thank you
Thank you for your post I agree that Mediation is crucial in maintaining a balanced life and will be something I am going to incorporate again. As you say it can only be 10-20 minutes a day but helps find the balance. ..Congrats on 600 and thanks for your advice much appreciated. 
CONGRATULATIONS ON 600 PAPI!!  I really value your contributions here.  And I completely agree about meditation.  I've fallen off that wagon and your post is encouraging me to get back on.  The benefits of sitting still and watching my thoughts really are amazing.
Congrats Papi and thank you for the insight!
This is interesting. I thought I'd feel this way at this point but I guess I gotta wait a little while longer.
I wasn't going to mediate this morning because of reasons. Your post reminded me to get up off my ass and work for the benefits I seek. Thanks. 
Well done Papi!
Up vote for meditation mention. I started a daily practice of passage meditation around two years ago in between my sophomore and junior year of college and man my life has gotten so much better in every single aspect of it. Proud of you for making 600 days my fellow human being. You are an inspiration
I'm so happy for you Papi!  You're really living it!  I will meditate today in honor of your achievement. :)
I used to meditate daily but have lost the habit. Reading this post is going to make me try it again today and enjoy its benefits. ..Thanks for the reminder and congrats on 600!
As addicts we are used to being in a constant state of peaks and valleys. I see so many posts raving about how much someone enjoys their new sober life. And dont get me wrong i couldn't be happier for those who feel that way. Unfortunately when youre constantly seeing people post when they're at their absolute best we develop an unrealistic expectation of sobriety that can leave us feeling like we're destined for failure. "All these people talking about how recovery has allowed them to cherish everything in their life why do I still feel like shit?" Is something I've found myself asking. However recovery is as much about becoming a new and better person as it is becoming content with day to day life. One of the largest changes to get used to is feeling comfortable with the mundane and accepting all of the small obstacles and fluctuations that occur constantly. Sobriety is a beautiful thing but i encourage everyone on this sub to do their best to not compare themselves to others on the same path because what you see is often just a fraction of the many sides that come with recovery. 
I feel horrible... My head hurts and I feel like I'm going to puke.
639 today myself. .Right on guys. It really does get so much better. 
Here's where the meditation bit seems to lose me:..&gt; The in-breath can be a celebration of the fact that you are alive so it can be very joyful..I have to imagine there are a lot of people who lurk in this sub for whom this does not apply as existence is nothing worth celebrating; it's a burden that must be endured. 
And desire is overcome by walking the Eightfold Path.  You have a powerful post thank you.
I'm only on day four. It's been easier than I thought it would be. I drank everyday for years and was still functional. ..I think what's making it easier than I thought it would be is that my two best friends don't drink at all. They've never drank a drop of liquor in their lives. Also I started to despise the habit before I quit. I was actually bored with drinking. Another thing that I think is helping me is that I live in Washington DC where weed is legal and I know people with PhD's in botany and shit that grow incredibly powerful bud. I only smoke at night and it's way less than a joint. As a matter of fact I can only take one or two hits of this stuff before I have to put it out. ..Has anyone else used cannabis to help them quit drinking? I haven't even told my BF's that I quit drinking. I'm going to wait until they ask me how I lost so much weight. lol..OH YEAH!!!! The other thing that's helping me BIG TIME is this AWESOME group!!!!..I AM NOT DRINKING WITH YOU TODAY!!!!! Thanks everyone!!!
You got me by a few days. Congratz.
&gt;Quitting drinking isn't the panacea to life. Did quitting drinking solve all of my problems? No...but it sure as shit made them more manageable. Am I a happy-go-lucky guy all of the time? No...I still have my good days and bad days just like every other human on the planet. Sobriety does take work...Such a tough thing to come to terms with if you're not prepared for it...I may not be such a drunk jackass anymore but all I really did at first was get rid of the drunk part. The jackass part still needs tending to. I guess.
Congrats and keep it up! I too enjoy meditation. It was as awkward as a first date the first few times I tried it but it too certainly got better. 
Ay Papi! Nice post very well said. I love seeing you around the sub and you are a shining example of the SD magic at work! Thank you for your service to all of us here on SD.
Hey Papi thanks so much for your post.  As always a great read.  160+ days in now and I wanted to say thank you to you for your early words of encouragement back at the start.  I shan't drink with you today my man.  
Well done on 600 days! ..I'm happy to hear that meditation has helped you as well. It's been invaluable to me! 
downloading Alcohol Explained now..I got so much progress with meditation since I stopped drinking! I'm on headspace and it's currently my favorite app ever :)
I had neurotransmitter issues in the first place. I'm pretty much expecting to be miserable forever at this point. Therapy isn't doing shit medication isn't doing shit being sober isn't doing shit. I don't know why I even care about staying sober at this point. I fucking hate living.
Aye Papi!!! You are kicking ass my dear friend! I will soon be one year old again. I restarted my very old TM practice in 2013. I'm hanging in there with it. Was just just happy I could still remember my assigned Mantra then! I have always thought that the TM Masters only have *one* Mantra but they tell you to never tell anyone your Mantra or you will die a thousand deaths or worse... so no one ever tells. Mine? Goes to the grave with me! Love ya babe! You mean a lot to me!
Love this post and can vouch for Insight Timer. They just started doing courses you can buy and I strongly recommend Jennifer Piercy's Sleep course if anyone is struggling with   in sobriety! 
Thanks Papi a great read and I definately itentify with those dull flat and not finding enjoyment in much of anything. I am working through that stuff each day. As many have said including myself I don't think I could calm my mind enough to do it but after reading your outline of it it seems worthy of a try I have nothing to loose and looks like it might be a wonderful gain. ..Congrats on the 600 and your journey to get where you are. Have a great weekend.. Peace
Meditation can truly be life-changing. Thanks for posting this great primer! 
Thanks for sharing! I've thought about meditation in the past and that article about the scientific benefits was really eye opening. I'm going to dl the app and give it a go today! 
Great post!  Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I'm sure this will be very useful for some. All the best.
I'm early in sobriety(again). Meditation has helped with my insomnia. I can't sit still. Before bed I choose a guided meditation from youtube and end up sleeping. Thanks for the great post.
Thanks for sharing this post. This is really timely for me. I think I'm still in the pink cloud phase actually. But I have been reading a lot about Buddhism lately and intend to start practicing meditation soon. Your post has inspired me to start sooner rather than later. IWNDWYT
At my AA meeting today we talked a lot about meditation and the people that practiced daily were raving about it. To my surprise it was a bunch of men in their 50s and 60s who I wouldn't necessarily peg as people that would be open to meditation. They even admitted themselves they couldn't believe they liked it. Anyway you all have talked me into working it into my routine.
**really** helpful inspiring post thank you...I have done numerous courses on mindfulness and STILL struggle with keeping up a daily practice.  Will download Insight Timer app!..totally agree that this sub is very special - it includes posts like this one :-)
Love this - have saved it. Meditation I think is a requirement for sobriety. It's part and parcel of the 12 steps. Thank you.  
Thank you for your suggestions. You are an inspiration to me!
Thanks for this. If anybody needs a pdf of This Naked Mind here is a link:..http://docdro.id/3wVw87h.
