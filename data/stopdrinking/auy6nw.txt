So I've started going to meetings after realising that I need some form of support group to keep me sober long term. I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict...Things were going good got a sponsor and I'm getting into the routine of sharing and meeting others that are getting sober...I'm not going to go into the precise details but let's just say things were quickly going down the wrong path and I stopped it from happening but only just...I didn't think this would affect me in the way it has. Without sounding too sure of myself I'm good looking but definitely suffer from low self esteem depression anxiety the lot. My pain and the reasons why I used stems from a deep psychological trauma from my past and is in no way connected to the way I look. ..How do I move on from this? This definitely would've relapsed me so fast it would've broke the sound barrier even now I have a really uncomfortable feeling in my stomach and I'm thinking of forgetting about the whole meeting routine until my state of mind is better? I can avoid this woman by going to different meetings but I'm already feeling like the others might involve the same bullshit. ..Perhaps most surprisingly I'm a guy. You'd think I'd be flattered to be desired and manipulated into sober sex with an old timer like this. But it's done the opposite of boosting my ego I genuinely feel sick. Despite my decent alcohol day count I've only just got off cocaine and cannabis. I'm not going to go back to that shit but at the moment I do feel like doing that. ..Any tips/advise on how to move through this would be greatly appreciated.
