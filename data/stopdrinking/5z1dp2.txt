I know that I can't moderate. I've tried it and it doesn't work for me. Absolute abstinence from alcohol is the only way ahead. I know this. Despite this tried and tested truth the allure of a couple of casual cocktails on a Sunday afternoon sounds delightful. In my mind are many memories of the aftermath of that mode of thinking. I won't do it and  I will ignore the temptation. I know others are struggling with the same thing and it helps to feel that I'm not alone.
