  As stated in the title. ..I am now firm in the belief that alcohol is not only harmful to narcotic recovery but greatly increases chance of relapse. ..So today is day one. ..Yes I will lose friends and relationships with certain family members but for the first time I am okay with that. The value of my recovery as a whole far outweighs drunkenness and buzzing. ..Day 1 today - Im proud to say it! ..IWNDWYT

Alcohol is definitely my gateway drug. When i got drunk I usually smoked some weed. When I got shitfaced I would say yes to whatever people had.
Way to go on choosing a healthier path! Totally makes sense that alcohol would make you want drugs. Iwndwyt!
Congrats on Day 1!!!!..I have a secondary urge that kicks in only when I'm drunk and that's to use inhalants (poppers). It started as a way to enhance sex but then I realized it could enhance everything even lame things like watching the news or a sports game on TV.  I would never think to use them sober but once I had a few drinks that urge would kick in. It has been a major source of shame because really who the fuck sniffs poppers to make TV more interesting? Gross...Kicking alcohol has the excellent knock-on benefit of kicking that shit to the curb.
This might be a wonderful time to spend time with new friends. Do you have many volunteer opportunities in your area? A humane society where you can walk dogs or interact with cats or maybe Habitat for Humanity or a local park?
