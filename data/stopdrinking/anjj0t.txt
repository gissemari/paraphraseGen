I've been lurking for a month or two and I've never quite made it past my first or second day. There was always that voice in my head that told me I deserved a break a reward that one or two drinks are fine. It's never just one or two drinks. ..I've struggled for a long time with severe anxiety and depression from BPD and I drank to numb that pain for four years every single day but I didn't realize I was actually making it a thousand times worse until very recently. It's so incredible how much things have changed already. ..I feel emotions again (which is a little terrifying but ultimately very good) I find music and art interesting again my morning panic attacks have improved immensely I can focus on writing papers reading and working again conversations don't feel quite as forced I don't dip away from human interaction as quickly my sleep is more fitful I don't wake up foggy and dizzy and flushed my thoughts and feelings are more regulated my confidence is creeping back up I'm not bloated or dehydrated... the list could go on and on. ..Every day is harder than the last don't get me wrong. It's difficult learning to cope with an onslaught of much more powerful stimuli but it somehow feels good. I feel human again. It's scary but it's so beautiful. This subreddit has been so helpful in making me want to stay on track. ..Guys IWNDWYT!

Congratulations and great work!
Huge congratulations on your fabulous 4 days of sobriety    . You are almost through the worst part of this journey...You have made so much progress and had so many realisations of truth already that I have to confess to being a little jealous  ...I look forward to hearing more about your journey.
