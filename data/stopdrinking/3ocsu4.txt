I have an amazing wife that is always there for me. I don't know if I could be sober without her. She even makes sure there is always bottled water for me in the fridge. That helps so much when I get the urge to grab a beer. Here is to all the great SO's out there that help us out every day!

Amen to that!   Grateful every day for him! 
Now that's a loving gesture. You've warmed by cold cold heart!.
That's was the theme of my morning check-in /u/n8saces -- you are indeed blessed.
Yes! That's great! My husband brought me coffee in bed for the first time in a long time today. For many many years he had learned that the only way to deal with hungover kilayo was to bring cup and step away quietly.... Now these last 4 months I've usually been awake before him. It was nice to be able to give him a smile and a thank you...Hooray for the great SO's!!! ....and thank you!
