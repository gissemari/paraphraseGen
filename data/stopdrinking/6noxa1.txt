I recently moved to take a job in a new city had friends from my old town drive in to spend the weekend up here and go to a baseball game go out on the town etc..I was excited that they were coming but I was worried there was gonna be a lot of pressure to drink/tailgate/party like we used to..First night at dinner I ordered tea and one of the friends says "still not drinking?" (she knew that I had a sober stint but didn't know that I had relapsed)..I said "well.....I'm back to not drinking......."..We all had a laugh and it didn't come up again once this weekend...had a great time and was awesome to be present for the whole time they were here..Great weekend hope everyone had as good a weekend as I did..I won't drink with any of you this week
