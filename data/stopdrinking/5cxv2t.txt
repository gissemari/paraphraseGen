So I haven't posted here in a while - I've been trying not to think about recovery too much and not count the days as I tend to become a bit obsessed with recovery and burn myself out. But I got a notification today on my phone telling me it's been one month (badge is slightly off)...Around 90 days ago I went on a pretty decent bender which fucked me up big time. Then a month ago I relapsed again with alcohol diazepam morphine and butane. I'm still not sure how that didn't result in a trip to the morgue or at least the hospital. Luckily I got back into recovery quickly but shit the two weeks after the relapse I felt depression like I've never known it before - lying in bed wishing for death every day...On the plus side I have been sober for 88 of the past 90 days. I have learnt a lot about myself in that time. I'm starting to figure out what I actually enjoy in life. I've become more interested in my studies. I have concrete plans going forward and my ambition is coming back. I'm about to start working. ..Importantly to me I no longer see the breakup with my girlfriend as a devastating pit of depression but rather an opportunity to develop. I realise now that I wasn't the best boyfriend and that we probably weren't really a good match anyway. So I can lie in bed and drink my sorrows worse than they were or I can get out and change myself...And that starts with staying sober - even if just for today.

Congrats on 88 days out of 90! Im still trying to reach that milestone. Keep up the good work!
Sounds like solid progress!
Congrats!
"One month. Could have been three."..Also could have been zero.  Good job and appreciate one month.  You may not be in the mood to give yourself credit but every day counts.
