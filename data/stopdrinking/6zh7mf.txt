I slipped a few weeks ago and got drunk twice within a four day period. I'm feeling better now but I know under the surface I'm still extremely vulnerable. I've seen it time and again where someone will have a brief relapse then appear to recover for a few weeks or a few months. Just when it seems the coast is clear they fall off hard and it's off to the races...One of the things I've come to realize in recovery is that my thoughts and feelings are not all that reliable. I may think I've got this but under the surface that sneaky fucker called addiction is lurking and waiting to strike. ..That's why it's very important that I stay vigilant and work my program harder than ever even though I don't feel like I need to.

Nail on the head!
Truer words were never written. Glad you're back at it. I will not drink with you today.
Needed this post. Thanks. 
So true. To me thinking you're safe is a sure sign you're not. Seems like most (all?) of us here never will be. Only way for me will be to never trust my feelings only my experience..
Yes this is solid gold wisdom.
Very true. Coming back from a relapse this weekend myself nothing more cunning than the addict mind.
