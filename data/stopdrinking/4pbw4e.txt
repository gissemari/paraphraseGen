Hey all..I'm having two quandaries and I can really use as many opinions as I can get...* 1.  I see a therapist who has been a wonderful asset in my early recovery.  I see her at 7:30 am.  The other morning I woke up late so I poured some coffee in a Nalgene bottle (a cup or two) and ran out the door.  ..She asked me "Are we replacing alcohol with coffee?" and nodded towards the Nalgene.  I was like "No?" but she's been insistent.  We spend as much time on my "coffee use" as we do on my actual alcohol addiction issues.  For the record... I drink 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning.  She also said "Wow black too?" because I don't take it with milk.  ..I feel like I'm about the throw away all the progress I've made over this coffee issue.  I can't tell if my therapist is being ridiculous or I'm being willful or a combination of both...?  I know this isn't r/therapy but I'm wondering if anyone could shed some light on this?..* 2.  My friends are getting together Saturday evening.  They are non-alcoholics but they drink socially.  I was planning on attending if my (non-drinking non-alcoholic) partner could attend as well.  He can.  Either way I want to go but if I'm not comfortable then I can leave.  ..My sponsor asks that I attend 4 meetings a week (which I can do)- my home meeting is Saturday so I would miss it.  I relayed the situation to her over the phone last night and she basically said that it was a bad idea and that I shouldn't go.  I'm a bit resentful of this and I don't really know why?  Obviously she can't tell me what to do and I do need and respect her advice.....Anyway.  Am I having an ego issue?  I don't want to fall back into the trap of only listening to what I want to hear (that road usually leads back to drinking.)  After a week or so of relatively smooth sailing I'm beginning to struggle a bit...Thanks all.

Every AA meeting I've been to has been awash in coffee..Unless I had a commitment at that meeting I might find another right around it unless you feel that strongly..A year ago I had a conflict between a dinner I had friends at an a speaker meeting I wanted to hear. I got to the dinner found myself surrounded by people drinking same old stories and relized the AA meeting was probably going to be better. Split to the AA meeting and hung with my tribe. Do what feels right in your heart.
I don't understand the issue over coffee. I'd be confused too. ..
I've never understood people that seem to think black coffee is any stronger than coffee with cream/milk in it. I mean it's the same coffee how much cream are people adding that it would actually dilute it? Unless you think your caffeine intake is a problem I personally wouldn't really worry about it. Maybe next time ask your therapist directly where she is going with the coffee thing. 
&gt; I can't tell if my therapist is being ridiculous.....My 2-cents go to totally Ridiculous.  .I don't remember who (sorry to that person) but recently wrote "They can pry my coffee cup out of my dead hands."  .I'm curious what your therapist's beef is with coffee...As for your get-together it's a few days off and I'm sure you'll make the right choice.  .Blessings to You!..
I think you are showing an incredible willingness to consider whether or not you are playing a part in these issues. In my experience that bodes very well. With that being said I have no idea why your therapist has such an issue with the coffee. Seems like a personal issue on her part. As the client you have a right to express that you are there to deal with the issue of ALCOHOL and would prefer not to focus on caffeine...Regarding the party your sponsor knows your specific situation better than we can and you know it better still. I can certainly see that there is the potential of a temptation there maybe your sponsor is just being very cautious and applying dry people dry places. 
As others have said I wouldn't worry about the coffee thing either. I'm sure your therapist is just worried about cross addictions and is probably coming from a place of attempting to reset your addictive brain habits completely which means not using any substances which alter your mood. Maybe talk with her about how you don't want to just drop everything from your life all at once and that drinking coffee right now will potentially help you be successful. (I'm putting words in your mouth so totally disregard anything I just said if it's not accurate. This was just more of an example of how you could approach her.)..Your sponsor is just looking out for you in the best way they know how which is to promote the "dry people dry places" motto which is great and works for many people who can arrange for that to happen in their lives. As you said though she can't tell you what to do...I live with two alcoholics and have to make my room my 'dry place' but can't really fit the 'dry people' into my life right now and am happily and easily avoiding alcohol. It's only been 16 days though and a part of me knows that if I don't remove myself from this situation (which I am working towards right now) relatively soon I'm setting myself up for failure. So---if you think you can manage going out and have a good plan for not drinking then go for it! It sounds like you've put some solid thought into this and having your partner there will help tremendously seeing as how he doesn't drink and can remind you of your goals if you start to feel yourself succumbing to temptation...Or you could just avoid the trials altogether and take heed of your sponsors advice. Of course this is the much safer route. Kind of like how abstinence from sex is the safest way to not get STIs/Babies. Haha...Either way though you've got this! :)
Coffee is really helping me in the evenings. Its a great reward and  very comforting.  I figure we should do whatever is working for us to stay sober.
So couple of things here..**Coffee**..I would turn the tables and find out why your therapist thinks the coffee is important.  I know that some people will substitute other beverages for alcohol or they will change their addictions (caffeine exercise spending money etc).  If that's her concern then she should be open with you about it...**Sponsor**..I think that your sponsor is coming from a good place.  I assume she wants to see you succeed in your recovery which is why she is suggesting 4 meetings a week.  4 meetings a week likely worked for her early in her recovery and she's probably talked to others who have had similar experiences.  As such she's suggesting it to you.  Missing a meeting so early in recovery probably sends up a red flag for her which is why she's saying it's a bad idea...A suggestion might be to attend the home meetings and then go meet up with your friends.
