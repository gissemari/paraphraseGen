Funny thing as I approach that 3-digit date this week.  I had some series plans for relapses in time.  Everyone does it I told myself.  I can't tell if I lied to myself that everyone does it or what.  I guess I forgot.  :-)..Was thinking about it on my drive to work this morning.  The raw edge of feeling like microwaved dog crap is gone.  I remember how much I hated that feeling.  Feeling like crap and hated myself for making myself that way.  I hate that I have somehow started to loosen the grip of hating that feeling.

You can do this and when you hit 100 you won't want to drink! Fuck zero as they say in house of cards. I won't drink with you today 
Those two beauties will shine up the sky! No fuck about them 
I drank planned to on my 100th day last time around and let me tell you it feels way better way way better really awesome actually to be on 400 days wow I didn't realize I was at 406! Whoo! I find it helpful to read all the posts from people just getting started to remember where I was when I stopped and what I am (not!!!) missing! Also lots of nachos haha good luck man hope you have something spectacular planned for day 100 :)
