Man it feels good to say that I was trapped in the cycle of quitting and relapsing promising to myself I would quit for the final time and then fall back into the pit of repeated downfall. I was a disappointment to friends family co-workers they all doubted I would quit. But this goes to show you they were wrong. I'm only moving forward and never going back...#IWNDWYT
