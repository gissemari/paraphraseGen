I'm always saying "oh yes that's my favorite thing too" here when someone comes along and says they love their hangover free mornings or their free evenings to do with as they please or pretty much any other favorite thing someone mentions.  It's not that I'm really that much swept along with the feelings of others it's just that many things have improved.  In fact all the things have improved.  ..Before when I was still struggling to stop I had a dull roar in my head of self flagellation shame and meanness toward myself.  It was terrible especially to me as a mother.  I felt like I was failing.  Failing.  ..But what has happened is a brick by brick foundation built in 24 hour increments of reclaimed self respect.  I am not tiptoeing through the tulips of life every day.  I'm still flawed but stitched together with good intentions.  But every day I don't drink is another brick in the wall and I can walk along the wall I built and when I look at it that dull roar is now the unceasing idea that I am not failing.  Self respect is priceless.  Even if it is just a tiny ember with barely a wisp of smoke to it blow it some air and let it catch.
