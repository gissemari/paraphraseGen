I'm not new to this page but I went about six months on the wagon after hitting what I thought was "rock bottom" and relapsed pretty terribly.  My approach to sobriety was basically just quitting which never worked the few times I've tried after admitting I had a problem.  Funny thing is my addiction didn't change... One turned to five and then I'd knock out or lose track of days and start seeing withdrawl symptoms right when I woke up.  This went on for a month as it usually does and unfortunately I crashed my car into a tree and somehow survived.  Nobody was involved but me and i know that there is a maelstrom of legal shit probably coming my way (haven't been charged with anything yet) but two days later I checked into an intensive outpatient program which has done more wonders for me in the past three weeks than anything has in years.  Regardless of what is going to happen I'm actually doing what I never did before... Accepting help.  To anyone who is afraid of accepting help you're not alone.  Having a group of people who understand has made this a little less painful.  I have even identified behaviors of my own that lead me to want to drink.  My point of sharing this is because for me talking about my addiction was embarrassing but most people in group are probably going through similar or worse shit.  Regardless of what's going to happen legally I'm 29 days sober.  Having those days back and a place to go now is worth it to me.  So to anyone who is timid on treatment... Give it a shot.  My stubbornness is one of my biggest flaws and it made my whole deeper.  IWNDWYT.

It takes a lot of strength and courage to open up and admit you need help. Your stubbornness aka pride will tell your otherwise but we can't trust our own thoughts when we're using or are in the early stages of recovery. And even years later for me now half the time. ..Connecting with other people is paramount for sobriety. Don't feel embarrassed (pride) or shameful for anything you open up about. A.A. is one of those weird places where the more messed up and crazy stuff you've done the more people like you. When you open up it shows people they're safe to do the same and before you know it people are bragging about the stupid and terrible things they've done trying to outdo each other. ..Plus A.A. or any addict group is the home of the most selfish and self centered people you will ever meet in your life. They don't care what you're saying. They're all thinking about themselves. ..Congratulations on 30 days. You got this and there is a beautiful life ahead if you. Expect it. Keep your hope up. You can't change the past but you can create the future you want.
