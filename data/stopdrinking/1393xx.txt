Hi guys the son of a dependent alcholoic here that was in a life threatening situation. ..My dad has been a heavy drinker for about 30 years and was showing all the symptoms of Alcoholism (Tremors/shakes Sweating not leaving bed for days at a time drinking everyday starting early in the morning etc...) Heres my story:..I tried for months getting him to quit at times I thought he had. He would put on an act tell me he's not drinking and was hiding bottles constantly. I tried getting others involved his mom sisters brothers friends etc... And they tried they talked to him about it seriously. My mom like the others have been trying for years and eventually gave up. But with my dad on a downward spiral lost his job losing support it's now my time. And he's going to beat this because I won't let it end any other way...Taking matters into my own hands I began doing research. I suprisingly started here on Reddit in this very forum as well as r/alcholism. I used the links provided to me on the side. I googled sites read up on various materials as much as I could. I split up the various situations...Here are the steps I took in order hope this is helpful!..-Research the situation you'll probably find that the situation is a lot worse than you had thought...-Reach out to everyone (friends family etc) and see who is supportive both financially and emotionally...-Figure out where you stand financially (Detox rehabs counseling can all be VERY costly). Look into County Funding (google it) look into Medicaid look into welfare. And do not be ashamed while doing so I'm in the same boat financially as are many others. If you need help with this please send me a message I'd be happy to assist in the research...-Get a Professional Medical Examination at a center that deals with Addicted Diseases (Why research is important I found a place nearby called Gaudenzia). Based on the evaluation they will recommend something for you they will also work with you financially...-I advise from here that you take there recommendation or do very good research on another Medical Detox Facility. They set us up with the Recovery Foundations Network...-From here the person you know who is struggling with the disease is going to struggle more than ever. Trying to break a dependency like alcohol is very serious and life threatening. But the hospital or institution that the Center for Addicted Diseases has recommended will be very helpful. Be supportive through the entire process he's in good hands now...And most importantly good luck. I'm not a very emotional person and I broke down multiple times throughout this process. If there is anything I can do to help please let me know.

This is really helpful - you may want to crosspost it in other Reddit locations (if that's allowed).
That seems like a very thorough and reasonable way to approach the situation. I'd add one thing: it's a really painful experience having a loved one suffering the effects of alcoholism while they continue to drink so remember to take care of yourself and your own emotional health. ..I can see that you have a lot of love and that you are a determined person. If despite your efforts your father keeps drinking alcoholically this will not a failure on your part. There is a point where people have to determine in their own heart that they truly want to get better and are willing to do whatever it takes. And you can't control that. I hate to bring in this pessimistic note because there is plenty of reason to hope but you have to realize what you are up against with alcoholism. There just isn't always a good ending...Good luck with your Dad and the program of rehabilitation that you are working on getting together for him and thanks for sharing your experience.
