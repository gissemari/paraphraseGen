Normally when I had a relapse I stop posting or reading anything. Not today. I'm here. I drank this week but I will stop. I really want to and I know I can't. I'm going to go to AA sometime this week. I just can't do this on my own. I just wanted to say this and not hide in shame.

Absolutely awesome that you're here!
If you haven't been to an AA meeting before the sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit has links to two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. I hope you give it a try. After 19 years if trying to quit/moderate/control I found what I needed to finally succeed. That first meeting saved my life. ..Good luck. IWNDWYT
You know what you have to do. If you haven't been to AA I suggest keep going. The first time might feel weird. If you keep at it and find it's not for you then there are other alternative meetings.  Online or in person. Iwndwyt
Love that you're still here with us!!! Accountability and support are key. Glad you're looking at going to a meeting!
Go to AA today. Stop putting it off
Going to AA meetings helped me feel less alone and ashamed.
Welcome back! I consider it progress to not hide a good first step to making sobriety stick!
