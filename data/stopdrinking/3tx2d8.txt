I've had a lot of problems with drinking but i came to terms a few months ago and decided I can't do it anymore. It was really hard to accept that at first but I'm happy I do now. I just view drinking now as something I can't do. Not in a lenient I shouldn't way but a firm can't do it. ..They say the brain is good at hiding the trauma drinking has caused but mine isn't. Just thinking about the last time I drank and those feelings still haunt me. I know that if I drank right now I wouldn't even be able to enjoy it because I'd just feel like that again. ..So that's how I feel about drinking it's so off the table for me and I'm really happy I chose that line of thinking when I quit. I didn't consider myself as an alcoholic then but now I do. Each day in my sobriety I realize more and more how much better off and happier I am. I know I will be miserable from the very first sip of a relapse but somehow I still miss it. I know I will never drink again and I'm very happy about that but I do miss it. That's why I'm an alcoholic. I had my last drink 87 days ago.

Welcome /u/pluecebo I hope you will become a regular on /r/stopdrinking.  If you haven't already why don't you check the Daily Check-in.  It's sort of the touchstone of our daily resolution on the Sub.
Have you made a list of the reasons you miss alcohol? Sometimes getting that down on paper will make you realize the reasons aren't logical or for example if you have a reason like "I miss the social aspect of drinking" you can counter that with a statement like "I will go join a Karate class as a social outlet." For me if I don't write down the nagging drinking thoughts they become more convincing over time. Getting them down on paper helps me understand the BS I am telling myself. 
Congrats. And welcome.  Good to hear your story.
