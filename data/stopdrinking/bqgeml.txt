Good morning! 8 months of no drinking and I screwed up this week. Drank 3 days in a row I knew I was going to drink probably a week leading up to it but instead of doing the work that I knew I needed to do I let the idea fester and marinate. Nothing disastrous happened but I know all the progress I've made in my life is directly related to not drinking. My divorce was finalized last week and it's painful guess I just was looking for a break from the stress. Overall it's for the best and I was able to persevere because of not drinking. I'm back and doing some deep thinking about what happened. Thanks for the support my plan is to come here more often again.

Slips can happen. Congrats on dusting yourself to off and getting back on track. IWNDWYT.
