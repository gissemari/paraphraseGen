So far it's been ok. My 12-week old is going through something now and hasn't been sleeping. I feel hungover even though I'm not. Not going to lie wine sounded pretty great last night. My husband was at a work function and after a long day with baby I really wanted to unwind after I got him down to sleep...But I ate a cinnamon roll and watched election results instead and went to bed early. Which was a good thing because baby woke up all night again and I'm already struggling so adding a hangover to this would be hell...Remembering that as we get to tonight. I will not drink today!

The first time I quit I didn't sleep for 2 weeks. Damn I was miserable but still got up and went to work every day. I was a Zombie everyone could tell something was going on. Nobody ever said anything but I can only imagine what they were thinking. I'm sure that me stopping drinking never crossed their minds. They probably thought   I was doing Meth or Coke. Good job on day 4! One day at a time. IWNDWYT!
It's so so hard with LO's. I have two under 2. I'm doing this for my kids...we can persevere! Hugs to you- and may sleep even out for you!
Oh geez I relate to this. One of the reasons my drinking got worse after my son was born (no drinking during pregnancy) was because I felt like such garbage from lack of sleep anyway it was the one thing I could do to immediately feel better.
