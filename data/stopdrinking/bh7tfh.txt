First ignore my badge. I think it's wrong but cant see it (on mobile) I'm on day 12 again. ..I struggle most with the L in HALT lonely. I dont know where to find friends to connect with. I've tried AA the IRC and various meetups and struggle to make any connections. Really starting to wonder if I'm just that unlikable. ..Where do you find meaningful connections?

You seem thoughtful and introspective - wonderful qualities when trying to make a connection. I find great comfort in friends and family. I've learned that making new friends is an ongoing life process. You put yourself out there and people will pop in and out of your life - doesn't mean the connections are any less meaningful. Also paying attention to the ebb and flow of friendships has helped me to understand what friendship truly means to me. I wish you success on your journey and I hope this helps in some small way. I will not drink with you today.
Something that I find really helpful is volunteering in my community...While there are many ways to do that when I relocate I simply look up United Way...They serve to bring most of the agencies in an area together.  I pick things that I like to support.  That may include Salvation Army soup kitchens Big Brother/Big Sister guide dogs for visual impaired adults with learning disabilities reading to the blind shelters for domestic abuse and on and on........I meet other volunteers clients of the agencies business owners philanthropists service providers......     Everybody is interested in "helping others" so they're pretty cool and thoughtful people...I've made good friends and business opportunities as well...Tried that?
