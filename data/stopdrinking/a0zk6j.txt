I left my wife for my new person did her wrong.   Was always a heavy drinker since my Army days.  But it was always under control.  Moved to a new state bought a bar (bad idea apparently).   Stress about money new life etc.. turned my drinking into something else.  ..Now she's cheating on me.  I caught her.  I'm so mad but in retrospect I'm the only one to blame.   She's not without blame I didn't cheat on her.  I went a month sober until I caught her.  I'm currently zero days sober.  Don't have me...

My drinking career went hand in hand with bad / confusing relationships and led to a fair bit of heartbreak. One of the best things about being sober is learning new ways of communicating and looking after myself and others. There's still a bit of heartbreak left over from those days but I'm slowly working through it all and optimistic about the future. I hear you.
