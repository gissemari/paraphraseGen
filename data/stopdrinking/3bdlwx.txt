Holy crap you guys. Last week was my one year soberversery.  I didn't even think about it and I love that. I didn't count the days to hit my year. I wasn't so anxiously waiting for it.  It was just another day and a few days later I realized "I've been sober a year." I love that my sobriety has become such a basic part of my life that I do not feel a need to count the days...Anybody who maybe is just starting out or is having trouble and struggling just know it gets better. Everything feels better. I have never felt better. I have gained the respect of my peers. I love sobriety. Keep it up. I know you all can do it.
