I didn't sleep that well last night my anxiety has been pretty high since my last relapse. And due to some financial and transportation issues. I knew it would be challenging because our general manager is off on Wednesday's and our assistant manager is nice but not as calm or helpful. I've got a massive workload being the officer manager and our fiscal year just ended. .And then my youngest child (15) calls me from school at work hysterically crying. She learned about google image searching people and looked up her dad (my ex husband that's been sober about 3 years) that's been MIA a few weeks. It was his mugshot from a DUI and hit &amp; run arrest from 2 days ago. .I'm heartbroken for him for our kids for his family and unfortunately I'm not surprised. It's his first DUI. He drank heavily for about 7 years before his sobriety and 4 of that we were still married. I didn't pick up drinking until about a year after our split. .According to court and arrest records he hasn't bonded out. Before we found out my son (18) had texted my ex's mom this morning just normal stuff and she said nothing. .I had some more work drama. Came home to hurt and angry kids and I can't blame them. .I'm so exhausted in so many ways. But I am not going to add fuel to this dumpster fire by drinking.
