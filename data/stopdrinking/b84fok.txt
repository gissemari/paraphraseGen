Sucks doesnt it.....  ...I've done similar stuff to my family. I've been sober and relapsed and did it again - thought they'd never forgive me for some of it. Been sober 11 months and I'm pretty sure I'm about to repeat the whole cycle. Luckily they have forgiven me completely or so it feels. It is extremely painful to have to deal with those thoughts. I think and thought very similar things... it got to the point I couldn't shut my mind off telling me to "just fucking blow your brains out or get drunk." Similar phrases still repeat in my mind and its all caused by alcoholism - well mostly. I'd love to give you an answer. But I can't.
Hey there's a silver lining here: you've learned that you cannot moderate. So don't blame yourself for doing a little science to verify...Now you can get back on to the work of sobriety. A clearer head will help guide you on how to proceed with repairing the damage drinking has done to your relationships...But! First things first! Get through today without drinking. Give yourself a little win. You deserve that.
I think you should tell her you were drunk
I'm pretty much in the same boat.  I feel you entirely.
It's an addictive substance. Once it gets a foothold it's not gonna let go until it consumes you. ..You can choose not to let it get that foothold by side-stepping that first drink. ..This is what I'm telling myself when that  you can moderate  con game pitch starts whining in my head. IWNDWYT
