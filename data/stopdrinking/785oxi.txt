Woke up early because a solution to a problem I was having came to me. I shot up at 5am and had to write it down. I was happy to have (subconsciously) figured it out not just for the solution but because i think my brain's on the mend. A much better feeling than passing out dead to the world waking up groggy to a thumping dehydrated brain living in a fog.    .A great start to the day followed by a healthy breakfast with a new friend and soon to put my solution into action! The past few days have been difficult and there are more bad days to come I'm glad I will have days like this to look back on and remind myself why sobriety is worth it when I'm struggling (instead of only the negative memories of why drinking isn't worth it).    .IWNDWYT!

this sounds amazing!  I love the feeling of waking up resolved with a problem.  I often tell friends "you just need to sleep on that problem and see what you come up with by morning."  IWNDWYT
