Not too much anxiety. That's been my biggest struggle. I think it's a mixture of anxiety and withdraws but it has been horrendous. My first day I wanted to cry from the anxiety every few hours. Today wasn't that bad at all. A little anxiety in the morning but I evened myself out by praying and breathing. I even mowed my lawn today without a beer. I've maybe done this twice since I got married seven years ago. Played with the kids and loved tucked them in. Just really good stuff all around! Anyways things aren't too bad. Buying the wife flowers tomorrow on my way home instead of buying myself two pints of whiskey to hide.

&gt;Buying the wife flowers tomorrow on my way home instead of buying myself two pints of whiskey to hide...This is excellent. Get something for yourself too! 
That is awesome! I really like the gesture of flowers for your wife. I think it says a lot about you this early I really like how much your family means to you. The more you keep showing them happiness in recovery you are creating unbreakable bonds. Yeah there will be bad days....but that happens to everyone. Great job!
You are on your way now.  Keep focused on doing this 24 hours a day.  ..One of the cool things I got in the habit of doing was hitting 5:30 PM commuter meetings buying flowers and sharing nachos with my wife at the local Cheesecake Factory.
