That might not be the right word. I just thought to myself .. I haven't thought about alcohol in a long time that's awesome. Hey maybe I should be fighting with the concept of sobriety more. I shouldn't think about drinking. Drinking....it's been awhile hasn't it? Maybe I should be struggling with my inner demon more. Yeah I should want a beer! Beer! Isn't it great?  Oh man I could go for a beer now. That's what I'm supposed to think. So here we are...getting close to beer thirty isn't it? ....

I find that when I'm thinking about 'not drinking' it's because I'm actually thinking about drinking but I'm clever enough to disguise my intent to myself.  When it happens to me I go through the 'HALTS' list (which is what I do if I'm thinking of drinking) and start there.
