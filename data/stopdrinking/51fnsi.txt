My first serious attempts to quit ( i. e. I actually counted the days and lasted one month then three months) were about 6 years ago and three years ago. I had my first worries about my drinking habits starting maybe 15 years ago. In between I convinced myself that it was OK to drink the way I was so that it wasn't REALLY a problem. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) I was hard to fully convince and regularly spent significant time worrying about the fact that I drank every day. I hope that after so many times trying to moderate the lesson is finally learned that I need to avoid alcohol permanently. I'm happy to be sober and have zero desire to start drinking again at this point. I hope and intend to continue as a non-drinker for the rest of my life...I'm trying to distill some useful information here from my own experience and it must be: you're playing with fire because alcohol IS ADDICTIVE; don't give up no matter how many times you've failed; and listen to that nagging inner voice. ..Imagine that a powerful and terrifying monster has smashed through the walls of your home where your friends and family are gathered. It begins to destroy you all. Blood is running limbs are severed. It reaches out grabs you and wraps its tentacles of steel around your neck choking off your screams...What do you do?..A. Think "I could really use a drink right now."..B. Decide not to try to escape because this is very exciting compared with your boring stupid life...C. Stay there because your friends are there...D. Break loose and run because you will probably lose weight and struggling to escape will be a good workout. Maybe your skin will clear up even...E. Relax because you aren't really caught by the neck in tentacles of steel. I mean you're really just resting your head. This monster looks hostile but he's really nice once you get to know him.  The only people he actually kills are the old smelly unemployed ones...F. Worry that if you try to escape you will be perceived as a lightweight uncool and unwilling to engage in adult  activities...G. Make a violent effort to free yourself help your friends and family (except the ones who choose to stay of course) and run as far the hell away from this monster as you can. Get counseling to help you cope with this incident and fortify your house so the monster can't get you again.  Join  r/notentacles to learn more about defending yourself from others who have escaped the monster...Not drinking today. No tentacles. Thanks......
