Does anyone have experience with this scenario?  I spoke with him today and have been given yet another reality check that my drinking is affecting things and needs to stop.  After a long conversation where I described how I feel and what it's like having the craving to drink every 2 days he starts telling me about his adhd and how he feels the same way about things and has struggled to a lesser degree with alcohol and overeating.  I was describing my difficulties with stress and decision making and how I never really feel good and happy about anything except having drinks.  He recommends I try a prescription drug (vyvanse)  to see if it would help me like it helped him.  I'm currently on day 3 cold Turkey from beers ( I usually drink 15 every 2nd day).  I'm honestly at a point where I'd love to find something that helps me operate in this world and feel good without the constant craving for alcohol and negative consequences that come with drinking repeatedly.

ADHD medication will help. ..I quit drinking cold turkey for 2 years before I was diagnosed. I was an emotional wreck for those two years. I'm pretty convinced alcohol was helping me but it was hard to control. ..ADHD medication allows your brain to control the cravings gives you more control over how many drinks you have and removes much of the guilt. ..Read about how the medication interacts with brain chemistry and then get tested for learning disabilities. ..Good luck! You are on the path to a much happier life.
There are several types of medication (stimulants like Vyvanse or Concerta or non-stimulants like Intuniv and Strattera) that treat different ways ADD or ADHD presents itself. You'll want to see a doctor to know the potential side effects of each (for example Vyvanse can increase anxiety in some people.) I do believe treating the underlying symptoms of diagnosed ADHD can help you with the work of sobriety but it's very important you find the right treatment! It may take a couple of test runs to figure out which approach is best. ..If you're interested in a very balanced view of ADHD I recommend books by Dr. Daniel Amen - he explains what is happening in the brain when someone is ADHD (the brain scans are amazing!) how medication works and also how nutrition and exercise help the brain.
