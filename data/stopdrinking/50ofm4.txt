I would like to thank Dr Pepper weed work and Mauy Thai for getting me through this week and of cause all the beautyiful sobernauts here on SD this sub is an amazing place for support and positive vibes. From first time posters making the plunge and reaching out to the long timers asking me what I'm going to do differently this time after my relapses all of you are my sexy sober soul mates and I love you all x

Great job! We love you back!
I'm at a week too. good job
Congrats to you and everyone giving you props here. You guys and gals deserve sobriety. Embrace it and enjoy it. There is so much good in store for you all because of it. ..Some times it will feel like it isn't worth it.  You will feel like "Fuck it. I'm drinking tonight." Don't.  Stay sober. ..I drank to not face reality. I didn't want to be an adult. I'm enjoying life now because I'm sober. You will too. It may take a while but you will.
