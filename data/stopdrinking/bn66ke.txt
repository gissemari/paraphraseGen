I posted a reply on another post and noticed I'm at 913 days. I hadn't even recently really thought about how long its been since I last drank but damn it's getting up there! ..To all of y'all struggling it gets easier as it goes on. At least for me it did. I don't even think about drinking anymore even when I make my fianc e the occasional mixed drink after a long nursing shift even after my mom recently passed away and even when the alcohol is on the shelf beneath all of my supplements. I actually thought about (as in contemplated what it would feel like; not actually considered it) getting drunk the other day and the thought of it made me sick. ..I'm in such a better place now without alcohol. It's my fianc e and I's five year anniversary today I just passed a fitness test for my Wildland firefighter certification (speed walk 3 miles in less than 45 minutes with a 45 pound pack in 92 degree heat;I did it in 40:52!) so I can go be medical support for our firefighters on wildfires I'm almost done with my nursing school pre-reqs I work 20-50 hours a week as an EMT and life is just all around so much better. None of the above were functional or happening when I was drinking :)..Anyways blah blah blah. Sorry for the rambling but just wanted to drop a positive vent somewhere.

Awesome job! Keep on doing it!
It's pretty cool to read this - even after only 2 weeks of kicking it  just the mental focus and drive is awesome...Awesome job
It's so awesome to hear these stories thank you!
Your rambling gives me hope. Thanks!
913 days?!?..I am so proud of you and hope one day - soon I hope! - to be even close to your amazing achievement. ..Not the three miles in 45 minutes though- I barely drive that fast :)
Good stuff!
Thanks for sharing your awesome accomplishment!
