Anyone else have those? I've only been sober 8 days and I've had three dreams where I drank and was trying to justify it to people.  Oh it was only a few glasses of wine   I survived a plane crash I deserve a drink!  (Yeah I have some odd dreams!). What's striking is the guilt and shame I feel even in the dream. And how relieved I am to wake up not having drank.

I've been sober for almost 2 years and this still happens and it happens the same way with me.
Yeah I get those too. I do feel shame/guilt/whatever in the dream itself but DAMN do I love the joy I get when I realize upon waking up that none of it happened; I end up starting the day with a fat old smile.
