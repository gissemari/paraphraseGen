So I started my journey mid January of this year had a relapse in mid April that lasted till the end of may. I did the math and in 2017 I have been sober approximately 162/192 days. So 84% of my year has been sober. Compared to probably a 60-70% rate most years.  I was feeling bad about my relapse and not doing better but I am so proud of these numbers! I will not drink with you today!
