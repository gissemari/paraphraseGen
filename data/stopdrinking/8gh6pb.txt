I woke up 45 days sober today feeling like I haven't really accomplished anything. This negative self discipline way of thinking has been the way I thought for a very long time so it's not unusual for me to walk through life feeling unsatisfied. (One of the reasons why I drank in the first place) But that train of thought never benefited me and I've been trying to mentally check in whenever those feelings pop up and just be kind to myself. ..I quit my job before I got sober so these 45 days I've had a lot of free time. Luckily my family and boyfriend are supporting and encouraging me to not worry about a job right now and just focus on me. But I know how scary and dangerous it can be to have too much down time (I've relapsed because of that before) It would be so easy to just go to the store and get annihilated and no one would know. But I would know. And for the first time in my life I've got just enough self respect to not do that. And I like who I am when I'm sober! I started gardening and painting again. I've never made music before but my boyfriend has been trying to replace his recording equipment so we can make music. Bills are paid rent is paid coffee is hot it's a beautiful day to be sober. I do have a lot to be proud of and I shouldn't feel guilty for being proud just because my brain tells me they're  not good enough reasons'.  But what are your suggestions in dealing with guilt and not letting it ruin your day? These feelings annoyingly like to pop up right before I've begun a project and make me feel like I've failed before even starting.

Self doubt is unfortunately common but the good news is you're on the right track by stopping those thoughts whenever they arise. Look into mindfulness and overthinking/anxiety. There should be no shortage of youtube videos on how to meditate or practices to cultivate a mindful state in everyday life...Your brain is telling you all sorts of things that simply aren't true. The more you practice letting them go the faster and easier you can do it.
[These](https://imgur.com/a/Tb1WJ6D) help me in those kind of moods. My joy jar do something physical (distraction plus natural endorphin rush yay) listen to music *positive* music (not saying like jsesus music but maybe perhaps not country or linkin park or trapt lol)... for me its 90s music or rise against that can pull me out of the dark and twisty rabbit hole. Going for a drive. Just chaning my train of thought is my goal. Those sticky notes are on my mirror in my room - I made them while I was in rehab. Gave a few to some of my fellow patients before I left and then the rest went there. I read them every day out loud to myself when I was inpatient and for a long time when I came home. I do it still when I remember or when I am having a particularly bad moment or if I wake up and in a super cunt mood lol. ..Anywhhhoooo sounds like you are doing significantly better!! Which is amazing bills are paid coffee is hot beautiful day..... maybe go for a walk to distract your thoughts and every stop sign or telephone pole tell yourself something positive about yourself? If you can't think of anything think about your NDV.... do you brush your teeth more? How do your finger nails look? Any mid night crazy messages sent from sober you? Is your face not puff anymore? Are you eating better? Are you spending more QUALITY time talking to people vs just yah no sitting on the phone saying uhhhhuhhhh lol. Have you been keeping up with your chores? Created something new? Remembered/found something you love to do now that you are sober? etc....I hope you feel better my friend &amp; .[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) for reaching out..PS.
