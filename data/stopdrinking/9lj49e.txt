Hi all just wanted bought I'd share something that's been helpful. I had a drs appt this week and therapy and took something's away. Firstly after opening up about my drinking to my dr and saying that I was working on quitting she was very helpful and said straightforwardly  For you with the type of drinker you are and your family history I'd recommend not even drinking socially because you'll always relapse. ..I'm and off and on heavy drinker I can stop for a few days or weeks and tend to binge which I then have to force and drag myself back into sobriety. It helped to hear it confirmed out loud what I kind of should've known already...Second was that my therapist reminded me that life is about discovering yourself and trying to live authentically. And alcohol prevents me from doing that because I'm in an altered state. Not only that but to me that helps with the pressure I put on myself trying to  fix' myself...Dunno sorry for the long post but I just thought I'd share

Good job going to a therapist.  I wish I could afford it.  It's nice to hear these types of topics.  I can totally agree about the authenticity and how alcohol interferes with that.  Living sober is weird to get used to but I do learn so much more about myself..
Thank you for sharing those insights. Both are needed to develop a healthy relationship with yourself and with this adventure called life. Despite our  knowledge of these insights the addictive voice can be persistent and cunning. I have needed different sources of support with this ongoing journey. .Glad you have found this subreddit and we will be rooting for you. 
Living authentically...I love that.
