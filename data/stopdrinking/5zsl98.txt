I have been ready for a while and finally took the next step of actually not drinking. The mental aspects of not drinking I have been handling well. I have so much loathing and hatred of being drunk at the moment going for a drink is not what I am struggling with. It's the physical. All I have wanted to do is hurdle somewhere with a blanket till I can feel normal physically. Been kind of dazed. My abdomen is definitely the worst. Going to the doctor is not an option. My partner who is a medical professional does not fully know how bad things have gotten lately. Honestly I am too ashamed and tired at the moment to resolve this with someone else before I fix myself a bit. I am guessing that is why somehow this week was the one I chose to stop drinking while I am alone in town. This thread has been tremendous has helped a lot. Thank you

No more alcohol meant I was no longer dulling my bodies pain.  It did get better and went away eventually but scared me for a while.  By that point my doctor already knew about my issues with alcohol and he refered me to rehab.  If you're not comfortable sharing it with your partner I can understand that but I'd consider a visit to a doctor at any rate.
