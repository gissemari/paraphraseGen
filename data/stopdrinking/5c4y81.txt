"So many people to thank..."..Seriously this is the longest I've gone in 5 years. I had a good run a year ago but fell back after making exceptions. This time  I imposed a blanket rule: No excuses I'm done with it...It hasn't been easy. I've had to find new ways to cope with problems. I had to convince myself that it was better to struggle and face things rather than avoid my problems / distract myself. ..I'm still in my early days but am optimistic about my journey. ..I've lurked here for a while but still took solace from you folks. ..Thanks and all the best!

Congrats on your 4 months I look forward to being where you are!  Are there any benefits you have realized that you want to share with those of us who are just starting out?  I will not drink with you today.
Yay!
