Hi. Long time listener first time caller... Apologies in advance for the wall o' text.  ....First thank you to all of the people who post in this sub-reddit. I've learned a great deal by lurking here the past few weeks and it has helped me to finally make progress.  ....I've not had a drink in 11 days -- which is the longest stretch I can remember since I was pregnant 2 years ago. I'm somewhat surprised that I made it this far this time. I've tried (or half-tried?) many many times before -- you know the promises you made to yourself those mornings when you woke up in slight terror because you don't know how or when you got to bed or what you had done before that ("Please gawd tell me I wasn't on email or facebook and didn't eat voraciously and didn't leave a mess downstairs and...") or whether your partner would bear to forgive you one more time for f*cking up yet again or...   ....Anyway I think I'm doing pretty well right now. I'm definitely feeling great -- mentally alert back to my daily gym routine lost 6 lbs already regaining some credibility with my partner (I think / hope) getting more and more done each day and (for the most part) focused on the future and not the past.  ....Some things I've learned in the process:...* **Day 3.** I should have paid better attention to others' experience with Day 3 -- or thought about what it might mean for my own attempts. Indeed for me Day 3 cravings were the absolute worst. The thing I should have figured out from others is: If Day 3 is going to be the worst make it a day when you have as much support or structure or whatever it is you need to keep you "in line." Prior to now my Day 3s had typically been on a Monday (quit Fri/Sat for the weekend since I'm accountable to family then) -- and Mondays are my most stressful week day. I had always thought it was the stress of Monday that drove me to relapse on  that day... when I may have conflated "Monday" with "Day 3". In any case maybe that will help someone else...* **Hiding.** I was a "secret" drinker; in social situations I drink moderately but when alone I drink to excess -- often to GREAT excess. I often felt like I was "getting away with it" -- oh how clever I thought my hide-the-stash places were -- when in hindsight I'm sure my drinking was about as "hidden" as my toddler's hide-and-seek tactic of hiding behind his own hands. Ugh. Anyway what I have learned is: If you're hiding your drinking you're probably only fooling yourself...* **Exercise.** I've tried to be active my entire life and exercise has always been important to me... but I somehow allowed drinking to take over the regular habit. (Was still going to the gym -- the incessant calorie-counter in my head wouldn't let me get TOO far off track -- but not nearly enough to counter the caloric and especially metabolic damage I was inflicting on my poor body.) Getting my morning endorphin kick back has helped me tremendously...* **Indulgences.** I'm allowing myself a few "treats" that I didn't often do before -- as much frozen yogurt as I want the occasional cookie (the Whole Foods cookies-by-the-pound case and I have become good pals lately) and an alternative drink that has some juice (aside from alcohol I almost never drank anything with sugar -- seemed like wasted calories). And I don't feel guilty about it!..* **Forever.** I'm still somewhat anxious about the prospect of not drinking "forever and ever". It's always seemed a daunting prospect to me to swear off alcohol permanently. Because of this I realize the value of taking things just "one day at a time"... and yet that also triggers some anxiety because it still leaves open the question of whether I drink tomorrow or the next day or... I guess there's comfort in having the decision completely made and not having to worry about even contemplating it ("I'm not drinking. FULL STOP."). So I'm trying to find a happy medium between these two potentially anxiety-inducing poles: freaked out by "forever" vs. occupied by the open question beyond today. For now I've struck on two semi-solutions: 1) A medium-term goal (6 months). 2) A thought that occurred to me a few days ago: *"I'm not giving up drinking forever. I can have that life back any time I want -- if I truly want the shame regret weight bloat disappointment loss of time loss of trust potential loss of my son..."* Somehow that seems to be working for me...* **Gratitude.** I'm grateful to this sub. I also have so many wonderful things to appreciate in my life -- awesome partner adorable son loving extended family living in a beautiful big city work life that can only get better with my turnaround... I need to keep these things top-of-mind.....Again sorry this ended up being so long. Just wanted to begin participating in this community and thought I'd start by sharing where I'm at.

&gt;Forever. I'm still somewhat anxious about the prospect of not drinking "forever and ever"...That one used to really get on my tits.  I was a habitual relapser!  The last time I sobered up I changed that when people asked me if I was off the booze again etc.  I just replied that I was not going to drink today.  That was it I might have a drink tomorrow but today I won't.  For some reason along with many others I have not had a drink in a while.  You know what I am not going to drink today we will see what happens tomorrow.  Good luck.
Welcome /u/Greek-Yogurt--I'm glad you're out of lurk mode.  I strongly resembled your "secret" drinker.  As to your point about "Forever"--it is a lot more than semantics when many of us say we're only doing this for TODAY tomorrow we plan on repeating what we're doing today but who knows tomorrow's not here.  This approach takes a lot of the pressure off doing today sober.  ..AA meetings helped me tremendously --and still do...Good luck and I hope you stay out of lurk mode ; )
Great post as a "functional" and also "secret" drinker I also struggle with the "forever part" and doing the same as you this time and so far its been great. Just told my friends I want to lose some weight before summer so I'm cutting all "unnecessary calories" out for a couple of months. That took the edge of having to "explain" my sobriety to friends and family for now which is nice. After that? I don't know I guess I figure something out. In the end this is something I do for me not for anyone else. Maybe we don't have to explain anything? Maybe "I'm not drinking today" is enough. For every day that goes by sober I feel that I don't really need any excuses to anyone. I just feel so much better now.
Thanks for sharing your experiences and perspectives.  As a secret drinker I can relate.  Being "sober" as far as friends and family knows and yet binging secretly at home on the weekends creates all sorts of problems for me and Im looking forward to being done w/all of that. 
You've cut pretty close to the core of what I've been thinking lately. I've only got 3 days in but I am a lot like you. Snuck around could have lost my son and wife no one trusted me. ..A guy told me once "Just don't drink today. Tomorrow do the same thing. Over and over until you don't want to do that anymore. Then start over." Maybe it's an AA idea but it always stuck with me...You did it. I hope I can too.
