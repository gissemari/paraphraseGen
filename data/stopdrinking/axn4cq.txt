Hi there...Tomorrow is the same number of days that I relapsed at last time. Pretty sure that won't happen now I have AA and the program in my life. (Even as an atheist I choose to see the whole of AA as my higher power. It helps keeps me sober more than I can on my own)...It's amazing even after just 68 days how much better I feel. Yes I still get cravings and I am frustrated about certain life things. But this is normal I think. ..Any way today is my 34th birthday and I don't have any cravings right now. It feels good...I've been to get my hair cut and beard trimmed and I have a meeting this evening...IWNDWYT
