I'm your basic binge drinker around 30 beers a weekend to myself. Tried to quit probably around 15 times over the span of a couple years. 90 days was my longest so far but eventually started drinking again 45 days ago I lost the urge to drink completely and don't understand why since I've struggled so many times in the past to quit. Maybe just sick of all the bullshit and hangovers that go along with it. Anybody else have something similar happen to them? I also do remember for a fact I prayed the night before to give me strength to quit drinking.

Congratulations!
After I had prayed every morning and every night for several months (and began working the 12 steps with a sponsor) I noticed that I had lost my obsession over alcohol. But I do find that when I slack off on maintaining my spiritual fitness I will lose this apathy.  
My reasons for quitting were different but yeah one day I kind of just got fed up. It was still hard for me at first because I had withdrawals but yeah.  This Naked Mind  touches on the subject. 
Prayer is powerful
I was the same. Out of the blue I had just had enough. I never looked back; weird. After trying all my lose to quit with no luck; and woh our really trying bam I was done. Thank god. ..If you think god helped AA would be a great idea. 
I still have the urge to drink but yes something similar happened to me where one moment suddenly I just KNEW I was done. 100 something days and counting! IWNDWYT!
