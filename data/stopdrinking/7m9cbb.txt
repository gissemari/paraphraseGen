Hey guys - Been struggling a lot lately with my anxiety. Just hit the 8 month mark yesterday longest I've been able to put together in quite some time. And life is good. Things have slowly gotten better after falling apart in glorious fashion over the spring and summer. ..My anxiety is starting to get the better of me and I am starting to feel like I'm losing touch with myself (and reality at times). I have this constant feeling of uneasiness. I can see it makes my girlfriend worry. I say stupid things and make her uncomfortable too because I speak before I think and I talk out of nervousness. I don't fear I will drink but recently I've thought about getting high which scares me. The flipbook in my head just won't stop...Problem for me is my health insurance is garbage and has no mental health coverage so seeing a shrink for meds is pretty much not affordable. Same with a therapist. And I'm one of us who's dual-diagnosed and needs those meds. I was waiting until the new year and my new insurance from work kicked in thinking it would be better than the shitty plan we were on but it actually is turning out to be worse. My financial situation seems hopeless. I struggle everyday to pinch every penny I have. My anxiety is manifesting itself now into physical symptoms like back pain sickness insomnia etc. ..I remain sober due to a program yet I'm scared as fuck.

Hey there - I can relate to your post. I also struggle a lot with anxiety and panic disorder and thought sobriety would be a magic bullet to end both. I don't have as much time sober as you but I'm realizing that there is more work for me than just remaining sober. That said my morning anxiety is practically GONE since I'm no longer hungover and dehydrated :) For me it's mostly situational like when I'm driving.  ..I too am on meds and have been for years and years. They are also no magic bullet. I've been trying some apps like Calm and Anxiety Relief which have been helping me sleep which in turn alleviates my morning anxiety. Not giving any advice but over-the-counter CBD oral spray has also seemed to help. It may be the placebo effect but I will take it!..While I feel sort of bummed that being sober hasn't taken away my anxiety I'm more committed now to working through it and hopefully managing it through more than medication alone...Re your GF I've found that telling my SO when I'm struggling has really helped. Let her know it isn't anything she is doing. ..Hang in there. I know it's super tough but we can do it. You are NOT alone. And keep up the awesome track record of sober days! They really really are helping!..IWNDWYT!.
