I've never felt better emontoanly/mentally than I have recently. But as I've mentioned in previous posts I am struggling financially. I was on my break this afternoon wondering how I was going to afford gas and/or food money when my neighbor texted me: "I made two huge chicken pot pies. One is yours if you want it". ..I do believe in G-d and there's no doubt in my mind that meal from my friend was a divine provision. If you think it was just a happy coincidence that's fine. The point is: help will come. Open yourself up to it. Humble yourself and ask for it. Receive it when it is offered.

Divine Intervention!
I love it!  
That's such a wonderful positive outlook! And your neighbour sounds like a lovely person.
