There is a comment from /u/ninjilla from weeks ago that has always stuck with me: "There is a saying that those who go back out come back to report what it was like out there so we can ensure we're in the right place."  So I've come back with a hangover to report what happened...I went 21 days sober but had a relapse last night.  This wasn't impulsive but kind of planned.  Sobriety peeled back all the stuff I was trying to cover up over the past couple of years and what I found over the past few weeks is emptiness.  It's made it hard to get through the late evenings.  I felt the urge coming on around midweek and finally went down Saturday and picked up a fifth of vodka finishing nearly all the bottle overnight.  I didn't black out (probably due to huge tolerance and my Irish blood) I mostly just fixed some dinner watched Netflix and fell asleep woke up about 3-4 am and had more watched more videos and drank and finally quit around 9 am...Why did I do it?  It wasn't a thirst for liquor or missing an old habit but it was to medicate depression and get away from the "void" that has been coming up on me since going sober.  I've been doing some deep introspection over the past couple of weeks and realized what I'm feeling is just emptiness.  Nothing makes me happy or sad.  Even the things I should be thankful for I appreciate them rationally but I don't feel anything from them.  Games movies and TV are no longer fun.  I just feel like a robot.  And my libido is pretty much gone.  I don't even feel anxious which is the classic thing that usually ties in with depression.  I found a whole subforum about this [here](http://www.depressionforums.org/forums/forum/105-anhedonia/) for those who want to explore this kind of thing further...My doctor addressed the general depression issues when I went sober and prescribed Paxil but I never started the course.  My ex who is supportive warned me away from Paxil because of the side effects so I took her advice and have been researching depression and antidepressants.  Interestingly what I want is to feel more emotion rather than less of it like the opposite of antipsychotics.  It seems a lot of antidepressants tend to work against depression by acting on crippling anxiety so I'm especially wary about just taking a random SSRI...The reason I drank the liquor last night wasn't because I was craving a drink but to break out of the flatline state and feel something again maybe to take a chance of feeling a happy emotion.  I remember quite well how liquor used to bring warmth to my evenings.  But when I really think about this I realize I'm seeing this with rose-colored glasses.  I realize I'm just focusing on a handful of nights (mostly 2+ years ago) where I felt good on alcohol and the vast majority of times I just felt numb bloated or sleepy.  Last night?  Yep felt numb bloated AND sleepy.  I have to dial it back to 10-15 years ago where alcohol actually added a glow to the night.  It's clear to me that alcohol abuse put an end to those days a long time ago and I'm trying to live in the past by picking up the bottle.  Alcohol tolerance raised the bar for euphoria over the years higher and higher to the point where I can no longer reach it anymore even with 500 ml of vodka.  I can report 21 days sober didn't do anything to lower the bar.  Maybe someday it will be possible again but there will have to be a long period of sobriety and maybe I won't even need alcohol anymore at that point...What the alcohol did manage to do was knock me a bit out of the flatline state... in spite of a shitty hangover I felt more productive today a little more cheerful and like I snapped out of my rut.  It's ironic that the little benefit I got out of it didn't come during drinking but during the next day with the hangover.  But there's absolutely no way I will use alcohol for that purpose... that's not even on the table as sobriety has made alcohol feel more and more like poison to me.  So my goal this week is to turn to other avenues to address my depression.  I'm gonna call my doctor first thing in the morning and will try to switch over to Prozac as there's a consensus on that forum that Prozac mirtazapine tianeptine and ketamine are sort of front line choices for this sort of depression.  I also am going to see about renewing my YMCA membership and hitting the gym in the next few weeks as it's clear to me exercise will help also...The past couple of times I drank I've made a point of writing notes to myself while drunk.  What did I write early this morning?  It was a paragraph ending with "don't do this again use Rx's no warmth no fun it was just numbing".  Last night was a mixed bag but I feel that it at least gave me a lot of insight into my situation and my lesson learned is that I need to accelerate my plan to treat my depression starting tomorrow morning.  Interestingly I had also been thinking about a moderation approach last week but after last night it's even more clear to me that there's no point in even having alcohol around.  It's bizarre how I drank 500 ml of vodka last night and it wasn't even enjoyable...So thankfully I don't see last night as a defeat rather I think it's helped me learn.  Also I'm glad to report in that 21 days of sobriety I'm losing weight.  I haven't been weighing myself but I can feel it when I pinch my waist and I'm sure there's also been health improvements.  A relapse doesn't wipe any of those hard-won achievements away.. it's just a couple of days setback...Anyway I'm crossing my fingers there won't be WDs... I don't know what's normal for a one night binge after 3 weeks of sobriety but at least I'm armed with meds if anything happens.  So far I feel good with the hangover wearing off...Sent in the badge reset request.

Heya thanks for reporting back! ..In my experience drinking never helped my depression.  I know exactly what you are talking about when you describe that flatline state and it is a terrible way to feel...I'm glad to hear that you've decided that drinking isn't the solution.  Trying to regulate my moods with booze never ever lead to anything good.  Give the anti-depressants a chance because (as you probably know from your research) they can take a month to kick in. I also follow a pretty rigid routine for exercise and meditation and sleep which has helped enormously...Also 21 days sober is awesome but my mental state DEFINITELY hadn't recovered after three weeks sober.  It probably still hasn't although now at least I feel like I'm on the way.  ..Good luck and I really hope the anti-depressants work well for you. For some people I know they have been life changers.
Thank you for sharing.  It helped me and no doubt will help others. I hope you feel better soon.
