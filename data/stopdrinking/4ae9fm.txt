Day 12 It's starting to sink in how much I screwed up the last time I drank. I'm sure there's worse stories out there. ..What's sad is my trigger this time around this relapse was success and good news. I THOUGHT I could moderate but I went from moderate to full blown non-functioning in the matter of 3 days. ..This time around I lost my job. I had always pulled myself up from the abyss in the past i needed a detox once before- but it was easily explained as sick time. Starting to sink in this is my new reality...Not going to drink today I guess thats what matters. We'll see where it goes from now.

Good luck /u/ithinkofdeanmoriarty -- yeah my relapse was pretty appalling.  I was in a living hell for 7 years.  Even after I was sober my consequences were so severe that I ended up in federal prison--but sobriety is true freedom and well worth any temporary pain.   Good luck to you.
I too lost my job. You are not alone. I will not drink with you today.
