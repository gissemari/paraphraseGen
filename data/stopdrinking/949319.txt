The last time I decided to give sobriety an honest chance I was 30 days in and decided I couldn't do it alone any more. I called up my company's HR which provides 3 free counseling sessions every year or so for employees. Three sessions was certainly not going to fix me right then and there but it was a start. ..After those first sessions I chose to continue counseling with interns under the supervision of a licensed clinician at the same practice. This made getting help way more affordable and I am so grateful that this option was available. ..Talking with a (semi)professional has been a huge help for me - creating relapse prevention plans practicing mindfulness exploring other treatment options figuring out what to say to a doctor gathering the courage to try in person support groups (didn't stick but at least I tried) having accountability for what I considered sobriety "boss battles" (like travel holidays and weddings) and just having a person to vent to when I'm feeling frustrated has made a huge difference - especially during the first year of this adventure. ..I'm over 2 years in now and I've largely moved from building up my sobriety to more of a "maintenance mode" situation. Now in therapy we're working on addressing the reasons that I drank and managing the challenges that have surfaced now that I don't have alcohol dumbing me down. Now I get to address my social anxiety chronic depression relationship problems family issues work stress learning how to communicate effectively etc. You know learning how to function as a person without leaning on booze as a crutch. The fun never ends people. ..The big downside to seeing interns is that they turn over every semester or two. Because of this I've been through 6 therapists in the past 2 years. I finally decided to suck it up sign up for better health insurance that covers at least a small percentage of sessions and start paying for someone long term. My first session with the new therapist was yesterday. We got all the way through our hour long chat without me mentioning my history of alcohol abuse when he asked me "is there anything else about you that I should know?" .."Oh yeah you should probably know that I'm a recovering alcoholic and I've been sober for 2 years and a handful of months."..I might be getting some judgmental looks for not mentioning this right off the bat but honestly that's not why I'm seeking treatment any more. Had I lead with this the conversation would have been dominated by questions about it but that's not why I'm paying for sessions now. It's to work on my other shiz. Don't get me wrong. Maintaining my sobriety will always be a primary consideration when making decisions and because of that it was important to mention. No complacency allowed. ..Having a drinking problem will always be part of my life - whether that's figuring out how to get my next drink or figuring out how to avoid it. I've accepted that. But as long as I maintain sobriety it doesn't define me IRL or while I'm sitting in a therapist's office or doctor's office any more and that makes me feel really freaking good. Because booze dominated my life for so long and now it doesn't have to.

That's a very intelligent way of approaching it in my opinion! Firstly it shows how far you have come and secondly how much more self aware we become when the alcohol isn't clouding our brains...Good luck with it I won't drink with you today :)
