This is weird but I'm almost glad that I'm an alcoholic.  If i hadn't gone through the many years with my problem I wouldn't appreciate what I have now.  \(people who aren't alcoholics can't appreciate what they have because they haven't experienced the pain.\)    I'm 28\-days since my last drink and I'm really enjoying it this morning.  I know I'll be struggling again but I went through the weekend without any major cravings.  I thought about the fact that when I was at the store yesterday that I normally would have bought beer or whatever and then went home and got drunk.  Waking up this morning was great and I feel like I've had some victories over the  past 28\-days.   I've also been working out pretty hard and have lost about 12\-pounds or so.   This is so much better and I'm very glad about it.
