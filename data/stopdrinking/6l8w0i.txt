Only my second day of basically drinking constantly for the last ten years. I am just wondering what struggles i will have. I know it will be hard weekends. But are there any symptoms you get from giving up. Struggled sleeping last night that's all so far. Thanks guys. . . 7.39pm drinking WATER. Go me!

Hi well done for making it this far keep it up!..[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6kof2x/all_aboard_for_the_emotional_rollercoaster_ding/) what my day 2 looked like recently...(I tried to keep it lighthearted to cheer myself up!).... You may get some or none of these(or something I didn't get) everyone's different! A lot of it depends on how much and how often you were drinking I'd say... ..I was a daily drinker for over a decade too and stopped 'cold turkey' (on day 6 now) even though this was potentially risky without medical intervention.... Have since checked in with the doctor and all is going well so far......Have a great evening I won't be drinking with you although sleep is still a problem so far.... It's nice waking up without a hangover though!..Stick around it's nice here :&gt;)&gt;..Woody
Whatever struggles come up just remember drinking does not make anything better.  I won't drink with you today.
Hey quit date twin. Think we are in same time zones as well. Just so you know me and you are now officially sober twins and I will see you tomorrow night while we both sober good luck
Hey! Well the good news is that in my experience it gets easier as time goes by. The first 3 days were hell and the rest were up and down for sure but generally on an upward trajectory. ..People talk about a pink cloud that passes after the first three months but I am yet to get there :)...Cheers with my cup of tea &amp; I'm not drinking with you tonight!
