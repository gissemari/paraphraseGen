So my wife is excited about the reservation she was able to get at this new restaurant in town for our wedding anniversary. I'm on day 4 and struggling with whether I should tell her I'm an alcoholic during dinner. My fear is I drink some wine with dinner and that triggers a weekend of craft beer drinking. My wife and I both work demanding jobs and usually there's little time alone to discuss such matters. What to do and how to do it?

I would consider telling her before the fact I think by drinking one glass of wine it would cause triggers and even in celebration I would not want to drink 1 glass because then 1 becomes 2 and 2 becomes 100. 
Why wait until the dinner? I understand the demanding jobs not much time to yourselves... But in my experience waiting around for the right/perfect moment just gave me time to talk myself out of it altogether haha. I'd just do it asap. Then you can more thoroughly hash it out at the dinner.
In your situation I would discuss this in advance and ask if she would be willing to abstain at dinner to help you. It's really not fair to her to bring it up after she already has a glass of wine in front of her. That could make her feel really awkward about drinking in front of you...My wife is wonderfully supportive. I generally don't mind if she has wine with dinner when we're out but at times I have asked her to abstain because I was feeling itchy...Unless your wife has a drinking problem she can be your biggest supporter in recovery. I know mine is and every day I'm thankful to have her behind me. IDK if I'd still be sober without her help.
