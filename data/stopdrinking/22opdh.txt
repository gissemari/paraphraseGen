Hey everyone it's Thursday that means the week's more than half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Apologies for the day late I've been fighting a really nasty bug and it totally slipped my mind yesterday...Triumph: On the path to recovery from a nasty illness...Struggle: Being sick is the worst...General chat: Goodbye snow!!..Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: 5 days no wobbles..Challenge: I've felt nothing. No joy no sadness no emotions. Nicht. Nada. I have killed my emotions with alcohol and now the alcohol has gone there's just a great big void. ..General chat: I want to go to an AA meeting. Not necessarily because I want to work the steps. I just want to be with people that get me. 
Day 20 now! ..Triumph: Feeling really good and happy today. No cravings whatsoever. No procrastination on my work and study either - a first!..Struggles: None actually! I should definitely drink more water though..General Chat: I'm also at 25 days of non-smoking. All this abstinence is turning out to be pretty good for me!
Triumph: Big work eent today that's been a few months in the making and I didn't throttle anyone. Yes! Also starting to get some good inertia behind me in staying as I call it "sugar sober." I realized I was using sugar in a somewhat alcoholic way so I'm on the wagon. I figure now that I'm near 100 days I need to get into a permanent place and that place needs to be without the excess sugar. Anyhow it's been since Sunday that I used sugar "irresponsibly." ..Struggle: Getting a case of the sniffles...General Chat: Safeway Select instant coffee really isn't all that good...Have a great Thursday everyone!
Triumph: I've been trying to be (and am at least better aware of now) less worried about things I cannot control...Struggle: It's been a stressful week and that stress has been caused by worry about the future. Not alcohol-related but just the coming months. My worry is irritating me but I'm slowly progressing towards the things I want. Also been sheltering myself from temptation which in some ways is a triumph but it has bothered me a little...General chat: 90 days soon! Huzzah!
Triumph: Two AA meetings in 3 days with no desire to stop.Struggle: Dealing with legal and relationship issues.General chat: NHL playoffs are right around the corner (which will probably make this a lot harder for me).
Missed you yesterday NMBP.  I hope you feel better!..**Triumph**: Life is awesome.  I weighed myself yesterday and came in at 187.  For those keeping track that's 101 pounds from what I weighed in July 2012.  I had gotten as close as 190 before going on vacation gaining a few pounds and having to lose them again.  But I really haven't been trying that hard to lose those last few pounds.  I know that my ideal weight is probably around 195-200 but I really really wanted to see &lt;= 188.  So woo-hoo!  It took me about a year to lose that first 85 pounds.  Then I lazily tried to lose the last 15...I've joined a tennis league team so I'll be playing different people which is good.  I also joined a tennis ladder which starts soon...Oh and I signed up for a half marathon.  I've only run about 8 miles in one go at this point but I feel pretty good about my chances.  Before this year I had never run more than 2 miles.  Over the last 3 weeks I've gone from 2-&gt;4-&gt;6-&gt;8.  The half marathon is in 4 weeks but I think getting to 13.1 miles should be no problem...Looking back over the last 500+ days and seeing the total amount of change in me and in my life it's amazing.  If I have a bad day I don't think "I need a drink."  I may occasionally think "In the bad old days I would have had a lot to drink tonight... but who am I kidding?  I would have even if it hadn't been a bad day."  I've been to bars to hang out with friends and drinking water is not seen as weird and I never feel like I'm left out of the fun...I went from a life that consisted of sleep work drinking rinse repeat (with occasional fights with my wife thrown in) to a life that consists of better sleep better work tennis Krav Maga running cycling more meaningful friendships better family time reading actual enjoyment of TV shows and movies walks with the dog and my wife and constant happiness.  Life is not the same boring cycle every day.  In fact just about every day is different (and exciting) from the day before...**Struggle**: I've got nothing.  Hi vnads!  Life is awesome...**General chat**: We're starting to have more good weather Spring days than bad now.  Which means more tennis running and cycling! \o/
I lost my SO to drinking. Last night she went to aa with me. Afterwards we went for coffee. She looked at me different. ..I'm only on day 5 but on day 90 I'm going to ask her out on a date. Things are turning up Millhouse.
Triumph: I have not taken a drink today. I did not take a drink yesterday. I will not take a drink today. ..Challenge: Stressors. My counselor pointed out to me that I drank when I'm stressed and in doing so I stressed myself out more. With everything in my life happening all at once (work/community service/meetings/full time school/counseling) I'm barely holding back a panic attack. I'm at the point where a case of the giggles will leave me with tears in my eyes. ..General Chat: I haven't been on here enough lately!!! I missed everyone. 
On day 3 and today scheduled an appointment with a substance abuse counselor next week.
Triumph: Not drinking and feeling great. It's not flashy but feels triumphant to me...Struggle: I'm going to an event at the local ballet this evening "Beer and Ballet" catered by a local brewery. I'm pretty sure I'll be ok especially since my husband is on board with me not drinking but obviously there will be some temptation. ..General chat: Springtime! Already enjoying some trails. 
Triumph: I can't really think of much. I've finished 2 books in the last 2 weeks and halfway through a 3rd. That's pretty cool...Struggle: Honestly pretty much everything right now. I had a solid 15 days going and then fucked it up Tuesday night by having a few beers. Although today is technically day 2 I don't want to get my badge again because I have almost convinced myself I'm going to drink this weekend. I am staying at a friends place to house/cat sit and being alone all weekend coupled with the fact there are liquor stores all around is really worrisome. Also being back on day 2 has really made me feel like I can drink this weekend and restart on Monday. I feel like all of my quitting motivation is gone right now. Those few beers on Tuesday really fucked stuff up for me. Also Easter being next weekend is not helping either as I really cannot see myself going to easter fam jams and not drinking especially since my cousin/good friend is back from Paris for the weekend. Blarghy. ..General Chat: Just finished episode 6 of True Detective last night. Such a good show ugh. 
Triumph: Signed up for the Spartan Beast in September!  If there's ever a reason to not drink it's knowing that race is ahead of me.  Also haven't had one craving to drink in the few short days I've decided to call it quits...Struggle: I really need to quit smoking.  But I'd like to put a couple of weeks of sobriety behind me before I quit that last vice. ..General chat: Thanks for being such a great community!  I hope everyone has a great sober Friday and weekend! 
Sorry about the bug NMBP.  ..Triumph: Just the fact that drinking never seems like a good idea is pretty triumphant right now...Struggle: I'm trying a zinc lozenge a day and lots and lots of handwashing but I seem to be sick three times as much as I'm well in the past few months and my doc gave me a weird look last week when I went in and described my symptoms.  Getting a bit nervous.  I'm under lots of stress so that could be a factor.  Couple of other things it could be and I don't like any of them.  Hoping it passes.  For the past few weeks I've felt like "hangover without the alcohol" and it's becoming obvious it's not "the flu."
**Triumph:** More a matter of checking something long-neglected off the list--a trip to have my kids visit (long overdue) their grandparents (and my parents) whom I haven't seen since before I got sober. I'm doing some journal-writing trying to observe my reactions to the ghosts in the town in which I grew up several decades ago. ..**Struggle:** Not much of a struggle but I did look into the old liquor cabinet at my ancestral home... the smell was familiar and welcoming... I thought fleetingly that I could get away with a sip/slip and how that would fit into an old comfortable pattern of visiting here when I was younger. I didn't--my now-trained brain turned instantly to: hey let's go eat cookies. That night I did have a drinking dream though the first in more than a year. That was two nights ago. ..**General chat:** Saw a "Guess what day it is" T-shirt at a store today... reminded me vaguely of this thread... can't imagine why. 
Triumph: I have been so much more active in AA!!! Hoorayy!!!! Work is going well - ANDDDD I was offered a position for both the summer and next school year!!!!! My last job could not wait to get me out the door. So many positives loving the vibe...Struggle: I want more free time. Ehhh but free time is not a good idea. What was that phrase you gotta get real dumb in AA because doing your best thinking is what got you there. Also shit with the boyfriend. Hmmm..General chat: Hello nice weather!
**Triumph**: Day 21 and I weighed in at 10 lbs. lower than Day 1 this morning...**Struggle**: My cookie-a-day treat has turned into a 2-cookie-a-day treat. Got to get that in check. (Damn you Whole Foods cookies-by-the-pound Toffee Crunch!)..**General Chat**: My son derives pure joy from watching bubbles float through the air. I need to re-discover some of these simple pleasures (... other than cookies).
