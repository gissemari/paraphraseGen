Good morning friends.  ..Today feels great. It's almost 8:00am and I'm heading to the gym soon. .I stared off this month with the intention of doing Sober October. I made it up to 20 days with no alcohol or drugs then last weekend I  slipped up . It was my husband's 30th birthday and I took him to a really nice restaurant. I decided to have a glass of wine that the waiter paired with my entree. It was so tasty and I didn't think much of the one glass at dinner. Then the next day we went to a local Halloween parade and I had some more wine throughout the day. That was a mistake because I kept drinking until it got dark and by nightfall I was pretty intoxicated. Nothing crazy or bad happened. We all hung out at our apartment playing video games talking listening to music etc.  it was ok. But Sunday morning I was sick and so dehydrated obviously. I was anxious and just not feeling well at all. I tried not to beat myself up but it was hard to not feel guilty &amp; frustrated with myself. I knew I would've had just as much fun probably even more fun if I hadn't picked up the booze. .I think everyone has the right to do as they please but I'm so grateful I'm realizing what is best for me and my body. Also my mind my heart &amp; my soul.   .Now that it's Wednesday and I've gone another four days without alcohol I feel wonderful &amp; back to normal. I'm just trying to continue moving forward and to be positive. I know my journey has not been perfect but if I can say I only had a few drinks this month and continue to keep it up I will be so incredibly proud of myself. .I'm doing the best I can and that's all that matters. Anyone who is struggling and trying to find their way just remember how incredible you are &amp; know that you've got this!!..All the love.M

Thank you for this encouraging post. Well done and I am happy for you  
Sounds like you learned a valuable lesson with your slip up- that's what matters most. Good for you getting back on track especially so quickly. That's really impressive!
Don't Drink!
You sound just like me! Last month I had 20 days of sobriety. I generally let myself drink on the weekends but have even been cutting back on that. I also have 4 days this week. Today will be day 10 this month. 2 of those 10 days were weekend days where I allow myself to drink and still didn't. I am starting to lose the point of drinking at all. My husband is very much an alcoholic. It's what we used to do together. It's what got me to the point that I was at. He has 4 DUIs. That's over $40000 in fees and fines! He just won't stop and I worry about his health. And the future of me and my 4 kids without him... How are you feeling physically? I am still groggy and tired...I can never get enough sleep. IWNDWYT
