When I was in my first week or so I was reading a post by /u/PJMurphy about ["how to deal with the fuck its"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8ckhyv/how_to_deal_with_a_case_of_the_fuck_its_repost_2/) which I found immensely helpful. The "fuck its" were one of my greatest mental weaknesses and one of the primary reasons I kept going back to drinking. But it wasn't just alcohol. I would say *fuck it* and eat things that were unhealthy or say *fuck it* and stay up till 3AM even though I know how that will ruin my sleep schedule or say or say *fuck it* and not brush my teeth. Drinking me practically had *fuck it* as a life mantra...Not anymore. At first this technique helped me a lot sometimes it would disarm the *fuck it* sometimes I just had to use willpower to beat it. And I felt I was fending off *fuck its* from every possible angle all the time! Well the good news for me is that I have to fight that fight a lot less times each day. My brain has drastically lowered the amount of *fuck its* I have to fight. And now when they do come up it's almost seems natural to say *no* and do the healthy thing. In fact right after I do that in my head I feel good as opposed to before where I would feel like I was trying really hard or that it was exhausting to be fighting this battle...So thank you /u/PjMurphy for your amazing insight and wisdom. If anybody else is struggling with the *fuck its* you can win and it is totally a battle worth fighting. I have implemented many healthy daily habits simply because I was able to defeat a *fuck it*.
