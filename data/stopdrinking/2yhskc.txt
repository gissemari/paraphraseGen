Last time I went was to get my 6 month chip. ..I have found that 6 months into the second year it is not easier than the first. I think the first year was easier because I spent it counting up to 365 and just constantly being pumped about being sober. Over the last few months I have not felt very good about things in my life. I don't feel in danger of a relapse but I know that I just haven't been putting sobriety first for awhile. I've been complacent. In short I been draggin' ass since about December. I need to recommit to my sobriety and start reaching out to people again. To start helping people again and being willing to be helped. ..The combo of SD and AA got me sober. It's time to give back like I mean it. ..However I must take a moment to say that even though I have been down lately I still absolutely believe that every day that I spend sober is a win compared to the way it used to be. I have not regretted giving up the booze at all. "My worst day sober is better than my best day drunk." I used to hate that saying. I thought it was stupid and hokey. Okay it's hokey but goddamit if it ain't true 18 months after my last drink. As a wise man on this subreddit once said to me "sometimes the only decent thing I do all day is slog my way to bed sober." ..Anyways. Just wanted to post here as a statement of intent and an admission that I still need help and that even we folks that are halfway to a thousand days (and those with 10 times that amount) still have work to do. ..Onward and upward and all that jazz. ..Special shoutouts to:..* /u/pollyannapusher.* /u/Chinstrap.* /u/coolcrosby.* /u/roseneath_and_park

I do alright without the Fellowship. But I do a lot better with it. Enjoy the meeting and grats on your time. 
Your re-commitment at this stage is super inspiring. Thank you for sharing this.
Awesome! I'm excited you decided to check out a meeting. Let us know how it goes. :-)
Hey friend. I see you and raise you the meditation I fell asleep doing tonight. ;-)  I'm proud of you for taking care of yourself. Better yet being able to identify when you need to take care of yourself. 
Probably not the right place to ask this but any recommendations on finding a meeting for newcomers? I've never been to a meeting and am having a hard time locating one near me that isn't closed for men/women only or gay/lesbian... So many stipulations. Where's the "open to everyone" meeting? Each city has to have one yeah? ..I'm not looking for my hand to be held maybe just a link maybe something I missed in the sidebar? I'm pretty alone in this endeavor at the moment and see meetings as very intimidating. But it's a step I think I should take.
Wow this was really inspiring to read thank you
I don't mind being hokey if I'm happy-  and that requires sobriety and recovery.
How was the meeting?
