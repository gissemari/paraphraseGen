I'm praying. Yes me. Never saw this one coming.....I was never one for religion or church. I was brought up Catholic... kind of. We were the family that started to go weekly then trailed out to just Easter and Christmas. I was one of the first to back out of going. I also ended up going to a religious high school and college. Strange how these things work.....The past 12+ years or so I've been wearing Mjolnir around my neck. I would pray rarely mostly when I needed to clear my mind or wanted to help a friend and didn't know how. Only this year have I been praying daily mostly a small prayer for protection and/or strength to Thor. I've even given small offerings to Thor and Freya asking for the health of family members who are struggling. It's been so...freeing. I've never felt such peace and when giving the offerings I've ended with tears in my eyes more often than not. Good tears soul cleansing tears. I always feel peaceful and calm after as if a weight has been lifted off of me. ..I'm rambling and I'm sorry but I can't tell any one. Especially family. They just... They just wouldn't understand.  I just needed to get this off my chest. This is so new to me but I think I'm starting to understand why some people offer prayers to others. Many of my views haven't changed on religion and spirituality but I'm not going to stop either. I hope it's helping others but I know it's helping me so it can't be all bad......Take care SD. Today I'll be going to bed sober.

The Norse gods liked animal sacrifice; I hope you don't take it that far. The neighbors would talk. ;-) ..Glad it helps you!
Thanks for posting  this - developing an openness to spirituality was a challenge for me - but it allowed me to stop worshiping Jim Beam.
I thought I was the only one!  :)
