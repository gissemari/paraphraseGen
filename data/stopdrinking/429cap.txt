The weekend is my struggle.  Day one of the weekend is over.  I just need to get through Saturday and Sunday.  Then I will forget about beer until next Friday when the craving hits again.  I'm going to do it this time.  I've reset my badge way too many times.  Best of luck to all of you resisting as well.

yep! as long as i'm at work m-f i don't have the urge but as soon as the weekend comes around I want to hang out with people at "let loose."  Being an introvert and wanting to be around people using a crutch of alcohol to socialize has been the hardest!
Stay strong! I will not drink with you over the weekend.
