I ran out of my meds early this month and am struggling with coping without them. All I want to do is drink and escape from this pain for a while. I'm just trying to keep myself busy as much as possible to get through the next week. IWNDWY for as long as I can. I really don't want to drink as it will only make my pain worse from being hungover.

Sit down and make a list or journal with reasons why you want/need to stop drinking.  I did that early on and add to it from time to time.  On days that I am struggling I read back through it to strengthen my resolve. ..We can do this!  IWNDWYT 
Hang on! Sending positive thoughts your way!  You can make it through this.  IWNDWYT 
Just remember that things will get better soon. Sometimes it's a real fight but you can defeat this and everything in your life will get better. Just hold on - IWNDWYT
Get outside .. change your environment
