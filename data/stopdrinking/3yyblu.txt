I'm chairing my last meeting for my first year of sobriety. I'm struggling to think of a topic. I've heard lots of newcomers come to these meetings and I'd like to help them with a topic that will help...So what would you like to hear tonight?

Gratitude!!!!
Rule 62
Something that has been on my mind lately and I touched on it in a meeting a couple nights ago is "new year's resolutions vs. one day at a time." I know that I am (and maybe you are too?) prone to wanting to do too much too fast or make big sweeping resolutions... But that usually just ends up making me despondent and distressed when I struggle to make expectations. This is especially true for my sobriety. I'd love to resolve that "I won't drink at all in 2016!" but I'd be willing to bet that at some point the magnitude of being sober for a *whole* year will weigh on me and stress me out. How much easier it is to just focus on each day as they come and only concern myself with staying sober and healthy for that day!
Serenity.
