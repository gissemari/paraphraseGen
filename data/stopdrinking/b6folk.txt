With help from this positive community and keeping my mind on the prize Im 4 months sober and every day gets a bit better than the last. I no longer crave a beer after a difficult day at work. I dont struggle as much to get to sleep. And when the occasional evening anxiety pops up I have other healthier tools to utilize now. .Every morning I wake up and tell myself "this is a new opportunity to improve yourself.".I want everyone to know no matter where you are in your journey you have the power to keep climbing. Im proud of each and every one of you for simply being on this subreddit and IWNDWYT
