I don't know if a lot of people on this sub are gamers but I am.  I wanted to have a bit more fun with sobriety by adding some achievements to it.  I tried to make them as attainable as possible so there won't be anything crazy like not drinking for 10 years.  I thought of a few I would like to accomplish but I added some more for other people.  Some of them might sound weird since they're not directly alcohol-related but might happen since you gave up drinking.  Hope you guys like it!..**Beginner Sobernaut**   Survive 7 days without alcohol...**Apprentice Sobernaut**   Survive 30 days without alcohol...**Oral Sobernaut**   Survive 69 days without alcohol. Hehe...**Skilled Sobernaut**   Survive 90 days without alcohol...**Expert Sobernaut**   Survive 180 days without alcohol...**Master Sobernaut**   Survive 365 days without alcohol...**Dry Cleaner**   Clear your house of alcoholic beverages...**Rejected!**   Politely (or not depending on situation) refuse a drink...**12-Stepper**   Attend any meeting that encourages sobriety. (Doesn't have to be AA or actually 12-step for that matter.  Could be an SD meetup if available.)..**Faux-jito**   Create a delicious mocktail...**Nice Day for a Dry Wedding**   Plan an alcohol-free event. (Doesn't necessarily have to be a wedding.)..**Designated Driver**   Spend a night in the town without a sip...**Tightwad Teetotaler**   Calculate a budget of what would've been spent on alcohol.  It will surprise and/or sadden you...**Sober Spender**   Take the amount of money from previous Achievement.  Buy something with that amount of cash.  You deserve it.  Or save it for something bigger...That was all I could think of for now.  I will say I feel like I'm being a bit hypocritical since I did relapse a few days ago.  Also don't let the Sobernaut achievements get to you.  Just fight one day at a time.

Don't forget the ever-important 24 achievement!! That's a big one!
Make the app! I'd play it! ..I'd want to go for the platinum trophy so I'd really piss off my husband by getting the dry cleaner achievement ;)
I've done all of these (!) except plan an alcohol-free event. And I'm more of a sober saver than a sober spender. But those funds are definitely going to better things now!..My only caution with this list is the Designated Driver one. Spending a night on the town without taking a sip is far too often taken as a "challenge" by people in early sobriety not quite ready for it. They do it as a way to prove something and it doesn't always turn out well.
you might Add:    .Denial Buster level 1  yeah there really is a problem        .DB level 2   moderation is a myth.        .DB level 3  there is more to this than just putting down the drink
.**DAY TRIPPER** - Be a passenger in a car/bus/train/plane for longer than 2 hours without having a drink...**Rememberance Day** - Recall the last thing you said before bed 3 days ago...**Performance Enhancer** - Watch 'The Big Game' without drinking...**Distant Relative** - Attend a family gathering/celebration without drinking..**Music Man** - Attend a concert sober.........
This is hilarious. I love it.
I love this! I used to play a fair bit of WoW(for the horde!!) and part of making my sobriety work for me was doing my version of [dailies](http://imgur.com/5s1giHk). It definitely helped me feel a sense of accomplishment knocking those out and also kept me busy for a part of my day.  .
You've reminded me that I probably owe my current sobriety to gaming! My gaming history shows I did road to platinum in the first couple of months for the Last of Us and then Final Fantasy for the next month. Gaming helped pass the time and keep me sober in those first three months I was sitting on the fence about long-term sobriety; it bought me enough sober time that I could then think with a clearer head and focus on my recovery.
