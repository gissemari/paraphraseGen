I found myself more engage with my girlfriend today because I did not drink yesterday. I got us out of the house early breakfast at our favorite spot and a walk in the park with the pup. She was asking why I was being so feisty. ..It be noted that I hide most of drinking from her. She doesn't know I'm struggling to get better.  ..IWNDWYT

I bet that made her so incredibly happy! Good on you sir. :) IWNDWYT
You might want to consider talking to her about it. I've recently had the talk with my wife and she's super supportive and holding me accountable. This is the first time in years I've made it to 30 days.
