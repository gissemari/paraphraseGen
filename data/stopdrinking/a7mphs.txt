Hey SD...&amp;#x200B;..So the last few times I have stopped drinking I've felt pretty good by this point.  Not sure what's going on but maybe my experience can help someone else or maybe even future me...&amp;#x200B;..I have been drinking on and off this year.  I've had periods of sobriety lasting 2 weeks 1 month and even 3 months.  I feel like I've made some progress but I also feel like the slip ups have gotten worse.  ..&amp;#x200B;..My most recent bellyflop back into drinking began on November 16.  I started with a few beers on Friday night knowing that an old drinking buddy would be back in town on Saturday.  Saturday I drank a couple of beers in the afternoon then a few at the movies with my friend then a few at a restaurant afterwards.  Sunday was a big meetup with a bunch of folks downtown and somehow I managed to keep myself to 4-5 beers total.  However I felt terrible on Monday...&amp;#x200B;..Here's where the real trouble starts.  The old me could've made it through Monday at least until 4 or 5 before cracking a beer to feel better.  However this new guy couldn't wait.  Knowing that a beer or three would crush my hangover I think I cracked one around 1 or 2 PM (I work from home).  This led to me drinking too much on Monday then into Tuesday and even into Wednesday where I had a few before going to Thanksgiving at my (anti-alcohol) parents' house.  Thursday I managed to cut way back to 1-2 drinks.  Friday I think I had a few but nothing major then I was sober Saturday only because I was sick.  I don't really remember a whole lot about the next week.  I think I managed to stick to just a few beers a night from November 25-29.  Then on the 30th I went with a friend to a couple of breweries and then to a dinner party at a friend's house with my wife and 18 month old.  Saturday I felt pretty miserable.  Not really sure what I did that weekend...&amp;#x200B;..Then it gets even worse.  I remember the next week (Dec 3-7) the drinking was starting earlier and earlier.  On Friday I had a beer at around 9 AM.  We had a really awesome party to go to Saturday night and I tried to drink a few beers beforehand to feel better but I just felt terrible the whole time and it really sucked the enjoyment out of it...&amp;#x200B;..Anyway so onto the trouble afterwards.  I stopped drinking cold turkey the day after the party.  Sunday Dec 9 was my first full day sober (after this particularly long bender).  I felt as expected - tired depressed unmotivated.  However I managed to get some things done and it wasn't so bad.  I was pretty tired Monday and Tuesday as well.  The weird thing was thought that even by Wednesday and Thursday (days 4 and 5) I was still feeling rough.  I just assumed that it was because I'd been drinking longer than my normall slip up (normally it's more like 3 days).  On Friday afternoon I was working and was completely overcome with nausea anxiety and weird aches in my abdomen.  I ended up laying on the floor for a while until I felt somewhat normal.  ..&amp;#x200B;..This weird feeling continued into Saturday.  Luckily we had a pretty easy weekend so I took a 2 hour nap Saturday afternoon and felt better afterwards.  Sunday I felt pretty normal and I packed up to go on a 1 night business trip leaving Monday morning.  Monday afternoon I landed in my destination and went to the hotel to drop my stuff and try to work for a bit.  Then the nausea hit again.  I got on SD and tried to read some accounts and best I could tell nausea and loss of appetite (something that had been coming and going) were not good signs at all.  I immediately got an Uber and went to the closest urgent care center.  I have to tell you I was terrified.  I just knew I had gone and ruined my liver.  ..&amp;#x200B;..After nearly an hour I was finally seen by a physician.  I explained how I'd been trying to quit drinking but struggling with it.  I explained this last bender and how I'd been feeling and also explained that I'd been sober 8 full days by that point.  He didn't seem worried which made me feel better.  He looked me over and felt around my liver for swelling and inflammation.  He decided to diagnose me with **constipation**.  I was so embarrassed.  He had me pick up some milk of mangesia on the way back to the hotel.  I did so and...well...I was much lighter a few hours later.  I was able to talk him into running a full lab though and I will hopefully get the results today.  This will show some things I'm interested in such as liver enzyme levels and kidney function.  ..&amp;#x200B;..So maybe I'm a hypochondriac.  That's fine.  I can't explain how terrified I was in the hotel room in the Uber and in the waiting room though.  I was close to having a full blown panic attack.  I thought about all the damage I had done to my liver over the years and thought about how it wasn't worth it.  How it wouldn't be worth putting my wife and kid through hell if I have to go to the hospital because I drank myself to illness and liver failure.  Maybe this was the scare that I needed to take my health seriously.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I felt OK that night and for most of the day Tuesday.  But I'm back home now and I am feeling pretty bad again.  I'm hoping to get those lab results soon.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I listened to about half of Dan Harris's 10% Happier while flying and at the hotel.  He talks about a period in his life where he had flu-like symptoms that wouldn't go away and his shrink diagnosed him with anxiety and depression.  Maybe I have some of that going on?  I just feel empty inside and I can't concentrate.  I have no energy no motivation.  Does anyone else have any experience with these symptoms after 10 days of sobriety?  
----------immediate responses--------

I can definitely relate with this.  I drank beer for about 12 years mostly after work always in bed on time excelled in my career etc.  (I believe the term is "high functioning)  Anyway I quit for Sober September this year and another 10 days.  Felt great.  Figured nothing is wrong with me I'll go back to drinking.  First I just did it on the weekend.  Then on Thursdays.  Then on Wednesdays.  Then one day at work on a Friday around lunch time I started getting wild anxiety and jitters.  I chalked it up to coffee as I had drank two mugs of regular that morning after drinking decaf for 3 months.  ..Friday after work it mostly went away so I drank again.  Saturday I felt ridiculous anxiety as soon as I woke up.  Tried to drive to the supermarket and had to turn back after maybe a thousand feet because I felt like I was going to vomit.  Couldn't even eat.  I struggled through it all the way to Tuesday when I went back to work.  And felt horrible at work only lasted 2 hours.  Was thinking I would have to pull over on the way home I was so anxious...The next day I felt great.  (The day before Thanksgiving).  Worked a 10 hour shift lights out 200% work quality.  Went home celebrated by drinking.  The whole night from beer #1 I felt weird.  Hated being around other drinkers not enjoying any of it. ..Woke up on Thanksgiving day with blinding anxiety.  On that day I figured that this must have caught up with me after 12 years.  Each time I quit for the past few weeks this just got worse and worse.  And that was 27 days ago and I haven't drank since.  The first week was the worst.  Could barely leave the house.  Each day I went a little further to a few more places.  Had a job interview a week and a half after and was convinced I would have to get up and leave in the middle of it but somehow I made it.  I almost cried tears of joy.  Each day since then it has gotten better - to the point now where I function pretty much normally.  I'm eating well again sleeping OK going places whenever I want.  But it will always be in the back of my head.  I never want those feelings ever again.  And I now understand why hard drinkers feel afraid to quit.  I was lucky I didn't end up in a detox facility.  What I went through was mild compared to others...Medically I don't know what happened to me when I woke up that morning.  I consider it to be the beginnings of alcoholism - i.e. I would have had to either start drinking all the time to fix that feeling or it was time to quit.  So I chose the second.  I am assuming it was just mild withdrawal.  Sorry for the long rambling but I pretty much went through exactly what you're going through.  The good news is that I got better and I'm hoping you will too!  I hope it helps to hear somebody explain something similar to what you're dealing with.  IWNDWYT  :)
I have not but I'm sure someone has. Either way I'm here to say I will not drink with you today.
