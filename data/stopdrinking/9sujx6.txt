I almost drank today after 3+ weeks sober despite taking Antabuse. I've taken it in the past and drank a week after with no issues and my last dose was a couple of days ago. I was having dinner with a coworker and asked if they wanted a drink and they said no so I didn't. I recently injured myself a couple of times drinking and had more frequent black outs and embarrassing situations leading to me quitting. My resolve has been so strong even since this morning and I got a little tired and hungry and almost threw it all away. Now I'm scared of actually having a drink next time. Last time I made it more than a few weeks sober I lasted for almost 5 months and relapsed for a year because I was in denial.

They say all you have to do is jump a hurdle once and you have it beat.  We just have a lot of things we have to do once without drinking.  Now you see you CAN go out with a friend and not drink and you're fine- you did it- way to go!!!
Just getting through the smallest event without drinking is huge. To me anyway. Good job! 
May I ask why haven't you taken Antabuse in several days?..You already know it's not an effective deterrent if you don't take it regularly. This isn't your first time on the rodeo. It sounds like your resolve wavered way before you sat down with your colleague ...
There is no denial now...frequent blackouts....embarrassing incidents...play it forward. I will not drink with you today. Hang in there as this too shall pass.
