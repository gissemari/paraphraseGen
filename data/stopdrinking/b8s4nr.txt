I've been having a lot of dreams like this lately and I assume it's a normal part of recovery but how long are they supposed to usually last? I guess one good thing about them is the fact I always feel guilty even in the dream after I "drink" so hopefully that means even my subconscious mind is on my side.

Mine stopped after three months. 
I still occasionally have them 9+ years later. I generally wake up relieved I didn't drink. Or refuse the drink in my dreams. ..We call them freebies lol.
