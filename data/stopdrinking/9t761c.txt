70 days ago I was incredibly sick with withdrawals and in the hospital for the upteenth time this year. My life had become completely horrifying and bleak because of my drinking and depression which I [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/9sjwot/a_day_in_the_life_of_a_nonfunctioning_alcoholic/?st=JNY6YBEY&amp;sh=392ba666) about a few days ago...I'm so happy to have made it out and to have put 70 days together which is the longest I've been sober in my adult life. It feels like an absolute miracle to me. I was in such deep despair a few months ago and it felt like I would never be able to stop drinking or manage my other mental health symptoms...Tonight I walked all around the city on Halloween sober just enjoying being in the crowd and seeing everyone out in their costumes. It's the first time in about as long as I can remember where I felt genuinely at peace. ..Here's my [before](https://imgur.com/a/9k2S51C) and [after](https://imgur.com/a/qlc7KTs) photos from when I was in the hospital to this afternoon walking around on Halloween. ..For everyone out there who is trying to quit keep trying and don't let a relapse erode your faith that things can get better! ..It took me so many tries to get 70 days together and on day 1 I felt like giving up because it seemed impossible. ..But somehow I'm here now! My quality of life has already improved a great deal and I feel curious and excited about the world again for the first time in years. ..Thank you all for the kind words of encouragement and for listening. Sharing my story and hearing yours is helping me stay sober. I am so thankful to feel like I have another shot at life.
