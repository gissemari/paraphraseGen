I had been drinking for a week or two again. Whiskey mostly. I couldn't stomach food or drink any more. I was getting back to that none functioning point. I took a shot last night and immeadatally became sick. I found myself hung over my toilet contemplating how I would be able to drink. How fucking insane is that? I've literally drank myself sick and my mind comes to the conclusion that I'll have to make a mixed drink instead. I'm not sure I can stay sober. I don't know if I'm mentally ill anymore. I've accepted that for me to drink is to die but I'm not sure I'm in control enough to have any say. I've been lying to my sponsor. I'm afraid he will give up on me. It's not my first relaps. He has watched me fall several times. He told me he didn't expect me to stay sober. Idk if that was reverse psychology or honesty. I stopped going to aa 3 days ago because going wile I'm drinking seems pointless.

Get thee to a meeting!! I went to meetings for MONTHS while sneaking the drink on the side. I lied to my sponsor too. Eventually she told me that she couldn't help me and that I needed a higher level of care. After a bad relapse I went to rehab and have been lucky enough not to have picked up a drink since. ..BUT DON'T STOP GOING TO MEETINGS. Hearing the experiences and the message from other alcoholics in recovery is the medicine we all need. Tell the truth about what you are going through and tell the truth about your drinking. You WILL FEEL BETTER and it lets others in the meeting know how to help you. ..Don't give up. Don't ever give up.
I'm sorry you are struggling. ..&gt; When it becomes more difficult to suffer than to change;.&gt; .&gt; We will change.
