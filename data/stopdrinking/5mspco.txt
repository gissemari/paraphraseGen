I've been a bartender for 8 years now and have struggled with alcohol since leaving high school. Its taken me this long to realize it but I'm two quarters away from graduating college and couldn't be more motivated to see a tangible change! After lurking on Reddit for nine months this subreddit inspired me to reach out and tell the world about my internal struggles. No more hiding. No more lies. The time to change is now. Thank you all for sharing your journeys so that I can begin mine..."A Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step" -Confucus

I spent my 20's managing bars nightclubs and restaurants. It's so difficult having alcohol around at every turn. The majority of people I worked with were fine on a day to day basis but were absolute boozehounds socially. ..Good luck and remember we are all here for you. You're worth more than what's in the bottle. 
Welcome! Good to see you here :) .You can do this I am not drinking with you today.
I have tried and failed to stay sober in the industry. Seriously consider a career change if you really want it
Sounds like you have your work cut out for you. Though maybe not. The mid day drunks and regular weekday closers present a pretty strong argument for quitting.
