Moderation does not work for me. Good luck at your session!
Moderation was wishful thinking for me.  Period.  It never lasted and when it  worked I was not happy...This is true for everyone i know who are problem drinkers.  And we all believed the lies we told ourselves
For me moderation was an illusion. Besides what's the point? I drank to get *drunk.* Trying to monitor my consumption was torture. Zero drinks is so much easier.
I spent years trying to moderate before I was truly convinced it wasn't an option for me. As I understand brain chemistry once we've altered that pleasure center in the brain by heavy drinking it's near impossible to go back. 
Thinking I could moderate caused me to relapse. I did 10 weeks sober and lost it cause I was bored. I've come to realize I can't drink. It's all in or all out.
