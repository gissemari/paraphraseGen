I just started seeing an individual therapist who focuses on substance abuse to augment my ongoing group therapy.  One of the first things I mentioned was that I cannot seem to stop relapsing now that I'm out of intensive outpatient where they drug tested and that if I could just have that one component back it would help a lot...She explained that this rather expensive device exists called soberlink (sound like a shill but I'm not aware of another brand).  You can set it up voluntarily.  You pick the times you should be tested and at those times you have two hours to go blow easy to do at home or in bathroom. So I got it and it sends my therapist (and my psychiatrist) a report every day and a weekly report showing if I'm passing. You can have it email anyone you want but for me it would cross boundaries to send to my family. ..I'm really excited about it it was easier than I thought to set up and it just really helps with my fragile battle with  oh I can have one right.   Now I know I can't because I won't pass and that's helpful motivation for me and also reduces the mental strain battling any impulse. I feel like it's extra muscle while I build up my own internal ability and practice to resist temptation. ..Just thought I'd share.
