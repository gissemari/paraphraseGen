Evenings were always when I caved.  A long day at work.  Commuting.  Lines at the grocery store dry cleaners delays that jerk who cut me off  ....Yeah I really felt like a glass of wine to unwind.  But Hey!  I *deserved* it ! I'm successful.   Listen I work hard.  If you had my pressures you'd have a glass of wine probably.  Anyway I'm not hurting **anyone** else am I?  It's not their business.  Just leave me alone for a little while OK? Is that too much to ask!  ..Then invariably several (many?) glasses later into the evening:   Hmmm you know maybe this is too much too often?.........Yeah just take a little break.  That's it!  Take a night off!  OK!  TOMORROW I'm not going to have any wine.  Yes!  TOMORROW NIGHT   No Glass of Wine!   There!  I've decided that tomorrow I'm not going to have any wine.  I've been **Thinking** and I **Feel** like I'm **Motivated**.  Glad I made that decision! ..No one here I bet is surprised:  Tomorrow became Today which became Tonight and  ..yep there's a glass of wine in my hand. ..WoW.  Just WoW!  I cannot Stop.  ..I had certainly **thought** about it; I **felt** like it and I was **motivated**.  I've got *Willpower*...What I finally learned is my Thinking my Feelings and my Motivation all **change**.  They are variable.  .My feelings change regularly.  They are variable thank goodness.  It'd be very bland to feel the same way all the time...I *never* feel the same *all the time*...I regularly see people write  I'm motivated ;  I really FEEL like stopping ;  I have Thought about this ...I don't know how I'll "feel" 10 days from now.  I can't predict that which has so much variation...Stopping Drinking is *Hard*.  Not Drinking is a *Struggle*.    Living Sober is easy.  ..My sobriety is not associated with my feelings.  It's a decision and manifests in my action and behaviors.  It doesn't matter how I felt when I got up this morning. I made a decision to forgo ONE drink today - The First One...If I let my feelings thoughts and motivation drive my choices I am doomed.  At any particular time I may be happy sad depressed ecstatic hopeful despairing excited bored crying tired energized laughing and on and on and on. In an earlier comment u/sunjim stated this well [Stress comes and goes]( https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/54v67m/new_job_dont_feel_the_need_to_drink_anymore/)...Feelings are internal...Decisions that manifest in Action involve physical behavior.  That's external...I decided to forgo alcohol.  I have external behavior associated with that decision.  It won't matter how I feel.  But the key element is that I operationalized that Decision into a Set of Actions.  I got phone numbers of support people.  I went to meetings.  I changed my behaviors.  I altered my patterns.  I created new habits.  I made new friends...When my thoughts feelings motivation and Willpower waver I ACT.  I call someone.  I go to a meeting.  I have a behavior (action) in which I engage irrespective of my feelings.  ..When I see a Red Light on the road I Stop.  Doesn't matter how I feel.  I hard wired that into my behaviors.  Doesn't matter what I think about the red light how I feel about the red light how motivated I am by the red light.  I decided and practiced the behavior of:   See a Red Light? -  Then Stop. ..If I get a craving.  If I feel like a glass of wine.  If my colleagues are motivating me to participate in some drinks.  If my Willpower wavers.  If any of those   I act.  I call see visit go walk drive travel depart.  Verbs.  ..When I obsess about how I feel and what I think I'm living in my head.  When I cogitate and make a decision that becomes action I'm living in my behavior...I can "think about how I feel about digging a garden."..Or.."I can dig a garden."..For me I always remember:..*Thinking Leads to Drinking*...*Behaving Creates Abstaining*...Just for today I forgo ONE drink   The First One..

I love this. Well put. Thanks for posting. 
That old cycle... complete with the 3am regret self hate loathing never doing it again awake time. Followed by the eager lead up to 5pm (for me an appropriate time) then proceed to get smashed... wake up at 3 rinse and repeat. Not anymore. I will not drink today. 
Thinking about it feeling like it and being motivated is really just dreaming about it. When it comes to not drinking Yoda said it. Do or not no trying. Its harsh for me but that's what it takes. Its worth the sober life. Now I won't drink today thanks for the post.
aye my best thinking got me into some pretty tight spots in the bottoms of ditches muddy ditches that really wanted to cave in on me....  not only will I not pick up a drink today I think I'll forgo the shovel too...
Wise words my friend! Once I figured out that I had to **DO** something things started to fall into place. 
Outstanding!  Great post my friend.  ..I'll keep acting my way into better thinking.
Loved your post! For me as well it always boils down to that first drink. If I don't have it everything is fine. It's amazing how I don't miss it or wish I had it. If I do have the first drink there's no predicting how things are going to turn out. My life got scary when I didn't know if the first drink would be it OR I would go off the rails drink to blackout and wake up in a physical and emotional shitstorm. It's become a lot easier to see it as I'm just saying no to "one" drink. I know it's a lot more than that but I'm happy to play this game with myself if it keeps me from drinking :) I will not drink with you and everyone else on SD today!
Thank you for this. 
Nicely expressed. Thanks for this - something to add to my toolbox!
Great post PG I saw something recently that relates to this that said "Reputations aren't built on what you're going to do"...For me it starts with the conscious decision to not pick up that first drink. Building other more productive habits makes the task so much easier...Now I've learnt that it's a case of rinse and repeat and occasionally add something new into the mix to keep boredom at bay...Oops I've just knocked over that first drink. Anyone got any stain remover?...
I love this! I reminds me of some advice I read last week about working out: that fitness isn't about motivation it's about discipline. I think not drinking is the same: you can have all the motivation you want but if you lack self-discipline then you may end up drinking...Discipline is not drinking just for today.
&gt; If I let my feelings thoughts and motivation drive my choices I am doomed...If only I could control this in all aspects of my life.  
I've used the analogy of the pre-shot routine in golf that helps keep the "thinking" out of the equation. I am slowly working in my pre shot routine with regards to sobriety.  Regardless of my emotional state I still have to remain vigilant with my routine to make sure I don't "shank" or "chili dip " or "blade" my sobriety. :)
Great post. I got something out of it. The ol' red light doesn't matter how I feel I still stop. Thanks.
This is brilliant.  Thank you for being you...oh and FTZ
This is so true. I once trained for a marathon and I basically managed it by implementing a 'no excuses' rule. Did I feel like going on every run? Nope. Did I do it anyway? Yup. ..I think the thing that keeps going through my head is 'it's not easy but its simple.' You just don't drink. It's actually mind numbingly simple. ..I will not drink with you today!

This is one of the best posts I've read in a long time PG!    ..Now my thoughts are simply that I am a non-drinker.  In the rare event I get a craving I do something else.  Even if it's telling myself "Hey Self if you really want to drink you can do it tomorrow --just not today."  ...and when 'tomorrow' rolls around I really don't even remember why I was even feeling that way..&gt; Just for today I forgo ONE drink   The First One.
GREAT POST!!!!
Needed this. I've been underemployed lately and newly sober. The strain I put on my relationship while drunk is still fresh and now the pressure of being broke is getting real. Drinking will definitely not help either of those problems. So I'm not drinking today.
Wonderful thank you. 
Hey PG!! Beautifully written as always. ..I think it's critical that we all understand this. While we all may have 'willpower' it's a feeling; feelings change though. It kind of links to the 'intentions are good to have but ACTIONS are necessary' tool...All too often we hear about white-knuckling willpower 'maybe I'll change' etc.. so this really sheds light on a positive way of thinking...Today I will stop at every red light (even though I'm a speed demon) and because I've also hard wired stopping when I see a drink I won't drink today!..You're awesome PG love ya :). 
Changing "I can put it down tomorrow" to "I can pick it up tomorrow" sounds like a simple but game-changing way to subvert the wiring and fight through cravings. Thank you for this post.
Ah yes "tomorrow" the magic word. Used it so many times that I couldn't stand myself anymore. Especially when the "tomorrow" drinking (once it inevitably happened) was not even pleasurable or desired it was just about making me feel better from the night before...Action instead of thinking. Powerful concept thanks so much for the post.
 Awesome post. Thanks so much.  I needed that.
The difference between Not Drinking and Living Sober was huge for me.  I credit AA a lot but I don't attend much at all anymore.  I feel that for me I do better not focusing that I'm not drinking.  ..I have other components of checking in; friends from AA are most of my daily social interactions in life anymore and then I've got places like this as well.  
Great stuff!  A good reminder that I needed right now.  I will not allow my feelings to decide my actions.  I will commit to daily action regardless of my feelings.
Love your post. I kept backsliding nearly always spectacularly because I would play the mind games you cite: I deserve just one 'cause it's been a good(or bad) day(hour week); just one will make me calm down (feel better) ... on ad infinitum. Until I figured out drinking can never be my reward or medicine or comfort-maker and that "just one" is not a real number in my life I never could get away from "Demon Rum"..Now I know better. .Just NONE!
One of the best posts I've read here in awhile. Thank you so much!
Absolutely on point!! 
Great post. Thank you. I am literally on the verge of "caving" but I came here instead. This post is what I needed to here. I think I will just keep reading-- after I take a bath. Man this is so so so much harder than it felt when I made the grand decision "of course I won't drink" and there is absolutely nothing wrong in my life-- it is just that antsy end of the day feeling when I basically am used to tuning myself out. I could go to a meeting tonight-- there is SMART here-- but honestly I am afraid to get in the car....because my go to when I feel like this is the liquor store. I should probably have posted this as a new text-- but I saw your post and felt like it was speaking to me in real time. 
yep..yes. ..thank you
Thanks for taking the time to share this. So much truth.
