For those of you that have tried and fell back but are finally on the right path what changed your mindset this time around that made it "stick"?  I'd love for you all to share and inspire those of us who are struggling to fully commit.

I tried to quit and failed over and over for 2.5 years...I never made it more than 13 days in that time...Several things helped it seemingly click for me this time.  The first understanding I had to make a choice between everything good I could have in my life or drinking.  I'm a runner and drinking took that away.  I had to choose between running and drinking.  ..Running was just the most obvious measure of the effects of my alcoholism. Drinking was damaging my relationships.  I just existed for the bottle.  I wasn't living.  I had to choose between life or drinking.  I've heard a some people say when it comes to a choice between losing something that matters to them and drinking this can help make sobriety click...The second thing that helped was joining a support group.  I started coming to Stop Drinking every day.  I participate by posting when I need to and replying to others posts.  Joining a community whether it is SD AA or SMART makes the difference for many. A community builds a vision for a sober life and creates accountability...The third was mindfulness.  I became aware that my brain said drinking was good but in reality it was a nightmare.  I said over and over  drinking is not as good as I think it is.  I played forward in my mind what would really happen if I drank instead of my idealized version.  Eventually I was able to rewrite some of my thinking on drinking...Finally took it one day at a time. When it's tough I don't think about the rest of my life I just don't drink today...I found freedom and peace in sobriety...Wishing you the best! You can do this. IWNDWYT 
Hey Minha!..I went to detox twice in 2 years. I fell back the first time - hard. Crashing down...The reason? I didn't follow the plan after I was discharged from the hospital...When I left the first detox I felt that I was 'cured' and I simply just couldn't pick up a drink...Well...that didn't go so well. I wound up drinking only a few days after being discharged. I wanted to kick myself! All that time detoxing and I f'd it up by drinking again?!..It took me a whole year to get back into detox. This time I came up with a plan; I committed to follow up doctor's visits counseling meetings SD sober people / sober places eliminated toxic people/places/things from my life read every book I possibly could about addiction helped others to get and stay sober etc.. ..I also stayed on the right path because I didn't ever want to go through detox and kindling ever again. ..Going through DT's hallucinations etc. was there to help this all 'click'. I knew that if I ever drank or had to detox again I probably wouldn't make it out alive...I'm happy to see that you're fully committing! Keep hangin' with us you're doing great my dear :)..
I ended up in the ER and the situation surrounding that was a total embarrassment. I had bad DTs and kept having to go to the bathroom to puke every half hour or so. The horrible anxiety shame and embarrassment of having my boss (pregnant at the time) drive me to the ER because I was so hungover and nauseous knocked something loose. I sat in the ER for five hours while the doctors fed me librium through an IV. I was also going through a divorce and decided the life crisis energy needed to be devoted to a better lifestyle. 
Misery...Unambiguous misery at being a prisoner of my daily habit.
For me it was seeing the lies I was telling myself for what they were...Having all the answers including a strong conviction there was a loophole with my name on it kept me from listening to what others were suggesting...For a long while I saw a drink (or 10) as a "reward" - and justified it and the consequences.   Once I saw that at the lie it was - not drinking got a lot easier...
I almost hit someone in my car. Came-to mid blackout behind the wheel slamming on the breaks with people in front of my car. Scared the shit out of myself. What clicked is drinking is dangerous. It can put you in a place to do incredibly stupid and destructive things. It is the ultimate form if self destruction wreckless-ness and carelessness. When I drink I could care less if I died. Then I'd wake up and see how much of that was only the alcohol working on me. 
It took seeing that alcohol was making every aspect of my life worse. I couldn't lie to myself any longer. ..&amp;#x200B;..Alcohol did not improve my social life. If I ever had that first drink it was "on" and I was consumed with either appearing moderate before others if in a group. \*I\* would not be present in that group. My mind would be consumed with keeping tabs on the level of each person's drink and trying to appear "normal". It was not fun. So I increasing opted to stay home where I could drink in private. ..&amp;#x200B;..Alcohol didn't relax me...there might be that first "ah" but then I woke up nightly in panicked sweat. (And the not-sweating alone is a great reason to quit!)..&amp;#x200B;..Alcohol made me something I detest...a liar - hiding alcohol and making excuses for why I couldn't do this or that. I was choosing solitary drunken misery over people I love...&amp;#x200B;..I was in a foul mood most days because I was so unhappy with who I had become also because I'm sure I was hungover though I'd have denied it (I hydrated So Well. \*eyeroll\*)...&amp;#x200B;..I hated so many aspects of my life but I couldn't move forward when I was drinking myself into oblivion each and every night. I couldn't follow through with goals until I stopped drinking. ..&amp;#x200B;..I could go on but those were the main reasons. ..&amp;#x200B;..I had some false starts but I new I could not live my life the same way and expect change. I had to change my priorities and rework my evenings (my "danger zone') to not drink one day at a time (sometimes one hour one minute at a time).  I needed therapy for my anxiety (which I still encounter but it's so much better). I needed medication but I may not forever. I played it forward constantly "surfed" the urges kept to sober people/sober places and spent a TON of time reading here on SD. I work in a hospital and I regularly where I will be if I go back. It's humbling and reinforces my resolve. 
This is my best attempt yet. While my reason to want to be sober stays the same (anxiety shame blackouts health family etc) the difference this time is truly wrapping my head around One Day at a Time. I used to think it was just some dumb AA catch phrase like a dozen others I'd heard. But once I really sat down to think about what it means and how to apply it I was able to find success. I'd fail in the past because I'd torture myself thinking of all the future days/events/struggles I'd have to get through sober. Now I know when those thoughts pop up that I don't have to be sober at xyz down the road. I just have to be sober today. Let future-me worry about future temptations. I don't have the willpower for the infinite future but I can do today. That has made all the difference.
A lot of different things for me. Truly believing that alcohol was not helping me handle my stress knowing I would lose my kids/spouse if I continued and one of my last drunks I tried to kill myself even though I had not been suicidal prior to getting drunk that day. 
I honestly don't know. I drank on a Wednesday and Thursday and then just stopped. Part of it was that I am having surgery and wanted to quit drinking until my surgery so I would be as healthy as possible.  But then I read This Naked Mind and it opened my eyes to what alcohol was really doing to my depression anxiety and insomnia. My depression and anxiety are virtually gone (either because the alcohol was causing it or because my medications are actually working now) and I don't have to take meds for insomnia anymore. ..But I really didn't have a big epiphany moment. I've been wanting to quit for years and years so it has been building. It is so hard when you have people around you who don't want to lose their  party friend  but I finally said enough's enough. This is the longest I have ever gone without alcohol (pregnancies excluded) and I don't ever want to go back to drinking. 
Winding up in the same space despite my serious intentions to the contrary. I know I have will power. I know I have a functional brain. I know I have a moral compass. After much research more than I wish I needed I concluded the only option was for me to live without alcohol. And I am certainly better for it. By the way just got back from my very first NFL game. Wow that was fun! People drink a lot at these things! I had a funny exchange with a beer vendor. I was passing him in a hallway and he had a cooler of beer sitting at his feet. He looked at me and said "I know you're ready for one!" I just laughed and said "Neither one of us is ready for what would happen if I drank that." He laughed too. Maybe he got it.
My initial plan was to quit for 30 days.  I had tried this countless times and always caved after only a few days in.   What made it click was this time around for the first time ever I realized that living sober while not all puppies and rainbows is actually pretty fucking wonderful.  Life is so much better.  No more morning recriminations no more promises to myself not to to drink today no more breaking that same promise immediately after work or let's be honest sometimes by lunch.  I have to think that SD and This Naked Mind really helped me this time around.  Good luck to you.  
Realizing that alcohol had taken over my entire life. All I thought about was drinking and my next drink and where I'd drink and when and how much and did I have enough to last me and do people notice I'm drunk? Etc etc etc
Thank you so much for asking this...reading the responses has been incredibly helpful!  I feel I'm too new this time around to know if anything has clicked but I'm hopeful.  Just tired of being sick and tired and devoting too much of my life to this poison and want to be the best version of me.  
Drinking has been such an in-grained part of my entire life that the very concept of giving it up forever is outlandish to the point of laughable. ..But ultimately it's my happiness and well-being that's at stake. This was pretty much the last card I had to left play to try and right my ship. Essentially an act of desperation.  ..I know that the changes I need to make have to be permanent. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out that an alcohol-soaked brain isn't making things better. Getting to a place where I knew beyond a doubt that I had to stop completely then stepping up and actually doing it -- the brute force method -- that's what clicked for me. ..Now I guess I'll wait and see what lies ahead. 
I saw someone I love and care about very much slip deeply into alcoholism. Something I never really suspected. I saw how much it pained her family. Her son and I have been together for over 20 years. We have a child. I saw how awkward and uncomfortable we all were with her and how helpless we all felt in wanting to do something. I saw the misery and pain it causes. I saw the frustration concern and anger her actions caused. I saw her isolate herself and miss out on holidays and family and her grandchildren. I felt all of these things. I realized that I was causing the same feelings in those that love me. I was a hypocrite...All of that plus the accumulation of a personal past that included 2 DUI's court ordered rehab jail time bodily injury horrendous and dangerous behavior and fear for my health clicked one morning when I was woke up not looking forward to the inevitable misery of detoxing. I had already read books gone to AA and done a lot of work to be a better person and live life fully. (again a hypocrite) So the ground work was there. I never planned a day or set a goal. I just knew I needed to get through the current detox I was suffering. I found this sub that day bought the necessary vitamins and supplements to ease my journey (found this info in one of the books I read) and here I am...Everyone knows someone that is suffering from alcohol abuse. I just didn't want to be that someone anymore.
Pretty new here (thus the no flair) but I used to drink to escape and have fun. I started realizing that I wasn't having any fun because of the alcohol and that drinking almost always ended with a side of suicidal ideation. I didn't like what it was doing to me. It isn't the first time I've tried to stop but it's definitely the longest so far - 3 weeks :)
My motivation was all wrong the first time. There wasn't anything that I **wanted** there was just a boatload of shit that I **didn't** want. ..I **didn't** want to be hungover every morning...I **didn't** want to keep making an ass of myself because I used drinking as an excuse to say stupid shit. ..I **didn't** want people's perception of me to be that I was just a drunk. ..Honestly it's the last one that I clung to so heavily. For years I surrounded myself with people whose actions and choices were similar to mine; there was no judgment because we were swimming in the same sea of bullshit. Wake up and immediately hit the bar for day drinking? At least two or three friends would be there doing the same thing. Get plastered and shoot off a bunch of messages and phone calls? I could laugh about it with my friends the next day because "we'd all been there before". Fall in to the black hole of self loathing hide away in my apartment for days with nothing but a bottle or two of whiskey? No one would miss me and no one would think anything was abnormal about it. ..For the last year though through my workplaces I've been slowly surrounded by recovering addicts and people who are 'sober' because they never had a problem to begin with. The fact that my behavior wasn't normal and okay slowly became more and more apparent and instead of my drunk actions just being waved away with understanding they were judged - and harshly. People were holding me accountable for being a drunk piece of shit and I felt like a piece of shit. ..I failed pretty hard the first time around because my only motivation was to **stop** being a piece of shit. ..Eliminating the bad is obviously a goal in the process of getting sober - the whole point is eliminating the drink from your life. But what clicked for me was when I started striving for things that I **wanted**. Everything before was just tied to becoming someone other people would respect and not judge and that meant dropping all the behaviors that made me an asshole. ..I guess what I'm trying to say is that it "clicked" when I stopped striving to eliminate my faults and started moving forward with adding positive things. I stopped focusing on abstaining from poor behavior and instead on enjoying every little thing that was becoming possible through sobriety. ..I failed when my only goal was to stop being the person I was. I've been succeeding now that my goal is to enjoy being the person I'm becoming. ..And it's worth mentioning that hating yourself does you no fucking favors. That was a huge roadblock the first time around. So much anger and loathing and disappointment - all completely directed at myself. If you're here in this realm of recovery it's because you fucked up - there's no denying it. Maybe you fucked up big time or maybe you just slowly whittled your own self away drink by drink like I did but one way or another you fucked up. There's just no god damn point in wallowing in the misery of it. You deserve to move forward with hope not regret. You deserve to be the person you're working on becoming. ..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT.
I finally let go of the idea that alcohol could every exist in my life in a healthy way...Before this my other attempts were made out of feeling like I had to prove that I wasn't dependent on alcohol just so I could bring it back into my life. This time I did it with the intention of fully admitting that I was dependent on alcohol. It was true that I had dodged a lot of bullets and also true that my drinking had continued to escalate over the years. Somewhere in the back of my head I knew I was going to have to stop at some point but I always pushed it off. Like I was waiting for something truly terrible to happen to be my "Aha" moment. Then I finally asked myself "How much are you willing to lose to continue drinking?" I honestly answered "nothing." I dont want to lose a damn thing. So I quit.
There is a blog by Laura McKowen and the post is called The Tipping Point. I read it over and over and over. She talks about what finally made it stick for her. Google it
High blood pressure. I kept telling myself that it's something I just have after having my daughter 5 years ago and brushed it off. Every time I stopped drinking in the past it went down to normal within 2 weeks but I just ignored it because wine was more important and I didn't feel any different from when my preasure was high so why bother right? Almost 3 weeks ago I started feeling like shit at work I could barely lift my arms to type and everything on the computer screen was swimming around and out of focus. I drove home early and decided to measure my blood pressure just in case. I was at 179/95. I'm 30 it's too early for me to have health issues like that. I really hope this time around my sobriety will stick. That feeling of my body not being able to perform basic things that I wanted it too scred me more than anything. ..And on top of that I just want to look good again like I did at 21. I want my husband to look at me like he used to when we first met. I invested the money I saved on booze ito healthier food and skin care products. I'm not going to the gym quite yet because every time I did when I got sober before I burnt myself out really quick so I'm trying to take it slow and take time to adjust to a new life style. 
My biggest issue was that I always held out this idea that one year was enough or 3 or even 10 or "when my kid is out of the house" or "when I retire" then I could have another.  Having that thought always led to it growing as time went on and creeping back into a rationalization that "well I've made it far enough time to drink."  I really did have to come to terms with the absolute fact that drinking really isn't something I can do responsibly and that won't change.  One-day-at-a-time works Okay in the right mind set but it also wasn't enough for me I did actually have to realize it's forever and I'm good with that - great actually.
I hit my bottom. No amount of self will reading books (could never get into this naked mind) encouragement from family/friends even this sub could keep me sober. I hit my bottom admitted I was powerless over alcohol and crawled into my 1st AA meeting. ..Now I have a sober tool chest I get into all day every day! And life is different. That is good because for me to drink is to die...Prior to my bottom the longest I got was 63 days and it was a living hell on earth. Inevitably that voice of what I know alcohol does TO me got replaced by what alcohol can do FOR me and I would cave. Only to get caught in that insane cycle...Thank God the cycle is broken and I feel free!..IWNDWYT    ..
