I had my first vivid drinking dream last night. The circumstance was predictable  for me - airline travel with delays - a situation that absolutely would have been an easy excuse for a cocktail (or 4). ..What I find amazing about the dream is the visceral feeling of shame that I experienced while still asleep. I resigned myself to the relapse and decided there was nothing else to do but let it happen and so kept looking for the next drink. ..I see this as a huge reminder to stay vigilant and know there is something that can be done. So happy to be awake and feeling good with no hangover! ..I will not drink with you today!

Congrats on 127 days!..I think you'll love this piece about [drinking dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_does_anyone_else_have_dreams_about_drinking.3F) ;).
I had one last week and woke up with a heavy heart crying myself awake.  Stay vigilant   is right. IWNDWYT
I had a bad drinking dream last night too! Was drinking a handle of cheapo vodka straight out of the bottle. Missed my classes and a big audition I had gotten for a job that shoots in Prague. Holy SHIT but I was relieved when I woke up. But what you say is so true for me too that the feeling of *knowing* that hits you while still in the dream that feeling of shame is SO strong. And the feeling of relief when you wake up! Whew! That feeling alone reinforces why I'm continuing on this path. So sometimes though they suck I think of drinking dreams as a little hidden gift. 
I commented about this on a different post a couple of weeks ago. The dream shame is real! But at least we don't have to deal with it in the waking world! Keep it up. IWNDWYT
I had constant drinking dreams when I first stopped and didn't understand why they bothered some people so much. Then after not having one for months I had one recently and it seriously affected me and made me feel guilty for some reason. I definitely found it useful to understand how I would feel about myself if I decided to take a drink for real though!
