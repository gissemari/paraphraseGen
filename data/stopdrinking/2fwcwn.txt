I very recently went on a binge after a couple of months sober. My wife neighbors and friends all look at me differently. That's a terrible feeling especially when mixed with the guilt of a full on relapse. Just wanted to vent. Onward and upward. This sub has helped in ways that group therapy couldn't. Time to stop lurking and be honest with myself and all you strangers out there. I'm very glad this sub exists!

Relapses get worst - that was the case in my experience.  I have had 4 major one and I'm trying all new ways to ensure I don't fall into the trap...I know you can do this! Make a plan. Make sure it's different than the one you tried last time around..Best of luck!
Welcome back!
what are you going to do differently this time?
That's the thing I have the most difficulty with as well.
