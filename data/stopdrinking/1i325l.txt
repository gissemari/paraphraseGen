I'm dealing with the just consequences of my drinking days. I had a bunch of parking tickets and i didn't pay them and because I didn't pay them in a timely manner my car got booted. It's abotu to be towed cuz I didn't have all the moneys that they wanted. ..I also have some other issues with the car that need to be fixed which are due to me texting and driving. *word to the wise: don't text and drive*. ..Also I relapsed and i didn't want to say a damn thing about it because I just wanted to get that magical 30 days coin and somehow that would keep me sober even tho i wasn't sober. So i lied about it to my friends and sponsor. ..My sponsor is none to thrilled with me. my friends are beign very distant. And it makes me very sad...I don't do sad i don't do feelings. All i want to do is drink or use drugs. but if i do that my friends will remain very distant and even just straight up not be friends with me. I don't have many friends. So the 2 friends i do have are like my bestest friends in the world. They are both in recovery so I see why they'd be like this it's understandable...I've taken to engaging in self-destructive non-substance related behavior to deal with my emotional pain. It's probably not the healthiest thing but I just don't want to drink/use drugs and I honestly dont' care that i'll have to deal with the consequences of that behavior. ..Hopefully this story stops someone else from drinking and ruining their lives.

Thanks for sharing this.  I've been white knuckling a bit lately and this was helpful.  I'm glad you're on day 2.
Learn from your mistakes  and get back in the saddle.  It ain't easy but it is doable. Do not drink or drug today and you have a chance!
what exactly do you mean by 'self-destructive non-substance related behaviour'...?
