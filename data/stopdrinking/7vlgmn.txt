I am a 30 year old American and have one day sober. I have known since I was a teenager that I had a problem with alcohol. Last year and a half things have gotten progressively worse binges got longer and time between binges got shorter. Finally this past weekend (3 day binge which feels like a bad dream) I felt like I was going to die and I was having anxiety panic attacks. I feel like for the last 10 years of my life I have part of me that has wanted to quit drinking and another part that is obsessed with the idea of drinking nonalcoholically- fixing myself and having a normal relationship w booze. A big part of that is my girlfriend of five years who has tried everything to help me drink like a normal person. Several weeks ago my luck finally ran out she asked me to move out. Without her as a safety net I'm really worried about where my drinking might lead...Life as I have been living it is completely unsustainable and I will end up losing my job and everything else even my life. I am still struggling with anxiety and an overwhelming sense of dread and morbid thinking. I'm terrified of sharing in meetings but have been going to AA on and off for years. I know that these are just words on the Internet but it feels good to just send this little SOS out to let people know that I am done with drinking and I want a better life for myself. I recently asked a guy I know from AA to be my sponsor and we are meeting tomorrow.

Congratulations on taking a big step. Asking for a sponsor is huge. You sound like you are motivated by good reasons to stay sober. Try not to think too much about the future. Just focus on today this moment. Be patient with yourself and those around you. 24 hours at a time. You can do it. IWNDWYT
Your words are read in the other side of the planet fellow human. I see good decisions and totally support you. Iwnwyt
