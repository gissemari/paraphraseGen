I just heard my friend had heart failure but he is doing okay but will need a lot of medication and help in the coming months. He is 40!! .Anyway he is going to be okay. However I was shocked at the news and had a mix of emotions all within ten minutes. Firstly he is 40!  I know know that we are not bulletproof anymore. This is going to sound selfish but I feel less alone knowing we all have struggles. It's really around 40 the cracks can show and there really is no shame!! I think that alcohol may be a big factor in my friends illness. Now there will be two of us not drinking lol!! However I have struggled for some years now but now in recovery I hope that I can help him and others which is an amazing feeling!! Sorry so many thoughts and emotions right now I just had to post

I find motivation not to drink literally everywhere I look these days.  I hope your friend decides to join you in recovery.
