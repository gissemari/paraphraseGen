That is so wonderful! I'm happy for you. 60 is a big deal.  You should be proud.  IWNDWYT 
You should feel great!  I am looking forward to hitting the 60 day mark
Yes! It is all part of the recovery process. 60 days was my "wall" a few times. Safe to say I made it through too. IWNDWYT
Heck yeah! Good job!!!
WOW! Sixty is GREAT!!! Wishing you many more - one day at a time. I will not drink with you today.
\o/! Woohoo!  IWNDWYT 
Extremely well done - cheers (with a Coconut La Croix)!
Yes!  Nice job!  You're on a roll.  
Awesome job!  IWNDWYT!
That is something special!  What made the difference for you this time?
Congrats on your shiny #2 Star!  Have a great weekend and IWNDWYT!
Nobody's ever broke out of prison with a wrecking ball. Keep chipping away!
