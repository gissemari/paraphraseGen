Wow. A full week?! It sounds lame because who cares what a week? But we all know how it truly feels. It feels LIBERATING! Before this I hadn't made it more than 2-3 days since December- and in December I only made it 3 weeks! I bought myself a new book today at Half Priced Books about forming habits for success (will have to look and see what the title actually is and add it in LOL) and some really nice smelling perfume from Bath and Body Works. I'm finding I am rewarding myself without food or alcohol but with things like getting my nails done or books etc. It is nice to finally love yourself enough to be kind to yourself and take care of yourself. I am hopeful to see what the future holds. I also connected with two girls from my middle school years who are both in AA and we have stayed in touch/live in the same city. One has 10 months sober already under her belt! It sounds odd but it always feels comforting to know other women my age with young children have struggled as well- I'm not some flawed young mother who is a total mess up (what I always called myself before- even at times considering offing myself to allow my family a 'better life'- I'm so glad I came on here and you guys gave me my wake up call and supported me fiercely!) thank you all for playing such a huge role in this and I promise I will not drink with you today!!!!!

Congrats on a week! I'll not drink with you on this sweltering Sunday. Well except lots of diet ginger ale and Lacroix to stay hydrated..
Congrats and I'm right behind you :)
Wow.  I'm glad you found us.  Congrats on a week.  I won't drink with you today.
One Week is HUGE!  Congrats!!  When I first came here I saw people with 30 60 90+ days which seemed nearly impossible at the time; yet here I am with 680 and still going strong One Day at a Time. You're doing Great so keep it up.  Your children will appreciate your added attention and better mood!!
