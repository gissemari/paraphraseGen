My issue is more of a problem stopping at one drink rather than alcohol dependence but it's enough that I've decided I need to stop all together. I poured all my wine down the kitchen sink and have since been turning to ice cream at the end of long days instead of a drink. This is all easy enough but tonight will be the real test going to my favorite restaraunt that serves my favorite margaritas and friends who will wonder why I'm not drinking because they know I love to. But I will. not. drink..This may seem tiny compared to some struggles here but if I can do it this feels like it will be a big mile stone. When drinking is so ingrained in your social life it feels more weird to not drink than to get sloppy drunk over dinner. But I will do it.

The world tested me enough in early recovery. I didn't put myself in any situations involving alcohol for the first 5 months...Let us know how it goes. Sometimes people feel that they can get through the evening fine but the cravings hit hard the next day along with thoughts of "Well if I can watch others drink moderately maybe I can drink moderately"..
You can do it. I am with you on day 5.
That's my specific drinking problem too is that I can have just one - one will turn into six before I know it. You can do this I'm in your corner!
