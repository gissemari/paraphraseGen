Hi All..You may not know me as I certainly have not been the most active but I've been here.. just watching listening reflecting.. I've made it a year. Something I have come close to before yet ultimately fallen. I don't have any great stories or any spectacular epiphanies but I'm here... ..Honestly I don't know how my life would be if I hadn't quit. I was a mess before still am. Struggling with life's decisions still am. Yet as I write this it's a beautiful winter morning outside my fixer home is moving along I just might have found an actual career and even someone who enjoys my company and doesn't mind I don't drink....Please know how much this community means to so many people active or not subscribing or not. This journey can be such a terrifying painful beautiful inspiring process and for me... this was an amazing place to find.  Thank You.

Congrats on the One Year! That is inspirational and amazing! 
Wonderful! I am a lurker and a non-drinker (not by deliberation or effort just don't really drink). As always I hope my POV is welcome. ..I lost someone a very young (28m) very close to me from alcoholism about 2 years ago. Watching a man put his son in the ground was harrowing beyond words. He was that young and managed to drink himself literally to death. So I come here to understand the addiction and hurdles that you all face. Because I don't struggle to not drink I can't fully understand it but I *do* understand alcohol's prevalence in the media and social events and parenting and hobbies and free-time. It's every. fucking. where...Keep it up! I won't drink with you today! Here is to clear mornings! 
Great! Congrats and keep going. For me no spectacular stories too. Life got a bit easier and nicer. 
Your sober life sounds absolutely lovely. Congratulations on your year :)
