"maybe you should take it easy/cut down/take a break" from the sauce...I've lurked on here posted a few times had a badge reset my badge drank moderately got hammered once recently so I am in absolutely no position (I feel) to judge or give advise BUT...I watched my friend turn from fabulous and passionate into a passing out wonky eyed spilling drooling stumbling into furniture into people shouting at people shouting at the taxi driver and being a general mess...I literally poured him into a taxi as he was cursing and lying down on the back seat...I'd met him after work for a "two pint maximum" as he had to be on a building sight at 0730 and I up at 0530...So I get there a cold pint waiting and my friend glad to see me so we could spill the beans on our latest escapades...Half an hour later he's slurring after that he's just pure fucked up...Two pints turned into shots because black sambuca was available then it was mojito's...I had maybe...2.5 pints three of the shots and a mojito the other 1.5 pints and 2 mojitos were sloppily sipped and spilled on his jeans...I had to guide him round the pub avoiding furniture he tried to steal a pillow struggled to get him out the door pass a baby without knocking over whoever was holding it hold him open taxi throw in taxi shout address and wish god's speed...I had missed my train so sat and sipped the beer which I ended up leaving most of along with the mojitos but I was tipsy as hell...My sister insisted she pick me up I was going to cycle probably a good thing because I fell asleep on the train for a bit...But the thing is seeing my friend in that state knowing I'd been that guy that mess that liability was horrible...Not the hangovers not the shame not the constant stomach pain or bad decisions...but seeing him.  ..Have you ever watched David Hasselhoff drunk eat his burger?..I don't know what the hell my badge says but day one is today...That was a really upsetting situation and I had to do the pep talk/give it a rest/you weren't that bad/don't let the doom set it...Serious role reversal...Fuck.  That.  ..A good time was ruined in an hour.
