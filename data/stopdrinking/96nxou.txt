  I still can't believe I'm waking up sober EVERY morning! My mind is clear my memory is much better I look better I went to Zumba yesterday I've lost weight and reached my goal I have a lot more energy I'm sleeping a full eight hours every night and don't struggle to get out of bed in the mornings I'm saving money and my children are happy! ..Apart from my relationship with my husband (that's on another forum) life couldn't be better!..IWNDWYT
