Hi all!..This is a bit of a weird one ... looking to share my story and possibly find similar stories! ..I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for around 5 years and have often used alcohol to self-medicate. I am a nightmare when drunk and feel awful the next day. I have been trying to cut down for a while now which has largely worked (e.g not drinking M-Th but still getting smashed on weekends) but I am realising now that stopping drinking permanently really is the only option for me. ..I was feeling depressed a few months ago and I upped my SSRI (sertraline) from 75mg to 100mg which made me feel much better! Then a lot of positive life changes happened all at once (broke up with a toxic bf started enjoying my work a lot more took better care of myself found an amazing new bf) ... all was well for a while and I felt calm and peaceful! Didn't feel the need to drink so much and drank in moderation not going overboard...But then BOOM - somehow all the elements combined and a few weeks ago I entered a hypomanic (verging on manic) spree ... spent loads of money was prancing around full of energy needed very little sleep or food acted inconsiderately was suddenly being super sassy at work and drank A LOT   one day I even completely missed work because I overslept after drinking almost a whole bottle of tequila ... yikes. ..This felt like quite a step back with my drinking problems ... although I have largely learn to manage my depression and anxiety over the years I have never really experienced mania before (I have never been diagnosed as bipolar and I do think it is the SSRI's that have tipped me into this state!) so this seems like an entirely new beast!..Since then I have met with my doctor who agreed I should cut the sertraline back down to 75mgs ... They also advised that I should stop drinking urgently for at least three months ... given my history I am very much considering turning this into forever - hence why I am here! ..I stopped drinking on Sunday so I am on Day 3 ... Here's to hoping the mania subsides AND that the depression/anxiety doesn't come back with a vengeance ... fingers crossed!!!   ..Has anyone here got any insight or experience with SSRI's and Mania in relation to drinking? I am super happy to be part of this community - thank you for welcoming me back!..Many thanks.Chloe .#IWNDWYT..

Unless you've been diagnosed with actual bipolar disorder with mania or hypomania them it isn't mania or hypomania. You saw your doctor and he clearly didn't so that's that. Self diagnosing yourself with manic depression gives doctors a lot of laughs.
I don't have experience with this exactly but I do know about drinking to self-medicate for depression. Despite the initial burst of feeling good that I got from my first couple of drinks drinking really was making my depression much worse. It also prevented my antidepressants from working properly. I feel much better with sustained sobriety although there were a couple of ups and downs in the first couple of months as I stabilized...I found it *hard* to go more than a couple of days at a time without drinking and it took a *huge* amount of effort to go a month. Until I got support on here I wasn't able to stay sober for longer than a month. And until I got support in real life I wasn't able to get more than two months sober. On my own I find it very easy to slip back into thinking that getting intoxicated is a solution to how I feel and not a huge problem.
