Here I am again puking down the drain blood shot eyes n feeling like crap.  After almost 3 weeks of not drinking.  I really hate this feeling.  Don't know why I do this.  Shit.  I feel embarrassed.  Ai this definitely isn't for me.  Four glasses of whiskey n I feel like crap.  I'm listening to you body..I'm taking this as a learning curve but I really had enough.  I've realized watching soccer triggers me to drink I have to step away from it.  I'm so sick right now but yet there's that voice in my head saying buy the last beer man the last cigarette after that we done.  I'm just really looking forward to a sober morning n eating some really nice food when this feeling goes away. .Day 1 tmro.

Been there I'm day 4 AGAIN but I'm working my sobriety now aa meeting as many as I could get all day everyday and meditating refuge recovery just keeping myself busy and around people like me right now...
Glad u are here and welcome back! We are strong together.
Oh yeah it sucks. That was me 2 weeks ago..The thing is you came here told us and by doing that you are picking yourself up drink lots of water and starting over again.
