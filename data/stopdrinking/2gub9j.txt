Y'all all know I relapsed a few times. I nearly did this summer again. But I recently got a new sponsor and connected with her like I haven't with someone yet. I connected with myself. I'm starting to hear the words again. I'm listening...I used to think the key to sobriety was to have a list of things that kept me sober. "Running keeps me sober if I drink I can't run." Well... it's easy to throw away a day of running for a beer. "I almost have 90 days I don't wanna pick up a white chip because I don't want to mess up my count and admit that I messed up and start over." Well.. it's also super easy to throw away a number for a drink. "I don't want to have to tell my friends I messed up." *Well* it's also really easy to think that you're going to be able to hide one day of drinking from your sober friends and then three months down the road be asking for help because you can't stop. It's easy to throw every single reason for staying sober away when the drink becomes more important...The truth is the day *IS* going to come again when I am going to have to face the decision of whether or not I'm going to pick up that drink and no matter how long my list of things that "should have kept me sober" is I will lose. Alcohol is "cunning baffling" meaning... I'm always going to lose if I choose to fight. I will *never* have enough armor I will *never* be strong enough or fast enough or smart enough. So I've come to the realization for myself that the list doesn't really matter. The list actually isn't a list of things that are going to *keep* me sober but a list of things that I *get to have* because I'm sober. When I pick up my six month chip it's not another reason to not pick up a drink it's just proof that I can make it six months if I do this whole sober thing one day at a time...So when that day comes I won't need a list of reasons why I shouldn't because all those reasons don't matter. I'll just know that in reality I don't have to fight the battle because I can choose not to. If I'm gripping sobriety I'll eventually slip but if I *let go* of alcohol then I'm free from it. ..And that's what admitting I'm powerless over alcohol has done for me.

Good job!
&gt;If I'm gripping sobriety I'll eventually slip but if I let go of alcohol then I'm free from it...I love this line. Great post!
beautifully said!  
I could not have said this better.  Wow super post /u/WineWednesday -- this is truly the point--I am not going drink TODAY is a decision that I make each morning which is not contingent on pros or cons.  Good on you and your sponsor.  
My first step keeps me sober everyday. A thorough first step is my safeguard.
