Posting a little early for Sunday Solutions..I shared this video on /r/videos last month.  [Eric & Peety - A Short Film](https://youtu.be/Rm0qYRWQpZI)..In the film Eric was struggling with being overweight.  This video spoke to me because I am overweight mostly because of heavy drinking.  I really identified with how lost he felt in his own life how he realized he wasn't living up to his own potential and was also inspired  by how he tackled his own shortcomings.  ..I think watching this video was one of the things that made me realize I needed to stop drinking two weeks ago.  I am currently in the process of finding a shelter dog for our family and I want to live a more healthy lifestyle like Eric...I thought Eric & Peety's story might be a good fit to share here.  It was certainly helpful to me.  Maybe it will be helpful to you.  I will not drink with you today...
