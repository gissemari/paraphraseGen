So long my little star. I've relapsed today. It was not much (like a half shot of Quantro) I'm not drunk at all but I failed at my sobriety. I had a very nice day today but I'm still affected by the recent family death. I cried when I saw a homeless person laying on the sidewalk. Wanted to help him (he was half-naked and it is so cold this night) but got scared - such a chicken! I feel heartbroken. I hope you can forgive me and take me back SD...

Welcome back!
Welcome back!! You are in the right place. You go at your own pace and we are here the whole way!!
You made it back. That's great! And you stopped drinking -- you're in the right place!..Next up: work on forgiving yourself...You're not alone! Be good to you
My lovely! I'm so glad you are back. 
Welcome back!
Rare is the person who does not stumble on any type of journey much less one as difficult as this...I'm proud to be here with you.
Always. That's why this community is here. We will always have your back. Sobriety is a journey. I don't think anyone just wakes up one day and stops drinking for the rest of their lives. Well maybe someone has but I don't think they're on this reddit. Let's not drink together the rest of the evening or tomorrow. .
Way to come back and not turn a half shot into a bender! 
Welcome back!
