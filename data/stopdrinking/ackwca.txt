Happy new year everyone ..Well I am afraid to say that this new years eve I made the decision to drink. In 2018 I spent most of the year sober. I had a slip in March then again in October and now its seems that every couple of weeks I succumb to the invasive thoughts I get of having a drink...It's the same routine every time. I drink I feel like shit for a few days maybe I'll attend an aa meeting or two but once I begin feeling better I get lazy and feel like in I  control until yet again the inevitable happens...I think my biggest issue is finding another aa sponsor this is what helped me most and after moving back in the summer it only took a month or two for me to divert back to the drink...Does anyone else get anxious asking someone to sponsor them? I feel wierd just going into a single meeting and asking someone on the spot for help... even though I know I need it...Lately I've been going to a meeting and then just feeling better and not coming back again to the same meeting after relapsing because honestly I just feel embarassed...Anyone else ever feel like this? I'm wondering what the best thing for me to do to get a temporary sponsor would be because I'm also just kind of anxious and have a hard time talking to people....Anyway thanks for reading and I won't be drinking with you today.

Thank you for sharing IWNDWYT
I have a similar story. I was the most sober I have ever been in my life in 2018. Then I lapsed in March and September that led to lapsing more often flighting the urge less and pretty just drinking because it was convenient for me. The thing is I went to meetings didn't have a sponsor but I had this place SD is my main support. I came back here and admitted to everyone what had happened yes it was embarassing but it was the step I needed to make to stay sober. I know I can't do this on my own and I need my support system it seems like that is AA for you. I would suggest being honest. I see it as embarassing/shame&gt;drinking.  Easy part is we have done it before so we know what works. Just like you know what you need. Accountability. Go get it :)
