Hi i was thinking that maybe when i have cravings. is that a good idea? personally don't like to smoke that much only when i was drunk. i was sober for a year then i relapse in the exact day of the "anniversary" i relapse 2 time in a monthe since then. the craving are getting stronger each relapse and i don't want to relapse again. i was drinking a lot of red bull when i was sober but that's kind of expensive for me. maybe cigarettes and redbull? what do you guys thinks? ..thanks for the help.

I would stay away from the smokes because you enjoyed them more when you were drinking. It could just make your cravings stronger. As far as the Red Bull goes my doctor just told me I needed to stay away from it bc it was elevating bad things in my blood counts. I would also think the combo may make you jittery. As far as what to do instead? I don't have a good answer but I would consider other options. 
Cigarettes kill. Eat something sweet. That's what helped me with cravings. I also got help. A therapist and AA gave me the tools I needed to stay sober.
Alcohol metabolizes into sugar. I never have liked chocolate much but I can't stop eating it and drinking Pepsi.
