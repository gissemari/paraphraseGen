Hi All!..I have been a lurker for a long time here (probably about a year) going off and on trying to stay sober for longer than a week; now I feel like these stories that I have read from everyone has become apart of my own story and I wanted to share this. I'm not a big social media poster and as proud as I am with this achievement; facebook twitter and Instagram just feels less genuine than this subreddit. Initially there were weeks before this one-month of sobriety that I would stop for a few days and then tell myself "One six-pack won't kill you go ahead and reward yourself it's the weekend!". Rationalizing my self-limiting to only beer or only on the weekends wasn't enough and I couldn't hide my constant drinking anymore as it started to affect my work-life and relationships with friends. ..About a month ago my roommate pulled me aside and told me a story about his brother and his daily drinking how it was in addition to job-hunting gaming too much etc. and it really hit me that I wasn't as healthy as I could be. I really want to be my best self and my thoughts were that beer would help give me that release of happiness to wash away the day. 2 years of a six-pack of craft beer because I thought drinking 'the good stuff' was not what an alcoholic would do. Wrong was I in so many ways. Reading so many of these stories throughout this month has had a profound effect on me and made me realize that I am not alone in my struggles with alcohol and the day to day without it. I truly am blessed that I found this sub and that everyone here shares their stories of sobriety from day 1 to day 2000+. I hope to get there some day and I want to continue this journey in the brightest light that I can with eyes wide open. ..No matter where you are on your journey without alcohol know that there are those that support you in ways that you can't imagine. ..IWNDWYT.
