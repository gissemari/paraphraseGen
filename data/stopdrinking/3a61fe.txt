I have not made it past 20 days sober in the last 20 years (the 20 days was yet another attempt last year). Three days sober was a 'good week'... yikes. And TODAY hits 100 days SOBER!!! Those roller coaster years are in the past and I have looooved being sober! Those still struggling you have your own choice to make and I'm joining to help that choice to be a bit easier for you. Everyone needs support this group is full of support and I'd like to help. Thanks for being there to help me! And yes I am bragging 100 days sober feels AWESOME!
