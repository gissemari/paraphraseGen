Guess what day it is!!!!!!..The week's half over.  Time to share you triumphs and struggles...**Triumph**: I'm continuing to play good tennis.  My wife and I are getting along as well as ever and we're managing the new puppy as well as can be expected.  My knee is feeling better too though I'm keeping the doctor's appointment I have next week...**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: My match got rained out last night.  I hope I get to play tonight.  Boo storms! 
----------immediate responses--------

Dang sorry to hear about your match getting rained out. I know how that feels! Boo!  .  .**Triumph:** I've improved more in the last year than I have in the last 6 years (in many areas). I can notice the difference and it weighs out all the negative that has occurred over the same stretch of time.  .**Struggle:** I have other issues aside from drinking I've discovered I need to fix. I've started the process but it's a long one and it's not always easy. I can't have the 'fuck it' attitude anymore and that's what is the hardest for me to overcome when I'm at my weakest.  .**General Chat:** I've been doing a lot more vegan baking and it makes me happy. Now I'm craving home-made pizza.
Triumph: standing in for my boss at work. Getting in on what's up Wednesday before it's all over. Pats self on back. ..Struggles: big weekend and  lots of partying at work last week left me a little raw. ..GC: it's Spring! Strawberries are back!  
Triumph: no pain! I actually feel better now than I did entering my second trimester one last infusion today for my anemia. TMI but I was also able to resolve the lactation issue within a week (that pain is no joke guys)..Struggle: knowing that my daughter is probably going to be starting her life in San Diego soon we don't know the date but I suspect it will be in the next 5-7 days. I'll leave it at that so my iPad doesn't short out from being cried on...General chat: huge shout out to all of the amazing support here. You guys are truly amazing. Never have I witnessed so many perfect strangers there in a others hour of need how freely everyone here gives of them self is truly remarkable. I'm a much better person now than I was when I found this sub in late March or early April...I'm the crazy atheist who posts scripture every once in a while but Matthew 7:7&amp;8 has been very profound for me especially in the last month. ..7"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you. 8"For everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened.
/u/JimBeamsHusband Pics of the new puppy please..**Triumph**: Baby soon. Wife is showing all the signs of imminent labor. ..**Struggle**: Trying to paint the dresser was a nightmare. Sister-in-law is going to come do it for us. I am not nearly craftsy enough. ..**General Chat**: Lost over 20 lbs my fitness pal has told me i need to cut an additional 110 calories a day. There goes ice cream :(
**Triumph:**  Second sober birthday today!!  Feels amazing.  Best gift I got today is my life.  My daughter told me "Well you're not *quite* middle-aged yet". (I'm 44...I like that number!)..**Struggle:**:  Hmmm....thinking about my future and what it holds.  It's not really a struggle per se more of desire for something more than I am able to have right now.  I'm patient though.  ..**General Chat:**  One of my co-workers just walked by my office looking quite well so this will work for general chat.  5 weeks ago we had a welfare check done on him after not showing up for work for days.  I knew he was an alcoholic because well....we just kinda know don't we?  Anyways my boss asked me to talk to him and share my story which I did along with another co-worker.  Of course I got the "no way" from him when I told him (because I don't look like the stereotypical alcoholic &lt;insert eye roll&gt; and am successful in my career).  It was a good talk.  My other co-worker offered to go with him to an AA meeting which he has not done to date.  BUT he told me yesterday that he had 5 weeks yesterday so that was awesome. 
Triumph: my doctor was impressed with my progress with the Sinclair method today.  And I'm feeling better emotionally.  ..Struggle: I weigh more than I ever have and my blood pressure is not where it should be.  ..General chat: I'm going to see a concert Friday! 
*Triumph*: second sober vacation of the summer. I feel so blessed to have a family member in recovery who helps me when the drinking starts going. And also just going on vacation twice this summer!..*Struggle*: still unemployed and have a move coming up this weekend. Moving away from my SO to pursue a stronger job market. Trying to find my spot in helping my parents deal with my addict sister who is in relapse...*General Chat*: made some kick ass grilled steak and chicken a couple days ago. I need to get a charcoal grill at my new place. I'm reverting to my caveman self!
Triumph: I woke up with a clear head and I'm still sober..Struggle: Being slightly anxious all day at work and couldn't shake it..General Chat: Did an Insanity DVD workout this evening &amp; it was awesome!
Triumph: Enjoyed close to a week with friends here at our little getaway in Chincoteague. Cooked lots of excellent food played board games and Mario Kart 8 kayaked and enjoyed beautiful beach weather. Our friends have returned to DC and my husband and I are staying here an extra few days to enjoy the quiet. It's a pretty ideal vacation...Struggle: My iron is in the tank. Real bad. TSAT level is only 3% so I'm pretty exhausted. But I finally found a new hematologist got an appointment and hopefully can get an infusion treatment soon. It is frustrating that I cannot resolve it with pills or a high iron diet but I am grateful for healthcare coverage that will allow me to get the treatment I need...General chat: Got offered two new permanent classes for the fall so I am excited to start planning classes and meeting new students. Sharing yoga with others really really makes me feel happy and fulfilled. 
Triumph: Blood results from first post-quit physical came back today and I'm in great shape somehow miraculously in spite of all the shit I put my body through. So I can breathe a huge sigh of relief that my liver doesn't seem to need to be replaced. ..Struggle: I do kind of miss the childish "fuck responsibility in getting drunk!" rush. Not so much that I actually WANT to get drunk but leaving work today I did have that moment of "woo-hoo I'm free to drink!!...oh wait I guess I'll just go home and eat some salad." ..General chat: A neighbor is moving cross-country and might sell me his $1300 treadmill for $200! I totally want a treadmill so I don't have to drive to the gym before work every day. And I've saved more than $200 by not drinking at this point so....
Triumph:pink cloud round 2 or maybe my brain is starting to behave itself.  For a couple weeks I was a fucking bastard.  Lazy and just super irritable but lately I have been feeling what I can only describe as NORMAL. Whatever it is i'm loving it and if being sober makes this happen count me in...Struggle: Job money weight...General Chat: Anybody in a similar boat as me? I haven't been to a dentist in more than 15 years and i'm pretty stressed out about it.  I know I need to go for my health and I suppose I won't know what I need done until I go.

**Triumph:** My new job in the kitchen is going far better than I expected. Tomorrow's my third day and I've already got the hang of what I'm doing. Sure it's stressful at busy times and very very sweaty but for once I actually enjoy what I'm doing. I hated being a janitor I hated manual labor for twelve hours a day even though I loved the work and I even hated selling drugs regardless of how little effort that took. For once I'm actually looking forward to going to work tomorrow. And I'm not drinking today which is always a triumph in my book!..**Struggle:** I've got twenty damn pages of tax forms and whatnot to fill out before I go in tomorrow and my employers have a photo ID of me on file from seven years ago. Talk about embarrassing. Other than that I've got nothin'...**General Chat:** Found out from a flyer posted outside the restaurant that a musician (Lydia Lunch) I used to love I suppose still do but haven't listened to regularly in years is playing a venue down the street from work on my birthday. Sure that may be three months away but I'm super excited for that!
Triumph: Almost 100 days sober. Can't remember ever having felt this normal healthy and content...Struggle: Learning new techniques on guitar. A good struggle :)..General Chat: Planning to play my guitar at an open mic show with my friend. We're going to cover "Magic Man" by heart!
