So I bought the book - Rational Recovery: The New Cure for Substance Addiction and am reading it. ..I'm currently at the end of my 4th day sober. .This time with relative ease by using the RR techniques. ..I've tried AA rehab therapy etc etc over the years and really struggled. ..This time I am full of hope faith in myself and a sense of liberation. Feel great! :)

"We thought we could ..find an easier softer way. But we could not."  I read that somewhere and this alcoholic decided to embrace the longest running  most successful program around.    But honestly  just like there's more than one way to skin a cat .there are more ways to stay sober.  Whatever works for you great and I support you in your quest towards sobriety.   I will not drink with you today.
