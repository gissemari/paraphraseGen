I woke up fifteen minutes ago and I already find myself feeling annoyed by small things (I have to go to the store to get filtered water for my f***in' coffee! What an outrage!) In some ways it's like going through the process of detoxing all over again. Well okay -- it's much easier this time but you know what I mean. I'm not feeling like my sober self...I am also annoyed that I finally decided to go to AA but when I double-checked the day and time of the meeting in my town it's right around the time of the weekly video conference I am required to attend. I live in the middle of nowhere so the closest is at an even *smaller* town 30 miles from here at 8PM on another night. I'll have to risk it...Well one day at a time right? I think before I have my coffee some yoga would be wise. ttfn

Congratulations on 4 new days.  Our lives are filled with suffering.  We get sick.  We grow old.  We see the people we love the most succumb to death.  and sometimes...we have to leave our homes to purchase filtered water...* Imagine that you don't have indoor plumbing and you have to travel to a well to get water every time you need it...* Imagine you suffer from a madness and the closest form of relief is a 30 minute drive **every** day...* Imagine that yoga is the medication you take in the meantime.
