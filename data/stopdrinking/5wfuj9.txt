Hi guys ..I've just recently hit 100 days sober and i'm truly not dealing. ..my original goal was to reach 90 days sober which i've now exceeded. i was going to rehab but quit because i felt as though my therapist wasn't listening to me and it only made me feel bad about sobriety not good. ..i'm feeling despondent and depressed. it's still hard being triggered by alcohol being saturated into life/society. ..i feel as though i've gained very little out of sobriety and i'm resentful. i guess the honeymoon phase is over. ..i'm in australia and i've been thinking of going to AA but i'm scared. ..i fantasise abt drinking constantly....i want to get black out drunk for 3 days straight. the thoughts are so intrusive and obsessive i feel like it's the only thing i talk about. ..has anyone else gone through this? ..i'm feeling really alone. ..K.

'ello mate!  I'm actually visiting your fine country this week.  Every time I get a strong pull to drink again I do two things.  First I ask myself what's driving me to want it. Is there something going on in my life that makes me want to escape?  If so that's probably something that I need to address.  Knowing your issues is half the battle.  Second I play the proverbial tape forward to imagine how things would work out if I did get drunk.  How would that feel?  How would it help me with whatever is bothering me.  I've reached for the bottle enough times in my life to realize that the relief is offers is a like.  So I say FTZ (fuck the zero - days of sobriety).  I've gone through hell and high water to get where I am today.  I still have suck-ass days but I absolutely believe that they'd be worse if I tried to drink my way through them...The sun is down here in Sydney let's both just find a good pillow and put this day behind us sober.  We can deal with tomorrow when we wake up - without a damn hangover to make things worse.  Eh?
Glad you're here.  Sorry to hear about your struggles.  ..Congratulations on over 100 days !!..I learned that the voice in my head **wants me to drink** for its own purposes.  Alcohol has a plan:  *Destroy my relationships Ruin my life and Kill Me*.   Sometimes the order varies...The voice in my head *resists* my attempts to stop drinking and learn to live Unimpaired.  It whispers to me sometimes it screams at me. It convinces me to do things that are not in my best interest.  It does it with some slick and manipulative schemes and strategies. One of the things that helped me was to notice the *words* and *descriptions* my mind tells me because my mind *Lies* to me...Lies such as "it's OK to have one what can one hurt?";  and "You know you promised yourself yesterday that tomorrow you would stop and now it's *Today* **But** since X and Y and Z happened you're justified in having one today.  You can stop tomorrow";  and more and more........One of the things my mind uses in creating falsehoods is the word "Feel".  .."To Feel" is related to my sensation of touch.  And therefore if I "can feel" something it is tangible and real.  I can "feel" the table; I can "feel" the fabric of the couch; I can "feel" the fur on my dog as I pet him........In your post you've got "feel" present in six instances.  Assigning the proxy of a "tangible and real" thing to something in my head is a lie my mind tells me.  When I assign "feel" to something it's REAL it's BIG it is TANGIBLE and not easily altered or dismissed.  I can't "dismiss" the table without considerable effort...But I realize my mind employs "feel" when the more accurate descriptor is "think".  These are thoughts and not actually real and tangible items.  My mind is lying to me...I discovered why:  A "real" thing (something I can feel) is hard and actually exists.  A "Thought" is ephemeral.  A "thought" can be changed in an instant without effort without cost.....  I don't have to "give anything up" to create replace substitute or dismiss a thought.  No one can *observe* me creating nor destroying a thought.  ..Just for fun if so inclined look at your post and replace the word "feel" with "think"...You write:..&gt;i felt as though my therapist wasn't listening to me and it only made me feel bad about sobriety not good...What if instead it read "I **thought** my therapist wasn't listening to me and it only made me question how I **think** about sobriety"...I can immediately change how I think about my therapist.  I can't immediately change my sense of touch.  ..From over here I read that the lies convinced you to halt therapy and rehab.  The very tools and resources that support many people in healing...... your mind lied to you and got you to stop using them.  ..I got support tools resources and fellowship at meetings to kill that little lying voice in my head...I've never been happier!
When I'm really wanting to drink I stop and ask myself "how will I feel if I drink in an hour? Tomorrow morning? The day after that?" And the answer is always the same. No matter how bad things are drinking will always make them worse. I'm going through some depression and plateau of my own in sobriety and while I know I don't have all the answers just yet I know for a fact that drinking them away like I used to will never make me happy will never make my life feel whole. Just take it one day and one drink at a time. I won't drink with you today. 
It sounds to me that because your original goal was 90 days sober and then by the sounds of it to drink again your having a constant fight with yourself. ..I had exactly the same thing 7 years ago when I last managed to stay sober...I had wanted to give up for lent and by an amazing miracle I did it I was feeling so good that I knew I should just keep going but that was not my original aim I didn't feel ready for 'forever' because I hadn't got my head round it I managed a couple more hellish weeks and then drank controlled for about a week then straight back to old habits of large amounts everyday. I got to about 70 days and had never been able to get a day without alcohol again until now...I feel different this time as I started off differently I think. I know I cannot moderate I know I wanted to stop forever because it was killing me....but forever doesn't frighten me because I only have today I'm just one day at a time. And this time I'm not battling as hard...I think AA is worth a try you may have to try and change your mindset you feel like the deal was 90 days that's why I think you're so resentful. 
something crucial in getting into sobriety is this: you need to get new hobbies or lifestyles or habits to replace the old. so you used to drink a lot. if you simple just STOPPED drinking now you have an empty gap. you have nothing. and you're just gonna be thinking and comtemplating about what you used to do..in sobriety you should be always self improving and gaining new activities to fill in the time. take a cooking class. start going to the gym get a trainer. go hiking. do art. do reading. take online classes. idk  you gotta do something. ..just quiting drinking isn't enough. you need to be occupying that time with stuff. i'm in school. so time that i may have previously spent drunk is now spent doing a little more studying. or maybe reading for leisure which is something i forgot about
Hi HazyKatie The number one agitator for me in my life is my mind. If I start thinking things are a certain way I begin to think about my thoughts and its not long before my hair is on fire. For me much of sobriety has been about the long game or moreover what I do as rote everyday to get through the day. When I stack up actions my thoughts tend to stay focussed on the tasks at hand. One of the actions I try to take on a regular basis is meditation. By meditating I am taking time to intentionally slow my thought process. When I do that I am in a better position to objectify a thought or place it outside my self. For instance I am thinking about drinking. I am having a thought about drinking. It is a thought it is ONLY a thought. I had a thought before this one I will have a thought after this one. I will let this thought go. Action has kept me sober. The more actions I can take that don't require thought the more likely I am to 1. Achieve and 2. Train myself to use my mind for problem solving only. Some days we just need to grab our asses and hold on for dear life. I find that having a daily schedule of the mundane and following it gives me a quiter mind and more peaceful existence. 
I had a big problem when I hit my initial goal of spending 30 days sober because I'd done it. ..My reaction was "So what?" (and lied by telling myself that nothing was better/had changed) and then "So now what?" (thinking clearly I can't be sober forever so I might as well give up)/..It was an empty day...And those thoughts are similar in feeling to the ones I had when I was still drinking (eg. you don't have a "problem" you're fine to keep drinking)...The hardest part of getting to my initial goal was that it made me realize that my battle isn't to stop drinking my battle is to stop wanting to drink...That's much harder and much more important...Since the day I reached my goal I have been free to drink. I have chosen not to. I have wanted to drink many many times and it would have been very easy to drink because I didn't have any promise or vow keeping me from drinking...The days after the goal have been the real work. The days after the goal have also given me the best reward...After a lot of those tough days I'm still not drinking. Today I feel less inclined to drink than ever before...The most important thing I've learned is that I can only control one moment. I choose not to drink in this moment. Then hopefully I choose not to drink in the next moment...If I stay with that I'm ok...Then I turn around and notice the want to drink is dissipating. I notice that I've been sober for days and weeks and (recently) months...Reaching 60 days became another goal for me. But now that goal is done. I don't have one and for this moment I'm sober.
I hope you can get through this. I gave in to the desire to drink and I regret it so much. I admire you so much for getting as far as you have without feeling all the highs that some people do to help them keep going. It might be a silly question but have you seen your GP about treatment options for depression?..Any way just want you to know that I am thinking of you and I won't drink with you X
Hi.  I find it helpful to write out why I quit drinking when I start to lose my path.  I also read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/) for a reminder of why I can never go back to those ways.  ..What made you decide to quite drinking?
I had the obsession you describe when I quit smoking cigarettes.  I did whatever I had to do.  Like take a shower take a walk  do a cheer clean the toilet wash the dishes.  The key is an action step.  Shift your attention.  It works!  I won't drink with you today on the other side of the world.
