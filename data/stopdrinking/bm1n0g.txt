*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one  thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**..I'm pledging myself to not drinking today no matter what  happens good or bad and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)  and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and  feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long  time and want to inspire others...It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours let's not drink alcohol!..**This pledge is a statement of intent.**..Today we don't set out trying not to drink we make a conscious  decision not to drink. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be  hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet  only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the  right mindset!..What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) we're not ready to give up...**What this is:**..A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next  24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a  pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you  do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning...**What this isn't:**..A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek  advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in  your own thread...This post goes up at:..- US Night/Early Morning.- Europe Morning.- Asia and Australia Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...----..Good morning everyone!..Wow - I was absolutely blown away by all of your responses yesterday. I had a crazy busy day so I didn't get much chance to reply but if you're out there know that your check-ins and self-care tips brought a smile to my face and kept me going! To all that checked in with their Day 1s yesterday - welcome and keep up the fight one day at a time :)..On Wednesdays my husband &amp; I normally have dinner with some friends who live nearby. It's frequently on occasion where everyone else busts out their beers and wines and spirits. In my early days of sobriety I struggled to find good alternatives to drinking alcohol which left me feeling glum...Since then I've been expanding my range a lot - it turns out there's so many incredibly tasty options out there! Last week we went out and I had a wonderful fruit &amp; vanilla soda and at home I have a whole bunch of flavoured waters non-alcoholic kombuchas &amp; teas mocktails and soft drinks. And whilst it's not for everyone there's also NA Beers and even NA Spirits out there!..So sobernaughts - what's your alcohol-free drink of choice these days?..I Will Not Drink With You Today!
----------immediate responses--------

Morning from the UK!..Great to see you Bone  . I don't really drink anything special really- I'm more of a diet coke girl. I don't mind sparkling water or the odd herbal tea. I don't drink tea or coffee either...Looks miserable out there today- I can hear the rain. It's my day off today but I might spend some time in bed reading. It's lovely to have choices  ..I will not drink with you today  
Oh yay I'm first! Haha - not drinking with you today day three and out shopping with my sister and then taking my niece and nephews to the zoo - would be at home getting drunk and watching tv by now for the past four years at least.
I will not drink with you today   
Good morning SD! I still love my sparkling water with ice and a slice of lemon. Thank you for hosting Bone! I hope you have a nice dinner tonight. Enjoy! IWNDWYT
I made it!! It's nighttime here but I made it through my first day and I'm going to bed sober and relieved. Looking forward to not drinking with all of you tomorrow :)
Morning /r/stopdrinking and happy Wednesday to all y'all! Today is the weekly deadline day at work so I'm going to be spending a lot of it in a state of mild panic. But after that I've got a fairly relaxing rest of the week - *and* I'm making soup tonight with somebody. What times!..Have a great day everybody - IWNDWYT!
Good morning from the UK! This is my day three and the mornings are so much better already! IWNDWYT!
I have such an urge today to tell people that I don t drink and that it s not as easy as they d think and that I m really proud of it but it would be a weird thing to do to coworkers and random strangers. So hey my friends - I don t drink it s not always easy and I m really proud of it!
Good morning.  Day 3 for me.  Enjoying a cup of coffee. IWNDWYT
No booze today!
IWNDWYT
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
I've posted about my depression recently.  Yesterday was a better day.  And I'm still sober. I will not drink with you today!
Yes I found interesting replacements key. I do apple and soda green tea / sencha kombucha and have lately got onto roasted barley tea chilled. Rich and buttery before or with a meal. IWNDWYT
good evening from australia :) not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today   
Day 39 IWNDWYT
Good morning friends. As per usual: I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
Day 10! Feels good to be yourself. IWNDWYT!
Day 7 here. IWNDWYT.
Good night here from Canada! It's 12:43am and I'm lying in bed wide awake and don't see myself sleeping anytime soon. The good news? I'm not passing out drunk! I'd take this any day/night. Hope everyone has a great day/night and IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
Day #6 I will not drink today!
IWNDWYT
2weeks. I will not drink today.
Lots of coke zeros does the trick for me! IWNDWYT friends  
First check in in a while! Hello SD Community. 3 days of newly committed sobriety. I'm excited because I know how good it feels to be sober. Having a break for 77 days (which was my actual longest streak) changed everything for me...IWNDWYT
Yep... another one!  Another perfect day not to be drinking  
Winding down my trip to Spain. 2 more days left! IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
No drinking today.
I will not drink with you today.
I'm not drinking with you all today! Enjoying completing 23 weeks of sobriety. When I was just getting sober my therapist had some tiny new kittens who happened to be just as old as my sobriety - about 2 weeks when I first saw them. I casually remarked that they're as old as my sobriety then privately made a note to be cautious... kittens die all the time! I shouldn't associate my personal growth with these fragile creatures! But then a month or so ago feeling steadier I mentioned it to my therapist. She laughed and said they're doing very healthy and thriving in their new homes. ..So yay for the 23-week-old kittens.
Going to enjoy yet another day of freedom from the prison that prison I commited myself to so many years ago. A day at a time and today I am FREE. No drinks with you today Peace
IWNDWYT. Getting tired of lemon and ginger tea. Trying not to have sugary drinks so bought some Nexba lemon sparkling infusion. Nice for a change. Have Kombucha every now and again but nervous of the very small alcohol content. Also looking for new bevs. Night all from Aus.  
I'm not drinking today! I'll be enjoying my non alcoholic drinks of choice coffee water and seltzer. I've recently added a cup of almond milk with cinnamon or sleepy time tea some nights before bed but generally I only ever drink those three things.
I will not drink with you all today
I will not drink today.
Light Cranberry Juice &amp; Club Soda! Works at home works if I'm out! Thank you for hosting u/BoneConsultancy! **IWNDWYT!!!**
But drinking!
My fave NA beverages are definitely fizzy water kombucha ginger beer and Fentimen's rose lemonade. Both the ginger beer and rose lemonade I treat like soda so I have them usually at the weekends as a treat. Irony is not lost on me that I can rationalize soda as "bad" b/c of the sugar and regulate drinking it as opposed to alcohol which yeah the regulation/moderation thing was never a thing ;)..Anywho I'm just checkin in to say I'm not drinking with you today. Hope today treats you right and if not I hope you at least treat yourselves right &lt;3
No drinking here - lots of water though. I like seltzer....and coffee. Just been getting in to tea lately I do enjoy that as well - some of the names along are psychologically helpful - "Cup of Calm" - no clue it it really does have a calming influence but in my mind it does!
I will not drink with you today. My drink as of late is ice cold sparkling mineral water mixed with a little limeade. So delicious.
Had plans to meet a good friend today and was nervous because I knew we'd drink... we always drink. Plans changed and I was disappointed yet relieved because I will NOT drink alcohol today.
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today! Mostly I drink green tea or water. I quit coffee last November. It sounds boring but I'm fine with boring these days :)
I will not be drinking today
not drinking today
It must be four weeks yesterday or today anyway IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today.
Can't believe I'm a mere 2 weeks away from one year sober. Never thought this was possible. I underestimated myself (I'm pleased to say). IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today
No drinking today
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
after drinking everyday for months straight how can I get a streak going again? The first few days/nights not drinking are the hardest for me. How can I beat the anxiety and dull feeling that comes when I come home from work at night with no booze?
Charcoal grilled pork ribs is what's on the menu for later today and glad to say I'll be much better able to enjoy every savory morsel with my taste buds and brain not corrupted by poison.
I will not drink with you all today...Being sober is really working for me this time around.  It makes everything better.   Even so the cravings are still there.  I feel stressed at work and have to catch myself saying "this is really mild 1st-world stress it's really just the addiction probing my defenses."..Not today.  Just for today.
I will not drink with you all today
Iwndwyt aa then counseling then aa then starting to meditate again
I'm not going to drink alcohol today
Palindrome! IWNDWT!
Count me in :)
Uni means coffee - and loads of it - on the two days I go to campus. And what's not to love about the ole sparkly water with a squeeze or lime or lemon at the end of the day. STILL works the magic for me! Yet another day behind me with no booze another night happening with no booze and I will not be drinking with y'all tomorrow either :)
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT   
I will not drink with you today.
I made it through day one and here I am in day two. I have a plan to get through my witching hours of 6pm to 10pm. So I am hopeful and determined to check in here again tomorrow on day 3!
I will not drink with you today in PA!
Thank you. IWNDWYT
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!
IWNDWYT
Hope everyone has a blessed day. Day 624 for me. Blessings to all.
Hump the day!  I will not drink with you today.
Woke up to a storm and no power so my morning is wonky but I'll just go to work with no make up grab some crappy gas station coffee and own the day anyway. I will not drink with all of you today!
Good morning! I've been up since 0200 because the weather has been insane! ..I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT
Today i will not drink. I am having a very hard time staying positive lately but I'm going to stay sober. See you tomorrow.
I will not drink today.
Will not drink today.
Ok slowly building momentum.  Adding the days  one at a time.  IWNDWYT.
I now drink tons of herbal tea and La Croix.  I cut way down on my coffee consumption since I now seem to be extra sensitive to caffeine.  Kind of boring but I am totally fine with boring! Thank you for hosting and IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today.  ..I have dinner double date tonight and I just won't drink.  It's getting easier to do that.  A while ago I would stress and have to come up with a plan of what to tell them.  Or I wouldn't make plans.  Now I'm looking forward to seeing them and to the evening.
Hey SD happy Wednesday. Hope everyone has/had a good one and IWNDWYT  
IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
YAy sunny day iwndwyt
Last beach day in Florida until we head back to upstate NY. Topo Chico on the beach for me. Stay strong everyone! IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Good morning SD!..Today is a day I'll be around boozy people.  But I am loved and supported there so I know I can do it.  I'll bring my sobriety helpers....watermelon Perrier and iced coffee and I will enjoy my day...I won't drink with anyone today.
IWNDWYT
Good morning stopdrinking IWNDWYT
I will not drink today
I try to stick with the three essentials: water coffee tea. When my wife and I go out to dinner a nice hot herbal tea is usually my go to beverage now. If anyone out there is having a little anxiety or just having trouble relaxing I recommend Celestial Tension Tamer herbal tea. Works like a charm for me...I will not drink (alcohol) with you today  
I will not drink today.
Good Morning SD I will not drink w/you today.
There are a couple left over root beers someone left in the fridge @ work. They look similar to beer bottles but pack a load of sugar instead of alcohol. Good/bad
Just for today I'm not drinking.
I will not drink with you today!
Flavored seltzer is my drink of choice these days. I love the Bubly brand they have so many good flavors that actually have well FLAVOR! Sometimes I'll jazz up a lime seltzer with either a fresh squeezed lime or a splash of cranberry juice. I've also gotten back into teas. I ordered a few delicious flavors from The Republic of Tea that I currently rotate during the day at work..IWNDWYT!
No drinking here today!
I will not drink today!
Coffee..and too much of it lol! When I am coffee'd out I drink water. Water was my alcohol replacement the first couple of months and I drank probably 150+ ounces a day just trying to rehydrate my body and flush out the other crap. ..I will not drink with you all today!!
Good morning! San Pellegrino. I buy it by the case at Costco and drink gallons of it! I also love Topo Chico but it's harder to find in my neck of the woods and more expensive.
Beautiful spring day in Toronto and I've made a decision not to drink today no matter what happens. IWNDWYT :)
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
Iwndwyt.
I will not drink today!
I've been on a horrible drinking spree finally had the courage to quit again two days ago requested a badge reset... standing in line to vote with a toe from hell (gout). I don't know how to fix my life but I don't think that is how. I guess I can try do do things a bit different. Haven't been to work in weeks either. I feel like shit. Iwndwyt
I am in it for another day. I will stay free from alcohol today.
I will not drink with you today on this second sober sunny spring day. Avoiding drama and the 19th hole.
Good morning from Canada SD. I  like mixing a fruit juice with sparkling water.I just ran out of my own apple juice so mostly it's whatever is handy. I also bought a tea press  for loose leaf teas.There are lots of loose teas both herbal and real teas try. I also grow a bit of my own chamomile and it's great for that. .I will not drink with you today  
Good morning! IWNDWYT! Happy Wednesday everyone!
Iwndwyt   
I love Polar seltzer; it comes in a ton of awesome flavors like triple berry cranberry clementine pomegranate and cherry etc. I'm also a big tea fanatic. I especially enjoy spiced chai varieties. And since you're never too old to be a kid I occasionally enjoy a tall chocolate milk; it's like dessert in a glass as one of my college friends (from back when I did my first degree ending in 2003) used to say!..Be good to yourselves and each other today.  :-)  IWNDWYT!
Today is my day 2. Physically I feel better but mentally I have anxiety and guilt over where I've gotten myself to. I know with each day it will get better one day at a time. I choose life; will not drink with you today.
Liverpool are into the Champions League final again! Sadly things didn't go well in Kyiv and I gave into my craving for alcohol for that final (after 148 days of sobriety). This time though I'll be sober - no relapses here! IWNDWYT!
Three weeks complete! Very proud.  I won't drink today!
I haven't checked in here for a long time but I'm still not drinking and I'm not drinking today. Been fantasizing about drinking beer lately especially with my 40th bday coming up this weekend a trip to Colorado this weekend to visit all my best friends and my old band and playing golf today which I haven't done in 6 years or so.
Today I woke up and immediately started crying. Wtf? This is the worst I've felt in weeks. I want to stay in bed all day I feel incredibly sad. I still will not drink.
Good morning everyone IWNDWYT!
Today I'll be in the car for over 12 hours with some coworkers for a round trip new business pitch. This should be an easy day not to drink but I know we'll stop at a restaurant on the way home and everyone will have drinks to celebrate our hard work. At least one of the folks there I know will try to pressure me to have a drink. That being said I feel confident in my resolve and IWNDWYT!
Day 4!
IWNDWYT  
Wanting a drink is the very reason I will not have a drink.  Not today.
No drink for me  
Today is sunny in the evening I will be attending an AA meeting in prison as a volunteer.  In the meantime I will take the dog into the woods do some stuff in the garden and work on my latest writing projects... Life is good.
Good morning from California!  I am closing in on my first 100 days!  Coffee in the morning lacroix or bubly in the afternoon.  Hot herbal tea at night.  I have seltzer's and mixers I'll play around with when it gets warmer.  Dear friends of SD IWNDWYT    Gigi
Work stress has gone through the roof and I cane very close to stopping at the liquor store on the drive home. But I didn't. Instead I drank three or four cans of off-brand La Croix went for a walk played video games and did all I could to distract myself. And here I am on day five. IWNDWYT.
Iwndwyt!
not drinking
One of my friends was leaving the city yesterday. Went to the bar to say goodbye. Had 2 sodas instead of beer. Did feel anxious for a while but then realized that i was there having a social life and not drinking. ..Today is day 3! IWNDWYT
At home I have a variety of flavored sparkling waters. Black Cherry is my favorite and Cherry Lime very close! Don't know who in this area is buying up all the Black Cherry but if it's war you want it's war you get!     IWNDWYT!
Woohoo   88 days!
IWNDWYT!
Fizzy water with splash of pomegranate juice and ginger juice. Squeeze of lime. IWNDWYT
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  Comrade Bone coffee coffee and more coffee!  Vigilance!  IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today y'all. Nervous about a gathering tonight that is centered around tacos and margaritas but there will be no alcohol in mine. Happy Wednesday! And thanks for all the sober drink suggestions already coming through.
IWNDWYT
IWND  WYT.
BOOOOOOOOOM LET'S DO THIS!!!
Iwndwyt
It might be challenging for me but IWNDWYT. ..I'm volunteering at an open bar fundraiser where alcohol will be extremely accessible. After the executive director wants to take the volunteers out for drinks. I think I'll pass on that one and just head home.
Crossed another difficult hurdle last night. Played cards with a bunch of friends and managed to not drink. Normally I always do at these gatherings. I brought some grapefruit sparkling water and just drank that. If I could do that I should be able to make it through any situation. I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today.
I have not been here in a while but I found my longest stretches without alcohol have been when I came here and checked in. I'm ready to try again. Bring it on day 1! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
I will not drink today!
I won't drink today!
I will remain sober with you wonderful people today - Wednesday May 8 2019.
Good morning BC and Happy Wednesday everyone! IWNDWYT...My choice of drinks lately are kombucha tea mixed with LaCroix... enjoy all the LaCroix flavors but lately it's been coconut and tangerine. I also like herbal tea in the evenings.
I will not drink with you today. It feels good to type it in. Today the acronym makes it too easy too convenient not committing enough. Today I want it spelled out. So I'll write it again. I will not drink with you today. I will not drink with you today. I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
I won't drink today!
I will not drink today.
Another day another battle. I don't want to drink but I sometimes get bad cravings. Both my physical and mental health has improved so much since I quit. I don't want to go back to the deadly lifestyle of getting drunk daily. IWNDWYT
Its a beautiful day today and I was able to walk this morning before work.  .. Now Im enjoying a lovely cup of Nepal black tea before I face down my procrastination gene which seems to be super-induced...IWND  WYT
Day 2. Back here checking in with you all again. Happy to be giving myself this time to think about my own health and positive changes. IWNDWYT
Day 1 for me today. I'm working until 9 and normally would come home stay up late drinking and feel like crap in the morning. But today I'm coming home to a fridge full of spindrift seltzers and gonna go to bed early and sober!
Starting day 4 today. IWNDWYT
Day 5 for me. I joined yesterday and posted for the first time. Today I plan to tell my one parent who is sober that I am joining them. I know they will obviously be supportive but I am still nervous! Wish me luck...Seltzer water keeps me going. I still need that fizz in my life and it's certainly not coming from beer. ..IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT
Onto day 4 I will not drink with you today!  
Sober today
I  will not drink with you all today!
Yet to be tested by myself though ever vigilant that it should come eventually. Usually I've had thoughts or fantasized the idea of it by now.. but all I still feel is disgust towards it. I assuredly will not drink with you today!  My alcohol-free drink of choice (other than water or black coffee 95% of the time) is spiced ginger beer(soda)!
Just a few hours into day 1 and I already hurt. I will however make it hour by hour.
I enjoy lemon-flavored sparkling water and the occasional can of Coke. I won't drink today
1 month in. Normally after getting through the board meetings and press after quarter end I would go have a few. Today never even crossed my mind.
IWNDWYT!
Morning SD! I am really happy with water for the most part. Nothing like an ice cold water on a hot day. Sometimes at night I like to wind down with some peppermint or chamomile tea. .Here we are on Wednesday! I will not drink with you today.
I won't drink with y'all today been drinking the hell outta some key lime la croix actually need to grab more today.
No drinking today or the next 24 hours.
At home seltzer. So much seltzer haha. When we go out to eat I typically pick some sort of fruity juice. At this point at least I find that the sugar gets my mind off of any cravings.
Got six weeks in today! Did I mention I got 6 weeks? That's SIX people! S.I.X...IWNDWYT
Lemonade vitamin water zero getting into Kombucha lately too and lots of different hot teas. Finding I can shift my nature of exploring craft beers to teas. ..When others are drinking and I have a hard time I drink Lagunitus Hop Water.
Day # 3.  Physically feeling way better!  Have an outpatient rehab assessment today...You know when people used to ask me why i drink so much at a time i would repond with "I don't understand how you can drink so little"  That is how my beer induced brain works but hope to change that.  IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT!  
Happy 1 whole year to me!  Couldn't have (wouldn't have?) done it without this sub.  IWNDWYT.
My alcohol-free drink of choice these days is any kind of sparkling water situation: La Croix Topo Chico Pellegrino with Lime anything with some fizz. I'll raise a La Croix to you and other than that IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today!
Another day down .I will not drink with you today !!
I am making a conscious decision to stay sober today.
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT
I'm taking my Mother-in-Law to lunch for an early Mother's Day today and of course it's half price wine Wednesday at the restaurant. My M-I-L drinks and will likely order a glass but I'm all ready with my "have to work and be clear-headed" reason for not drinking. Thank God it's not dinner as she would order a bottle and insist that I have a glass. I made it 2 weeks now and I'm proud of myself for that and looking forward to many more weeks of not drinking. IWNDWYT!
My husband and I have been exploring "soft cocktails" (as we call them) most evenings lately. We tend to just wing it but our favorite ingredients are: lime or lemon LaCroix (fizzy water) as a base cranberry/pomegranate juice homemade simple syrups (rosemary is a great) muddle fresh mint leaves Pelligrino Chinotto non-alcholic bitters and fresh squeezed lemon/lime. Armed with this arsenal you can create all sorts of yummy concoctions that balance tart and sweet and taste WAY better than if they had booze in them. Looking forward to another experiment tonight and IWND (except soft cocktails) WYT!
Good morning everyone. Thank you for hosting Bone. I've been leaning heavily on LaCroix coffee and tea as well as plain old water but I've been interested in diving into mocktails with all this good weather. I think I'm afraid I'd just miss alcohol more...Haven't made it there yet. Baby steps! ..And my 30 day reward hand cream gets here soon. I almost have the whole set to match a perfume I found in a little hotel boutique a few years ago...IWNDWYT!
A lot on my mind today. Lots of uncertainty. But keeping a clear head is important - alcohol will rob me of this and cause my emotions to be out of whack. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
Kombucha! IWNDWYT 
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in!
I will not drink today!!!
Day three! Last night I had some friends over for tacos and they were drinking. It was hard for me not to have a drink or two with them ( I knew it would turn into more) but I stuck to water and here I am feeling great today! IWNDWYT
I drink lots of water and herbal tea. When I feel the need for something a bit more 'cocktail' like my go-to is soda over ice with 2 tablespoons of pear-infused white balsamic vinegar. Or kombucha. I don't like anything too sweet or sugary. In a restaurant usually soda and lime. Bars and restaurants really need to get on board with more NA choices!..Past the one month mark and IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT

Good morning SD! Days are adding up as my resolve waxes and wanes. ..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT - day 3
Good morning to all of you. I won't be drinking today! Have a good one.
Another AA meeting tonight.  Looking forward to it.  Yesterday was an emotionally heavy day.  IWNDWYT!
Hello and Happy Day Everyone!  I will not drink with you today.  Take Care and Stay Strong!
Good morning.  IWNDWYT
Made it to 7 days sober! First time in 6 months. I am getting a soda stream to make all sorts of interesting carbonated beverages with fresh fruit and lemon juice. I am finally not having night sweats although the vivid nightmares are still going strong. I'm so grateful for another day sober.  
IWNDWYT
I stock up on La Croix because it feels kinda fancy and a teeny bit of soda. When I'm out I like to try what a restaurant has like a cool tea or fruit juice and if I'm at a bar I get seltzer with lime so I can feel confident I'm just drinking water. I do have fun ordering mock-tails (usually they are just elaborate sodas) but only if they are on the menu. IWNDWYT!!
Cock &amp; Bull diet ginger beer!! ..IWNDWYT  
Hopefully the last "day one" for me.  I am changing everything I can from the route I take home (to not drive by the liquor store) to finally attending a meeting.  My goal is to remove triggers and to accept help from others.   . IWNDWYT.
I will not drink today
Haven't ever posted. Really struggled yesterday and can't seem to get it going this morning. Need to get some work done but I'm so tired. I didn't drink yesterday (Day 28) and I will not drink with you today.
This time around I will truly take it one day at a time and  I will not drink with you today!  In the past when I was sober and craving an adult beverage I'd have a Kaliber n/a beer or I'd put a shot of flavored apple cider vinegar over seltzer with ice (some great flavors available on Amazon).
Less than a week out from a year. Not today.
Big day tomorrow but only if IWNDWYT  
/u/BoneConsultancy I swore I'd never become one of these people but I'm absolutely addicted to LaCroix and it's off-brand counterparts.  The addiction came on suddenly.  I had one maybe about 2 months ago and now I drink probably 8-12 cans a day...So I guess I wouldn't call it a "drink of _choice_" as I feel I barely have any choice in whether I'll drink them today or not ;-)..IWNDWYT unless its bubbly water and then apparently I'll drink mine and yours!
Day 3! I WNDWYT!
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
My go-to beverages have been Diet Coke and Polar Seltzer. On my break I splurge on a large turbo iced coffee with milk and two splenda from Dunkin. Not cheap but a heck of a lot cheaper than picking up bear wine and road sodas for my ride home. IWNDWYT!
Day 41. Busy week this week but feeling ok about it. Hope I can get another job soon. I have an interview tomorrow.
I will not drink with you today!
Day 134 for me IWNDYT! I have my 4 month chip working on my 5 month chip.
Not drinking today!
I have also enjoyed finding alternatives that are delicious and aren't "an acquired taste." IWNDWYT!!
Happy. IWNDWYT
I pledge to cleanse my body and not drink today.
I've been consistently sober just a little longer than my son has been alive. Couldn't imagine life any different it is difficult but wonderful. IWNDWYT.

I'm really really struggling with urges today. I have one more hour to white knuckle it to a noon meeting in my town. As I write this my  alcohol song  just came on the radio in my car. (Feel like I'm Drowning by Two Feet). I think it's a sign from above no joke. I'm going to drive over to the meeting and just wait the hour. Helped me just to type this here. IWNDWYT guys.
I will not drink today!

I will not drink with you today
I will not drink with you today! Instead I'll have green + peppermint tea and take a (my first ever!!) yoga class   
IWNDWYT!
Was offered a glass of champagne for a co-worker's birthday. It gave me anxiety but felt good to refuse. I stepped out for a few minutes (I was at work) took a breath went back in and went back to work. Just thinking about how it would make me feel made me nauseous and I'm glad I'm to that point. IWNDWYT!
I made it thru my first day!! Day two - I am not drinking!
I will not drink today.
I pretty much only drink coffee and water. And a latte every afternoon.
Hello my friends I will not drink with you today and I will remain vigilant    
Day 220 of not drinking. IWNDWYT
Not drinking today
IWNDWYT
99 days no booze and 13 days no cigarettes! My favorite mocktail is apple cran La Croix with cranberry juice and Luxardo maraschino cherries (contrary to popular belief these cherries do not contain alcohol). IWNDWYT
Day 9 - I haven't checked in in almost a week but I've stayed the course. It hasn't been easy. It hasn't been pleasant. Most of the time I wonder if it's worth it at all but I have ended up telling myself that my momentary craving is just that - momentary. ..It reminds me of the scripture 2 Cor 4:17-18: " For this light and momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient but the things that are unseen are eternal."..No other words today. IWNDWYT.
Just for today I am not drinking but this ain't no weekend rodeo either!
I will not drink with you today. Went to see Endgame instead   finally managed to carve out a block of time. I would have been better off meditating for three hours.
IWNDWYT :D
Just had the largest handful of m&amp;m's...but I'm not drinking!
IWNDWYT
I drank a ton of la Croix and bubly when I first stopped drinking alcohol. Now it's pretty much coffee water and tea with the occasional kombucha in there when I feel fancy! I think I subconsciously stopped worrying about what I was drinking just so I'd stop thinking about drinking alcohol...Happy Sober Wednesday everyone I hope you have a great day whatever non alcoholic beverage is in your cup!
No booze today.
I had to meet people in a bar tonight. Only 12 days sober. I had a milkshake! I'm so proud. I have passed my first hurdle. IWNDWYT!
Still here  ....and IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT- fighting off the urges through recognising HALT triggers using distraction and enjoying my go to drink of herbal tea for a night cap   Lime soda and ice is a refreshing drink of choice during the day. I'm very glad (reading through the pledges above) that I'm not the only one who experiences vivid dreams. I actually started to think there was something wrong with me!!!!
Still here.
Back again after falling off last year. On Day 23 now. It's been much easier this time but my mindset is also so different and I did months and months of self-development to get my thoughts and emotions to this point. Not drinking with any of you today and super happy about it!
Checking in. ..I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind.
I will not drink today!!

IWNDWYT. My soberversary is coming up - how should I celebrate?
Afternoon SD IWNDWYT
Think its been a little over a week now. I've been having dreams involving alcohol and it sucksss. Today I have felt the urge to hit the liquor store more than I have since I stopped. Like its really getting to me. But I am stronger than that.   . Screw you alcohol....IWNDWYT Still need to find some hobbies.
I will not drink with you today.
Have tried to quit many times hopefully I make it this time.  Day one.
Orange vanilla Seltzer.   IWNDWYT
Day one here.  Made an account just for this page.  IWNDWYT!
Day 10 complete. One day at a time. Another positive day achieved. Roll on tomorrow   
Hi I am checking in for the second time today.  I checked in this morning whilst drinking a coffee...Since then I've a few more coffees lots of water a few cokes a Henry (orange juice and lemonade - you learn something new everyday) and a herbal tea...I'm reading the big book for the first time.  I think I've been reluctant to label myself an alcoholic as I am not at the far end of the spectrum but my past experience has taught me it is very difficult to quit that if I drink just one beer it will undo all my progress and that I am powerless over alcohol...Still I am feeling confident.  Miracles happen every day and I know my life is going to get a whole lot better as I shake this disease off of me.

IWNDWYT!!!
Such a good day even through difficulty. My favoritest band since I was 12 is coming to town finally not at a beer festival. I get to see Bad Religion for the 7th time in July! I will not drink with you today!
I went out with 4 friends last night and after I told them I wasnt drinking and why there was a 20 minute convo about how they all drink too much and then they each had 2-3 drinks at dinner while I had a Virgin Paloma. Wasn't as hard as I thought will keep doing my best. TODAY IWNDWY!
There will be no alcohol crossing me tonight. That is for sure. I am not drinking.

Hi. Fourth comment here. Can't sleep because I'm not drunk but: I will not drink with you today (literally because it's 02:04 where I am).
736 days. That's pretty neat. Missed my two years. This feel more and more permanent. ..Can't say the same about week. On and off and off at least half a dozen times in the past two years. Mostly on...Still love not drinking!
IWNDWYT!
Day 1 just about in the books...
Day 4 in the bag. Gonna finish dinner play some games and watch Netflix. IWNDWYT.

not drinking today.
I shall be drink free with all of you again today.
Checking in on day two I went to the grocery store this evening that sells my favorite beer and I didn't buy any. Somehow I had the wherewithal to know it wouldn't make me feel better I don't know where that came from and I'm not taking it for granted. Now I'm thinking maybe it would but it's too late at night now (not technically but I'll tell myself that) and I need to go to bed. Looking forward to day three.
Stressful day... Ran it out and ate more than I should which is ok :)
Made it through another day sober! The cravings hit me something awful today but it's getting easier to resist. I know those bastards are triggered by hunger but sometimes I just don't feel like eating...Oh well wishing everyone a safe and restful night/day. IWNDWYT  
San Pellegrino Grapefruit for 99 cents in the Safeway deli case has been making head roads this week.  24 oz cans of Arizona raspberry ice tea too.
Made it! Day one and going to bed sober.
Checking in. Still rocking the no booze train.
I will not drink with you today
