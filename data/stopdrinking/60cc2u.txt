90 days didn't seem like an accomplishment for me because I've gone much longer before relapsing in the past. So instead of counting days I'm trying to notice the little successes that are possible because I'm sober now. Today I went out of my comfort zone in a big way and did some networking with someone in my field. It was a big challenge for me to meet them and ask for advice especially since I had to do this in french and my french is still very much a work in progress... It was scary but worth it in the pride I feel knowing that being sober is actually changing me for the better and I am different and moving forward and growing. It may seem like a small thing but anyone who has stumbled through a foreign language knows that something as simple as a conversation can seem like an unsurmountable task. Anyway I'll be celebrating with a nice cup of tea :)

Congratulations!  During my last attempt at quitting last year I took an online course to brush up my very rusty schoolgirl French.  Sadly the online course finished and so did my sober stint - and now my French is back to its original rusty schoolgirl level.  The thought of holding a conversation in it is very daunting indeed.  Kudos to you!  It's a huge accomplishment.
90 days is really fantastic and you should feel really proud of yourself.  Well done you :)
