Yesterday after waking up sober I went out in the yard on a beautiful sunny fall day and began raking leaves. I found a dollar bill that may have been lost by a trick-or-treater but it made me think. Just the day before I had been struggling and fighting trying to find a way to find some money so I could drink but I overcame that now I have found the money I could stash it away for the next time or  do the right thing. I told my wife about it I gave her the dollar bill so we could buy a lottery ticket and I gratefully thank God for this group that has helped me understand the value of my sobriety.
