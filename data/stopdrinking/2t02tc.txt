My note I wrote myself: http://imgur.com/MLIh0Aq. I also have a lot more I could add on now that my mind is much less clouded. ..From 7/19 to Dec 20th I gave it my all every day but I would have bad relapses where I would drink 10-12 beers. I struggled through extreme anxiety went to the ER and had sleepless nights...Today I'm proud to make it to day 30!!! And the best part is it has never been any easier. There is no looking back for me. I will defend my sobriety against everything and everyone. Thank you very much for all your wisdom!
