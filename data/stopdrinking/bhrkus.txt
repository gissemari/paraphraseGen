I'm so disappointed in myself.  I can make it a few days but some how or another I keep thinking I can just have the one.  I woke up having severe hangxiety this has been such a struggle. I really wish I could drink like a normal person but I can't and I wish I could just quit so tired

I usually get to about the sixth too and then break.
We can't drink like normal people. It's a fact of life we have to adjust to. Until we realise this then we are stuck on a merry -go-round of trying to control our drinking and failing.
I hear you. I can pretty easily go 3 or 4 days and a few times in the past several years even a few weeks. But then the stupid rationalizing voice kicks in and talks me into forgetting why I stopped and how I felt when I was drinking 1-2 bottles of wine a night. "You can drink in moderation again no problem" it says. And I believe it. Again. Anyway you're not alone. Don't be too hard on yourself though -- just take a deep breath and start over! IWNDWYT!
Same story for me. Day one again and going into the weekend. IWNDWT
Gotta go a few more days - then you should legitimately start feeling better!
Sorry to hear that I've been in that boat too. You're hear though! And that's what matters. ..Someone much wiser than me once commented on this sub saying failure is when you stop trying. (Cliche? yes. True? also yes) ..We learn from our mistakes and come back stronger the next time. ..Good luck .IWNDWYTN
