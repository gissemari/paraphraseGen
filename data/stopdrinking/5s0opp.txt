Good morning everyone. Just wanted to share something from yesterday - my roommate was out of town the last few days visiting an old friend he hadn't seen a while who's a big drinker. As he was telling me about his so so trip (due to his friend getting too drunk to the point of being very forgetful) he commented on how I looked much healthier. ..That feels really good to hear because during my last relapse I was living alone in a different city and I looked like shit. No one close to me saw what I looked then but I was so repulsed what I saw in the mirror that I told myself never again. It seems to be working because since I stopped I've been handed drinks at bars and house parties and I politely decline every time. ..It's been a little over 2 months but I see and feel a huge difference in me and it feels good when other people notice it too. So instead of a morning beer I am sipping coffee. Cheers.

Congrats on 2 months. I am at a month and I can already tell a difference in my face--puffy hangover mug is gone. Relaxing with coffeein the morning w/o the hangover is one of the best benefits of sobriety for me. Have a great Saturday! 
Congrats on two months! The benefits are reflected inside and out. I find I'm smiling much more lately and let's face it we all look better when we smile :)
Awesome! I spent most of last summer hiding in my house because of how bad I looked and felt. I was so malnourished my skin looked almost grey. Sunken in face. Yellow eyes from jaundice. Really pretty right?! ..I've gotten a lot of comments like "you look younger!" or my favorite "you look really fresh and healthy!" ..Keep it up Hot Stuff! 
What a great feeling! If you're shining noticeably on the outside imagine how much healing is happening to your insides! Great work; thanks for the encouragement:)
