I am at 10 days without a drink today. This is the longest I have gone in the past few months. I've hit 7 and 8 days but never double digits. This is the longest I have gone without a drink in 7 years and I am only 25. ..With it being Saturday night I am struggling though. So here I am. Trying to stay occupied and keep my mind from wanting a drink. ..

You can do this! Congrats on your 10 Days!
Great job. I'm not drinking with you.  
You found the right place.  Let's keep this up!!
Congrats. Keep it up.
Oh I'm so glad I found this. I signed up to write this just to let you know that you're not alone. I hope we make it. I'm on day 7 and it's hard as fuck. I'm 25 too and most of my social life involves alcohol so this weekend has been crazy boring. I'm too afraid to go out I just know that if I do I'm gonna drink. I miss hanging out with my friends but there is no way I'll stay sober if I go out :/ .....Sooo anyone know a movie I can watch?
