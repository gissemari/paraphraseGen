This really resonated with me and the struggle to be still and comfortable with myself without drinking through it. It's from the Pema Ch dr n book When Things Fall Apart. .. Well-being of body is like a mountain. A lot happens on a mountain. It hails and the winds come up and it rains and snows. The sun gets very hot clouds cross over animals shit and piss on the mountain and so do people. People leave their trash and other people clean it up. Many things come and go on this mountain but it just sits there. When we've seen ourselves completely there's a stillness of body that is like a mountain. We no longer get jumpy and have to scratch our noses pull our ears punch somebody go running from the room or drink ourselves into oblivion. A thoroughly good relationship with ourselves results in being still which doesn't mean we don't run and jump and dance about. It means there's no compulsiveness. We don't overwork overeat oversmoke overseduce. In short we begin to stop causing harm.
