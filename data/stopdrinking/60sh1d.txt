"It's a terrible thing I think in life to wait until you're ready. I have this feeling now that actually no one is ever ready to do anything. There is almost no such thing as ready. There is only now. And you may as well do it now. Generally speaking now is as good a time as any." - Hugh Laurie..---..I was never really "ready" to live life sober. I quit several times and each time I relapsed I would tell myself that "I'm just not ready for sobriety yet. Maybe next time." ..But after telling myself this over and over I started to wonder if there ever would be a next time. ..Most of my life revolved around alcohol--even my favorite activities like making art and hiking. A few years ago if someone told me that I would happily celebrate my 27th birthday sober I would have shook my head and wondered how in the world such a thing could be possible. But last year I did just that: Not only did I celebrate my first sober birthday since 17 but also I celebrated sobriety every day last year and it felt great. I filled my life with activites that made me feel whole again...I could very easily have told myself that I had the rest of my twenties to live in a stupor because hey it's my twenties right? But I realized that like Hugh Laurie says there is only now. And a year ago all my nows were full of self-loathing regrets and pain. I could barely function or enjoy life without the crutch of alcohol. I couldn't hold on much longer so it wasn't so much a matter of being "ready" but rather being *aware* of the pain I was inflicting on myself with each glass I poured...---.."There is almost no such thing as ready. There is only now.".
