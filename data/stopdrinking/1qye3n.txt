First of all yesterday and today I woke up and went to bed at a decent time. I've been really struggling with my sleep schedule so yay! I've also been tracking the foods I eat and my calorie intake. Still too lazy and unmotivated to work out yet but I'll work on it... I've also been smoking a lot less. Went from 1+ packs a day to half or less. Yay again!..The biggest thing I've noticed in the past few days is a huge self esteem boost. Today I showered only put on foundation and I'm rocking some new clothes. I'm usually very self conscious about my light features and draw my eyebrows in and pack on the mascara. But I looked in the mirror today and thought I was looking good ;D No bags under my eyes my face is skinnier and I just look happier!..I still have things to work on but I have had very little urge to drink even with it being around (parents and friends all drink). I'm so excited to be healthy and soon to be a month sober!!..Thanks so much to all of you again. You're all seriously so awesome. And to anyone just starting out If I can do it so can you!..Love you guys!..Emma

Congrats on the two weeks that is huge.  As for the self esteem that is a core issue for me and many of us.  Keep doing.
Thanks for the update sounds like you're doing fabulous!
Awesome!  Yeah it amazes me how quickly things in life and motivations improve once booze is no longer a part of our lives.  Congrats on your progress!
Go Emma!
