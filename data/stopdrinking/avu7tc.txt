My day count is inaccurate. I had a brief relapse about two weeks ago. I've been working a lot of overtime at my job lately because my department is currently understaffed. With that + being in grad school (and I have one of my hardest classes yet this semester  ) most of my waking hours over the past few months have been spent working so as you might imagine I've been under a lot of stress. ..That day my team lead offered me (and the rest of my teammates) a shot of whiskey at work. On a day where my stress level had been more normal I know I would have been able to more easily resist as I've done it before but since I was already at the point of wanting to start crying or screaming at my desk I relented. Later that night I drank more about a third of a bottle of rum. My boyfriend came to check on me around midnight - he'd been in the other room gaming with his friends -  and I burst into tears...But it was only one day. The next morning I went out to brunch and had hashbrowns with sausage gravy - probably nature's ideal hangover food.   And I talked to my team lead about it at the beginning of the next week (he was very understanding) and brought it up to my manager during our next one-on-one as well. I work in an office where drinking at work is pretty common (tech industry) so I don't want to be able to hide. So even though I did relapse I feel encouraged by how I handled it and I feel like it indicates that I'm making some kind of progress.

I would agree! If you've been able to keep the brakes on after a small lapse that says a lot about your commitment to a permanent change. And your desire NOT to hide - anyone who drinks knows what a temptation that is. Secrets fester in silence; bringing it out into the open helps us stay accountable. 
Good for you and welcome back to fighting the good fight! IWNDWYT
