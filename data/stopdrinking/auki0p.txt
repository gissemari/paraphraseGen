I'm a 54 year old lifetime since early teens alcoholic. I admitted I had a problem around 23 and quit through AA at 25. I made it from July 12 1989 to Dec 4 2007. I was only in AA about 3 years and quit going. I got involved in a marriage ministry with the church. It was very fulfilling. From what I see although I was no longer attending AA and I'm sorry I have a problem with seeing the Big Book and the BIG Book. But. what happened is after leading many groups in marriage ministry side by side with my then wife and being very active in the church I was basically regularly working the steps. Especially the part about carrying a message to others. There seems to be nothing more fulfilling than giving people who have lost hope some hope and hope that works. Dec 4th 2007 my wife and I separated. We'd relocated to a new state searched out church families even started one in our home for our kids friends. That waned off and went away. We continued volunteering in the area of our kids schools. We were always willing to give time to worthy causes. We hit a financial crisis we'd never had and really didn't know how to disagree productively although that was certainly part of the training we taught others. We never experienced it first hand. We failed. We separated and we divorced. Within 5 minutes of separation I had my first drink in almost 19 years and first cigarette. I tried for 3 years to reconcile. I had to yield when my separated wife was pregnant and if she had the child still married the child would have been my responsibility which I informed her I was fully prepared to do and asked once again to get back together and let me do that. She declined. I continued to struggled with drinking from Dec 2007 until October of 2018. I'd say it was 50% on 50% off. I can't drink normally. If I drink I drink daily and have some in my system all day. Maybe keep it to a drink an hour to 2 hours then build a bit before bed. I've required medical detox about I don't know 7 or 8 times but have had a Xanax prescription for anxiety pretty much since we separated. So I had the means of doing my own medical detox by just staying in bed a few days. I decided to go to treatment in October 2018. I really could not recommend a better place. I have staff member friends there now it is a thorough program. I had a Psychiatrist 3 one on one counselors and approximately 5 groups a day apart from personal sessions. I learned a bit about why I am how I am but I really knew most of that. I'd done research papers on this stuff since college and in a lot of cases knew more than counselors certainly and the psychiatrist was really no help. He wanted to medicate me with things that would have only hurt. I know a lot about the subject. I especially know a substantial amount about natural treatments that are far better for you than pharmaceuticals. I know this is not sounding like a question. I'm getting there.  I'm especially asking for feedback from long time abstainers that went back...&amp;#x200B;..What I have seen as far as 12 step programs and additionally what kept me sober for years outside of 12 step programs is a relationship with God. Call him whatever you want but the notion that there is a higher power creator that has a personal relationship and cares. That combined with a lifestyle that removes us from the most important person in our universe. Along with that a desire to engage in activities and DO engage in activities that help others and would be impossible in our addiction. I can break down the 12 steps to several that are key. That's not my point here. Basically what I have found is that I can not be the most important person in my universe and that I must care enough about others to want to benefit them and do benefit them in ways that would be impossible if I wallow in drinking or any other addiction. ..&amp;#x200B;..That's a paragraph that sums up what I've learned. Now about a week ago almost 6 months out of treatment I slipped. I'm in a long distance relationship and therefore isolated socially. That's a problem. I've been too focused on money because drinking money is unstable and I'm self employed. These two things I see as things that need to be remedied to stay sober. Please bare in mind the paragraph about makes it very concise. But am I off here? For any AAers or Celebrate Recovery people which I like better than AA lets just assume the steps having to do with our creator are met. But I got off somewhere because I slipped again. I was sober almost 20 years and in the last 11 have only been one time almost 6 months. I do sincerely want helpful criticism.

Interesting as I read every word. I am the son of an alcoholic whose father was an alcoholic. I probably was an alcoholic from my 1st sip of beer and that escalated when I turned 21 and could drink daily which I did until 1 week before my 70th birthday in November 2018. This is my 1st and last attempt to stop.  Your approach is way to complicated for me. I am just not going to drink. I don't care about 12 steps a higher power professional counselling AA or what other people think.  I use SD many times a day to see how others are struggling and I put my 2 cents in whenever I am moved to do so. I only posted 2x I think. I hope you sort out the 2 things you said need to be remedied. IWNDWYT
