It's been 88 days since my last drink and I feel great! The only thing I gave up when I stopped drinking beer and whiskey is the hangovers and the accompanying feelings of sadness and depression. I'm amazed at how my mood swings have almost completely disappeared. I still have fun stay up late on weekends and host cookouts at my house. Except now I have a craft root beer instead of a microbrew or a glass or blueberry juice instead of wine. I never thought I'd be able to enjoy my off hours without rewarding myself with a drink - but the truth is that I enjoy my off time so much more now! I hope my message helps someone who is considering quitting or is struggling. You can do it.

Blueberry juice? Never thought of that. Now that is a way to get antioxidants without the destruction of alcohol. Nice work!
Congrats on 88!! 
Congrats!!! It's amazing to experience the things we enjoy sober. I never thought i would enjoy anything really anything sober. The reality of the situation is that i enjoy and experience things so much more. The difference between living life and experiencing life! awesome to hear of your success! Keep up the good work.....as i'm writing this i can't stop thinking about blueberry juice. I have never had it or even thought about it. I'm intrigued...
Still having trouble myself. The cravings man. But this is no time to negotiate with terrorists. Alcohol is just cut out of my life like the malignant tumor it is.
