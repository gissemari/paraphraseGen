Alcohol is destroying my life and I'm sick of it. I have one problem in my life and it's alcohol the root of all other problems. This is a stupid problem to have and I'm tired of it fucking up my life. I'm tired of fucking up at work because of this stupid shit...I'm done. I've relapsed so many times and every single time it fucks with my life in the worst way. I'm finished. It's over. I will never drink again and I look forward to having a life free from this goddamn poison. ..It's time to do anything it takes...I will not drink with you today.

I felt like this too. I felt *done* but just couldn't break the spell on my own. The book This Naked Mind helped me realize that I am not the piece of shit; alcohol is. I am now on day 11 and not looking back (and had to actually add up the days just now). Maybe it would help you too?.IWNDWYT. All the best  
Freedom is GREAT !!..Looking forward to hearing more about your journey!
