Hey everyone just checking in at the two year mark! I want you all to know if you're struggling there's a light at the end of the tunnel... and it's glorious. I'd like to be more involved in the community so please PM me if you need help. It's not the easiest path for sure but it's completely worthwhile. If you're just starting out or a long timer... young or old stay strong!
