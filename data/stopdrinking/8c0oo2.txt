I've been keeping my sobriety a secret at work for almost a full year and today I finally found the courage to be open about it. It felt great to get off my chest and it also helped my boss understand why I've been having such a tough year. For me I still struggle daily with depression and anxiety but I found a little release today. Peace.

Good for you! Break the stigma. Have a wonderful weekend :)
Just think how much more productive you've been.  Your boss is probably LOVING IT!  IWNDWYT
that's awesome. you should be proud and excited about your growth. 
Congrats!  How did he or she take it?
I did that too and it back fired on me.  My boss started trying to use it against me.  Made me into a  liability  in case I ever relapsed.  And I was a very good worker...The guy was also a complete douche bag narcissist sociopath though.  I quit in order to stay sober 
To all readers-dont ever do this. Work is the place to lie and pretend and take it to the grave...Best of luck to OP though
I told my boss too. After he told me was leaving for a new position. He'll be gone in two weeks. He was super supportive.
