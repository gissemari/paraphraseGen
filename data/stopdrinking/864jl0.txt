Hey SD I've been away for a long time. Busy with work and trying to get where I wanted to be. Then when things were going very well I started to"moderately" drink. Really I was just sneaking around and hiding my drinking but telling myself that I was in control. And before long I was in full blown binge mode. I did a lot of damage; I have no more savings living off of a credit card on unpaid leave from work. **BUT** it's not that bad not as bad as it has gotten. And more importantly I said this is enough. ..I had my first sober day on March 15th. The detox was bad (and in hindsight I probably should have sought some assistance). But things are good calm and clear. My destructive behavior has gone down to 0 I'm not hemorrhaging money on impulsive purchases and the need for constant intoxication isolating a little less and reaching out a lot more. ..I requested a badge reset pleasantly surprised that it has already been 6 days! Thank you for sharing your stories accomplishments and struggles team. IWNDWYT
