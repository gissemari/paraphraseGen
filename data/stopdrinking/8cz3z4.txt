I still feel depression - but not as agonizing as the first month. Every day gets better. I want to keep with it. I relapsed before... It was worse then the first time I tried to quit. So here I am. Saying out loud. Time to grow up.

Welcome aboard!..I found that the depression lingered for a while and didn't go away as quickly as I'd hoped but as you say it does gradually get better.....Congrats on nearly 2 months keep up the good work!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Congratulations - here's to a sober 24!..It took me a while to settle down with mental health. My normal was *so* low for *such* a long time it took me a while to reset the bar and realise I needed some outside help in addition to my recovery program. ..You're not alone.
