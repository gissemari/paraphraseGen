Still struggling to quit down to every other day. Kinda worried at this point what symptoms I may have when quitting after doing it every other day for a long time. I keep trying and failing days later.

Every other day is half as much alcohol as every day - a significant difference.  A lot of folks need support to win the struggle and there are a ton of success stories on this sub about the different places that support was found and how relieving it was to finally ask for help and begin the healing process.  Is there a person doctor or group you can lean on?..I'd also like to share what helped me (an introverted engineer) the most: reading starting with *This Naked Mind*.  That book changed my path and relationship with alcohol...Good luck and check in as often as feels right for you.
