Was here a few years ago under a different user name after a DUI and divorce. Stopped drinking for 7 whole months . It was wonderful even with all the crap I caused myself.  I lost weight got in shape excelled at work skin was nicer slept awesome.  Think that would be enough to keep me stopped? Nope thought I could moderate shocker.   That didn't last but a few months.  I could go 2 weeks without a drink still hit I could also go 2 weeks straight drinking 6-12 drinks a day.  I recently had 2 weeks and a few of the nights even got back to my blackout stage.  Embarrassed myself a few times even drove once.  Admittedly I'm tapering today to ease the sweats and anxiety having 4 drinks over the course of the day.  I'm done with the withdrawals and stupidness.  I have a wonderful gf (somehow) who (somehow) doesn't know of my struggle although I did tell her i'd like to  drink less .  She'd be ashamed to know the way I've behaved a few times lately and (somehow) loves me like crazy.  I know I have to do this for myself but I don't want to lose her or my job or get into trouble or kill someone or die prematurely.  I'm a male and only early 30s.  Thanks for listening time to get back on the wagon. ..
