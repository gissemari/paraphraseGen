Hm....my body is taking a long time to recover..day 20. Wow my hands have finally stopped sweating..day 25. Maybe I should stop smoking too. Nope too many things at a time...day 30. Am I getting addicted to SD and reddit instead?..day 38. Hmm.... I'm forgetting what this used to be like. did i ever drink THAT much? was it really so bad? ..I wish I'd kept track of when I relapsed the last few times I tried this. ...

This is just the sort of post I sought out when I was starting out. Brings me back. Thank you for sharing this. I won't be drinking w you today. 
Congrats on 38 days sober thanks for sharing your timeline! I remind myself that I was in a real bad spot fully trapped by my drinking habit. I remind myself how wonderful it is not to sweat anymore! If I am thirsty I just drink herbal teas or sparkling water and I am so grateful for the freedom to live my life focus on what really matters to me without alcohol weighing me down anymore.
Awesome !..Did you end up quitting smoking ?
I really like that as a potential map of things we noobs might experience over the first weeks of our sobriety.  I hope you'll update it from time to time and share again.  A good read indeed.
Never tried vape too many components.. Did e-Cigs for a while but idk prefer spending $14 bucks for a pack of American Spirits instead.. Ugh *Stupid* lot better than spending $100 for a bag of white powder thatll be gone in 30 minutes.
