So my wife had surgery and I took 2 weeks of to take care of her. I told myself that I was going to go to a meeting every day and life was going to be good I was wrong. Since my relapse after a year of sobriety I have had a hard time getting started again. I think about all the motivation I had and that tenacity and I cant seem to find it. Being alone for that long in my office "doing schoolwork" I wallowed in my own little hell and destroyed what little snowball I had. I can't wait to get rolling again and I know that the depression will eventually leave once I get out. I could use some happy thoughts right now.

Sending Happy Thoughts!..Why not try what you said "go to a meeting everyday" ?
