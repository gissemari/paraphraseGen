The time has come for me to toot my own horn once again! And it is extra special because 3 happens to be my favorite number!!..It's been 3 years since my last hangover and regretful morning. It feels like yesterday but also has felt like a lifetime. The longer it goes on though the more humbled I feel about it all and realize how fragile it all really is. ..I still have those days where I struggle and strongly consider making a trip to get my old favorites but every time so far I have made it through and it's a beautiful thing. ..I have learned to embrace who I was and who I am now. I no longer feel ashamed admitting I have a problem with alcohol. It's just become another trait of mine... like my anxiety or my hair color. It's a part of me but not controlling me anymore and it's a wonderful feeling...I am so grateful to my family and friends who have stuck by me through all my highs and lows. And I am especially grateful to all the amazing people here. Because even when my friends and family were telling me I had a problem I didn't admit it and take action until I started lurking here and realized that there is a better way to live my life. ..To any newbies reading this I am nothing magical or amazing. I am you... just 3 years from now. I'll leave you with this appropriate quote I got from my sober tracking app today. "Life's greatest accomplishments are those that at first seem impossible." ..I will not drink today and I hope you all join me!
