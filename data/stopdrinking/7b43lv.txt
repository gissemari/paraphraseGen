I ve been lurking on this sub for quite long but today i decided that i want to share my story.  I havent had a drink in 9 days after my last replapse. I've been drinking quite heavily  for the last 6 years. Outside in bars and parties and of course home alone (i could drink two bottles of white wine every two nights). I have tried to quit many times as drinking made me extremely aggressive the last years  doing shameful and dangerous things ( how i wish i could erase all of them).  I knew i had a problem i just couldnt stop.  I couldn't imagine my life without drinking.I didnt enjoy it but it was better being drunk than sober. Everybody knew i was drinking a lot when we went out ( i lost some friends due to that)but nobody knew about my home wine binging thing. Last year i moved in with my boyfriend and i couldnt hide it anymore. He drinks too sometimes heavily  but only when hes out with friends. He would come home after work and find me drunk most days of the week. We fought a lot about my habit but i couldnt stop. I wanted to quit so hard my hangovers and shame killed me on the inside but then the next day would come and i would pour myself a drink. One last drink as i used to say but that was never the case.  I tried to quit with his help on April lasted two months then relapsed for the next five months. I had a lot of break downs went to see a psychiatrist and as it turns out im bipolar.  I used alcohol to self medicate all these years. Im currently on medication that helps A LOT  i dont have the need to drink and pass out almost everyday anymore and im happy with myself. Im finally aware of whats been going on in my brain. And thats a huuuuge relief.  However im still scared of going down that road again. When something stressful or sad happens my first thought is alcohol. I wish i could change that. Im trying my best.These days im having a lot of trouble with work and my boyfriend and i m scared of myself. However i feel stronger than I ever had. I just have to take it one day at a time and fill my time with enjoyable activities. It always helps me to read your stories so i wanted to share mine as well. Seems only fair to do so. Sorry for my English (non native). Hope you have a lovely day. I wont drink with you today :)

Good luck friend. Don't lose the motivation or belief in yourself. I am on your side and believe in you. 
Being afraid of loding your sobriety means that you care keep it up my friend!
