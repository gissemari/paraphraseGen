I don't feel proud this time. Today is the first day I've actually counted how many days I haven't drank. I had stopped drinking before from December of 2011 to July of 2015 over 1000 days. During that time I still used Adderal Vyvanse Mushrooms and smoked cigarettes but I was so so proud that I wasn't drinking. ..When I quit this time I quit everything. Nothing happened all at once I quit the pills in June stopped drinking on July 2 and eventually I stopped smoking through September and October...Everything got so fucked up from all of this stuff. At 28 years old I could have accomplished so much more by now. I miss all of it dearly and I also can't believe I got rid of all that trash in my life. I struggle to find contentment in each day though each passing month shows some growing progress-accumulating things and activities I would have never started unless I went sober: Building my credit back up with credit karma paying off old collections getting a credit card with a small limit occasionally buying nicer clothes updating and editing my resume actively searching for and applying to jobs related to my degree actually having the motivation to go swim laps in a pool clean out my car spending more time with family and nurturing friendships that never got attention before because I shut myself in and altered my mind instead...I miss the world of instant gratification that could just be gone to. I don't miss everything else about it. The drunk rants to people I could have been building relationships with the anger regret feeling like shit and letting responsibilities big and small slide-missing opportunities and disappointing people. ..I may not feel proud of being sober. I feel like I am just now getting it right. I do feel proud of so many of the little changes I would have never done because I went sober...Thank you so much Stopdrinking your posts remind me I'm never alone. I will not drink with you tonight.

The sentiment of letting your life slip by is something that I'm dealing with too at age 29. I always got close to success but never grasped it fully because of drinking and drugs. ..Cheers. I will not drink with you today.
