Father and Mother In Law came back from vacation with presents for us. A bottle of wine from the area they visited. I don't even understand peoples thought process sometimes. (Though I am fine with it as I can be around drinks and drinkers now without struggling....it was just ODD)

I actually looked for a "Non-Alcoholic Grape Product" label or something...nope.
Does seem odd glad it didn't throw you off track!
People who aren't alcoholics think once you've stopped drinking for a while that you're now OK to start drinking again. They will never understand that I will always drink the same way whenever I drink. I have far too many "it will be different this time" relapses to think otherwise.  
Huh weird.  I suppose you can re-gift it to someone else.
i find this to be funny really... When i was drinking no one offered me anything ever for free. Now people offer drinks all the time... I recently won a Wine basket at a company party. I traded it away for a candy basket and was one happy camper!
My mom visited a few weeks ago.  She brought me all kinds of food from her freezer. She likes to do that.  All of it contained meat. She knows I don't eat meat. As far as she knows I haven't eaten meat in 4 or 5 years. Yet every time she sees me we do this. ..This time was especially funny. *Mom I don't eat meat.*  "There's no meat in that it's just pork broth. You can use it to make soup." ..Thanks mom. ..True story. ..It's not that she doesn't care.  It's not that she doesn't understand. It's not that she forgets. It's not like she's trying to change my mind.  I don't know what it is actually. All I know is that she does this. She always has. Probably always will. She means well.
