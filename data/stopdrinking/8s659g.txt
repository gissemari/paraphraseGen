I'd have three months sober very soon. I know I can't change the past and coulda woulda shoulda but I relapsed when I got two months and now a WHOLE month has passed me by. I would've been getting that damn three month chip if I would've stayed the path. I just got 24 hours sober so I hope I'll be getting that three month chip in three months!!!! ..(I know I only have today. Just feeling a little frustrated).

Nothing can take away the two months you had.  Your starting again with sobriety experience under your belt. .IWNDWYT.
