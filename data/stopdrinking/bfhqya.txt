I live at home and my parents went out of town this weekend-its thie 1st time in this 8 month stretch I could drink and get away with it. ..I ended up making the incredibly unwise decision to drink last night :/. The plan was to "only have" 5 min airport bottles at my house alone. Then I went to a local bar. Then went to the local strip club. ..THANK GOD I made it home ok still have my wallet and phone didnt spent too much $ at the strip club-$80. ..But this shit was not fun. And the cravings are somewhat intense today. Feeling hungover didnt go to the gym and just feeling depressed and thinking how unhealthy it is to drink like I do. When a normal dude has a "night on the town" its like 4-5 drinks. When I drink it is 20 drinks whatever drugs I have and a bunch of red bull. ..I feel like such an idiot. ..&amp;#x200B;..I just wasnt strong enough to resist drinking while my parents were away. I plan for this to be day 1 again and when my parents come back it should be easier. ..&amp;#x200B;..But I cant live at home forever. If I ever want to move out and be an independent adult I have to make the personal choice to never drink. ..&amp;#x200B;..D\*mn guys...... :/

I've been there...I found I had to go through all the relapses though to get to the point where I would take sobriety seriously...That sounds like you from your post. So hang in there. You've got the rest of your life still in sobriety.
I know how you feel. I still get the urge to be sneaky in many situations and it never turns out well. I make a huge mess do all kinds of impulsive things and then the next day feel the urge to drink again because of shame guilt and panic. I've gotten stuck in that cycle for days. We simply cannot pick up the first drink no matter what. ..Here is a virtual hug - you can come back from this! Just reinforce your methods and make some reminders where a drink leads you. One sip for me means psychotic thinking and the quest to drink until I pass out I don't even know why. IWNDWYT  
It's crazy how 1 night out brings back all the horrors. Even I've heard of people relapsing after years and 1 night  depression comes back regret comes back cravings spike again.
I'm literally in the same boat.  See my most recent post... Hugs my friend.

I will not drink with you today.
Hugs.
Man that's why I'm serious about quitting. Moving across the state to take a new job where I can make serious money and have a career. If I'm drinking I will fail miserably. We can do this. Fuck alcohol
Welcome Home!
I can sympathize. I've had a lot of relapses and not once have I emerged from a relapse glad that I did so. And in some cases the results were disastrous. ..At least you came out of it okay. But that's never guaranteed. ..It's the consequences I've experienced from those "I'll just drink this one time" events that have me super scared about picking up. In fact the last few days haven't been good and my natural inclination is to reach for a drink. But I know not only will nothing good come from it but there's a chance I will raise total hell for myself and others.
We're here for you. Welcome home
Pretty sure 8 months is a major victory whether you're at your parents house or not. Don't beat yourself up too bad. Learn from this and grow. Good luck.
I relapsed after 11 months I feel your pain. We can do this
Consider yourself hugged. I'm sorry. Get back on that horse. You can do this.
