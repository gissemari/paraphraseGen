Sometimes it's the small things going into this new week sober and fresh (despite multiple wake ups from the baby last night!).An accounting of the the little wins from a weekend well spent as these small positives add up everyday!.- fridge full of tasty food including lunch for me and the husband tomorrow.- an empty laundry basket.- toothbrush ecig and earphones fully charged.- outfits laid out for everyone tomorrow.- Xmas presents posted to friends.- little holes in a pair of my favourite trousers and a jacket repaired.- bedsheets and towels changed.It may not seem like much on paper but compared to a  normal' drinking weekend; the house would be a tip I'd be struggling to get clean clothes for everyone no extra tasks would have been done and I'd be dreading the impending week. .No more sitting in the same place doing the same thing drinking the same shit!.I'm so ready for this week!

I love this! Amazing how much we accomplish in such little time when not drinking!
This is how it should be amazing isn't it?..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
That all sounds so positive!  Keep avoiding alcohol and things will get even better :)
