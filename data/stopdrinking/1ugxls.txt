The craving for the alcohol was intense last night and the setting was one where I would usually drink - Saturday night no plans nothing to do the next day bored and lonely. I was THISSSSS close to running to the store to get alcohol and my mother keeps a ton of booze in the house but I resisted. I called my dad (who ironically is a drug and alcohol psychologist) and we spoke and simply saying "I want to drink" was very cathartic. My mother is an alcoholic and as I was talking to my father on the phone she was getting aggressive with me and generally just being belligerent. I decided I dont want to be where she is 30 years from now and that I can push through the temptation to drink. And like a craving for a cigarette the craving to drink passed. I DIDN'T DRINK!!!!! I know I'll face these struggles again on my journey but knowing that if I just do something else talk to someone wait it out the temptation for that moment will pass...I hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend and I am beyond grateful for this subreddit!!!!!

&gt;simply saying "I want to drink" was very cathartic...It's so true just talking it out with someone who understands is a huge help. Getting it out takes away a lot of its power. This is what I find most helpful about support groups like AA - the ability to just talk about it with people who understand...It sounds like a very unhealthy environment can you move?
GREAT job lad! This kind of mental toughness is going to help you thrive in this adventure.
Great work.
When you get a craving try dropping and smash out 20 push ups. Works for me plus youll get in shape!
