Oddly enough I'm currently averted to drinking alcohol. Im sitting in a room with my roommate and his friends who are currently drinking. It doesn't make me want to drink. Maybe it's because I acknowledge that these withdrawals show how disconnected I've been. I had been drinking a 12 pack of beer every night. If it wasn't a 12 pack it was a 750 ml bottle of liquor. This happened nightly for the past month and a half. The first 48 hours were rough. I had some minor visual hallucinations and some scary auditory ones. I also had some light shakes. I went to AA the first 2 nights but didn't go tonight. I can relate to them but it still doesn't feel like the right place for me. I didn't relapse today. I just want to get through this. I haven't been shaking today but my anxiety has been getting to me. I'm definitely paranoid. Im also confused a lot. Very simple things are hard to concentrate on. Im easily agitated but I understand that it is a withdrawal effect. I haven't been acting out on any anger. Any thoughts? Ideas? Experiences with withdrawal?

Day 3 was the worst. Tough it out. By day 7 the body feels less pull to booze. Good wishes.
I had lots of anxiety the first week. It does get better!
