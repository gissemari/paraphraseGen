It's gone so fast but also a daily  (& sometimes momentary) crawl and struggle. ..I have been so grateful for this community and your experiences - you helped me daily commit to taking care of myself and not drinking. ..Life is going well now and I'm trying to be present and grateful but also mindful that I cannot drink again. ..Thank you for sharing and your support friends. ..Namaste
