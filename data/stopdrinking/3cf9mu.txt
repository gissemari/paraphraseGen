I just reached the two year milestone and it feels great. July 5th two years ago I had a liver biopsy done and realized my health was declining a lot faster than it should have been for someone my age. My health made a decision that should have been made years before much easier....I decided that day I was done. I am one of the lucky ones; I wasn't physically addicted to alcohol but it was still a struggle to quit drinking after having 8-12 beers a night for somewhere around 10 years.....Quitting drinking has not made my life perfect but it is a hell of a lot more manageable. I am now emotionally more invested with my wife and kids. I don't have that weight on my back of knowing I have a problem I am trying to hide it from the world.....I found this sub a few months into my sobriety. It has helped to inspire me to keep fighting. Every day is still a battle but each day it gets easier. Thanks to everyone here for their honesty and support. Every comment helps others who are in need.....My hope is maybe someone will read this and it will encourage them to make changes in their life or to get help. If someone is sober and struggling please keep fighting. It is worth it.
