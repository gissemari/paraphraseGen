I went to join my local VFW yesterday. I didn't have a DD214 with me so I ended up going home...I wanted to join a new one since it's been a few years and I have one close to me again...It's been a bit of a struggle this past year and I thought I could get help on filling out paperwork to get disability and whatnot...I also went because Joining up generally nets you quite a lot of free booze from other members welcoming you.  Luckily(?) there was an event going on upstairs and no one was really in the bar so I filled out my application and took it home to attach my DD214 to it. ..Made it another day I guess.
