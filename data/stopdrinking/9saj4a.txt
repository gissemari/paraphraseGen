I haven't watched cable since probably 2003. I've been using tv apps like Netflix HBO and HULU since 2011. Downloaded sling tv today and holy hell... no wonder so many people are struggling with alcohol addiction! Every other commercial is about how great drinking is. I'm glad I only signed up for the free trial. I won't be continuing my subscription. I don't need the temptation and I'm sure as hell not paying $25 a month to watch 5 commercials (2 of which are geared toward brainwashing people to think alcohol is the key to fun and happiness) every 10 minutes. ..Ok. Whew. Rant over. That caught me a little off guard. BUT! I did not drink with you today! Off to bed. Good night sober friends. Tomorrow is a new day.

When stopped drinking I started noticing all the ads and they pissed me off! Reading your post I realized that I dont notice it as much now I must be filtering it out or just not as affected by it anymore. Not to be uptight or what have you but I really dont understand why they are allowed to even have ads at all! .
Marlboro Man had his day and then he was out of a job. Someday ( hopefully ) our political leaders will take on alcohol like happened with smoking.
