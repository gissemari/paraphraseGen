Hello all. I am checking in again for the first time. I've been struggling with drinking for a long time (about 5 years) and the longest I have ever gone sober was about 4 months. My new goal is to make it one day. And after that to make it 2. One day at a time. I start therapy for depression and addiction one week from today so that is my first big goal one week clean. I haven't done that in years. .I plan to use every tool I can think of this time which is why I thought therapy would help. I also plan to go to meetings have someone I check in with on a consistent basis and tell my friends and  (for the first time) tell my family about my struggles. .Has anyone else used therapy or counseling to help them stay sober? If so how does it work? What can I expect? .Thank you all for any support or well wishes. I will not drink with you today.
