The bar to bar thing too. One thing I notice (I also did when I was drinking) is that people especially in bars are chained to it...You talk about adventures traveling etc. The people I knew (and I was one of them) would adventure but everywhere they went it was about alcohol. You're still drinking just in a different venue...I realized it wasn't an adventure at all just a different place to get drunk. The real adventure happens when your mind is free and clear to really enjoy what is around you...The person that exclaimed in disgust when she found out you didn't drink? Well I would have nothing but disdain for that person. I get it. People want to drink. The people that are real drinkers and drunks get very uncomfortable when they are around someone that doesn't drink. It's because you represent what they could be and not what they are...They are chained to a drug you are not. People with deficits seek out people with similar ones so they don't have to admit they have one...I hope you feel better some day. 260 days ago I did not care anymore either.

If I only told my wife that I was quitting I could talk my way out of looking like I'm going back on my word.  But it'd be more difficult to convince a group of people that I still had integrity if I went back to drinking...Over the weeks and months after quitting I started feeling more proud of my actions (quitting drinking losing weight etc) and less like there was something wrong with me.  Instead of skirting around the issue of drinking I'd proudly tell people that I didn't drink (anymore)...Now when I meet someone new and the issue of drinking comes up I tell them that I quit drinking two years ago because I used to drink too much and had to stop.  Sometimes that leads into a discussion about whether I miss it or not.  And I always say that I don't.

One of the main reasons I did it was because I felt so left out - I also found it hard to speak to women. I gave in and drank again but it didn't provided the relief I expected and it took ten years to stop again. ..During my early twenties I was suicidal for almost a whole year. I considered myself an atheist but the one thing that stopped me killing myself was the idea that I might have to live this shitty life all over again. I doubted very much that this was going to be the case but I just couldn't take the risk even if it was just 0.0000000000001%..This time when I'd been sober five years I developed some serious financial problems. I became depressed and I could hardly bare to look at my wife and son because I felt so guilty. The thought of drinking never crossed my mind but I did briefly consider suicide. I felt bad like this for a few months but it turned out to be the best thing to ever happen to me. I enjoy a level of serenity these days that I never thought was possible. ..What I've come to realize is that the struggles in life can be a gift to me. I've found that almost all of my suffering is because I resist the way things are - my suffering always starts with these words 'I shouldn't be feeling this way' or 'it shouldn't be this way'.

His family held an intervention and it worked. He's been clean and writing for decades. He recently just released his newest novel *Revival.* ..It's excellent. Maybe one of his best. ..My point is that drugs and booze and all that shit don't actually make you more creative. What they do is turn down the voice that all musicians and writers and artists hear that says "no one will like this." It doesn't enhance creativity it just stops you from second guessing yourself.  ..Drug-addicted artists are not tortured heroes. They're sick people who could be making better more pure art if they were sober. ..In that book King addresses his substance abuse problems a bit and then he says "I've heard alcoholic snowplow drivers make the same claim: that they drink to still the demons."..Everyone's "tortured" to a degree. Being an artist (and I am one as well) is not special. Real talk? It's lame. There is no glory in getting drunk and making art and dying of overdose is not tragic. It's not cute.

There are others but AA is the largest and oldest 12-step recovery organization.  And its free.

Once there the best course of action would be to each separately find someone willing to talk to you one-on-one about staying sober...This may seem like a drastic proposal but it really is not.
