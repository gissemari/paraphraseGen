That I didn't even realize it was coming up!..When I first started coming to this sub my flair was like a watched pot. I remember how waiting for that first week badge felt like an eternity. While I am still very vigilant and serious about my recovery it feels good to have something at the forefront of my mind that isn't related to the number of days that have passed since I last had a drink!..But all that being said... the 3 on that star looks damn good and I'm damn proud of where I am today. And of course I owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to all of you here for your support advice and stories of shared struggles. ..For three months I have woken up and said "I will not drink today" and in the morning it will be three months and a day. I hope you will all join me in a sober tomorrow!
