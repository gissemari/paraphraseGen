After I discovered SD some months ago I've found tremendous support in reading and commenting on posts. I recently had three weeks of sobriety but slipped last week. I continued to read posts but was too ashamed to post and comment...That was a mistake...There's a rule of not posting while drunk but the only rule against posting while struggling as in knowing that today may still go south is in my own mind. My self imposed exile didn't do me any good quite the opposite. I missed out on the finest community I know the only gang that understand me. Commenting and cheering on my fellow SDers gave me strenght too...I'm not out of the woods but hey I'm giving it a try day by day. I both want and need to be here. My guess is that goes for you too. So Don't be a stranger! And I will do my very best to not drink with you today.

I'm glad you're here and I will not drink with you today! 
Hell yeah! The posts and comments/replies are the fuel that keeps this community going. There is no such thing as a bad one even perceived "negative" ones are helpful to people who feel the same way. Together we are stronger and we are definitely not alone!     
We're all in this together.
Not drinking with you today!
