I am very glad to have found this sub.  I am amazed at the support offered here. After struggling with alcohol abuse for quite some time I've decided to stop drinking for the next 40 days.  During this period with a sober mind I intend to evaluate this issue and decide whether I am willing to seriously commit to lifelong abstinence. ..I come from a family where alcoholism is somewhat prevalent. From severe DTs to DUIs I've seen the devastating affects of my mother's alcoholism.  Allowing my alcohol abuse to progress into alcohol dependence frightens me more than anything.  I certainly don't want my own family to have to deal with what my siblings and I experienced. ..But I am not alcohol dependent (yet). I don't drink every day and when I do I typically don't have more than a few.  Every now and then however I am unable to control my drinking get blackout drunk and make terrible and dangerous decisions (many of which I do not remember). I become someone that is far different from my sober self. These instances are becoming more frequent. I cannot seem to control them. I spend days afterwards recovering from the depression anxiety regret and the physical effects of these blackouts. ..So why wait to hit "rock bottom" like my mother?  I have an unhealthy and dangerous relationship with alcohol. If I continue down this route it is only a matter of time before I end up in serious trouble...

Welcome! This is a good place and you are among kind people!
Wise decision!  Welcome to SD this sub is extremely supportive!
Very similar to my situation! I'm 13 days in and have never felt better. Keep it going!! All the best.
I'm taking an "evaluation period" too! I've been making a list of questions over the past month or so during both the good times and the bad that I can weigh with a clear head. Here are a few pros and cons I've come up with so far to help with my decision as to where to go next:..**Alcohol Pros**..- fast easy way to treat or reward myself..- something I enjoy when I have had a very difficult time enjoying life since childhood..- makes most social situations easier (I've never had social problems due to drinking)..- I can escape pain when it hurts too much to be conscious ..**Alcohol Cons**..- consumption has kept creeping up over the past decade and that will lead to social and health problems..- current rate of consumption gives me an increased chance of liver cancer and other health complications..- messes with my sleep which messes with my mood which can destabilize my whole damn life..- bad for my skin..- bad for my waistline which then affects my self esteem..- does weird things to my priorities. Hanging out at a social gathering and finding myself suddenly not caring about our interactions and just waiting for the chance to crack another beer doesn't feel right..- sometimes leaves me trapped and unable to drive when I need to..Overall my goal is to figure out whether alcohol will make my life *harder* or *easier* over the next 5 years or so and plan accordingly. I've never quite been a daily drinker and I don't black out or drive drunk but I know this path is slippery and the rope holding me back from sliding into those actions is threads at best and that fear is real. Until I have a rope I trust I don't want to keep pushing my luck...Keep us posted with how your sober experience goes! I'm certainly going to be keeping my updates here.
Welcome! Rock bottom is when you choose to stop digging.
Your story sounds just like mine. I've just finished day 2 also and working on 3. I come from a family of alcoholics and know it's in my genes too. ..My mother committed suicide after years of alcohol abuse and afterwards my father finally drank himself to death. I could start to see myself spiraling down the same pathway. I decided to just stop for good before I get to the point that they did. Good luck. I know that you'll make it.
Thanks for the support everyone! I look forward to not drinking with you.
