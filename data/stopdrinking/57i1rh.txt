I'm struggling a lot with general sadness and grumpiness so I decided I needed to pick one thing in my life that was feeling good. Answer: my poops. About 3 or 4 days ago I started having decent movements for the first time in forever. My stomach was WRECKED for the first 10 days or so of not drinking. I'm finally feeling like a normal pooper. So that's my reason for not drinking today: happy poops tomorrow.

Hahaha - thanks for posting! Sorry you're not feeling so well today but your post on poops did make me LOL - cheered me up a bit :)
Now were talking about a good story that started with a salad!
No more stacking mud
well done! 
Great poops start with salads.
Even on your worst day sober there's always the poops.
That's very well articulated. 
Never underestimate the cathartic power of an excellent shit.
Ah shit! I'm moving tomorrow so all of my books are packed which means I can't pull out Infinite Jest and quote you an extremely relevant extremely hilarious passage. Remind me in a couple days!
it took me a few weeks to even get an appetite back. now i eat every few hours and ive lost weight. no more "skinny-fat" tits (im not a girl).
