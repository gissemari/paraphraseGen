I'm so sorry for you loss. I'll join you in not drinking. 
Nothing changes if nothing changes. What tangible actions are you going to take to remain sober?
I am sorry for your loss and hope your family is comforted on all sides. I will not drink with you today too.
What the hell is wrong with your boss? I would mention that to HR that's absolutely uncalled for an inappropriate. 
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.  Sending healing prayers to you and your family.  Your boss is pure evil.  But please don't worry about him/her right now.  Your sobriety and peace has infinitely more worth.  I won't drink with you today. 
Your boss sounds like an asshole. It is totally inappropriate for him to comment to anyone about your situation regardless of his opinion. The other commentor is right you should definitely take it to HR. What a giant douche bag.
