They often go together don't they? Started out Saturday drinking beer then graduated to the hard stuff. Boss texted Tuesday wondering where I was at. I resigned right then (had been mulling this for a while anyway but it would be nice to not be jobless!) continued with blackout levels of drunkenness up till yesterday spent a fortune buying stuff online too.. jeez this needs to stop. Recovering is a bitch this time around sore throat from vomiting orange pee breath like death.. TMI..? ..The worst part though is what it does to friends &amp; family relationships. They are watching you kill yourself not quickly like with a gun but that's what it is. I can't seem to quit for my own sake but maybe they are what can motivate me. Good luck too all struggling out there today and better believe I won't drink with you today!

It's a struggle but stay focused. IWNDWYT

Take any motivator and run with it. Ultimately you have to quit for YOU but you will figure that out the longer you are sober. IWNDWYT!
You can do it. It's nice on the other side.
