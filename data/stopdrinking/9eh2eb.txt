I have been abusing alcohol for five years now. Maybe longer. It is hard to tell. It was a way to "mute" my brain. To make me feel better. But now it is just causing issues. I am having suicidal thoughts more frequently. I find myself going into work still drunk. I know that I have a problem but I keep relapsing. I haven't sought the proper help. I haven't managed to go one week without having a drink. Nothing is seemingly getting better and my drinking is getting worse. I posted today in /r/SuicideWatch because today I woke up again feeling like garbage both physically and mentally. I am at a low point in my life and I need to sort my shit out. I haven't done laundry in two weeks my apartment (until the end of October thanks to my room mate) is a complete mess I am a complete mess. I need to change something. I won't be able to go to an AA meeting this week but I am planning to go. It is going to be hard but the only one who can change  my life is me. First thing though: stop drinking.

It's the alcohol talking.  I used to hear:  you can't live with it and you can't live without it.  Makes a person feel pretty desperate hearing that all day long...But it's a BIG FAT LIE.  We absolutely can live without it.  And please forgive the cliche but Life Is Good...We have to give ourselves a chance to realize that.  And we do that when we Stop Drinking...So you are on the right track!..And if you haven't read Annie Grace's This Naked Mind it's a real eye opener.
Good luck. If you haven't been to a meeting before check out the sidebar of the r/alcoholism subreddit. There are links to two articles about what it is like to go to your first meeting. ..IWNDWYT
