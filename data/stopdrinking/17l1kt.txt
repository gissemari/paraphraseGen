I've been going through a rough time with a breakup from my GF who had become suicidal and seemingly dependent on our relationship for her self worth. Long and short of it is she has made the breakup very difficult involved the courts and dragged it out. In thanking my parents for their support I finally told them a bit of my recent struggle..."It is very unfortunate and sadly there was very much I think I could have done to stop things from getting to this point. While I know that [GF] has her own problems and I don't agree with the way they are approaching this I suppose it is within their rights. I know however that I made many mistakes. One of them is that I have yet to fully address my alcohol problem. ..On Saturday night when [GF] was driving around acting wildly I made the decision to shut down and drink. I couldn't stay sober and keep my head and heart in the game. And on Sunday evening after her father was here and had taken her to the apartment I again avoided my feelings of hurt and sadness by drinking. I could have gone out there to help him to be there for her. But instead I made the dumb choice to turn to alcohol again. ..Mind you my drinking isn't quite as bad as it was when I lived in the DC area years ago. But it certainly did not help my relationship with [GF] my plans for the future or the two of you. I am very sorry for once again putting you through a difficult time in worrying about me. ..My last drink was this past Saturday night (1/26). Yesterday I went to a meeting during lunch. I plan to do the same today. It is going to be a long road for my family friends and myself. I know that I cannot drink anymore. "
