I relapsed three weeks ago - started drinking every other day until it was everyday and day drinking included. I had one day sober (went somewhere w parents) and I was already getting the shakes. Everyday for 3 weeks. ..I stopped cold turkey last weekend. My boyfriend was putting his foot down on it. I got through 4-5 days of withdrawals and eventually they simmered I felt okay and hopeful again that I could keep it off. Then two nights ago I had moderate amount of wine. We were at a bar. I gave in. I woke up hungover and spent most of yesterday curing said hangover (my organs have been freaking out) ..Now I'm awake woken up in sweat and withdrawal symptoms no other and I'm justifying to myself in my head how a bottle of wine right now at 9am will be a good idea for me bc it will make me more productive (withdrawal is crippling me rn)

No.  Just no.  Been there tried that. It won't help and sooner or later you'll have to sweat it all out...  maybe see a doctor there are meds which can help.

Wait you've decided to stop booze once and for all and you're fighting with yourself? Hard to justify stopping saving yourself from saving your life...I have GAD. Chamomile tea drunk in liter quantities takes the edge off enough to let me catch my breath and sleep for ~four hours...I also found that a brisk walk (as far as you need to work the jitters off...) works especially *with* the tea...CBD is also effective...You can do this...IWNDWYT
