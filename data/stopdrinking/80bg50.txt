My sober weekend went well in the sense that I didn't drink. I managed to get a glimpse of the relief I hope to find being sober because I didn't have to hide my drinking. Yesterday it was strange my Mrs came home from work and everytime she went out to the kitchen I had my usual panic that she was going to find my empty bottles this would last a few seconds until I remembered that she can't find empties because they aren't there! So I'm looking forward to getting to the point that I'm not wasting half of my mental energy think up ingenious ways to hide my drinking and the other half thinking up ways to surreptitiously get a drink in me...But today will be hard. Every relapse has happened on a Monday. Work is hard and Mondays are the worst. My Mrs will head out to work until around 10 (I get home around 6) and this is when the lie begins. Usually I'll run to the shop grab a bottle of cheap red hide it in my bag until she leaves then do the bottle over an hour. Then I'll fall asleep for an hour and then spend the next 2 hours trying to cover the smell with cheese and tea...But not today! Work will suck I can't control that but I can force myself to bypass the shop. Once I get home I can't leave (I have young children so can't run to the shop) so all I have to do is not go shopping after work. ..IWNDWYT

Don't take any money or credit cards until you feel strong enough. 
Your story reminds me that drinking is so mentally exhausting.. All the lies remembering what bullshit you said to whom hiding booze hiding empty bottles secretly taking the trash out etc etc..I'm very glad for your sober weekend and really hope you can get past today...IWNDWYT
Totally relate to all this!!
