Hey guys day one here....For most of my early to mid 20s I was a severe alcoholic lost everything and slowly rebuilt since then....I had been toying with having a few drinks here and there lately and have been partaking in some beverages.  But I didn't have any at the house a few days ago so I thought let's hit the bar!...So I go to the old stomping grounds and see some of my old buddies and let's just say the bender has finally ended and I cannot handle the hangover like I could when I was younger and the novelty of a perpetual blackout is still long gone....Now we let the battle rage in my head if I just fall back into doing this all the time or if I should try to get back on the saddle.  Life's a wild ride.

All I cam say is get back on it.  I'm goimg through similar right now.. Wasted 9 months of sobriety went on an epic 2 week bender that got dark.  Checked myself into a psych hospital and yet the first thing I did when I got out was drink.  A gallon of vodka over a 3 day period later I guess I figured I do want to live.  I've been sober 3 days now and haven't been able to sleep at all sitting in a flea bag motel because I've burned everything else in my life waiting for a bed in a rehab to open up. Here I was thinking the six months in jail and losing my fiancee over it was rock bottom but jokes on me.  Long winded because I need to get this off my chest (literally people fighting and breaking glass outside in this trap motel so I'm pretty much holed up) but don't give up.  I've put myself through hell and I still don't want to give up.

I highly suggest pedialite or a knockoff if you can find it. I also suggest the Sinclair method if you ever plan on doing that again should put more time between you're relapses.
