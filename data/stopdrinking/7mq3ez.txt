I don't post on here often but I truly do appreciate this forum. I think all of you whether it be a person that is on day one or a person that is 3650 days in is to be admired for either seeking or simply giving support. To think about the fact that total strangers support one another is proof that the world we live in is not all that bad. I'm approaching eight years of sobriety and those who have given me support will forever be appreciated. I hope and pray that those who are going through the struggle stay strong and succeed. Here's to a great 2018. I will not drink with you today.
