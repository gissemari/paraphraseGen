Hello ..I'm Slowfive this will be my first post in this community.  My arrival here is one of many first steps towards a sober future.  ..I have been struggling for the last 10 years with alcohol addiction and in the last six months I have started to make more of an effort to seriously stop drinking for good.  ..Of course I have failed many times and every time I pick myself up and try again. Every time I slip I feel like i'm starting from even lower in the gutter.  I am joining this community and others to try and dig myself out of this trap and start over...My best friend and my family all know I am struggling and are supportive and I know if I don't try and heal myself now I will only get worse and they may even give up on me.  This may be my last shot before something life shattering that I cant recover from happens and I need to find the tools to make it work...I want to thank this community for being here to take in another member willing to finally commit to a sober future.  I'm posting this mostly for myself so that i can come back and check it one day with a nice big number next to my name...Again thanks for being here.

Welcome and congratulations!....As a newbie myself I can tell you that you've made a great decision with sobriety and this SD community. After a couple decades of heavy drinking I have never felt better and more in control of my life than I do today!
