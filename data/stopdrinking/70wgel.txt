I knew it was going to happen. Family events are the worst. Everyone was so drunk and basically shoving alcohol into my face. My anxiety is through the roof today. The reason I wanted to quit drinking was the depression I'd feel after a binge. I wasn't drinking every day before but when I did drink I'd go for a couple days. I would end up feeling like killing myself and then be sober long enough to forget those feelings. The cycle would just repeat. I thought I had it under control this time around but obviously not.  Feeling really sad today. I'm just disappointed in myself.

Just dont dig yourself deeper. You can always come back just focus forward and dont feel guilty my friend.
I know. The feeling. It is when I wake up WITHOUT the sour stomach. The heartburn. The sweats and the pounding headache.  That is what I think about. LAST week during Hurricane Irma We were evacuated twice. And we ended up taking refuge with my family. A huge trigger for me. I came close to drinking however thinking about how I would feel the next day kept me from having that 1st one.  I went hour by hour during that time. Not day by day. I would  tell myself I am not going to drink this hour.  It worked.  Before long it was bedtime.  It's amazing  how we can trick our brains !
