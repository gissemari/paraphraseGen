I relapsed in late October and have pretty much fallen back into my old drinking ways. I had about 8 months dry when I picked back up. It doesn't feel good to drink and I keep putting off things I need to do with the mindset of "I'll do it when I quit drinking again". I'm gonna reset my badge today see my therapist go to a meeting and maybe journal a bit tonight. I started drinking again because I was sad and forgot how shitty drinking made me feel but also because I'm an alcoholic and I will find any excuse to drink if I let myself. I'm gonna check in here later for accountability tonight. Thanks y'all.

Any excuse is right. Sad happy indifferent we'll find a way to justify it somehow. Best of luck! 
I feel you are going to have a wonderful clear headed sharp minded 2017 my friend. Stay the course!
Somewhere on SD there's a post about "playing the tape forward" I've been clinging to that the past 11 days. I recognize the urge then picture what happens after. It's an ugly scene that plays out so I'm not drinking with you today.
