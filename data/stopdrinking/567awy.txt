This is one of those southern drinking holidays that I can not participate in this hurricane.  
----------immediate responses--------

I am just convincing myself that unlike past hurricanes this one is not a joke - it's a killer and getting drunk now will be a terrible decision if quick decisions are required.
What's a hurricane party?
I'm in rehab in south Florida (I live here also) so we aren't drinking here but I am certainly craving it and seeing people post pics on facebook of parties isn't helping (so I'm not looking at that anymore) but damn will I be glad when I wake up tomorrow sober and not hung over. .I will not drink with you today!
I hope you're hanging in there!!  Not drinking with you this Saturday night :-)
