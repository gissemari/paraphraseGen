**u/Dartaga is no longer able to host next week's DCI so the spot is open to anyone interested.**..*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*..***. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up...***. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---..Thursday! We're getting closer to the weekend thankfully! I had an awesome day off yesterday and am really glad I decided to be spontaneous and take some time to myself...Now past 8 months I find myself cautiously comfortable in my sobriety. While I don't think of drinking as an option anymore this experience has taught me that for better or for worse my brain is emotional and impulsive. Not saying it's a bad thing - just something that I try to remain aware of...And now I'm on to my next journey: FINALLY getting back into shape. I've been uncomfortable with my weight and fitness level for a long time now and alcohol made losing weight nearly impossible. However those excess calories have gone and it's on me too start holding myself to a higher standard with what I eat...I find myself drawing parallels to when I stopped drinking. I'll go a couple days of eating well feel overwhelmed by how difficult it is and then cave in and eat even worse than I ever did before. Just like my struggles with alcohol this cycle is demoralizing. So what am I going to do??..First stop putting myself on the clock. I'm trying to avoid the thought of "I need to achieve X weight by X time." I was guilty of that when I kept relapsing with alcohol. What changed everything for me was narrowing my focus. One day at a time. One small victory at a time. Try your best again the following day but don't worry about tomorrow until tomorrow...If you're struggling I'm back at day #1 with all of you in a sense  . I'm going to give it everything I've got to make good decisions today and not put the pressure of tomorrow on myself. As always I'm proudly not drinking with you today!!!!
----------immediate responses--------

Good morning. I'm up bright and early after a nice early 10pm bed time. 3 weeks has flown by looking forward to the big 30 days now! Looking forward to not drinking with you today.
Good morning! Did my 13km (like 8 miles) bike ride to work today and rocked it in 35 minutes on a normal city bike (Dutch thing). Feeling really energetic and ready to take anything heads on! ..Not drinking with you today!
Nada no liquoring today life's too short too much good stuff to do! Yeah!
Morning! I think you have made a really important link in terms of eating well and sobriety.  One day at a time!  I am still learning that one. .I have a little chart at the back of my journal and each day that I stick to my plan to avoid alcohol I get to add a shiny circle sticker to the chart.  Then I write the date of the next day ready for my next sticker.  Trying to combine my love of star charts with a "one day at a time" overall approach!.Last night was harder but today I feel happy with myself - this early phase seems to be a lot about breaking former associations between people/events and booze..Very happy not to be drinking with you today - have a good one!.
Yesterday was super hard. I woke up 30 minutes ago and panicked a little about being hangover. Felt so blessed after realizing I am not because I didn't have a drink yesterday. I will do this again today. I will not drink today with y'all.
Happy Thursday all ! Not drinking with you today!
Good night last night made it through a dinner party without wanting to drink! The mornings are hardest for the anxiety though I keep thinking of more embarrassing moments and feeling sick..Regardless I will not drink with you today!
Good morning! I'm so happy to be sober to be feeling healthier and more energetic. ..Not drinkin' with ya'll today  
I will not drink today. I got a statement from a special doctor and I have a very long sick leave. We are talking about months. Well got some time to suffer my alcoholism in peace. Cannot say that I'm recovered it would be a big lie. But I accept my shadow. 
not drinking today
I will not drink today...Still feeling pretty lousy. Any advice for how to stop feeling sad and lethargic?
Have a good Thursday guys. I won't drink with you today  
Good afternoon     not drinking with you today !!
Not today b*tch
I am not drinking today! Let's make it a good one! And if you can't make it a good one just get through it  
Morning all you lovely people. Today I Will not drink with you all  
You guys.  Today I will spend the afternoon in a lawyers office trying to settle financials between my ex husband and I. This is something I would be getting through usually by looking forward to a bottle of wine tonight when it's over.  But tonight I will go to a meeting and pick up my 30 day chip.   That chip is what is going to get me through this day.  I will not drink with all of you today.  I will not.  
Just got back from dinner at the pub washed down with a ginger beer   Very happily not drinking with you all today!
I've missed a few check ins with some major life changes lately but I've been applying the Special Procedures day-by-day. Still here still rocking in the free world...Dry as a sandbath in summer and beginning to reap the rewards. Not drinking with you all today.
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today. Hope you have a great day! xo
Not drinking today! No way no how!
I'm not drinking today!
I will not drink today. Going to be a tough day. But I am going to handle all things that come my way. 
The next few days will be high stress but I'm ready.  I made a first stab at stopping drinking during hurricane Matthew but relapsed soon after before finally stopping a few weeks later.  But I know from that experience that being sober and aware helps infinitely.  I will not drink today.
Funny you say that u/xJToews19 because that's how I'm doing it too. I (re)started eating keto the same day I stopped drinking and doing it the same way; one day at a time...Today I'm not drinking. And today I'm eating the right way for me.
I will not drink today.  
I will not drink today 
I will not drink today SD...Take care my friends..
Red five standing by.

I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
Had a day at work that ended with a stressful meeting with my boss and I'm coping with it by going to eat some delicious food with a friend (who doesn't drink) and going to bed early I'm exhausted. I will not drink with you today!

I will not drink today!

I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. 
Not drinking today
The trans support group last night was pretty rough. Just not a good fit for my personality and the one girl sitting next to me was clearly wasted reeking of whisky. I made it home without picking up though and I've got my addiction recovery group tonight so guess what y'all: I'M NOT DRINKING TODAY!..Hope the rest of you enjoy the day - hard to believe it's already Thursday again! Take care of yourselves lovelies. You deserve it...- Emma
Not drinking today!
Tuesday was really hard yesterday felt really easy. Hopefully things keep getting easier but no matter what today brings I won't drink

I will not drink today. The benefit of not drinking last night is waking up at 5am tired but not feeling like shit.
Happy Thursday everyone! I will not drink today.
19 days and the drinking dreams have started. At least even in the dream I was thinking "ah shit I drank got to reset the badge." SD has definitely gotten into my head...I will not drink today..
Busy day at work today. Not drinking after! 
I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today. 
There are some books about Wheat Belly and are quite interesting as you will go through a withdrawal when you eliminate grains from your diet. So your parallels to alcohol are valid. Author is Dr. William Davis if you're interested. .I will not drink today!!           
Not drinking today Thursday September 7. 
I will not drink today!
I won't drink today dang it!
Made it through a day that was full of emotional dysregulation grief anger and didn't drink. Making the same pledge today.
I will not drink today. I am excited to check in here with you all!
Good morning all.   Working for the weekend. I will not drink with you all today 
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink today.
Had an opportunity to have a drink last night and I declined. I'm thinking a lot about the difference between missing out  and losing out. Some things it's just okay to miss out on it it means the trade off works in my favor. I seem to have come down with a cold or sinus thing so I'm feeling a little spaced out and low energy. Some gentle yoga and continuing the job search are priorities. Definitely not going to drink today.
I have to work....but that means no time for drinking!
  
I will not drink today. 
  FTZ!
I will not drink with y'all today!
Good Morning Everyone- I wish you all a great sober day- I will not drink with you today.
My mom posted a meme about drinking at work on her Instagram. It made me want to drink bit put my decision not to into a better perspective. I don't want to have to desperately reach for a bottle. I can tackle the day. I'm not going to drink today.
I will not drink today! 
Day one for me. I've taken time out from work just to do this. I have 10 days at home to detox. No alcohol for me today. 
Not drinking today!
I will not drink today. 
Busy day today! None for me thanks!
This is the first day in a long time that I've woken up before noon. I will not drink today. 
No matter what happens today good or bad I will not drink any alcohol for the next 24 hours.
I will not drink today.
Not drinking today!

Happily not drinking today :)

I will not drink with you today!
Today I'm grateful that - just for today - I won't allow myself to be enslaved by the booze aisle.  It crazy how much energy I had been investing in making sure I didn't run out!!!!    Thank you SD and take care of yourselves today.   
I'm in! No drinking today for me. 
I will not drink with you today!
Day 248. Not going to drink today either.

I have to get up at 4 am to catch a 6 am flight to DC tomorrow. Oof. But I get to spend a long weekend with friends hanging out eating lots of yummy foods and hopefully seeing a couple of museums. Thankfully most of the people going don't drink so I don't think I'll be tempted. 
I won't drink today

Another great day NOT to drink!
A week woohoo! Can't wait to get to those double-digits. The "rationalizing" voice has been whispering to me lately ("oh come on...you can moderate. Just one or two...") but I've been telling it to STFU. I'm over that nonsense now. ..Glad to be here with all of you and NOT drinking today! 
2 days on the books into day 3. The physical withdrawal feels about done (hopefully). Not drinking today regardless.
Not much to say except 11 and counting - IWNDWYT!
Checking in and ready for another great sober day. 
no matter what i'm not drinking today - FTZ
I will not be drinking today. 
New here.  Just want to see my badge

Checking in at day 3... no longer a lurker because this sub has given me strength and purpose!.Not drinking today. .For myself my kids and my relationships!

Going to be a long weekend at work. ANNDD I got called in early today. But I still will come home and do healthy things. I will not drink with you today! 
No drinking today  
I will not drink today
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today no matter what.  Yep I feel the same way about other addictive behaviors as I do about alcohol.  TV and food are escapism behaviors for me and I have a similar relationship to them as I do alcohol although not as destructive.  One day at a time also works for me with them although I don't seem to take it as seriously since it doesn't present as clear of a danger as alcohol did.  Great job at recognizing this and working to make the change you want!
I will not drink today.
I've been working on losing weight and getting in shape for about three months. my legs are noticeably stronger but I weigh about the same with the same damn fat fucking belly!  Lol. It is definitely a challenge. Either way I would take sober and fat over skinny and drinking. I will not drink today!
Going through the most stressful week in decades wanting that first drink has come back with a vengeance.  Posting here to stay the course; I will not drink alcohol today no matter how much worse (or maybe better?) the stress becomes.
I won't drink today!
Don't even feel Like drinking I will not drink with me tonight. 
Bit late to the party here from Australia as it's technically the 8th for me now (just coming up to bedtime!) but I did not drink with all of you yesterday and I will not drink with you today either! Coming up on 90 days down under. Best of luck to everyone and good work so far!

I have no time with this stupid hurricane coming! I'm spending today doing last minute emergency errands. Please keep us in your prayers as we brace for impact...As of Sunday I may not be able to check in because we WILL lose power etc. but I won't let Irma destroy my sobriety. 
Not drinking with you all today - good luck all.
I'm not drinking today but I want to. My train stop to get to work has all the ads for my favorite IPA. I want to go into the bar at the bottom of the stairs and pour a bubbly one into a glass and forget about all the stress of the things I should be doing. But I'm doing the things because I know that will actually make me feel better and accomplished. 
Not drinking with you good people today. ..I'll never drink again and I'll never change my mind. I may be over 70 years old but it feels really good to say I'm a work in progress. ..kinda like predicting a really long time to the future. ..lol..
Not going to drink today! All you beautiful people have a great Thursday!!!
Not drinking today or tonight watching NFL football. Go Pats!

Another awesome alcohol-free day coming up - woohoo!
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today. I'm so tired but that's mainly due to my I daughter's sleep...well I can't really call them habits. I'm about to go to my therapist's office and tell her the good news. Loving this already!
Not drinking today so I can have another joyfully-awake morning without a hangover tomorrow.
Woohoo Day 2! Not drinking today!
Not drinking with you today and making as many conscious choices as I can to live my best life and love myself--for the long term not the short. Much love! 
Day 4 - Went to the gym yesterday and for a bicycle ride today. Starting to feel better but still having sleeping and stomach problems. Not drinking today!

I will not drink today.
Happy to say I will not drink with you today! 
 Not today.
Work I really busy just now and historically I'd put a lot of pressure on myself and end up going daft on the drink to cope with it. Not this time mofos...I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today. Need to cram a week's worth of to-dos into a single day so I can head for NYC in the morning!
I will not drink today! 
I will not drink with you today.
I will not drink with y'all today
I won't drink today! 
3 MONTHS! HOLY SHIT. 3 months ago I was telling myself I couldn't do it. I would try for a day and fail by the time I got home from work. But now I'm sober healthy picking up new hobbies and all around feeling so much better. I love it. Thank y'all for the help. I won't drink with you today.
I'm so tired but it's because my daughter was up from 3-6 am and woke at 9. So I got about 3.5 hours of sleep. I'm so tired I thought I already checked in today. I'm so tired I ordered the completely wrong coffee (hot Americano rather than iced latte). ..I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today! 
I will not drink today. 
The simple affirmation in the title just boosted me 1000-fold. Thank you!
IWNDWYT even though I want to.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.
Had a dream last night that I drank a beer and had to reset my badge. I was pretty bummed about it. Good thing it wasn't real. Not drinking today!
It's been a long and draining day.  But hey I'm not going to drink tonight. 
I will not drink today! 
I will not drink with any of you today.
National holiday here and i'm bored really bored but i won't drink today...dOUBLE DIGITS TO ME
Doing good. Feeling great. Keeping it going. I will not drink with you all today!
Day number 2. I was jet lagged last night so sleep came easy. Started a new fitness routine today so hopefully that helps too.
227 days and I haven't even thought about alcohol lately.  I quit smoking weed 38 days ago and that is also going great.  ..I finally found a buyer and negotiated a price on my Harley yesterday.  I've been trying to sell it since March.  I'm hoping to get something that'll act as a middle ground between riding a Grom and my goal of owning a 1000+cc superbike.  I need to become more mature before I've got a 200hp beast between my legs.  Those recent [Panigales](http://www.ducati.com/cms-web/upl/img/bikes/2015/Model_page_main_img/Superbike/Model-Page_2015_SBK1299S_Red_01_960x420.jpg) are sooo sexy!
So....my badge isn't entirely honest...I had a 6 pack of Guinness on Sunday over 8 hours at DnD and on Wednesdays I go to a brewery for game night and had 4 light beers...But all of that is a fraction of what I had before my badge started. ..I don't plan on any drinks for DnD this week and maybe 2-3 for game night...I don't know if I want to 100% give up alcohol but the less the better...Now I just need to stop filling the void with junk food or non-alcoholic beer...
Feeling great today! Spent most of the day collecting more wood chips for my garden and now my yard is really beginning to look like the miniature plant based homestead I've been dreaming of. Out and about with the family now and looking forward to a relaxing evening with some fiddle playing art fundamentals and herbal tea drinking. Good so grateful I am literally seeing my dream of a hippie permaculture homestead coming true. I will choose to not poison my body nor my mind today I will eat healthy vegan foods today I will not put ethanol in my mouth today!
Day 90 here! I will not drink with you today!

Had a rough couple of days with depression. Today has been good so far. Had a good class with lots of student engagement. Looking forward to going home in 20 minutes...Not drinking today. 
I had early training today so didn't have a chance to check in earlier. Still sober and I will not drink today!
Hi everyone. I'm not drinking today.
I  will not drink today!
Made it most of today so far although I had repeated urges to just go to the shop two minutes away and buy some wine to lock myself in my bedroom with. Didn't do it though. Having a shop this close is very convenient but so damn tempting...My roommate is on their way home and is apparently drunk. I haven't been around drunk people since I've been sober. I don't know how it's going to make me feel. 
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today!
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!
10 year wedding anniversary in Vegas this weekend. Never been sober in Vegas...Not drinking today though. I am not doing that today. 
Day 60. Steady. 
I won't be drinking with you all today!
Can't believe how organized my life as been without drinking! New school year for the kids and the mornings have been a breeze! I feel so bad for yelling when I was hungover all the time.  It wasn't their fault we are all having better mornings now. I will not drink today!

The day is almost over for me but I did not and will know drink today! Today was my 18th AA meeting of my 90/90 goal. I can't wait to get my 30 day chip next week! 
No drinking today...
You can do this Toews. What worked for me is cutting breakfast because eating one less meal tricks myself into eating fewer calories. Also tons and tons of coffee helps me fight the morning hunger pangs. ..Not gonna drink today. .
