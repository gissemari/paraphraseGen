Anyone else notice while being sober you can't help but to wake up early now? A part of me misses the ability to sleep in but I really enjoy waking up sober and refreshed for the next day. 9 days! Tomorrow will be a struggle.

Nothing like getting up earlier and feeling good.  I have been getting up a good hour or so earlier.

Hmmm not yet.  But I'm still finding getting to sleep difficult so that's probably why.  Mind you I've never in my life liked waking up or getting up early so I'll be very miffed if that starts to happen!  Why will Day 10 be a struggle if you don't mind me asking?
Not only waking up earlier but waking up in a good mood!  I love it!
