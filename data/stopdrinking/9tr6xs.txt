I (m29) have been drinking nearly every day since 2006.  Aside from the births of my children and a stretch of probation around 08'.  Recently I had 3 weeks sober then relapsed.  Hard.  Back up to half a bottle of whiskey every night a couple beers.    2 of my children have special needs their mother is a superhero and went right into advocate mode.  My reaction was to have a full break down retreated into intoxication.  I failed a lot of people I love.  I have been blind to a lot these last few years.  I had a serious depressive episode last time I stopped so I'm sure this will be a bumpy ride but enough is enough.  Tomorrow is a new day and I will not drink with you.  Thanks for hearing me out.

Tomorrow might be hard but it can be a good day! 
You got this man! Are you working a program at all? You're here that's what's important just try to do the next right thing.
Good luck.  Today was my day 1 and it was brutal.  I don't have your exact story but close.  You can do this.  We both can. 
It could be worse.  Old Yiddish proverb..Don't take this as a threat or fear mongering but what if your wife is overburdened taking care of little kids AND a big kid too?  What if she realizes the money spent on drink could buy food instead? ..I don't like saying someone else has  got  to do anything but it might be time for taking inventory of what is good in your life and what you can do without if it comes to choosing between drink or that other stuff called  a life. 
Maybe try getting medical help/support this time?  
We have got your back hunker down you can do. Sounds like you have a great partner and a family that needs you sober hopefully they will be motivators for you..Wishing you strength and IWNDWYT
