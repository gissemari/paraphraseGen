I've only once gone longer than one day without a drink in the last 13 years. My "weekends only" drinking stopped before I had even turned 19. But I did once take a few days off of it. That was about a year ago when my girlfriend asked me to stop with her. I made it four days before I convinced myself that I wasn't the one with the problem...Well I've probably spent most of my life telling myself that I wasn't the one with the problem...&amp;#x200B;..The first red flag that alcohol was an issue for me probably should have been my DUI. But I just told myself I was just being young and reckless and that I couldn't have possibly been an alcoholic considering I wasn't even old enough to drink legally at the time...&amp;#x200B;..Fast forward through college letting frat parties dominate the time I should have been studying and working on getting a job after graduation. Then through my 20s spending a whole year in anticipation of going to a music festival only to miss the bands I wanted to see because I couldn't spend an hour without a drink outside the beer gardens. Then a few years ago meeting an amazing woman one who I didn't realize had the same latent tendencies as me. Tendencies that she became self-aware of long before I did...&amp;#x200B;..So here we are after a blurry few years last Friday I got the news that I would not have a job in a few weeks. (Amazingly enough this did not have anything to do with my drinking.)  It came not long after a devastating tax bill that has left me penniless and indebted to both family and the bank. A pretty bad situation and I probably don't have to tell you what made it worse.  My girlfriend and I spent the evening trying to drown our stressful situation in bottle after bottle after bottle. I spilled wine on my laptop completely destroyed it (and this is probably the third time I've done that to a computer)...&amp;#x200B;..I don't remember waking up the next morning. I only remember that I was sitting in my kitchen some time in the morning continuing to drink. I had gone through two bottles of sake that morning before I even realized what I was doing. It literally took being on the phone with my mom and hearing her ask me if I was drinking to even see that I had a drink in my hand...&amp;#x200B;..I don't remember much of it but I spent five hours that day on the phone with my parents my friends crying and  making a complete damn fool of myself. I remember at one point looking down at my phone I had been on a call with my buddy for 90 minutes and I didn't even know that it was him I was talking to. Being a loud drunken fool I also managed to say some things that ended up being very untrue and very hurtful to the woman I love. We fought for hours after that...&amp;#x200B;..I woke up yesterday morning in maybe the worst shape I have ever been in. My body was in such rough shape that even taking a few steps would cause my head to throb to the point I thought I was going to die. I've had plenty of hangovers in fact I've been hung over more often than not these past few years but this was something else.  After a few hours of trying to sober up I felt like I should do what I always do and just \*one drink\* to take the edge off. The sun was almost setting anyways! So I poured myself a drink had a couple of sips and instead of that halcyon haze of my pain disappearing I felt like my brain was going to explode. What had happened to me? My beloved drink was answering me with unbelievable pain? That was the moment I realized that I was killing myself with this stuff and it had to stop...&amp;#x200B;..I was too sick to go to the store to buy some advil. I was too sick to feed myself. I was too sick to realize the gravity of how much my drinking had harmed my already bad situation in just a day and a half...&amp;#x200B;..Well now I'm sick of it. I've let alcohol hold me back from so many opportunities. It's caused me to miss so many important events whether because I was too hung over to attend or because I chose to stay home and drink instead...&amp;#x200B;..My girlfriend who also struggles with alcohol she has asked me time and time and time again to stop drinking with her and time and time again I have thought I didn't have a problem that I didn't need to. I thought I could make gin and tonics at home and it wouldn't become an issue for her. I was a selfish ass. I'm fortunate that she's giving me another shot to clean up my act...&amp;#x200B;..So now I'm done with it. For today and I hope tomorrow and every day after that. I want to show her that I'm in it not only to support her but to save myself from an early grave. What kind of a husband and father would I be confining myself to sitting in front of the TV stinking of booze? Not the one I want to be...&amp;#x200B;..Feeling pretty good about the decision right now and I have a feeling that I'll be checking in with y'all around 5:00 when I'd usually be pouring myself a drink...&amp;#x200B;..Let's do this!..&amp;#x200B;..Edit: Fixed a couple sentences that made no sense.

How long have you been drinking that hard? Days? Weeks? Months? Years? Perhaps I missed that in your post. Alcohol isn't a drug that you can just 'stop' drinking without serious potential side effects like seizures strokes and even death. If it's been a long time and your body is used to having alcohol in it pretty much every day without stop then you may need medical attention to detox properly and make sure you don't end up in the ER or a graveyard. Totally serious here. If you start to feel shaky nervous sweaty warm to the touch or otherwise horrible feeling seek help and fast. It progresses (withdrawl symptoms) rapidly and can go from 'uncomfortable' to 'serious' to 'terminal' rather quick. Don't take chances seek help imho. Doing it without medical supervision is asking for trouble. Others may disagree but others may not have gone through this before.
Congrats on day one! Happy to hear that you're making the right choice for yourself and for your family.
