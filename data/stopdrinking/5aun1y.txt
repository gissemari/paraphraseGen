I just found out.  He died just two days after I stopped drinking.  I haven't seen him in three years.  His wife stopped by my old house but I had moved out of town.  She just sent me an email.  He was such a loving kind fun man.  He had struggled with pain meds and alcohol for years after an injury.  I think he was only 50 or 55. ..My earlier sadness of the day seems sentimental and easy after hearing this news.  His poor family.  They didn't see it coming.  It's awful. ..I'm glad that I am sober.  I will not drink today in honor of my friend.

Ugh. I'm sorry for your loss. I won't drink with you.
That's tough. My thoughts are with you 
I'm sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss. I'll honor his memory by having a sparkling water. 
I am so sorry to hear that it just seems way too young and so very unfair.
I'm so sorry for your loss. Death is so difficult. I won't drink with you today to honor him. Hugs.
