I've been sober 60 days today and feeling pretty good. I'm young [25] but all my friends are parents they only go out once every few months I made it clear to them that although I've stopped drinking I'd like to be invited to these outings. .Going out to the bar with my friends wasn't a struggle but I've always been the "coordinator" telling them what drinks to getwhere we should go etc. I'd always over drink and "be the life of the party." After this particular outting I felt empty as hell like they weren't enjoying my company as much as they would of if I was the childless partier they live vicariously though when I was drinking. .Ever since I have felt really isolated from them. If they've been going out I haven't gotten the memo. .I've just been feeling isolated from my group of friends. ..How do some of you veterans of being sober deal with these feelings of isolation?

I'd not call myself a veteran but for me the events that revolve mostly around drinking simply aren't for me anymore. ..If they're just get-togethers where people just happen to also drink then I'm absolutely fine. And once I got over the "I am not funny if I'm not drunk" I enjoyed them much more and noticed that I was actually funnier and more interesting (at least I hope :p) than when I was drinking. ..And the isolation you feel might also have to do with their different life as parents and common topics they have that you don't share. That's completely normal and happens at a certain point in life and doesn't necessarily have to do anything with drinking alcohol or not...Congratulations on 60 days! I wish I'd been that smart at your age.
