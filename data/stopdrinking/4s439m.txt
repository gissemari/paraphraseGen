I know I'm not alone in those feelings. I was recently fired from a job because of some interpersonal drama between me and a coworker. I was drinking and I can't handle anything when I'm doing that. My drunk antics and emotional theatrics caught up to me. It stopped being a juvenile self pitying bs game I was playing whether knowingly or not and got real. Im 34 but I feel like a  clueless and naive kid. ..At first I was shocked she showed interest in me. My self esteem has been shit for a while. It's ok now but I feel like I'm realistic. I've lived irresponsibly trashing relationships and opprotunities. I've taken advantage of my parents used people stolen lied cheated and just overall selfish and mean spirited. I'm not sure what I should feel good about. A self esteem seems like something I should earn and I don't feel like I've done that. At the same time I'm not doing any good making sure I suffer at every turn. Almost immediately after she showed interest I was expressing self loathing I'm a victim sentiments. I told her I wasn't ready for anything. But I'm sure people can relate to this no matter how much you think you need time when you're lonely and someone exceptional shows up and is interested it seemed impossible to not abandon myself in that. I know its codependent behavior. It just doesnt feel like it at the time. It feels good. It feels like escape. Its so hard to know the right thing to do by me and them when i get caught up in that longing feeling..My self sabatoge has made life an absolute nightmare for far too long. It's to the point where I can hardly trust my feelings about anything. I alieanted myself always running trying to put space between me and the past trying to start fresh. Before long I'd find myself caught up in something absurd again. If someone I was interested in showed any affection something in me would freak out. I would become desperate for their affection while distrustful and angry. I would resent them for something I couldn't put into words. I would assume the worst. I would get drunk and dump a decades worth of baggage. I would be nasty and unload scathing criticism out of nowhere. The next day I would be wrecked. I'd would profoundly hate and despise myself. No amount of apologies ever help. By trying to fix a thing it seems to only gets worse. I've known for a long time that I haven't been in any kind of shape to see someone. I have so much twisted. So much hypocrotical moralizing bs flies around. I don't know what I want need or value. I start to shrink into a shell of a person humiliated and terrified of what other kinds of hell im capable of perpetuating on myself. I want to be with someone but it feels almost impossible to let my guard down to open up or to simply chill the fuck out and not be so intense about things. But see I feel like I'm fighting for my life. You can't spend over a decade actively drinking your life away wishing you wouldn't wake up the next day and make it to the other side without a certain intensity. For me I think I need it in order to maintain sobriety. It's snuck up on me and I've lost so much because of it. I don't know how many more times I can survive hurting other people and treating myself like garbage. I've been sober a couple months. Every day is a struggle. I feel like a scared kid and I rarely feel like I'm doing the right thing. I'm not sure what that looks or feels like. I'm just trying to move forward. I'm not trying to to bury myself in regret and shame. However the lonliness feels oppressive at times. But it feels justified and oppropriate. I feel like I'm a bad and broken person getting what they deserve. I feel like I'll never be able to experience any intimacy again. I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with me with my thinking and my idea about how things are versus what I think I want or how I want them to be. There's so much about my behavior in the past that makes me want to abandon my personality my identity all together. I'm just really confused and lonely. The more I like someone the worse I behave. I think I need a long long period of sobriety and working on myself before I can feel well enough to be with someone. It's just hard to admit that for so many reasons. It's hard to have that patience. Despite everything I still care for this girl but it feels like it might be elaborate deception. I just dont know. ..I'm sorry I'm not contributing something more positive. It's just how I feel at the moment. It's just something I needed to express.

I think personalities do change for the better once we are sober.  The hard part is being patient and letting the process occur.  It is also easy for me to validate drinking again once the positive changes start appearing because I feel I have changed.  Indeed during times of sobriety I do change because I AM NOT DRINKING!     I suppose my point is to be patient and wait for the changes and then not forget why the changes occurred. (sobriety)  My interpersonal relationships are SO MUCH BETTER when I have extended sobriety times.  Hopefully you will get the same results.  Sober on!
