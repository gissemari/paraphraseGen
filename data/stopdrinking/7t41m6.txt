I am going to be ultra vigilant and not let the little monster (Easy Way reference there) catch me unawares...I am not going to drink today anyway I have already made that decision.

Excellent!..If the Booze Goblin shows up give him a swift kick in the arse for me......I won't drink with you today congrats on 3 weeks and keep going!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
You are a sentient octocustard.  Your name alone implies winning.  Let's go get this day!
Well done on 3 weeks! It is going to be one fine day little monster be damned. Onwards and upwards! (Kevin O'Hara)..I will not drink with you today!
Congrats on three weeks! I will try to remember to be on guard when I get to three (last night was seven days for me). It strikes me that every little anniversary is an opportunity to say  Welp I made it yay me!  And grab a celebratory drink.  Power through to the next milestone! IWNDWYT
Congrats! This can be your last three weeks post if you want it to be! Just remember that! I've been quitting nicotine again and I have to keep reminding myself of the exact same thing! IWDWYT
