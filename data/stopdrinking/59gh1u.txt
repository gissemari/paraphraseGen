I was on this sub a while ago under a different username before I purged social media accounts for a while. I rejoined Reddit earlier this year but never got back to SD. Well after a series of relapses ending last week I remembered how great y'all are and so here I am...This is the first night since recommitting to sobriety that I've gone to bed (albeit at 4am) and genuinely wanted to wake up the next morning. Hooray...Is anyone here from the Louisville KY area? I can't find an SDLocal sub for 502 so I figured I'd ask. It'd be nice to hit a meeting with someone from this sub sometimes.
