it was my day off. The day I would usually drink. I had been good for 3 weeks.long story short I passed out in bed and my wife ended up going to sleep. we should have had an intimate encounter. but I was drunk and passed out. I'm such a dick.

&gt;I'm such a dick...Maybe but then again maybe not...Being a dick however is not the reason you drank last night.  I have found that the best way to move forward and get better is to really figure out why you drank and then start working out a proactive plan for addressing it...Good luck.
