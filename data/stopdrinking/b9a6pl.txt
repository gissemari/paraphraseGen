I have several friends recently that have quit drinking and or quit substances in general. I'm the music industry so it can be a mindfuck in these parts. Kudos to anyone that is out to better themselves but I still have the occasional beer. It's hard to be third party supportive if you're not hardcore sober. I'm so proud of them but in a way it makes me rethink my coping strategies. I want to be a supportive friend and not trigger them in any way. Just wanted to vent to you guys. Y'all understand the struggle better than anyone.

You ARE being a supportive 3rd party! That's really sensitive of you and your alcoholic recovering friends and acquaintances appreciate you! That's quite alright that you have that beer (if that's not a prob for you). Sounds as if you are in that environment where it's around anyway. Sober folks need to learn their own coping strategies. As long as you are not encouraging "Just this one drink won't hurt ya!" Or "Hey man it's my birthday and you're not going to have a drink with me??!" and things of that nature you're good. You can also tell them that you are proud of their success! Always good to hear on any occasion. IMO anyway. ROCK ON! IWNDWYT!
