After failing miserably to remain sober  at Christmas during my recovery in both 2016 and 2017: yesterday and today I proudly achieved my first alcohol free Christmas for the first time in around 20+ years...It is no less than a miracle after hitting rock bottom in only November 2018 when I received a custodial sentence for convictions relating to my alcohol misuse during a relapse in September. Thankfully the sentence has been suspended for a year giving me a second chance to rebuild my life heal and recover...&amp;#x200B;..I can only describe going to bed sober tonight as the most serene peaceful joyous and content feeling I think I will ever experience. I don't ever want to forget how amazing this feels. So blessed and grateful right now. Beats any chemical induced buzz only 1 million times over!! Today I MASSIVELY felt the love and respect of my family husband and children- which I'm sure you'd agree is priceless...Goodnight and god bless Reddit/ SD

Congrats on staying sober today! The holidays are a tough time and I think your accomplishment here is something to be really proud of...Good luck to you in your sober journey!
Congratulations on your third time lucky!!! 
One of my favorite things about not drinking - peace of mind. Good health no hangovers being there for family genuine interaction and so much less drama to worry about. It's strange to think that drinking was something I did to calm down and relax when it actually created problems that robbed me of peace of mind!
