I'm back at day 3 almost 4 after 23 days of not drinking. I am feeling overwhelmed because I also attempted to give up meat spliffs and go to the gym in the process..maybe not all at once but pretty close. When I relapse with one it all seems to come crashing down eventually. Is it a mistake to do this all at once. My goal is optimal health (6pack included) bodywise..lol..but it's so frustrating when not drinking I crave all the bad foods. Hell I crave the bad foods when boozing..I just can't wait to get to the point where I can get past the fog and  concentrate on the gym eating right and forming new habits..

When I first got sober I wanted to fix everything all at once. It was a recipe for me to fail at everything - it was too much change all at once...My sponsor gave me this advice - "Focus on what is killing you the fastest." For me that was booze...Over time I have started working on exercise diet mental health nicotine and the rest but at first my total focus was on booze. It was necessary for me to succeed.
I quit cigarettes a few years ago and cleaned up my diet even before that. Now it is alcohol with a reduction in herb. After alcohol feels good I will completely cut out herb...I find it too hard to do 8t all at once or even too close to each other. Keep at it and keep checking in with yourself. I found the right mixture and am hopeful that you will too.
Maybe hold off on giving up meat and instead switch to higher quality unprocessed meat. Meat isn't a bad food and going without it isn't any healthier messages to the contrary are based on faulty evidence.
