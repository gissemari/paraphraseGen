I posted a year ago about needing help to quit the sauce. I have been doing better but I'm still struggling. I am just wondering if there is anyone in the Omaha area that I can talk to. Or anyone at all. I would just like someone to talk with. If anyone wants to text or call or anything. Please pm me so we can talk. I need help
