First post alert. I've lurked a bit and this sub helped me complete over a month sober last year. But after those sober days I felt  cured  and went back to moderating. And we all know how that goes.....I created an account and am posting because this is more serious to me now. I'm sick of saying I'll do better and then I don't. I'm sick of disappointing my spouse and myself. I'm sick of the guilt the embarrassment the shame. And I'm sick of my beer belly bad eating habits and all that comes with living an unhealthy lifestyle. ..I'm so scared. I'm scared I'm going to fail again. I'm scared I'll never be the better person I know I can be. I'm scared I won't fit in with our current friends and wondering if that will cause a rift in my marriage.....All I can do is try. Thanks for reading and thanks to everyone here who shares a bit of themselves and their struggles and celebrations. I'm hopeful that participating will hold me accountable and help me in this process.

Welcome. Feel free to check out the various recovery programs available.  The r/stopdrinking subreddit has links to their websites on the sidebar. ..AA taught me that this was not my fault but it was my problem. The good news is we don't need to face it alone. 
I just started too.  Yesterday was Friday the 13th--it seems like an ironic day to start and I like that.  It sounds like Friday the 13th would be your last non-sober day.  Let's do it!
