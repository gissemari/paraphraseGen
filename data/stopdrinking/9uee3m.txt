For quite some time now I've suffered from the one year fatigue. I'll soon have one year. Then what?..It's rewarding to keep track. We celebrate days weeks months palindromes oddities and nerdities (69 amiright? 42 anyone? 256?). But after one year there are no more milestones. Every day is more of the same. This possible anticlimax has been difficult for me...Some days I ve doubted my will to stay sober. I've seen many people struggle around the 9-12 month mark maybe because we have to decide to pull this soberthing out of time and into perpetuity...And that's scary and sad at least to me; I have to accept that all my foolish dreams and hopeless investments made to drinking are lost. For ever. I have to choose for ever...This is where I realized that the one year prize isn't a smiley star or a chip. It's a future. It's nearness over distance to my wife and kids. It's creativity over dullness in my work and it's clarity over oblivion in my mind. The star and the chip are reminders that it didn't come for free...I will not drink with you today!

Welcome to Day 362 SH!!!..&gt;The star and the chip are reminders that it didn't come for free..Beautifully said...So when you think about 'what's next' leave your heart mind body and soul open - you've achieved an extraordinary feat of staying sober for 1 year and there's so much bountiful goodness to come :)...You're a kind warm supportive integral part of this community and I know I speak for many when I say Congratulations I'm so proud and happy for you!!! :D
Hey buddy.  A year sober is a huge achievement and you're absolutely right that for many of us it's a time for reflection.  It's hard sometimes not to have regrets but it took risking everything I hold dear for me to be able to truly appreciate it...Into a second year sober milestones may be less frequent and arguably less often hard-won but victories are still out there to be claimed. Every single day my life is still better for not drinking any more.  ..Enjoying your company along the way is one of the best things.  Happy to not drink with you today  :)
&gt;I have to accept that all my foolish dreams and hopeless investments made to drinking are lost. For ever...I have a way to go but as I leave my foolish dreams and hopeless investments in alcohol I realize I am learning a new way of being in this life. A chip a star a milestone...tokens of achievement. A new way of being is what I am learning about this journey. ..Very insightful post SaintHomer. Peace to you as you surpass one year and into forever.
Wow!  SaintHomer I'm so glad you posted this!  This last week I've been tempted to comment on one of your daily check-ins about your approaching milestone but I get the impression that few of us like to count our chickens before they've hatched when it comes to days sober...Man did you lay a gift at all of our feet today with your words today.  This post is _amazing_.  Full of sadness beauty and the kind of grit it takes to stay sober.  I'm looking forward to celebrating your milestone in 4 days.  Thank you and IWNDWYT!
  I love it when you use your poetic powers for good!  the real gift is beyond any logical ability to adequately measure.  The root of the flowering tree.        **iwndwyt**
A week and a half ago I broke down sobbing while journaling as it occurred to me that this is not some phase this is not a break this is my real and forever life. Alcohol was so much a part of my personality and so much a part of my life. I've "known" rationally for a long time now that it's over for good with me and alcohol but I think what's different now is that it's sinking in emotionally and it's fucking hard to accept sometimes. My brain hasn't fully reconditioned and it thinks that "the prize" for all this wholesome clean living of this past year should be a fucking drink or 17! ..But when you read the 2 year posts or the 1000 days posts you see that indeed it does keep getting better and better. That is my hope for us anyway and one thing that sobriety has certainly given me and that I value so much is hope. ..I will not drink with you today.
It is odd that we think of returning to what likely should be "normal" as anticlimactic. I have thought the same thing. When we are getting sober we can feel and see the improvement. I almost feel addicted to the improvements. Maybe the idea is to expand our definition of improvement and use what we have build to make tomorrow even better. I won't drink with you again today. One day at a time.
Hey Homer thanks for this beautiful post. So much wisdom in it... I think I can imagine how you're feeling right now...I've noticed the last week or so has been tougher for me than days 30-70. For whatever reason... It's as if the effort is starting to wear me out - even if I've experienced very few actual cravings. Bizarre. And I have this silly notion that if I only make it to 100 days I'll finally get to breathe a sigh of relief. That things will somehow magically get easier after that. My mind is totally fixated on that number. 100. Even if I *know* on a rational level that there is so point after which we are "safe" from relapse. It can happen to someone with 1000 or 10 000 days...Well I've already learned that we go through different phases. I just hope an easier phase is just around the corner for me...Looking forward to congratulating you on one year **:-)**
My sobriety is 1 day at a time. ..Not yesterday.  Not tomorrow...Not 1 year...1 day...Today. ..If I set my eyes on 1 year. Make it ...Bang. I reached 1 year. ..Drink...1 day at a time I hope I never loose sight of that. ..  
One day at a time! They add up fast.  IWNDWYT. 
Oh I still find milestones.  After 365 I aimed for 500 then 800 then the anticipated "comma club" of four digits.  It helps me too to have something to look forward to.  For all that I know the real benefit is an "unimpaired life" (thank you /u/prevenient_grace!) having fun with numbers is still a nice way to stay focused.  Because it's true I still have to choose sobriety in a society that champions drinking.  It's insidious and while I rarely have major cravings I know it's important to keep an eye on my tricky little brain.  Mass marketing can convince me at times of how nice it'd be to have a sophisticated drink.  So I aim for the next number stay in touch here look for names I have grown familiar with (lookin' at you SH!) and remember that if I stay focused I get to have that clarity and a future of possibilities.  An early congrats on your smiley star! 
Congratulations on Your Upcoming Solar Sober Circumnavigation!
