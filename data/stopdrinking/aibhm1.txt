5 years ago on feb 4th my best friend died of a seizure in his sleep as a result of a prior brain injury and subsequent drug use. He survived a tbi without loss of personality or intelligence. But he couldn't stop partying. He was physically half the person he was. So February has always been a very drunken month for me. Last year on 2/9/18 I ended up in the ER by the cops for falling down in the street. I managed to stay dry for three weeks of February last year. I have been up and down struggling since then. Triumph followed by fall after fall. January of this years started with a bum knee and depression. Drinking beer smoking some weed and just being inert. I have been trying to moderate behave and not get "out there". I have made some improvement. But I really want to stop my health and immediate family deserve it. I don't know what the point of this is. I just wanted to say thank you to all the people who offered supportive comments on my "total failure" post a couple weeks ago. I really was moved by you all. I haven't given up.
