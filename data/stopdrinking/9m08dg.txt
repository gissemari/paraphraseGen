Hello all..I have been struggling to find a sponsor.  I don't run into many women and the ones I do are either a newbie like me say they no longer take sponsees due to their age or aren't a good fit at all.  How have you all found sponsors especially ladies?

Note: I had a woman who was going to be my sponsor but she was just diagnosed with cancer.  Also my first 30 days I was in treatment and had a temporary sponsor there but that was an hour away from where I live.

I'm 43 my sponsor just turned 70 in june ............ she might be alot older but she has 25 yrs of sobriety and lots of wisdom to share .   .My home group announces that they have temporary sponsors available at the end of each meeting .  .I've also found going to a local ladies only meeting helpful in meeting ladies of various ages
