Hello stopdrinking. Despite my current flair I've only been sober for eight days. This is because nine days ago I drank a lot of alcohol and deeply upset my partner. I didn't do anything in particular except slur my words and behave sullenly but it lead to two days of skepticism on his end as to whether or not he wants to continue this relationship. Fortunately he let it go and we've had a nice week at his place...&amp;#x200B;..But like... I find myself daydreaming about alcohol. About how I can get off the train on my way home and pick up vodka or whiskey and stash it in my suitcase quickly enough that none of my family notices. Drink it after they've all gone to bed with a nice cranberry juice mixer. Wake up the next morning and shower off the stale alcohol and inevitable shame. Follow up the day by paying for groceries to be delivered to my door with a nice big bottle of liquor or wine. I say 'or' like I'd choose between them when actually I'd order both and easily finish them off in an evening. ..&amp;#x200B;..\*Then\* I tell myself today I'll be ready to quit for good. Commit to going vegan. Exercise. Lose weight. Let my antidepressants kick in. Move on from my rape flashbacks/nightmares and be just like everybody else. Sober and not so... haunted. ..&amp;#x200B;..But like... I've been an alcoholic for two years now. How many times during this period have I said "Just one at the train station"? Ten times? Twenty? Fifty??? When searching for an AA meeting yesterday I found that I'd last visited that page on 08/04/2018. That's 153 days. I've been drunk on at least fifty of these days. How many of these days did I spend vegan exercising losing weight and trying antidepressants? Take a guess. Not one. Fucking. Day. If I pick up vodka at that train station 09/09/2018 will just be one more mistake to add on the long list. One more time risking my relationship. One more time pushing my family away. One step further away from recovery...&amp;#x200B;..I guess what I really wanted to ask is if the cravings ever stop? This subreddit is so full of love and hope but I'm not even sure how to differentiate between my personality my alcoholism or my mental health problems. I don't even know if it's possible to differentiate. I felt so safe this morning when I thought I would be picking up that liquor on Sunday and my plan to feed my addiction was in place. But now I've reflected and changed my mind I feel extremely scared and uncertain. And I'm afraid that I'll feel this way for the next 60 years.

For me the cravings did subside. It took a month or so but I rarely crave alcohol now. And when I do it s so fleeting and I can push it away. My life is much better now and I don't want to go back...It took me a while to establish new routines and especially to build new coping mechanisms. For the first month-ish I was so wound up because I didn't know how to relieve stress without alcohol. I worked through that but it was wasn't quick or easy...Keep trucking. And talk to your doctor if you need to. We're all here with you. IWNDWYT.
Even if you did fight this battle for the next 60 years which im sure you won't because ive heard things get easier... At least you wont be stopping and buying vodka right off the train and hiding it for 60 years ans feeling the guilt and shame to go with it. ..You will get stronger and the decisions you are making will get a little less heavy each day. ..Hang in there
