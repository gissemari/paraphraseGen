Only people close to me know how big of a problem I have drinking. (30 some odd days btw) Got asked by a coworker to drop a load of firewood at his house after work today. On my way there he text me "wha t kind of beer ya drink? I'll get ya a case for helping "  My answer? ".... Gatorade!  I'm allergic to alcohol!  EVERY time I drink I break out In handcuffs!" Ya I know pretty lame but it made me laugh!..*edit. Words and sentence/paragraph structure seem to be outside my mental capacity... apologies!

Hahahaaa! Congrats on 30 days!
Remember: it's only a struggle if you ARE drinking.
My sponsor used to say that. Lol.
