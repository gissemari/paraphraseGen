No doubt I'll have people asking me to take shots again. Pressure is real every time I work. I was clean for almost month  (relapsed once). Each time I say why I'm sober I'm called a pussy and everything else... when they are inebriated... looking stupid. ..I've seen many fights break out. People acting like absolute bafoons... passing out on the bar... pissing in the corner of the outdoor tent.....&amp;#x200B;..I'm so happy to say I will NOT drink with you today!

Just do what my sister used to due at a night club she worked at that had ZERO tolerance for employees drinking at work.  She'd either smile and say (to men) coyly "I'll get fired tee hee!!" or she'd put Sprite in it..This club had a lot of older guido types and my sister was cute so she'd make a lot of money..
Can someone tell me a trick to fake a shot? Like I feel like there's always someone in the group paying attention who will notice if you don't pour a jaeger or whatever from the bottle into your shot glass. Grabbing the gun seems super obvious since it makes noise and the shot bubbles.
