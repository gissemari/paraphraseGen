One of my biggest triggers may seem silly to a lot of people.  It's also very hard to avoid...It's being in my car driving alone.  The time of day almost doesn't matter.  If I'm on my way home I feel a strong desire to "treat" myself in some way.  For the past four years that was almost always alcohol...Yesterday I met one of my adult sons fire dinner.  Talked about his new job opportunities etc.  He takes after me on a lot of ways and he's at the very start of a career in a field not terribly different from mine starting in a way very close to his I did...It was a good time...Unfortunately one other way that he takes after me is that he doesn't know when to stop drinking. He doesn't drink often but when he does it's usually not good...I had some frank discussions about my struggles.  How for years I never had problems... Until I did.  Until I looked back a d saw that I did but couldn't quite pinpoint when it happened...It was a good talk.  He's smart enough and wise enough to consider my words.  Even if he doesn't go completely sober overnight I know that he'll think about them and hopefully they'll help him make better choices far sooner than I did....In any event on my way home.... Feeling pretty good about being a decent dad... That old feeling crept into my head......  "Just stop by someplace for a drink.  Look you're in a different part of town; you haven't tried places up here; you always likes trying new places."..It hit hard.  I actually pulled my car over and argued with myself telling my windshield all sorts of things...I settled into the "play it forward" strategy.  Focused on the promise vs the reality.  The lies I'd tell myself ("Only one drink") vs what I knew it would really be...It worked.  My play it forward scenarios have gotten worse.... But only because they've become more in line with what the reality would be...That one drink would have been three.  Then a shift to a bar closer to home.  And another three.  And bad food that I don't need...And then I'd might have walked home.  Or maybe not...Then I'd have woken up the next day.  Dehydrated.  Hung over.  Late for work and missed my morning meetings.  Gone out to eat for lunch and eaten more bad food with a few glasses of wine. Skipped my evening exercise club in favor of going out for dinner.... Again with more wine...Monday evening would be worse.  Is drink enough to black out then wake up in my car at home.  No idea how I got there.  Completely missed the next day at work another day of missed workouts and bad eating...Hundreds of dollars gone.  Thousands of calories eaten.  Another thousand *not* burned off.  Problems at work right as my boss is doing annual reviews.  Embarrassing texts to exes at 1 a.m.  ...That's if I was lucky.  Unlucky might have me fired.  Or maybe I actually hooked up with an ex and have to explain that to my wonderful Significant Other.  Or a DUI.  Or an accident maybe with injuries... All of the potential fallout can get VERY bad...So... Yeah.  The "play it forward" tactic works for me now.  A year ago I would have lied to myself about how minor the evening would have ended...Getting honest with myself is a major step in my sobriety...I know that I have to balance facing my harsh reality from bad success with self-forgiveness; maybe that'll be the next lesson on my path...I will not drink with you today.

I'm glad you were able to speak to yourself so honestly! I tend to overthink when I'm driving alone. The thing that helped me the most with that is listening to podcasts or discussions about true crime stuff like unsolved murders or disappearances. Music is never really enough to distract me. I find that stuff fascinating so it helps keep me out of my own head. Weird I know but it helps me with the negative self-talk so I thought I would share! IWNDWYT!
