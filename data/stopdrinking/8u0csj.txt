2 days ago I hit 3 years sober...I'm much younger than most people living sober in my mid twenties. It's really hard a lot of the time. But it's so worth it. .3 years ago I had just gotten my second DUI and couldn't even begin to piece together the silhouette of a functioning life. It was my second relapse after in-patient rehab. I thought about suicide. Decided to give it one last shot...On the day I hit 3 years without a drop of alcohol in my body I woke up early and went for my daily jog. I hugged my sweet loving compassionate fiancee extra tight and thanked him for his relentless support. I called my mom and sister and thanked them for never giving up on me. I took a good look at my ordinary extraordinary life and cried. I cried for all the struggle pain anxieties beauty gratitude awesomeness this life has brought me...Some days are harder than others. I still feel intense guilt for all I've put my loved ones through and wonder when my fiancee will leave me for a "normal" girl without a criminal record and mental health issues. But the pay off couldn't be more worth it...Just wanted to say hang in there if you're struggling. I'm in it with you for what it's worth. Everyone here is a miracle whether you're on day 1 or day 10000.
