I fell off the wagon.  Made it a few weeks and was feeling pretty good about my sobriety.  Out of the blue - wasn't feeling down or questioning things - just picked up a drink again.  Just like that.  You all know what comes next.  Slowly but surely the empty bottles filled up in my glass recycling container and a few weeks later I am drinking just as much as I was before and feeling terrible about it...I have been trying to reconnect with my spirituality and yesterday I went to church for the 1st time in a while.  The pastor said something that really connected with me that made me want to try again.  He was talking about how transformation is different than change and how it comes from the inside out and how our society uses distractions like drinking (and many other things) to keep us from feeling our pain and from truly transforming.  I have definitely used alcohol to self-medicate and to not feel depressed/anxious.  I also feel like I have resisted anything more than surface level change because actually transforming from the inside is scary...I read "This Naked Mind" when I stopped drinking last time.  The author talked a lot about how reading the book would help transform your sub-conscious narratives about alcohol and make you legitimately not want to drink.  I felt like it was absolutely working.  I agreed with everything she said and was even starting to get cocky (thinking "I've got this" "I don't even desire alcohol anymore!").  It worked beautifully right up until it didn't...Obviously I need to try something different this time.  I'm looking into AA meetings.  Part of why I have tried going back to church is that I feel disconnected from other people outside of my family (which is very supportive and loving).  I am looking for community but struggle with doubt and have a really hard time trusting/connecting with other people...Sorry for the long post.  Just needed to get some of this out there even if no one reads it.  Any other advice for me as I give this another shot?

You can also look at SMART Recovery.  I used it and thought it was very good.
