I have 23 days today which is the longest I've gone without a drink in years not counting when I was pregnant. But all I can think today is that this f-ing sucks. I'm struggling with some semi-major life decisions and all I want to do is disappear into a glass of wine...Fuck. I don't want to want to drink when tough things are happening.

I get a lot of support and fellowship for these instances at meetings!
Yeah it does fucking suck. And drinking will give you maybe a few hours of relief and then just make everything worse. Sometimes I have to take it just minute by minute or breath by breath. I won't drink with you today.
