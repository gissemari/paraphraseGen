Let me preface this by saying that no one needs to read my lengthy ramblings below! I'm posting this for catharsis to get all my thoughts written down and for my own future reference as much as anything but you guys are wonderfully supportive so if anyone makes it through all this thank you!..I just had a birthday recently and it made me realize that I've been drinking heavily for the past 3 years. I know many here went for much longer but that number is insane to me. When I started drinking heavily it was a really rough time in my life that I knew would only last 6 months or so. I always gave myself a pass telling myself that I would get my drinking under control after that was over. But here I am 3 years later still doing it only with no excuse now. Addiction really is a crazy thing. At the beginning I was using alcohol to escape my problems now alcohol **is** my problem and I've been unable to escape it despite having so many good reasons to do so...Besides the drinking things are going well in my life. I have a decent-paying job and I'm good at it and most importantly it can be very enjoyable/rewarding (or at least I would feel that way if I wasn't hungover almost every day of doing it). I've made a few half-assed attempts at quitting in the past more "let's see how long I can go without" rather than "I am quitting" and during those periods (never longer than 2-3 weeks) I can be amazingly productive. I've started learning a new instrument I'm writing music I keep my life in order - clean tidy the way I want it. I can't tell you how much I enjoy sobriety and how stupid it is that every time I eventually decided one day that I would kick back a few beers (which turns into a lot) because hey it's friday and I can sleep in all day saturday if I need to. And even though I spend most of the time I'm drinking sitting worthlessly in a chair feeling down while browsing the internet or watching netflix for some reason I come back the next day and do it again and again while my guitar sits next to me unplayed clothes and garbage begin to pile up friends are becoming distant and I'm wearing the cleanest shirt I could find among the piles into work etc...It's really a weird thing to think about. It's very clear to me that I shouldn't want to drink but I usually do. So yesterday after 2 drinks (which is me just getting started) I'm about to pour my 3rd one and it really hit me. I'm relatively young but I'm starting to hit an age where there are some very important years of my life that almost feel like they never existed. I see people a couple years younger than me and I'm sad that I feel like I never lived those years. It doesn't help that alcohol probably has made me age a bit too fast in those years. In some ways it makes me want to drink to drown that thought out. But if I really think about it - at my age it's unfortunate that I missed out on some better times. But how would I feel if I'm looking back in 3 more years thinking the same thing? I know that's where I'm headed unless I change. So as I'm about to pour this 3rd drink it's really hitting me that the only reason I feel like time has passed me by is because of what I'm doing. One or two drinks and I might still feel productive enough to really *DO* something with my time but I know that I won't if I have much more than that. I never stop at 2 drinks but yesterday I did. I stopped and instead of drowning myself in liquor I spent the next few hours writing making music and when those drinks cleared up I drove myself to the store (being able to drive at night? what a strange and wonderful thing to be capable of) for a 12 pack of root beer (having something *else* to drink is so helpful) and snacks then invited my friends over for a great night of video games...It was an absolute blast. I'm actually feeling really elated typing this out. I've stopped for awhile before and I know there are some initial feelings of elation that don't last but this is a different choice I'm making. I'm not just deciding to clean up my act "for awhile". I can see so clearly the two choices I can make and the two outcomes. Drinking like I have been is just dumb and ridiculously detrimental to my health and well-being and there's not a single second where I truly enjoy it more than sobriety. I'm **so damn** tired of it and have just been comfortably numb this whole time. I know that it won't be as easy as that but I feel like I'm finally prepared to take the challenge. I've actually learned a lot through my relapses. I have the next few days planned out for me - what I'm going to be doing *sober*. I'm ready to start living my life and making these days ones that I can remember and look back on with fondness...Thanks again to all you awesome people reading the comments on here is incredibly helpful and insightful. I'm glad to be among you. And if anyone is worried about withdrawal - I've been very lucky and never really had any physical withdrawals when stopping in the past and I wasn't in quite as deep this time as I was when I quit before. But still I know it can be dangerous and I will pay very close attention to myself over the next few days and make sure I get help if I need it.

Remember what you've done in the past is never as important as what you do next.
Welcome /u/TheDrinkStinks -- outstanding post with lots of insights into our thinking and issues relating to withdrawal.  [At this link I describe what I did to stop drinking and get sober.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  I hope you join us and post and comment as you go along.
If you feel like you wasted those 3 years  just look at how fast they went by and imagine looking back and the number is now 6 9 15 etc...I'm quitting for many of the same reason - also a young professional that drank heavily for the past 3 years and feeling like I'm not living up to my potential at all...We can do this.  It will take work but we can.
My god. Are you me? I turned 24 yesterday and have been drinking almost non stop since the day I turned 21. 3 years. It really hit home for me when you said that you don't want to look back at your life in another 3 years asking what happened. I realized this is could also be a reality for me and I really don't want that. ..I wish the best of luck to you.
