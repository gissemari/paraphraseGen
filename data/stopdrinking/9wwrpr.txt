It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I got a piece of mail from Charles Schwab delivered to my mailbox addressed to my cheating lying ex-husband thanking him for allowing them to manage his wealth. My ex-husband is someone who made a  pauper's plea  to the court and claimed to be so broke that he couldn't even pay the filing fee for his legal papers in our divorce. Even now after several years his fraudulent behavior still has the power to infuriate me and this is bad. I should be over it by now but clearly I'm not...**Triumph:** I love celebrating my anniversaries so much that I even love celebrating my half-year anniversaries. November 14 is my three and a half year soberversary...Every time I reach a year a half-year or some other milestone I enjoy getting a note from past me to celebrate the occasion. I then take a moment to write myself something for next time. It's a fun private tradition that I greatly enjoy receiving a message that I've since forgotten about so it's always a pleasant surprise. In addition if someone says something nice about me here on this sub or says something wise or encouraging I might send that to myself as well as a pick-me-up for some day in the future. (I use a website called Future Me where you send email to yourself on a specific date but I'm sure there are many others.)..**General:**  May all the people who judge you today get paper cuts and parking tickets. . .
----------immediate responses--------

First up! I will not drink with you today!   
**Struggle:** going into the holidays I'm starting to feel the stress rumblings. Can you all feel it as well? Hmmm... time to plan ahead for some calm stress-free moments...**Triumph:** celebrating an important accomplishment today that went well beyond my hopes. Immediately reached for the "expensive tea" and a sweet treat to toast the day and didn't even consider any other beverage. As I near the 2 month mark I have much to be thankful for!
Thank you for sharing your tradition of writing to yourself I really love that idea! ..Struggle: I'm a baker and I wanted to offer a holiday special that included a recipe with bourbon. I wrestled with this for awhile today and finally concluded that I should just leave it off the menu for now. I know for sure I could not leave an opened bottle of booze alone either in my work kitchen or at home. I do feel good that I know my limits! ..Triumph: I went to my husband's work party with an open bar and had a great sober time! ..General: meh nothing really. 
Happy 3.5 years to you SFMary!  You're killin' it.  I love your tradition to future you what a great idea.  I'm going to borrow it. Your ex sounds like a real piece of work.  I hope reminders of him wither and blow away...**Struggle:** I've been having some nicotine cravings again.  Not gonna smoke.  It feels like forever since I quit but I checked and it's not been quite 6 months.  Ugh.  And I think the recent decision to cut out sugar for a couple of months is triggering the smoking additions.  I feel like I'm playing addiction whack-a-mole. I shove one down and another craving pops up.  Meanwhile I keep working on growing and learning to fix the underlying issues that made me turn to addictive substances in the first place.  Slowwww going but a worthy task...**Triumph:**  I feel like I can rephrase my struggles and have them also be my triumphs LOL.  *I quit drinking over 800 days ago!  Yay! I quit smoking over 5 months ago! Yay!  I'm cutting down on sugar and trying to overcome obstacles both real and imagined. Yay!*  I guess this just highlights how **attitude is everything!**..**General:**  May all the people who betray you constantly get rocks in their shoes and pine needles in their underwear...
 Congratulations on three and a half years Mary . ..Struggle: I need to leave my job that I adore as it simply doesn't pay enough the stress of being behind with bills etc. is hitting me hard. Also the thought of having to put myself out there again in the job market is nerve-wracking but I've been procrastinating about the whole situation for too long. Just got to bite the bullet. ..Triumph: Being back here it took alot to log back on xxx..General: Is it too early to eat a mince pie? You know 'cause it's nearly  
*Struggle*: an old friend I hadn't seen in a while overdosed and passed last week. I meant to call him but got distracted will never forgive myself. I can't think about anything else. ..*Triumph*: reconnecting with a few old friends and my old life I'd forgotten how great they were...*General*: grief is love with nowhere to go. 
**Struggle:** Waiting to hear back from a company about a job I really really want and experiencing radio silence after interviewing with 8 different people and having really positive conversations. Trying to set my expectations hope for the best and prepare for the worst. In the past I would've used it as an excuse to drink if I didn't get the job but not today not anymore. ..**Triumph:** Down 25 pounds in 2 months! Went from 20.9% body fat to 12.6% after dedicating an hour a day to cardio and another hour to weights coupled with a healthy sugar-free low-carb diet. Would not have been possible without sobriety and in the past I would've used benders as excuses to order UberEats or overindulge in candy. Discipline feels great!
Struggles. I have planed giving up my sugar for a time. Was sorting out sleep problems first. Well a few days ago I ran out of sugar. So I said this is it. Monday bang. I felt like I went cold turkey off alcohol. I was very much supported by my friends at Dinos. I thank them very much. ..Triumphs.  I am on day 3 no sugar. Yes yes yes. I can do this...General. I am sober just for today. I have been able to say that for 10550 days. Each one here has a small place in my sobriety  in my life in my heart...       
**Struggle:** Winter is coming and my bones and joints disagree. Today they took two hours of moaning before they reluctantly agreed to settle...**Triumph:** I m at the school bench this week learning more about magazine design with my wife for our new business and *I - LOVE - IT!!!*..**General:** My wife has a standing order that every time - *every time* - I say that I know a shortcut she s to stop me. Short cuts have a tendency to mess things up. I ve realized that one of the reasons for that is that I stop looking for better solutions...Mary I m sorry for your struggle and I love your triumph. Lots of love to you.
Struggle: training our new dog has been a bit exhausting. My partner has been working a lot so it's fallen on me. ..Triumph: seeing our dog play with other dogs after first few days of him being shy/scared was nice. Also I am still sober! Don't think having a pet would have been possible if I was still drinking. Dog cuddles on the couch are nice. ..General: work team is changing hopefully for the better. 
Struggle - just got a fancy new phone which is in itself a very nice thing. But transferring my immense (4.2GB) Whatsapp chat history from iPhone to Android is actually a lot more tricky than I anticipated and I may have to write that all off unless I find some super simple way as I'm not tech-minded really. Also a few apps I have used heavily in my sobriety so far are either not on Android or I'm struggling to work out how to transfer my history from them so that's a bit annoying and frustrating. ..Triumph - got some really exciting possibilities for a sidestep in my working life that I've been seeking for some time hopefully will be able to make one or more stick!..General - Feeling good positive healthy. Enjoying being able to deal with hiccups like above with equanimity and poise as opposed to freaking out/entering denial! 
Happy 3 Years Mary!    That's amazing :) What a great way to reflect on your progress. I'll have to try it myself. Do you have any other plans to celebrate your sober birthday? ..Struggle: The first light layer of snow on the ground has brought on a lot of nostalgia. This time last year I caused my ex more pain than I've ever caused a person. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for what I did to him. I was drunk when I cheated on him and was in the throes of my alcoholism but it's not and will never be an excuse. After the fact my alcoholism plummeted to much darker depths I'd never known before. It was already alive and well and I had been struggling to stay sober. But rock bottom always has a cellar door I eventually learned. ..Winter has never been kind but last year was one of the worst. I've been doing pretty well lately but tonight has been tough...Triumph: Today I am 38 days sober. This is by far the longest I've been totally clean in 6 years. I started going to AA and it made all the difference. I underestimated how hard it would be to stay sober. I have to re-learn what it's like to not chemically alter your mind and body. I'm still not used to this. and I won't lie. I want to drink right now. It's all I think about. Whenever it'd be 5:30 AM and I'd still be awake I'd drink till I could sleep. I've been fixated on drinking these last couple days the most out of these last few weeks. But I haven't given in yet... So there's that...General: My Cane Corso nestled up on my chest earlier while she was in a deep sleep and it was just the cutest thing. 
*struggle* As I get closer to the one year the sneaky little voice suggests I might want to "try moderation" once I have done a full year. I know this is Class-A bullshit and I wish it would just STFU...*triumph* now the weather is warming up I'm pulling summer clothes out and I am delighted that trousers I wasn't able to wear last summer because I was carrying so much wine weight now fit comfortably again and I again have a waist so I can wear my favourite ankle-length wrap-around skirts again. Enjoying being in my body and feeling lighter more nimble and just generally more "myself" is a constant pleasure. It helps me battle the "fuckits" lizard voice too. I never want to feel so bloated and horrible again as I did when I first came here...*general* it's a real endings/beginnings time in both my life and Kiddo's right now - she finished with Cub Scouts tonight finishes primary school at the end of this term I am looking at starting yoga on what was Cub Scouts night and starting university study next year that will actually involve leaving the house regularly after 10 years of mostly working from home... it's all positive and it's also a lot of change to process and navigate! Best to be sober for it :).   
**Struggle:** My new partner was recently deployed and in danger every day and as much as I know I can't control anything I am still racked with worry alongside missing him being here..Also struggling with alcohol and struggling with my narcissistic father...**Triumph:** Got a job! Planning a future + saving money! And met/fell for/began dating my partner. These are things I never ever thought I could achieve! So woo! It also allows for significant introspection-- the extent of my self doubt in the past I know now I really need to work on for my own benefit....**General:** This community as everyone else says too is absolutely fantastic. I'm so grateful for it and everyone especially mods for running it. Thank you all and IWNDWYT!.
**Struggle:** So right now I'm studying in Argentina. I think this has actually been really good for my sobriety - my roommate is also going sober I work out every day and I'm generally in charge of my own decisions without much pressure to drink. BUT - I'll be leaving this to go home in December to a family that *loves* to drink during some of the holidays that they love to drink the most on. I know I'm going to struggle I just hope for the grace to pull through it. ..**Triumph:** I'm at 9 days by the time I go to bed tonight it'll be 10. This is the longest I've been sober in 3 years. If I get past 2 weeks it'll be the longest I've been sober in 9 years ( I started drinking young). ..In non-drinking triumphs: did super well in my Spanish oral exam yesterday and the professor told me she was impressed by my improvement and I got an email from a professor I worked with last year inviting me onto a project. ..**General:** not a quote - but I'd kill for some Indian food right now. 
Struggle:  I still have no idea what we're doing for thanksgiving yet.  I should probably get that figured out here soon. ..Triumph:  My state just voted to legalize medicinal weed which is awesome then yesterday my county came out and said that they are no longer going to prosecute marijuana cases.  So I guess it's like legal now?  I have no idea. ..General:  I'm super jazzed I'm at 862 days.  It's been tough but I'm still here and I couldn't be happier about my decision still.  
Congrats on 3.5! ..Struggle: food!!!! I'm getting married in May and am the heaviest I've ever been to date. Granted I'm still not morbidly obese and I'm a relatively active person just definitely not where I should be. It's upsetting and the lack of motivation id's upsetting and I won't drink over it so...    ..Triumph: wedding plans are falling into place and it's really starting to feel real!..General: all the wedding stuff has opened a ton more communication between family and friends and I. 
Good morning u/sfgirlmary and congrats on 3.5 years! The note to yourself is a great idea and hopefully that kind of note will offset somewhat the irritation of getting your ex's stupid mail!..**Struggle** A little over 4 months into this job and I still can't seem to make all the pieces come together and I'm sick sick sick of my coworkers even the ones I like (I worked at the same office in a different role for 2 years before getting this job so I've had over 2.5 years with these people now). We're doing budgets for 2019 right now and there's not much of a raise for me available. I am salaried but when I do the math with all the hours I work it doesn't come out to much more than minimum wage and I'm lucky my boyfriend is able to insure me as a domestic partner through his employer because there are no benefits besides 15 days a year pto for both sick and/or vacation time. I've been working for 30 years now and this is as far as I've gotten. And forget about ever retiring. ..**Triumph** Overcame a massive urge to drink last night. Happy that I'm about to hit 300 days soon. ..**General** Glad it's going to warm up today here in MN. This past week has been teens and single digits-- brrrrr!
Struggle: Spilled my  15 bottle of e-juice on my carpet. This is going to be hard to deal with..Triumph: 10 days now (longest I've ever been sober and each day breaks that record!). Managed to plan things to do with other people for the rest of the week that don't involve booze. Driving range gym and movie night to keep me occupied...General: how do I get a flair?
**struggle**: my personal life is not at it's finest right now.  i'm battling a bout of depression but need to remind myself that this too shall pass...**triumph**: i cooked with wine last night and was not tempted to drink the leftovers or taste the wine before cooking with it.  that's a victory for me and i am pleasantly surprised that there was no temptation on my end.  goes to show the power of positive thinking and reinforcement - thank you SD! ..**general**: 8 days until i get to spend thanksgiving with loved ones!..&amp;#x200B;..IWDWYT!
**Struggle:** Sudden staff departures at work have thrown me for a loop. They come at a bad time and one that was announced last night feels incredibly abrupt. It's the start of our busy season we were already overloaded with training new hires and now this... I love my career and it provides huge benefits emotionally. But it can also be very stressful which leads to depression if I don't manage it well...**Triumph:** There are themed builds in the Lego fan community periods where lots of people build around the same concept. November is the one I participate in building a specific style of spaceship. I made some decisions about what I would do this year and have been having fun with the builds.
Struggle: I still worry the moderation monster will try to get me...Triumph: 5 straight days in the gym and I told my Mom I am quitting. She arrives today for a two week visit so I get to show her I'm not bullshitting.
**Triumph:** I replaced my bike tire! I have yet to test it on the road but it's held air through the night which makes me feel so good about my handiness! There's something truly satisfying about fixing something with your own two hands...**Struggle:** Work is leaving me so utterly bummed out at the end of the day. It feels as if I spend most of my day doing something purposeless that won't add net value to the world in the long run. I hope it will but I'm not so sure...**General:** The first snow of the season is upon us here! Hooray!
Struggle: Work is pretty busy right now I haven't gotten to a meeting in almost a month (usually attend a noon meeting near my work).  I've been lurking here and am in an overall great place so I'm not worried about slipping....I just don't want to break a good habit...Triumph: Three years sober today.  Man....best three years of my life.
**Struggle:** Teenagers I have two of them. ..**Triumph:** They are actually pretty good kids. Could be a lot worse my struggle with them (one at the moment) is pretty minor in the list of things they could be doing especially when I think back to myself at that age...**General:** I hope there's pecan pie in my future.
\*\*Struggle\*\* Badge reset today. :( Spent the past 3 nights drinking.  I had given myself permission to drink for 2 nights and couldn't handle starting over on the third night.  I know I suck...\*\*Triumph\*\* Before that I had 4 days sober.  Today I will have another day sober.  Even though I have not been successful in maintaining a long string of days 4 days is better than none and maybe this time I can make it to 5 6 7.  Each day counts.  Even though I have failed each small victory takes me a tiny step further from dependency and reminds me of who I can be when I am sober...\*\*General\*\* Cooked up some mushroom  bourguignon the other night very tasty.  Looking forward to cooking for Thanksgiving.  What are y'all making these days?
**S:**  Daughter's math homework..**T:**  Got my dryer fixed!!!..**G:**  Ugh I remember when I found out that I was going to have to pay my exes legal bills when we separated.  Resentment meter hit 10.  Her latest stunt getting my daughter a puppy (daughter lives with me and plus i already have her other dog) was the last straw.  I'd do things for her to help not rock the boat... so yeah I'm not doing anything for her anymore.  She wanted me to get her a phone charger seriously? 
Happy 3.5! And thanks for the Future Me mention I will check it out. ..**Struggle:** I am so lucky to have so much freedom around how I spend my time and I often find it so hard to decide how to spend my time. There's a certain amount of existential panic going on - so much I want to do and less and less time to do it. Right now I am sort of between jobs and trying to focus on health household etc. ... but I don't enjoy most of that. I am missing work and also am spending way too much time alone. Which I enjoy but tends to sink my mood. Ugh sorry for the ramble ... ..**Triumph:** Scale finally heading in the right direction. It is my hope that once I establish good eating and exercise habits that will take less of my mental bandwidth than it does now. (Sort of like after the first 100+ days of not drinking.) ..**General:** I would like my future self to know that I am trying hard to make her healthier. I keep a journal so periodically I go back and read what I was writing about in the past. Things change and yet they stay the same. "Every five years or so I look back on my life and I have a good laugh" - The Indigo Girls ..&amp;#x200B;
**Struggle:** This sweet dog who has become aggressive. Sitting here watching him and I'm scared myself that he'll bite me so I'm sitting in a full-sleeved windcheater haha. Not a big struggle but just worried that our bond will thin. Or whatever. ..**Triumph:** Many god bless! Got a raise today without asking - and a 25% one. Sitting here drinking coke with three peacefully snoring dogs around me. Moving into a place of my own after a long time (so alcohol will be an issue it's been easier not drinking when there are people around me who know I'm sober but I want to go to AA and find a sponsor). Got some good exercise in today. 
**Struggle:**  I've been so wrapped up in my own problems lately and my decision to stop drinking that I have ended up neglecting some of my family.  I received a phone call last night that my mom has been ill and I didn't know because they haven't heard from me in a couple weeks.  I'm going to visit today after work.  I know it's super shitty but to be totally honest I'm not looking forward to it.  I'm not ready to talk to my family about my addiction yet and they have no idea because I've kept it a secret from them for years so I don't have an excuse as far as why I haven't been around.  Anyways I'm going to be there regardless because it's the right thing to do and it will make my mom feel better.  Plus I need to do better in general and be a better son...&amp;#x200B;..**Triumph:**    I had a productive day at work yesterday.  The weather was beautiful where I live so I went on a couple of walks. I cleaned my apartment read a book and treated myself to some pizza for dinner. And I didn't drink! It was a very nice day...&amp;#x200B;..**General:**    You are all such beautiful people and I am so thankful for all of your kind words understanding and support over the past few days! 
Hhahhaha love your general sfgirlmary! Sorry to hear about the still ping to a nerve the ex situation can still sometimes ping. Mine pinged yesterday too I start school to go into the medical field and I realized I may not be able to because of certain circumstances that went down with him... long story but yes that is my **&lt;:Struggle**..**Triumph:** I signed up for school and have orientation tomorrow! I also resigned up at he gym and actually using it. I have more paying job calling me in for a possible position so that's nice while I am still waiting to hear back from NCL :) Getting my ducks in a row and checking off boxes on to-do lists again feels good... I really do enjoy being productive...**General:** I want to make a smoothie but my sister bought this dumb "blender" where the cup is the thing you actually put the fruit in - to blend - to then drink straight out of...... the cup is missing and it only came with one....[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
**Struggle:** I had to quit my brand new part time job after only a month. It was actually a full time job in disguise. Before me the department had 1 full time staff and 4 part time staff. I was hired on 20 hours a week to perform the same role. Not happening! Two senior managers above me agreed with my resignation letter! Sad but..at least I'm free from that stress and I have one month's work lined up as a Christmas Casual for The Royal Mail (UK mail)...**Triumph:** Genuinely enjoying 5 days of being alcohol free. I've been an insomniac for years and last night I slept so well = I was in a great mood today!..**General:** Living in the present moment (from a 99p ebook) really helps..when I can remember to do it!..**Bonus General:** Every single one of you in this group rocks!
Struggle- angry resentful. How is this my life now? Unfulfilling job relationship with SO not good no friends..Triumph- knowing sobriety is the first step in changing. Happy I'm doing something to unstick myself after years and years. .General- digging meditation....looking to start going to the gym! Thanks SD community 
**Struggle:**  I was too sick Monday and Tuesday to get any schoolwork done (I couldn't even sit up at the computer long enough to read my e-text) so I have much less time than usual to get my work for the week done.  I'm not 100% sure but I think the two days of sickness were a reaction to my first shot of Vivitrol which I had Monday morning.  From the time I returned home after the shot through last night I was constantly sick to my stomach light headed headachey and had severe chills (my husband said I was even ice cold to the touch) alternating with hot flashes...**Triumph:**  I finally managed to eat some toast this morning without it being marked for immediate return to sender and the wooziness is gone enough for me to get some work done at last.  And I have three weeks sober!  This is my best streak in several months at least...**General:** I'm a little worried now about whether or not starting Vivitrol treatment for my alcohol use disorder was a good idea.  From what I understand usually any severe side effects like what I  was experiencing are usually relatively short lived and only occur after the first shot (so in theory I should be OK next month) but there are also a number of less severe side effects possible including worsening depression difficulty sleeping and stiff joints.  I take Sertraline for my depression and getting adequate sleep is often a struggle for me under normal circumstances so if I have those side effects it could be a deal breaker.  (Fun fact: Sertraline has a tendency to cause false positive readings for benzodiazepines in instant urine drug screens.  Who'da thunk?)  I guess I'll just keep tabs on how I'm feeling for this first month and if it seems like I am having any longer-term side effects I'll talk to the doctor about it before my next injection.
It's been over 6 weeks now. This past weekend was tough. My husband is still drinking- we were out of town for a working event. The city it was in is one of our "stomping grounds" for drinking establishments. We went to eat at two of the places as the food is good. I would have preferred not to but he wanted to and after some other issues it wasn't worth arguing about. Watching all of those people drinking was not fun or easy and the whole thing basically made me angry. I'm kind of in the "angry" stage I go through when I stop drinking. This time I am going to get through it and not start again. Sorry for the negative post- as I mentioned "angry stage". 
**Struggle:** I ran out of time to get a birthday bike ride in. .**Triumph:** It's my 3rd birthday in a row where I won't be drinking alcohol..**General:** Let's hope Elon Musk never gets involved in a scandal as ElonGate could be a very drawn-out affair...
**Struggle:** An attack of the "sads" unrelated to the present apparently except for the passage of time and the descent into weather too cold for the month in which it occurring.  Where is that spin doctor when I need him/her? ..**Triumph:**  Whatever the wisps from the past I'm still taking care of today. ..**General:** Everything changes.  The sads will leave. The terror of icy roads will soon arrive.  I keep it upbeat ! And IWNDWYT
I started working with a new business partner. We've been having these deep conversations about our project on Fridays after everybody leaves work. We'll hang out and go over our plans for hours it is passion-fueled and productive...&amp;#x200B;..Last friday as the talk was winding down he broke out a bottle of whiskey and was about to pour two shots when I stopped him...&amp;#x200B;.."I'm sorry I don't drink but you can go for it"..&amp;#x200B;..There was part of me that knew this moment would come. That I would find myself in a professional situation where being offered a drink by my mentor I would have to accept. That happened last Friday and I turned it down and he respected that boundary and we continued our conversation without much of a hiccup...&amp;#x200B;..My drinking friends don't understand the complexity of this interaction for me so I just wanted to share it with someone...&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
Struggle: I'm worried about Thanksgiving. Cooking with my mother for many hours is a trigger. I've already talked to her &amp; I think we are going out instead. ..Triump: I'm on day 46. This is the longest I've been sober in years. I had 45 at the beginning of the year before I tried to moderate. My next goal is 60 days...General: My fav tv shows are ending for the season Kidding (last Sun) &amp; AHS tonight. I liked scheduling them to watch. I will need to schedule something else for that time. 
Congrats on the 3.5 years. :)..&amp;#x200B;..**Struggle:** I shouldn't have weighed myself the other day. I'm up to a BMI of 18.3 which is the biggest I've been in a few years and it's freaking me out. We're supposed to go to the Dominican Republic in January for my BIL's "wedding" (they've been officially married for 2 years and I'm not super excited about using a week's worth of PTO to do an all-inclusive for an event that already happened but that's a first world problem I guess) -- so now I'm stuck on needing to lose ten pounds prior to January. Well AT LEAST 10 pounds. I hate how my anorexia always drives me to want to be the skinniest bitch in the room. I was probably a BMI of 15.5-16ish when BIL had their backyard (real) wedding two years ago and I was getting a lot of compliments about how fit I looked. I must look like an absolute landwhale right now. Which I understand is illogical but it's not really logical for someone who is underweight to get compliments on how fit and healthy they look either so maybe there is something illogical about my body composition...**Triumph:** I'm not puking to lose weight. Except for once last week and twice two weeks ago but it's not 5-6x/day. The bulimia when it's bad gets a little on the alcoholism-spectrum with the lying and hiding shit and that bothers me a lot.  Moreso than being nearly 33 years old and wanting to weigh less than your average 10 year old. ..**General:** Winter came early this year and I hate it. Also wtf to Target for putting away all their fall stuff and moving right into Xmas. I still need to buy Thanksgiving things.
Struggle: I want to see a doctor to make sure I didn't permanently mess up my body by drinking while taking wellbutrin but I recently moved and am having an extremely difficult time finding an in-network doctor. I also have like $9. Lol...Triumph: Instead of drinking I stayed up all night getting an elderly woman's phone to work again. I succeeded and was able to pull off all her photos and put them on her new phone. She then told me that I recovered pictures of her grandchildren who passed away in a car accident less than a month ago and she was immensely grateful...And to think I was going to get wasted instead. Lol. 
Struggle: found evidence of a carpenter ant infestation in my basement. Anxiety is absolutely destroying me today. ..Triumph: I was anxious to begin with and I took a mental health day today.. Putting myself first was a big win even before I found that insane mess that I now need to figure out how to handle......General: I'll be damned if I'll let the impulse to go drink away the anxious win this fight today. I will not fucking drink and make it worse if it's the last thing I do today (iwnfdamiwiitltidt!)
Struggle: just moved back into town a few months back with the girlfriend staying at my parents house for cheap rent while we save up..first seven days of sobriety ended with giving in and drinking myself into oblivion ran out of beer so drunk me decided opening up one of their wine bottles was a wise decision drank half of that and polished off their rum..Woke up covered in piss parents disappointed and upset with me(rightfully so) and the girlfriend pissed at what she came home to last night..I hate myself today and feel awful that I made her deal with that awful that I took alcohol from my parents (replaced it this morning but regardless ffs guy) and just want to crawl into a hole..Have to have this stop I can't keep doing that to them and I cannot lose the love of my life over alcohol. ..Triumphs: I don't know what to put down I guess going to aa this morning was a good step but ffs I don't feel like I've triumphed over anything today.
**Struggle**: - I had a super stressful day yesterday including having to pick up a teen downtown late at night and getting turned around. When she was in the car I let it slip that I wanted a drink (but wasn't going to). She saiid she didn't need to hear that and she was totally right...**Triumph**: One week today!!..&amp;#x200B;..**General**: Just put in an offer on a house for the very first time in my life No PRESSURE!!!

Fml.drunk rn but i wont drink no more....need help.....
3 weeks sober. Heading to bed with a clear head and excited to wake up early. 
Struggles: I feel like I cannot trust myself and it is a bad feeling to have that conflict with yourself. I have been running so fast for so long I am afraid of the quiet...Triumphs: I have singel handedly brought my family from ruins 4 years ago after a health blow to my spouse which caused us to almost loose everything to having a good financial flow and after having 4 jobs I now have two and doing well in those...General: I want health and have joined a fitness/healthy eating club at work and will try to make that evening my own time. ..Not super inspired today but those are true at least. One small struggle is I think I have to eat comfort food to not feel like drinking today...mmmm...not good in the long run but better than the alternative today. Makes me feel  full and I dont crave. ..Thanks all really.
**Struggle:** Decided to quit drinking when I woke up at noon today. Already having those feelings of saying "fuck it." But this time feels different. I've done well in the past but my last experiment with moderation has been my worst relapse to date. ..**Triumph:** Poured the last two beers that survived my wrath down the kitchen sink feeling motivated this time around. Looking like I might get a solid 8 hours of sleep tonight. ..**General:** Going to go check out that Overlord movie to keep my mind off the booze. Looks pretty gnarly!
This isn't even a struggle but it's a big "shake my head" moment I had today with my Mom. ..Recreational pot just passed in our state and although I've never been super into it I enjoy an edible here and there or a couple hits. No big deal. ..So my Mom and I were discussing that a store in town had just started selling liquor and she wondered who had given up their liquor license (since each city can only have so many). I said I wondered if they were going to relax on that since the liquor commission is probably feeling threatened by legalization. I said "I'll choose weed over alcohol or my Xanax any day." ..And my mother. You should have seen her face. "You're going to SMOKE POT?!" she gasped in horror to her 32 year old alcoholic daughter who she's cleaned puke off of seen naked running around outside and seen fall asleep outdoors multiple times. My Mom who with my Dad has drank almost 4daily since I've been alive and has seen me drunk more times than I can count with no issue was horrified. ..Such a strange double standard. I just said "eh maybe an edible here and there better than the bottle of wine I used to have!" 
Struggle.About to go to band practice and it's very triggering. It's mostly the band mates who make me want to drink not the alcohol in their hands. I'll be ok tho got my lacroiux...Triumph .Started a new health eating plan and feeling great with 2 days success. ..General.I'm almost at 7 months and I'm a badass. 
**Struggle:** I took on WAY too much this semester and am getting my ass handed to me in a handbasket over the next three weeks. Everyone wants me on their set I have a client project due on Friday that I'm nowhere even near finished and I have shoot days almost every other day for 2 straight weeks. I'm so tired. I'm so hungry. I'm so ready to just go back and hide in my old corner and sob myself to sleep...**Triumph:** I've got 2. Just because I want to go and hide away from the world I don't want alcohol to be there. I don't want to deal with that whole dilemma on top of everything else. And I am finally in a relationship with a girl who loves me. Truly unbelievably loves me. It's a miracle. It really is. I feel so fucking blessed every God damn day. I don't even believe in a big guy upstairs I just believe that she loves me and I am insanely lucky.
Gonna make it work this time thanks for the tlc
