I miss sobriety so much. That fact alone tells me I'm an alcoholic. But in recent weeks I've had many social things that include alcohol and I'm having a hard time imagining giving that up. I know my reality would be   sober people sober places . I'm  not strong enough to continue with the same socialites without booze but I'm not ready to let them go.  Anyone out there who can shed light on the  road? I know sobriety is the best but where does this relapse sit on the scale of I'm finally done for good ?

Have you read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace yet? I couldn't be sober in social settings because I felt so awkward and out of place. After reading the book I feel much more comfortable with my sobriety and I can go to bars and parties without drinking no problem.
Believe it or not it's possible to socialize with fellow humans without drinking poison. It just takes a little practice. Are these "socialites" fellow alcoholics or are they normal drinkers that like to go out? If you can't take a break from hanging out you're going to have to come up with some pretty serious methods of ensuring your sobriety around them. Telling them of your intentions to quit is a good start.
Ever think of having a "running buddy"? Folks in AA who make friends hang out with each other in social situations where there will be alcohol.  I have a close friend who knows I have a problem (she's a one glass of wine &amp; done person) I drag her to all kinds of things because her being there will keep me from drinking.
