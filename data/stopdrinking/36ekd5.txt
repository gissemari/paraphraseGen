So this is for everyone struggling. You got this. Shit ain't easy but it was never supposed to be. Some of you are in the darkest loneliest hole and no one seems to recognize you. Some of you are flying in the pink clouds high on life. Some of you have your eyes set on the stars but your body is still in the gutter. Where ever you are take heart. Feelings do not last forever! They come and go with the ebb and flow of life. One day the sun will be shining on your beautiful face and you will know what /u/3v3ryt1m3 speaks of when he says "All is right in the world".   .  .Having a hard time coming up with a reason to stop? Struggling to stay stopped? Let me quote the great Zach De La Rocha:  .> [It has to start somewhere it has to start sometime... What better place than here? What better time than now?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0kJLW2EwMg)  .  .Seriously you are not alone. There are lots of sobernauts that have gone through the shit you are going through. They were wading in shit but they didn't stop to open their mouth; neither do you! [*I'm pickin up good vibrations... oom bop bop excitations...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eab_beh07HU) So I am going to pass them on to you yes you! Uncle Sam wants you but I want you more (in a totally non-platonic interwebz inspirational way unless you promise to feed me nutella)...  .  .WeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  .*EDIT: I was told to add links*.
