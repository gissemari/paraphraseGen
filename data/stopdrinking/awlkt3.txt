Well I'm 28 days sober and have been doing quite well. ..Today however  I'm really struggling with urges and right on the edge of saying fuck it!!..My housemate is out of town so who would know?!....  I would  goddammit!! I'm so lonely.  Sitting in grocery store having a Starbucks with nothing to do today  and I have 0 friends that don't drink...I will get through this.  Just needed to rant a bit.  IWNDWYT

28 days that's awesome! You're right in the middle of it now doing real work. The last time I quit when I struggled bad I began thinking do I really want to go through this again??? Nope...Hang in there you're doing great! I will not drink with you today! 
Well done on 28 days!!! .Try and keep busy at the times you normally drink. Helps me a lot especially exercise. .I will not drink with you today....
