I've been actively cutting down on my alcohol intake since june and I finally have realized I'm ready to be done. Its not a positive thing for me anymore and I want to quit...I guess I struggle calling myself an alcoholic because I don't do reckless stuff when drunk and I dont drink a ton But I drink to cope with my pain and I'm sick of the bandage that never works and makes me feel worse. Also the longer I've tried not to drink the more I've realized how reliant I am on alcohol. ..I want sober experiences. I want to remeber everything. I'm tired of feeling like every event needs to be acompanied by booze.  ..The biggest struggle is that my fiance doesn't seem supportive of this at all. I mean he says he is but then will offer me drinks bring me my favorite wine asks me to just have a glass with him ect. I think it might be because me not drinking makes him realize how much he drinks. we always drank together but lately he drinks a lot like every day sometimes booze in his coffee before work sometimes a shot at lunch. ..I guess becoming sober is scary for me because I'm unsure how my relationship will go. I know that sobriety is something I need for long-term health and happiness regardless of what it does to my relationship. And he always says he'll be supportive and many times has been.. (Like I hadn't had fully sober sex since I had my son 3 years ago and I was super scared about it but we talked and he was supportive and awesome helping me through it all. ) I think he wants to be supportive but then he drinks and the alcohol talks and he feels uncomfortable that I'm not drinking and he's doing shots alone. Every time I bring up his drinking he gets defensive and angry. .He's told me 100x he wants to cut back but it's all talk. ..Anyways i guess any tips for unsupportive partners? .Has anyone been in a relationship where they both got sober? .Regardless of what happens to my relationship I am getting sober. For me for our son and because life is too short not to. .I plan on sitting him down this week for a serious discussion and really laying down the boundried. I think in some way the wine and such is him trying to be nice? That used to be the nicest thing someone could do for me. But he needs to stop. It makes it so much harder not to drink ..TLDR: I really want to quit drinking and my partner says he supports mein that but then will ask me to drink with him bring me my favorite wine any tips on coping with this working through this? Has anyone else dealt with this?

My husband used to behave like this in my early attempts at sobriety. He is not an alcoholic though he enjoys partying. Eventually he quit with me which proved to be crucial in my continued sobriety. It sounds like you suspect your husband has a drinking problem too; but unfortunately there is no way you can make him stop. I think it's a great idea to sit down and set some boundaries (i.e. no more surprising me with my favorite booze bring me chocolate instead or something!). Best wishes.
&gt; lately he drinks a lot like every day sometimes booze in his coffee before work sometimes a shot at lunch...This is not good behavior and I am speaking from firsthand experience. I think there's a very good chance that you are right; your spouse is intimidated by the thought of you getting sober. Have you looked into marriage counseling at all?..I was in a similar relationship and unfortunately our marriage ultimately ended. Our mutual drinking wasn't the cause of our eventual divorce but I didn't get sober until after we split. I'm hoping someone here can have a more inspiring story for you...I can tell you definitively that getting sober has been the best thing I have ever done for myself. Every aspect of my life has been improved by it: my physical health my mental health my finances my creativity everything really. I hope you and your husband can find a way to give yourselves a similar gift.
