Background: I have been through inpatient detox a couple of times over the last 5-6 years. The first detox (6 days) was relatively easy I was doped up to my eyeballs on diazepam and just played Civilization for a few days with a roommate. I started relapsing 2 weeks out of detox...The second detox I managed to stay sober for about a year with the odd beer here and there mostly sticking to MJ when I could get some. Melatonin eating properly and exercise helped a lot...Around this time last year I started to relapse properly after work pressures became too much to handle. It progressed from a beer after work to 2 beers to a 6 pack and up and up until around november last year when I decided to do something about it. ..This time instead of paying loads of money for a fancy detox center I decided (hooray for Ego) that I could do my own damn detox. I got my hands on a couple months supply of naltrexone and diazepam and began cutting down gradually each day. I maintained this tapering regimen through to February where I was down to around 2-3 standard drinks per day sometimes less but never zero. It was then that I realized I cannot do this alone and started attending AA meetings...So for the last 4-5 weeks I have been going to meetings fulltime 2 a day minimum. In between meetings I listen to speaker tapes and read the literature. I have met wonderful people have lots of phone numbers of sober members and I am building a support network and starting to help out in little ways...HOWEVER: I have not put down the last drink. I have continued to slowly taper and the last few nights I have drank less than one standard drink. I have taken to buying 1 can of mid strength cider mixing it with grapefruit juice and spreading that out to 3-4 drinks with lots of ice. ..This level of alcohol does nothing to me physically. I drink 1 standard drink or less between 6-8pm then I eat a big meal take my melatonin and have a great nights sleep. Then I jump out of bed each morning bright eyed and with no hangover at all. I feel great - physically. But I am still going through varying amounts of withdrawal and early sobriety (PAWS) issues ranging from manic energy and anger to crying to profound apathy. ..A few weeks ago I spoke to an addiction specialist explained my latest tapering regimen and asked why I can't seem to just.... stop. Why do I need to have this glass next to me each night when it physically isn't doing anything for me anymore? ..I asked whether he believes I need to get locked up in a detox or rehab for a while to keep me away from that first (and only) drink...His answer was that the amount I am drinking is not considered medically significant and that I should continue to do what I am doing: keep going to AA meetings keep cutting down ever so gently making new friends and learning new ways of dealing with life sober. ..So on doctors orders I am continuing to go to as many meetings as possible and I am trying and failing continuously to make it through just one night without a single pill or potion or puff. I am not there yet and I am absolutely astounded at my own lack of willpower when it comes to the ritual of the evening tipple. ..Thank you for reading this far. If you have any advice on how to get the courage to make it through a full 24 hours without touching a drink or if you have similar experience with tapering down and finally surrending and submitting and turning over my will to the higher power as you understand it I would appreciate any advice or support. ..Or just come over to my place and kick my ass for a couple hours until we both fall asleep maybe that would work..Thanks!

If it was me and it was the ritual I would just keep tapering until it was nothing but grapefruit juice (and maybe apple juice too). If my brain wanted to think it was drinking to give it comfort I would give it that...If it ain't broke I don't fix it.
I set a date to quit completely and stuck to it.
