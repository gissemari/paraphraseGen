Despite what my badge says I've been 6 days without alcohol (had a hiccup two days in).  I drank today - to make matters a bit worse and here's how/why I convinced myself to walk to the corner store for some beers:..I'm 22 I have a girlfriend to whom I will be giving a pretty little ring asking for her hand in marriage within a few weeks.  She is well aware of my struggle with alcohol (could explain my struggles but that's a whole new thread) and has been a major source of support for me.  Today was day number 6 without a drink (in recent times I've had similar or better 'streaks' of abstinence) and I for some god awful reason got some cheap ass beer.  . **Here's What Made me Feel O.K About Getting These Beers**.*In the past five days I have rejected maddening cravings.*A highschool acquaintance posted a music album we both used to like as high-schoolers (I still like the music) I clicked the link to the youtube album thing ... comments start suggesting beer is perfect with this album..... in my brain I'm like "oh yeah .... beeeeeeeeeer". .*zombie status I get beer...My girlfriend/fiancee is well aware of the struggle that I have and she's a huuuuge source of comfort.  To make things clear I'm trying to abstain for me she just happens to help in an immense way and is a very positive vibration in my life - yet at the same time I seem to be able to use this as an excuse to drink till we get married and move in together --> me thinking --> "I can go a week without a drink if I have the will once I share a home with the woman that i LOVE i won't have a problem not drinking because I'll have her around to: a) keep an eye on me and b) distract me and constantly remind me of the natural source of good feeling and of good love.    ...Hope this made sense!  I suppose I'm just looking for some opinions and ideas!  Thanks this place is great.

I think I get what you're saying: it's great because she's so supportive but maybe it could also be not so great. It sounds like you have a pretty good thing going with her. Fast forward to the future. The excuses could continue well into the marriage and create problems. You can head this off at the pass now and avoid the problems. ..I've been down this road and luckily my marriage survived but it almost didn't. Be good to yourself and your future wife.
Moving in with a SO can be an interesting learning experience even in the best relationships there tends to be a lot of adjustment need to make concessions and as such there needs to be a lot of communication to ensure things run smoothly (its not all sunshine and lollipops). ..Do you think think you'd be able to have rational discussions like these when you're just struggling in the first blooms of sobriety (and potentially when you're both angry over some stupid little thing)? ..For me in my first month I needed to be very selfish to ensure I did what was right for me moving in with my (currently imaginary) SO and all the adjustments to that life wouldn't have been conducive to that and I can imagine the first hint of an argument would have sent be back to the bottle. ..Get it out of the way get started for real today. You will not regret it!
We are here when you need us.
I like your honesty and thoughtfulness.  ..Here's one thought: do you really want to NEED your girlfriend in order to stay sober?  That actually could be bad for your relationship.  In my opinion you don't want to set up a dynamic where you are the irresponsible one who only manned up and got sober when you moved in together.  That to me just screams "relapse" whenever you two have a fight or when she's tired and pregnant or you two have little kids and you want to go do man-stuff with men involving beer drinking etc etc.  It's actually not fair to you or to her.  It almost infantalizes you and sort of forces her into a "drinking police" position.  I know you don't mean it that way now but it certainly could easily turn into that. ..Anyway that probably sounds quite critical but truly I am impressed by your honesty and willingness to post your feelings here and I'm trying to meet you with equal honesty.  Just something to think about. 
&gt; I for some god awful reason got some cheap ass beer...The reason is because you indicate that you have a past history of alcoholic drinking and your alcoholic brain is singing it's siren call to you. It's also singing this:..&gt;"I can go a week without a drink if I have the will once I share a home with the woman that i LOVE i won't have a problem not drinking because I'll have her around to: a) keep an eye on me and b) distract me and constantly remind me of the natural source of good feeling and of good love."..Do you really want to make your future wife responsible for something that is ultimately your responsibility which is your alcoholic drinking? Do you think that is fair to her? You said that she knows of your struggles. If she knows even **IF** you were able to drink as you proposed she will likely be wary of your honesty about how much you drank if you drank before you got home or if you continue to drink after she goes to bed. Do you want a full life of trust and honesty with her? ..I know you're searching for some "out" to be able to drink...even every once awhile. We've all been there looking for that loophole that gives our alcoholic brain what it wants. Justifying our insanity. ..I know everyone must make their own decisions which direction to go and trip over their own feet on this path. I would only suggest that you really search deep in your soul and look for the real reason(s) why you want to continue drinking. What does it do for you in any beneficial way? Trust me when I say that searching for an out and trying to maintain drinking is WAY harder than quitting. I know you said you had 6 days. Why don't you make a commitment to yourself to quit for 30 and then re-evaluate at that time? That will give you a clearer head for your decisions without the major constant pull of the physical addiction clouding your thoughts...Good journey my friend. I wish you well on your path.
