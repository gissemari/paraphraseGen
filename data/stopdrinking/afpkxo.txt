Just finished reading a book The Spectacular Now and the main character is a teenager who struggles with alcohol abuse the entire novel. It's a young adult novel but it was really interesting to read and see the slow downward spiral of a high school senior who is considered the life of the party. And the ending made me feel like I was punched in the stomach. It's a movie also but the movie ending had a manufactured Hollywood happy ending so it didn't end realistically in my opinion. If you're bored and into reading check it out! Happy (sober) Sunday all.

I saw the movie and didn't realize that it was based on a book although that makes sense. I agree the ending didn't feel realistic but there was quite a lot of accurate scenes about alcoholism. I've been reading a lot today too. Happy sober Sunday and congratulations on two weeks!   IWNDWYT
