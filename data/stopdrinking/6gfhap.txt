**Re-posted with permission from u/akayahtzee (my amazing cousin). I related to every bit and thought it was worth sharing**...***... ...It's been a while. This is a long post.  ... ...I always drank quite a lot. Teenage hijinks a very extended gap year university. Everyone drank. Sometimes I stepped outside the lines. I drank more when I was unhappy and I'd cycle in and out of unhappiness like a broken clock. I nearly dropped out at the end of my first year when everything stopped making sense and after 4 days of no sleep drugged by sleeping pills and wine I ran away from uni from my exams to Croatia and my uncle's house. It was somewhere else to be. I finally slept and woke up in a room by the sea; salt breeze white shutters sunlight on linen. My nerves felt like they had been burnt out; electricity and ash. I smoked a cigarette and sat on the cool tiles and called my parents. They brought me home. I took my exams and failed. I spent a summer revising with my family by a colder British sea. I retook my exams barely passed and didn't drop out.... ...I felt better and I still drank quite a lot. Everyone did. I said some stupid stuff I pissed off my friends. Mostly I was forgiven. I didn't do as well as I should have but I didn't fail again. Mostly it was fine. There were days when Oxford felt full of promised magic   old stone on lazy woozy afternoons; sparkling wine from the bottle on a confetti-ed riverbank; evenings sparking with laughter and gin and wanting to know everything all at once. In London too after I left. Nights of pubs and conversation and possibility until I felt drunk on my friends wanting to breathe them in. I kissed people I adored and some I liked just okay. Sometimes maybe often I was very happy.... ...I'd cycle back of course. I phoned my mother in tears more often than was strictly necessary for a twenty-something girl with pals and a nice job a beautiful flat she doesn't pay for and no real problems to speak of. It came and it went. Life was lovely and life was occasionally grim and none of it made much sense. Sometimes it would occur to me that things were making less sense than usual that I was slipping a bit too far. A bad day became a bad week a bad month a bad patch. The normal distractions of booze and cigarettes and midnight adventures weren't working were making everything worse. Last summer a succession of cortisol-days and private humiliations   some to do with drinking some not   finally took root again and mutated until after a nice week by the sea with nice friends I had one of my worst-ever panic attacks on a train platform at Slough. There have been three occasions in my life when some internal fever has risen to a point where I thought I would actually break or go mad. Slough wasn't Croatia but it was close. I ended up back at my parents' burnt out. A month later and the pattern repeated. Another holiday another sea. Wandering from drunk to hungover and back again shame and fear and a fever rising.... ...I returned to London and I stopped drinking 241 days ago. There's nothing particularly significant about the number 241 except that it's the day I could finally be bothered to write this. It's nearly 8 months; it's 13/20ths of a year (Google had to help me with that one). It's a decent chunk of time and it's barely any time at all. At the time if there was any logic to stopping it was an attempt at a quick fix. A tangible obvious solution something to point at. An action or a lack of action as a way to short a circuit I'd finally had enough of. When I started I downloaded a lame little app on my iPhone to count the days. I couldn't stand to write  Quit Drinking  so the days stack up on top of a line of emojis   the cross-armed blonde girl the champagne bottle the wine glass the martini.... ...That image of warding something off feels correct. I stopped drinking out of fear; of how dark and twisted my mind could get of disliking myself more than I did already. I carried on I think mainly out of stubbornness. I know   deep in my bones _know_   that it was the right decision at least temporarily. But it doesn't necessarily feel that way. I started writing this from my parents' garden where I've worked from for the last week (spot the theme!) after once again getting to a point where I felt I couldn't hack London couldn't cope with the vagaries and banalities of a perfectly ordinary life. The loop repeated. Weeks and months sliding by with rare ease sparks of joy a hinted touchstone of purpose and place. And then starting again the old quickening of confusion and overload and more-more-more until every decision feels like a disfiguring compromise strange and misplaced grief yawning into a period of numb existential blankness punctuated by the feeling of stomach acid behind my teeth. I am not  fixed'. I am deeply hostile about this.... ...Stopping drinking has not been the straight shortcut I thought it would be. The colours are not always brighter. I go to significantly fewer parties and on quite a few more runs. I don't spend as much money. I'm probably more productive and in an active state of crisis less often but mostly (_mostly_) I'm just enormously bored. I suspect that this is not a thing you are meant to say some violation of the narrative of getting and being better that was agreed upon a long time ago where commitment and sacrifice are made and struggled through but eventually rewarded. There have been rewards   a cold comfort in commitment for the sake of it in inflicting rules and then living inside them. There is a certain liberation in ascribing some ordering principle on yourself especially when that self is so characterised by childish wants and being deeply uncomfortable and unsure much of the time. At the moment that liberation feels so bitter and half-formed that it's almost not worthy of being any conclusion at all   I'm seconds away from slamming down the lid of my laptop and having an actual tantrum on the floor   but it is a type of freedom a way out of chaos rather than towards it. I know from experience too that my current feelings will cycle away and that this cycle is itself just a little less dark than the previous one. It's a small light but it's there. What this period of abstinence has given me chiefly is an awareness that the work of trying to be happy   trying and not getting there and trying again   is so much harder than the inertia of unhappiness and crashing through the same easy terrible choices and so much more necessary. There is nothing to do with that knowledge but tuck it tight in the back-pocket of your jeans combat it with good jokes and good pals and the good moments that make your heart beat right and keep on going. Right this second I hate this but it's true...
