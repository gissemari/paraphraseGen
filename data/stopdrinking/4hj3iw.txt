I've seen the movie "Smashed" three times. It's absolutely the best movie about sobriety I've ever seen...The first time I watched it I knew I had some sort of drinking problem but wasn't quite ready to quit. I related so hard to the early scenes in the movie: the embarrassing encounter she has at the liquor store in the middle of the night the terror of waking up and realizing what she'd done the night before the shame of a hangover at work...The second time I watched it I was drunk. I hadn't meant to get drunk   I was on vacation and promised myself I'd make the most of it. But I was still trying to moderate and a few drinks turned into many and I watched the movie in bed that night (even my drunk brain was growing aware that I really did have a drinking problem). Again I was mostly struck by the early scenes in the movie. I saw too much of myself in her character before she gets sober...The third time I watched it was a couple weeks ago. I decided to get sober in February and have had a few relapses but I'm squarely in the recovery phase. I found myself instead relating to the second half of the movie which consists of the character's journey toward sobriety. And that shift in relatability felt like a sign of progress for me...Have you guys seen this movie? What do you think?
