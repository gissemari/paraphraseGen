So in May this year I decided to quit drinking. You can read a lot about this on my post history if you want to know more about the how and why. This post should serve as both diary entry and as an outlook for people who are just into their sobriety...For context I'm a single guy in my early 30s. Here's a bunch of things ..&amp;#x200B;..\# The Feels..I'm struggling with ADHD and depression. The latter was TERRIBLE after my first month but I'm starting to learn to enjoy being able to feel feelings at all instead of numbing them down with booze. Sometimes it gets a bit much; I never cried at movies but recently I cannot help it. I mean the other day I was watching Creed of all things and teared up during the main fight...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Looks..I used to be pretty overweight but started losing a lot of it. Mostly because the carbs of alcohol are gone plus I eat way less shitty. I'm also hardly ever too tired or hungover to go to the gym. I do eat way too many sweets but combined with sports and (mad shoutouts to) /r/intermittentfasting I'm on a good way. I started to like my body again the ladies show me that they do as well and I'm enjoying that a lot...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Friends..Just like just about everyone here I was afraid how my social life would be without drinking. Spoiler it's great. That boils down to two things:..For one I'm enjoying my time alone. I'm waaaaay less disconnected with my own feelings and myself so I'm not scared of time alone. Don't get me wrong I still do all kinds of distracting shit (this is only my self-help-and-weird-meme-subs account I've got a more serious reddit account as well and I'm watching some shit on TV as I'm typing this; shoutouts to /r/ADHD) but I don't drown out my own company with booze...The other point is that I'm just way better at connecting with people. Don't get me wrong there's a bunch of other people I basically stopped seeing and I sometimes miss going wild with them but the friends I have left are at the very least accepting of my decision to not drink and appreciate sober me which makes me feel so much better about myself...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Shits..People here keep saying how it's nice to not have diarrhoea all the time but sometimes I'm just constipated af. I'm starting to have these weird unflushable turds that I eventually learned to just push down the drain with the toilet brush thing...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Others..Talking about other drugs: I've always been a casual cigarette smoker and I do that more often. (Meaning in my case a day with smoking every 2 weeks or so.) Also sugar caffeine ritaline and sports; sometimes weed. I wanna cut the smoking and the sugar and maybe the caffeine and the ritaline but come on I gotta live somehow. I never quit drinking to be the best possible person; I quit drinking to be a better me and I'm already being that. There'll always be ways to improve but I'm not gonna beat myself up on all that just yet...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Future..I don't think I gave up for good. I've got a holiday planned in South America where I might also take a holiday off my sobriety depending on how I feel and I'll see how I feel about drinking sometime next year. There most definitely was a shift in my perception of alcohol though: Instead of a problem solver and basically life elixir I see it as it is; as a drug that is pretty dangerous and shouldn't be taken lightly. I'm in no way advocating for drinking here; it's just that as written above I'm not drug free at all. If I use alcohol as I smoke cigs and weed (that is sometimes always socially not getting fucked up and if I do just going straight to bed instead of giving in to the cravings for more) it's personally fine with me. I might do another post on how that goes after I decide to do it; it'll just not be this year and probably not this winter...&amp;#x200B;..\# The Help..To finish this off: Mad love to all of you; it helps so much to know how relatable this struggle is. My therapist was a huge help as well and y'all made me read and listen to Annie Grace. Also my friends have been AMAZING (I've been best man at the wedding of two sober friends a week into my sobriety; don't think I could have stayed sober if they weren't; plus I don't feel pressured by my friends who asked me to stop drinking cause I was becoming a pain in the ass anymore but they're rather amazed that I'm still absolutely off the booze). But the most important source for help was this subreddit...I knew I could come here with my struggles and y'all would understand I read your struggles and commented WAAAAAAY to seldom and it's great to have this community. Very love much thanks.

Love back at you!  SD is the best damn place on the internet for sure...I really liked your section on friends.  I've always been an introvert but now that I'm sober socializing is a lot less taxing and at times I even enjoy it and find it reinvigorating.  Being alone with myself is also _much_ easier but some of that might be due to the therapy I go to and the meditation I've picked up since putting down the bottle...See you around!  IWNDWYT
