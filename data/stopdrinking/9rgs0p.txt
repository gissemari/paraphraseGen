Just wanted to say thank you to everyone here - Im sober because of this online group aa the sponsor and the 12 steps.  It wasn't easy - but once I got passed the 9 month mark of recovery tears and hard work...I was able to come to the peaceful place I am at today.  Im looking forward to sharing my story at my one year cake with my new sober friends who have supported me along the way.  Don't hesitate to reach out if you are struggling or want to ask me what else worked for me.  Here's to another 24 hours of clarity and sobriety.
