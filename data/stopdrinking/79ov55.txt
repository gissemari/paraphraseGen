I know I just posted but wanted to add more thing.  I have quit before using Allen Carr's drinking book.  Then after 3 months I ran into an old buddy and bought a 6 pack.  Here I am like 9 years later still struggling.  ..Just wondering if anyone else has used this method.  I want the magic of Easyway to work for me again.

I haven't used his method but I just wanted to say hi and that I'm glad you're here. I will not drink with you today. 
I've seen it mentioned a lot by people it worked for. A lot of folks also like This Naked Mind which you can download on the sidebar if you're worried you won't get a repeat performance out of Carr because you've already read it. Not sure if that's true or not but it can't hurt to have more resources. 
This Naked Mind is basically an updated version of Easyway. Same basic philosophy but with updated and cited science.
I first quit drinking 10 years ago thanks to AC's book. Sadly I allowed others to convince me that moderation was fine and it was a quick slide back into 5 nights a week drinking. I re-read it again 6 weeks ago and have been sober since. There's a lot of sense in that book!
I used Allen Carr's book with great success! I now view alcohol as a poison and it is incomprehensible why I would want that in my body!
