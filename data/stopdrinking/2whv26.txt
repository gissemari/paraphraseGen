Ive been reading this sub daily for 2 weeks and Ive noticed a common theme.... the majority of us myself included are struggling to love ourselves our minds our bodies and people around us as a direct result of our drinking...Its probably been mentioned before but Id like to recommend the book **You Can Heal Your Life** by Louise L. Hay...Its a very well-known book and I believe it can be a helpful addition to the 'sobriety toolbox'...She addresses our mental patterns and believes that all dis-ease is created in the mind initially and this eventually manifests itself to dis-ease of the body.   ..She recommends a lot of mirror work whereby you look in the mirror look yourself right in the eyes and tell yourself 'I love you'. Its actually quite difficult to do but eventually I hope I start to believe it. There are also affirmations to repeat on a daily basis. .I hope it can be of some help for others who may be struggling with self-hate/self-esteem/guilt/anger/blame/ etc issues..

&gt; She addresses our mental patterns and believes that all dis-ease is created in the mind initially and this eventually manifests itself to dis-ease of the body. ..I gotta be honest and say that this flags for bullshit at least to me. I'm sure there's some good stuff in there but at least in regards to the idea of physical diseases being a manifestation of mental diseases this sounds like a new-agey version of faith healing. Animals get diseases all the time and I'm pretty sure they don't have the mental patterns she's claiming cause disease.
