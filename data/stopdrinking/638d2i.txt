Hello everyone. Thought I'd share something about myself (I think that's okay here)..When I was in undergrad I started drinking. I was always one of those people that thought I didn't have a problem but I'd definitely binge on weekends at parties etc. It got to the point where whenever I had a social interaction I'd make it a point to be drunk because I thought that I needed to in order to have fun...Flash to 15 days ago and I decided to remove alcohol from my life in an effort to re-evalute my social life. Also I take lithium so I really shouldn't be drinking at all. I've already had a few tests. I went to the club this past weekend and I thought I'd relapse but I didn't! I still had fun and I was even able to dance with a few guys...So I'm learning a lot. Alcohol is so pervasive and invades so much of our lives. I don't know if I'll go back to alcohol. But so far I'm learning more about myself. My confidence is still here. I'm still myself if not better. I'll see where tomorrow takes me.

Nice. Congrats for gaining some perspective and for having a fun sober weekend at the bar. Not drinking feels weird at first but I'm so glad that I make the daily decision to not drink. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.
Keep up the good work.   U deserve to have a happy life.  Alcohol is a downer. 
Proud of you!
