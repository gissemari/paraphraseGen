I've been struggling a lot with drinking this year. Not really so much the drinking itself as my own habits have actually slowed down - but just watching my friends and myself waste so much of our lives on this poison. This October I went almost 30 days without a drink which is the longest I've ever gone since turning 21 (I'm 25 now). I wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic but I've definitely had periods of time where I drank way too much every day. Last January I realized that I needed to slow down. I've moderated my drinking significantly since then but never really felt the need to totally quit. This summer one of my best friends blacked out at .4 BAC and almost died. He survived and was taken by the police to the hospital. He spent the summer in rehab and is now sober. Around that time I really started to question my own habits though nowhere near as bad as his. I started lurking this sub and realized what an amazing community you guys have here. ..Going that month off the sauce really gave me a different perspective and helped me to not crave alcohol every day anymore. I really hardly crave it at all these days. I guess this is a regular part of hitting your late 20's. Either you settle down and slow the partying or it becomes a problem. It's just getting hard watching people still drink themselves sick. I was at a party this weekend and one of my friends ended up throwing up and passing out. I found myself feeling disturbed and upset 3 years ago I wouldn't have cared but I'm just over it. I'm starting to realize the time I've wasted drinking when I could have been doing other more creative or productive things. I'm 3 days drink free now starting to feel real emotions again and I'm gonna stick with it as long as I can. Just wanted to post to say thank you to this sub for keeping it real. Gracias.

I want to start off by saying congratulations on being introspective and honest with yourself. That's huge and not everyone can do it. ..But I really wanted to post to caution you that I was always in a similar situation with my friends having more serious addiction problems than myself. And well a few years ago (I'm 26 now) I sort of fell in with them and drinking became a very serious problem. Like you my problem never became on the level of my friends but still a very serious one (ie drinking most days and a good 3/4 days a week I'd go on serious binges) ..It doesnt sound like it every got that bad for you (Although I don't mean to over infer in what you wrote and I apologise if I am). But at the same time the way your described your situation was similar to how I felt in my situation. I've thankfully come a long way in the past few months and you definitely sound like you caught your problem much earlier than I did so that can only be a good thing...Pier pressure though man. D.A.R.E. wasn't lying when they told us as kids how serious a thing it is no joke whatsoever there...I'd also like to throw in as a last point that I have older relatives whove struggled with alcohol. You mentioned getting older and turning points. While I do believe that anyone can turn around addiction at any age I think that the older you get the more you let it become and/or remain a part of your life the harder recovery becomes. You don't need to talk your friends out of drinking necessarily but be careful about them talking you into weekend benders where you my friend wind up being the one puking everywhere...I apologize for being so long-winded and the probable typos from trying to hammer that out quickly haha I feel pretty passionate about this topic and I hope some of what I said connected. 
Gracias for your courage to post!  ..&gt;  struggling a lot with drinking..Yes and also struggling with the cravings and sometimes they get you to drink and sometimes they don't...&gt; that month off the sauce really gave me a different perspective..A clear head is a wonderful thing until ... a craving comes along and then what is the right thing to do?..&gt; 3 days drink free now starting to feel real emotions again..The point where you have relapsed in the past is important. Knowing what my triggers are will help me to prepare myself for when they might happen next. It is a sure thing that my triggers will get strong when my mental state is weak.

If I were you I'd stick close to that best friend in recovery. He would be a great support and I'm sure he'd love to meet up for coffee or a movie instead of getting sloshed and stupid :) Welcome and I wish I'd quit at your age!
