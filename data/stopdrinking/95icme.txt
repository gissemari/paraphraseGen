and I ordered a glass of wine. A moment of weakness (it was a 5$ special!). But I decided not to drink it. I gave it to my partner and I got ice cream on my way home. .Definitely made me think about stuff evaluate my journey and think about how I would deal with an actual relapse and how I deal with my partner drinking around me. I have no regrets. I don't care if I don't get any comments. I'm just happy I could come here and let you know I did it. .I will not drink with you tonight.

good for you
Good job! We all need to be able to get to that point where we can go into a bar or club have a drink in front of us and be able to pass it off to the next person. It sucks that we have to limit ourselves to certain locations people or events because of temptation. Shouldn't be that way. Should be able to enjoy every place we want to go
Way to stay strong! IWNDWYT 
Ice cream has totally become my "replacement" for skipping a night out getting drunk. Nice work!!
 
Great! I practice out loud daily what I'll have at a bar ir party. "I'll take a (your NA drink) please." Repeat 5 times. 
Nice. 
Hope your 70 day is awesome!!
68 for me. Right behind you. I'm pretty sure I'm going to start again. Just enjoying it while I can. :)
Great job! You should be proud of yourself
