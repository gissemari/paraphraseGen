[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I have been reading about [*kintsugi*](http://imgur.com/VPZN4qR) the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer that has been mixed with powdered gold. The method treats breakage as simply part of the history of an object rather than something that means that the object like a broken plate is now worthless...Like many people who have a drinking problem I have done great damage to myself and my body and this has been a source of shame. But *kintsugi* actually draws attention to the cracks where something has broken instead of trying to hide them. In fact after the damage has been highlighted with gold dust the object is actually more precious than it was before. I am trying to see myself this way -- as previously damaged but still having worth and perhaps even more value.. .**Struggle:** Due to my non-healing foot wound I now walk with a cane. It makes me feel like a 99-year-old cantankerous old woman -- like children are going to run when they see me coming down the street...**General Christmas trivia:** Did you know that many Japanese families eat at Kentucky Fried Chicken on Christmas Eve? (In Japan December 24th is apparently more of a holiday than the 25th and the KFC X-mas Eve dinner is a tradition that was started in the 70s.) ..Where will *you* be on Christmas Eve?..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph mixed with struggle... I got a promotion and a raise but I kind of question if that was due to me replacing alcoholism with workaholism. Thankfully I am learning to understand what normal work hours are and recognizing WHEN it's necessary for me to stay and what to say no to! Making self-care a priority for this xmas season which involves a lot of saying no! ...Struggling also with health problems from my past addictions. Note to self I am not invincible and the maximum daily dose for OTC painkillers is a very real limit that you shouldn't toy with.... ....No trivia but a recipe. Just made [Zuppa Toscana](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2015/01/zuppa-toscana/) and it's freakin' delicious. I am so grateful I'm back on the cooking train again forgot how good real food can taste!!! 
I love your triumph!  That's awesome. ..*Triumph:* 90+ days..*Struggle:* Not to just talk about myself &amp; high negative rate (thoughts of myself topics of discussion mood  etc)..*General:* Christmas Eve for most of my life has been dad's (divorced parents) so staying with tradition pushing thirty we go to my sisters house and that side of the family (about a dozen people) come over to eat/relaz while the niece &amp; nephews get the holiday gift experience.  [Mom's side is Christmas day with like 30 &amp; is completely chaotic lol]
Your triumph was really interesting - I had no idea about that...**Triumph** - I'm sober and given my recent struggles that's my biggest triumph.  I also got a promotion at work which is really cool but kind of mind boggling.  I have been able to shield the chaos of my personal life/alcoholism from my professional life and I'm not sure how.  I know that - ultimately -  I can't continue my drinking and perform at my job. ..**Struggle** - I am going to New Orleans tomorrow for a full week.  This trip was planned months ago when I was heavy into the bottle.  There's always a ton of alcohol flowing at these trips and I told my friend I'm visiting there I won't be drinking but he doesn't believe me or take me seriously.  And honestly given my history I don't blame him.  I'm pretty scared. I've been a "functional alcoholic" for well over a decade but something's happened in the past year where I feel like I can't drink safely *at all*.  I black out much much more and my behavior is just unsettling and dangerous.  Like I feel that in my past the chances of a serious blackout/fuckup were maybe 5% of the time?  Over the course of the last year I feel like it's around 50%. I don't know if this is a common progression with alcoholics or what but I know it's bad.  I've checked out some potential meetings and will likely be on here...**General** - Bought myself a lottery scratcher today.  Didn't win... /:
T: Got 3 working days of 2016 left and so far it sucked but it didn't kill me. ..S: There doesn't seem to be anything around at the moment that I could classify as a "struggle". Some minor irritations. ..G: I have two weeks of leave and I have my daughter for all of it!! Fun sun and quality sober time. 
Very nice! I hope everyone is on track. 
Triumph: It's christmas break - And I am sober!..Struggle: My alarm clock on my new phone doesn't work... Got up a little late :D..General: I have two exams in the first week of january so I've got a lot of homework to do but it's better than doing nothing :).
Triumph: I'm under a lot of financial strain at the moment. Imagine being in a position where your landlord owes you money and has repeatedly had to borrow money for bills in the week leading up to Christmas...I didn't snap. I didn't drink. Instead I just planned out the rest of my week and started looking for somewhere else. The money is a loss he literally can't pay me back. I'm done. But I'm not raging or anything...Struggle: The above. I'm working A LOT right now trying to keep everything together. Falling short on some of my metrics for my business more a lack of contract availability due to it being December than not having time which is irritating because I was fucking SLAMMED at my retail job for two months...General: This should be the first year in my entire life I'm actually able to afford Christmas gifts for my entire family. Should be the rest of the week still needs to unfold and I'm down $300 that I should have in my pocket right now. But hey... I'm trying.
Good question.
Hey sfgirlmary that's an awesome Triumph! "..perhaps even more value..". Love it! Sorry to hear about the non-healing foot - is the cane at least helping? I'm thinking of you :). ..Triumph:  I was released from detox on this day last year so I'm making this the most wonderful Christmas for my family. I did the lights all decorations the shopping the wrapping the catering etc.. It's incredible what a difference one year makes!..Struggle:   I've had old friends and old flames calling and texting me the past few days. As a result this has forced me to face the past - memories (some good some...well let's not go there). I've heard everything from "still not drinking Lee?" to "I'm so proud of you" to "wtf are you a nun now?!". Needless to say I smiled about some of the good nostalgia and simply closed the door on the not-so-good. Faced it shed a few tears onward and upward...General:   Christmas Eve plans: volunteering my morning with Mom at her dialysis hospital (in reindeer attire God help me lol) visiting sober/normie friends and then settling in to have a beautiful Christmas Eve dinner and gift exchange at my home with wonderful family and friends (bonus: nobody drinks!!). ..Warmest wishes to all of our SD family for a safe happy healthy and sober Christmas and Hanukkah! xoxo
I Love your triumph this week Mary :) Very cool. ..**Triumph:** My manager and I have been having some very great conversations about behind the scenes stuff and it's awesome to know he trusts me and values my opinions and input on things. I know he's looking out for me and my career and he's a great boss. Lucky to work with him...**Struggle:** Work is gonna be a bit crazy the next few weeks and I'm mentally gearing up for the stresses now. Working Christmas AND new years day sucks but oh well. I'm grateful to have the job  and the days will eventually return to normal. But I'll be pretty high stress until then. ..**General:** I'll be home maybe go exchange gifts with the family and generally trying to sleep as much as possible before christmas and work. 
T: Cracked the first week. I've also discovered that the only reason I ate so much fast food was because drunk and I said "stuff it not cooking" so I haven't actually had any for the past week either. So that's a nice little bonus...S: Can't. Fall. Asleep. Even if I feel really tired it takes me far too long to drift off...G: I'm going to Fawlty Towers Live after Christmas. Looking forward to it.
Ring the bells that still can ring. .Forget your perfect offering. .There is a crack in everything. .That's how the light gets in..-leonard cohen..That's the song that started playing on my intracranial stereo system after reading your post Mary. Thank you for such a beautiful image...Triumph : I made it a year and change with no drinking. ..Struggle: just a few days into the family gathering for the holidays and this is the hardest it has been to stay sober since last December. There are some strong personalities to deal with in my family that are just exhausting.... makes me want to check out. ..General : have to get my picture taken in a few hours haven't slept have been crying for a few hours looking all puffy with bloodshot eyes... a very pre-sober me look! :p
Maybe you've had a similar dream: I 'wake up' to find myself riding in the passenger seat of a speeding car. I look over and there's no one in the driver's seat. I look ahead and we're flying toward a busy intersection. I struggle to climb into the driver's seat my foot can't get to the brake fast enough. I'm stuck but finally wedge myself in and slam on the brake. The car skids into the intersection just in time to avoid an accident. ..I've tried sobriety a few times this year. I want this to really be the time I take control. 
Triumph:  Got a new battery for my car made a world of difference. ..Struggle:  Christmas on a weekend is going to be rough family will be town they'll want to go out and drink saturday night.  I'll tag along for a bit at least. ..General:  Xmas eve I'll be at my aunt and uncles house it will be great to see them and my Cousin up from where he lives.  We always have a good time.  They keep a bottle of old grandad for me this will be the first time in a long that I won't be having any.  Tea for me please! 
Triumph: I'm so glad I posted here yesterday about my craving. I got wonderful support and made it through the day sober. I'm incredibly proud of myself and grateful for this community. And even though it's a triumph to come I'm so looking forward to a sober Christmas. Cannot wait...Struggle: Disordered eating. I've been on antibiotics for a horrible sinus infection and my appetite has been seriously curbed. I can stand to lose weight (funny what thousands of calories in booze can do) but losing weight triggers my former anorexia. So when I start losing I start restricting to an unhealthy degree. I begin to think about the praise I could get for weight loss and stop thinking about true healthy living. My struggle is definitely letting go of my eating disorder. Working on it...Christmas eve: Strangely enough I'm planning on eating sushi while the Japanese eat KFC! Found out that my local grocery does all gluten free sushi and I'm super excited. Trying not to get any dishes dirty before the big day so it's takeaway for me! Just spending the night with my husband before family descends. Should be fun!
**Triumph**: Loads of stuff. I completed a 6 weeks beginners Muay thai course I ran a 10k race at the weekend I finished Bioshock Infinite (about three years after everyone else) I sent xmas cards this year and finished my xmas shopping!..**Struggle**: I had the briefest moment of 'oh man I wish I could let loose a bit more like when I was drinking' but I pulled myself out of it. I forget that I need to relearn all this stuff after a decade of faking it with booze. ..**General**: I'll be in my flat on Christmas Eve because we are doing Xmas this year with both my and my bf's families!
Triumph: I got through another round of *"oh shit I can't do this anymore life is too hard sober is too hard somethings going to break in me and I don't want it to but I can't stop it"* thanks to the support I found here. Back in my safer state of mind and focused on each today as it gets here. ..Struggle: My grandfather passed this week he was my mother's step father but the only "grandpa" I knew on that side. There is a lot of bad history there with my mother. My brother and I were never treated as grandchildren by him or my grandmother. He was a stranger to me and while I feel sad about death in general I'm more concerned if my mother is really ok like she says she is. ..General: Christmas Eve is our big day celebrating. I'm so excited for the grandkids to wake up on Christmas Eve morning to find what Santa brought. Then were hosting a brunch with my parents so they can celebrate x-mas with the kids. Then were headed to my in-laws to celebrate with all of my husband's family. It's going to be a super busy day and I can't wait for it!
Triumph: I recognized that my job I've only been at for 2 months is killing my soul and I had a great job interview at a cool new place yesterday.  They want me to come back this week to meet with the executive chef so that seems like a good sign .Struggle:  I won't be able to go home for Christmas due to said soul killing job and I'm feeling pretty down about it. . The methodist church at the end of my road has an evening service though so I think I will try to go so I at least feel like it's Christmas (I'm Episcopalian my SO is methodist but they're sorta similar)..We're going to get authentic Chinese food and then go to church Christmas eve.
Good morning! It's going to be a great day!
Wow kintsugi is so cool.  Thanks for sharing!  This a perfect thought to dwell on as the new year approaches.  ..**Triumph:**  I'm pulling myself out of my funk.  I had a couple of months of a bit of depression and low energy but I kept making myself do stuff and even enjoyed myself a lot of the time.  ..**Struggle:**  Still sick and just waiting for my health insurance to start on the first of the year so I can figure out why I haven't been able to breathe through my nose.  It seems like a minor thing but it really sucks to be chronically clogged up.  At least I'm getting my shit together to finally address the issue...**General Christmas:** My husband's family is from Arizona and every Christmas Eve we eat posole and tamales and have an open house where folks can drop by and visit at any point during the afternoon/evening and have some food.  This year Christmas Eve may be icy and snowy here in Oregon so we may just have the regular extended family of 9 or 10 folks but I'm looking forward to a fun sober holiday.
**Triumph:** I'm actually looking forward to the Christmas holiday. A little bit but that's a lot more than usual. I'm mostly ready I've got time off work and my Mom is visiting at the holiday for the first time in years...**Struggle:** I've complained about work projects on here for almost 6 months. They've been big sources of stress and squirrellyness. now I'm watching people argue and snap at each other as the projects get further and further delayed...**Kintsugi** is such a great metaphor for us isn't it?
**Triumph:** I've made it 105 days not drinking...**Struggle:** I've been really sick for a while now and I'm getting tired of it. I've also been feeling a bit depressed since the weekend. I keep getting the old familiar voices of "You'll always be a failure. Why kid yourself with this flying thing? Might as well drink for the holidays." It's weird because I haven't heard those voices in a long time and I even posted my own thread a week ago about how great I was doing and how awesome sobriety is for me. I know it's going to pass but it sucks right now. I just want to feel better. It feels like living with a constant hangover right now with my cloudy head. I miss my clear head. ..**Xmas** - I'll be with my family at my brother's house. I'll be the only one not drinking. 
I think that's a beautiful way to look at oneself and I'm glad to hear you are doing so.  How frustrating about the foot!  Sending you healing vibes...**Triumph:**   I've been really consistent at the gym for the last few months and am seeing a real change in my strength and my body composition.  It feels good to look the way I've wanted and to be a strong woman.  I cannot wait to be cranking out multiple sets of dead-hang pullups!..**Struggle:**  I REALLY want to pay off my car so my mortgage payments aren't so tight but I'm charging my girlfriend cheap rent because she doesn't have a job right now.  Working to stay patient and reallocate funds to meet that goal anyways.  Trying not to be resentful...**General:**  I had no idea about that Japanese tradition - how random!  Don't Jewish folks eat Chinese during Christmas?  I'm grabbing a few traditional Swedish foods and we'll have a simple meal at home for Christmas Eve.
**Triumph:** I'm closing the business year out having increased my turnover by a good 20% making it my most successful year since setting up. The forecast is looking strong too I think 2017 has the makings of being a bumper year for me business-wise...**Struggle:** I've had fleeting drinking thoughts these last couple of days. Nothing major it's just the time of year and having now been to 5 separate social events where alcohol was being served and drank in abundance. I'm confident I won't buckle though...**General:** I will be playing at a church service in a band then playing carols around the village Christmas tree on Christmas Eve then playing carols in the street and into people's homes on Christmas Day morning.
T:  I've got almost all of my laundry and dishes done.  This week and a half is the first time i've had significant time for myself in a long time. ..S:  I need insurance.   I tried to get it through Obama care but I couldn't get it.  I have to fill out paperwork. ..  can we say Kafka?..G:  Usually go to Papas on Xmas eve.  Not sure I'm going to go.   In other nonsense. ..  Sunday we had a windchill factor of negative 25f . And it was windy!  Today it feels 54 degrees warmer.  It's still below freezing...
Triumph: I have remained sober despite having a tough month. I also hit my first weight loss goal a few weeks ahead of schedule. ..Struggle: Feeling lonely feeling between two worlds. I haven't made any sober friends yet and I don't enjoy parties and bars anymore. I no longer have a car so I've been staying in my apartment alone most weekends this month. ..General: I love Christmas Eve!! I love the excitement and the anticipation. Everyone comes over to my parent's house and I will be cooking dinner for my entire family.   
Argued with my gf last night outside of a bar (my stop is outside of a dive bar) and resisted the temptation to go an have a drink.
T: the shame I'm feeling for the actions I committed during my last black out are subsiding...S: on day 5. Hit the point of questioning if I'm "over reacting" about completely abstaining from alcohol. Simply due to the fact that my problem lies in blacking out occasionally at the bars or at a party...G: ready to see my family for Christmas!
**Triumph:** Sober me seems to like going out and about and interacting with people. Had some great laughs and simple moments that brought me joy. Been playing the guitar a bit again. The mighty Flying-V still rocks...**Struggle:** With my kid in rehab and the coming clean of the shit he was taking just blows my mind. Drugstore Cowboy used to be a favorite movie of mine. So my brain wants to punish me like I didn't f'ing suffer enough or I didn't really have a problem. Lies. ..**General:** Spending Xmas eve at the rehab for visitation and education. Some KFC after would be the bomb. I have a killer copycat recipe if I need to do the work myself...U/sfgirlmary - awesome things you are sharing. Thank you.
Omg about to hit a week!!!!! Longest time in YEARS. ..Love you all. No alcohol for me!
