Tonight is turning out to be one of my most difficult nights so I came here for advice.... My first 2 weeks sober were a struggle. Not so much being tempted to drink but feeling scared and low when I had to face and actually feel what I had been so adept at avoiding. ..But since around my 3rd week I have had progressively more frequent cravings -- not really for alcohol but a desperate urge to be wasted. I am craving self-destruction. I want to be ugly and depraved and trash myself. I miss (and still do) being able to inflict hurt on myself in a very raw way. The big 'fuck you'.  And now it's getting worse in the last week. For the first time I am so tempted to drink that it makes me nervous. I have started leaving my ID in the car when I go to restaurants and stores so I can't buy alcohol. I look at cash in my wallet and for the first time since I quit I can barely talk myself out of buying a fifth of anything. I'm realizing that the first 30 days were the easy part...I am in therapy and do go to AA meetings occasionally (okay lately not so much). Who else noticed a strong increase in cravings after 30 days? How do you cope? .
