Back in my drinking days I thought it was entertaining but it didn't seem that deep and some plot points didn't make a whole lot of sense. But now... Denzel Washington's self-loathing manipulation and lying were much more front and center. And the lure of drinking when he would be tempted and then relapse was so painfully relatable.  His decision to confess made a lot more sense too....And I don't remember crying at the ending before when you see the warmth and pride of his loved ones at his sobriety. It's a good movie but a little more emotional to watch now.

Thanks for the review.  I haven't ever seen this.  I just put it on my list.  I'm looking forward to it.  :)
Definitely hits very close to home.  Have you noticed Denzel almost always plays characters with a drinking issue?
That movie is the reason i have the minibar worries when I travel for work. Seriously. 
I think it got a lot of things right including the moment he decides he can't lie any more ("God help me"). That resonated with me.
