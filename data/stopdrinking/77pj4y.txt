Hey all..Round 3 of sobriety is doing well (44 days! Woo!). ..Anyway they talk about how relapses start way before you take the first drink. I was thinking about that recently. It occurred to me that both relapses started in the same place: my computer chair...Both happened when I was off work and bored. Sure the reasons were a little different but both times the day I caved started with wrestling with the choice while sitting in my office chair staring at my computer monitor...So [I put this reminder where I can't miss it.](https://imgur.com/UQTWmPI)..I can't NOT see it while sitting here...Probably won't leave it up forever but right now when that little voice starts with the "Wouldn't it be nice to watch some netflix with a tasty whiskey?" all I have to do is glance up to get that counter argument I need...

Very wise tracking down the source and the circumstances.  Sometimes I write little reminders on the side of my hand then same thing I'm sure to see it!..
i have a whiteboard in my bedroom that i look at every morning and night it really helps. i've had it for four years. this year i picked up journaling as well it helps me remember the things i need to work on every day.
Excellent idea! I love the way you chose to put it: IT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE. So true and when you think about it that way it's not even really a sacrifice to not drink. Drinking doesn't even fucking work!
