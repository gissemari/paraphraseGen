.Struggling with this today. Quite drowsy from a small amount of sleeping tablet I took last night after not sleeping the whole night the evening before. Still struggling with sleep I think it's unrelated from the drink now I was just drinking to numb out other struggles that still exist but I'm now working on with a much better approach minus the booze. In fact drink never did to me what it can do for others - help them sleep -I had awful insomnia from booze. Anyway I work from home at the moment and due to my sleep issues and this brain fog have been very unproductive the last couple of days and it's starting to annoy me. Posting this maybe has got me rolling. Just had to let it out. Thanks for being a great group to post to.

i feel horrible when i don't sleep. can you take a nap?
I would not take a nap.  I would try and wear myself out.  Have a bed time routine.  I won't drink with you today.  I used melatonin gaba and valarian root one hour before bed and that helps me a lot.
Thanks for this - yes I take valerian - the others you can't get in the uk - annoyingly. I won't drink with you today - thanks for the support
