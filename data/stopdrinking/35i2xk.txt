First post to reddit. .Hi all I (23/f) live with my SO (25/m) and he has recently slipped up a few times with alcohol in the past week or so. He has opened up to me within hours after having the drink - which I admire and appreciate from him. .I am recovered from a multiple year long battle with an eating disorder so I understand the struggle with mental illness addiction and self destructive behaviors - so I feel like I can be emotionally supportive to him..But I wanted to ask for advice on more logistical support ideas..1. Should I stop keeping wine in our apartment?.2. Should I avoid drinking around him when we go out with friends or have a nice dinner?.3. I work at a tap house should I not talk about the beers at the restaurant?.4. Should I keep sodas stocked in the refrigerator? .I am familiar with the concept of certain things being triggering so I am wondering if these sorts of things might be triggering for him...Thank you all and best wishes.

Yes.Yes.Yes.Yes.All that being said  alcohol is but a symptom of what ails us
Yes to all but I would also urge him to join a recovery fellowship. AA has saved my life and given me a life beyond what I ever thought I deserved.
Yes x 4 they all sound like sensible and supportive ideas. I'd recommend keeping the home a safe sanctuary. ..My SO hasn't got on board with all those things but he is active in sharing sober activities with me which I value...You might wish to pop your head in r/AlAnon or try Al-Anon or similar for yourself.
I would stop referring to his multiple drinking incidents in just 1 week as "slips."  He didn't make a one time mistake. He is in a full blown relapse.  It is probably going to get a lot worse.   I would get a whole hell of a lot more nosy.
