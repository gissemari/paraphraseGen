Hey everyone I've been tedious to post here but I think it might be time. I really don't even care to post this with a throwaway it's who I am and I'll always accept it. However I will ask anyone who sees this to keep it here :)..I strongly appreciate anyone who is willing to read my story/provide input...Tonight I pretty much drank an entire bottle of whiskey and I feel relatively fine. This has caused me to be scared for my future. I'm having doubts I can simply stop when I originally thought I would be able to. I've previously accepted my enjoyment of alcohol as a childish coping mechanism until I attained a successful job and as of two weeks ago I've successfully attained one I'm really happy with. Alcohol has never directly affected my life but I'm starting to realize it has become a planned necessity over a natural occurrence. I've never felt as if it has hindered my performance; I instead somewhat believe it allowed me to talk to my ego repeatedly and gain a sense of confidence that eventually allowed myself to realize my place in life (I mostly drank alone played guitar and enjoyed arts earlier on in my drinking career I despise bars). I also feel as if it aided me in taking risks to pursue a major passion of mine. Now my passion is my full time job and I'm really quite happy. ..I'm a 24 year old Male 6'2 205lbs. I would say that I've been drinking almost everyday for 2.5 years. In the beginning it was a low amount maybe a beer or three every night. Now I drink every other night at minimum but in a heavy amount if I don't drink for a day (today) whilst also drinking both Friday and Saturday every week. I can easily crush a 12 pack/even drink a bottle of tequila if I eat a lot during the day...I guess I'm the definition of a functional alcoholic but I want to stop. My girlfriend is the same age as me and I love her to death. Due to the fact I'm so functional outside of hating myself for this she can't really see the extremity of it/the weight I feel on my shoulders. I just want to be able to stop without her or my family seeing the potential struggle I'd feel. I'm also slightly concerned for my health  I've gotten blood tests and everything is okay - but then again I received blood tests from when I was in the shape of my life and they came back horribly wrong. ..Anyways any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for sharing...  most people admit to having a drinking problem when they hit rock bottom!  I am one of those.  I suggest seeing your healthcare doctor and let them know you are giving up alcohol .  They can give you meds for the withdrawals anxiety and sleep aids  you might also consider AA/SMART alcohol counseling and come back here everyday for additional support.  this group is wonderful and there is usually someone around.  I will not drink with you today/tonight (iwndwyt)  you have the strength and courage to change and resist that first drink!
