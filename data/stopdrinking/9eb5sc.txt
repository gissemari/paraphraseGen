I woke up made smoothies with my daughter and took her for a long swim. She said it was 'the bestest day ever!' (I'm usually a narky hungover zombie on a weekend) Then we went to do a bit of shopping.. There was my favourite bottle of prosecco on the shelf I thought about it and walked away. For the rest of the day I thought about that bottle of prosecco the sun was out and my daughter was staying out that night too - perfect drinking conditions! But then I thought about everyone who I'd told I was off the alcohol and how smug they would be to know I was drinking yet again..I fell asleep on the settee instead. I'm proud I've not had a drink this weekend and I've woken up fresh and ready to do stuff!.Weekends are a roller-coaster of emotions! .IWNDWYT
