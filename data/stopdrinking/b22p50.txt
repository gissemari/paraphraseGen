What to say? I feel good.  I've lost weight and feel much MUCH better. My health still needs a lot of work and I've just found out I need a hip operation. ..A few years ago I tore all the ligaments in my knee (surfing not drinking) and after the op I just 'recovered' on scotch and tramadol. So I'm not doing that again. ..I have this slight nervous fear though. When I've relapsed before its because I get that premature 'I've got this' feeling and decide I can have a few glasses of the Johnny Walker .  I need not to forget how shit it was chasing the drunk buzz and the hangovers and dragging my ass through the day and just not being who I want to be and wondering when my daughter will be old enough to realize my dad's a drunk..The truth is I will never be able to drink normally. I can't ever forget that and IWNDWYT sober friends!

I will never be able to think about alcohol normally at least not for any significant length of time. Left unattended my brain will convince me that it's OK/hopeless so I can/must drink again.
