Hey sober date twinsie!   .Hope you have a great trip! And I won't drink with you 
Congrats on anger management.  I'm trying to forgive and let go and be patient and enjoy the moment.  Have a good trip!  I won't be drinking with you on the other side of the world. I'ts 7:30 p.m Sunday night where I am.
