I've thrown my hands up in surrender after 2 weeks of multiple hospital visits losing my significant other losing my school standing losing all my dignity.  I've been in the cycle of a little bit of sobriety/relapsing for years. I'm choosing to go into a long term recovery community where the stay lasts from 6 months to a year or more.  Anyone have experience with this? What was it like?

What a blessing you are able to do this! 
In my 20's I did a short-term treatment followed by long-term live in for six months and then a sober house. It saved my life and got me on solid footing again. You have a great opportunity in front of you.
I know someone who did a whole year and she said it was the best thing she ever did.  ..Go for it!
Amazing. What a gift! I have a friend who was addicted to meth went to treatment with me for 35 days then to long-term treatment. He is still sober and it's a miracle...:)
So I'm packing for rehab and I went from okay with it to gut ripping out panic/pain/regret. I can't believe I have to wait until tuesday to actually fucking leave..
