I've asked for a badge reset not sure when it will go through. I had three legitimate weeks of not drinking and felt amazing. Then I had a get together with my best friends from college and drank. I couldn't imagine trying to explain to them that I needed to stop forever. The weekend was a blast but it immediately put me back in the cycle. I've drank a six pack or more every night for the last two weeks...I think what scares me the most is that I'm very unlikely to hit any dramatic rock bottom. I have an Ivy League degree I'm considered decent at my well-paid job I'm not likely to end up homeless or anything like that. But I do feel like I'm on a path where I'll wake up one day and be 30 and barely remember the past decade and most importantly not have achieved even a tenth of what I could have...I started abusing alcohol in college. I played a division I sport so I couldn't drink every night back then but I binged like crazy on weekends when we had a day off. I dated the most amazing girl in the world for 2 years and blew up our relationship through things I said when blacked out drunk. We had one breakup then another chance then another breakup then she started dating someone else. And that's really when I began to lose it...That's one of the worst things. She did finally tell me some of the things I had said and they are unbelievable. Especially once she started dating the new guy. The things I said can really only be described as evil. And I don't remember saying them or texting them. And I lost my best friend in the world because of it. She got engaged a month ago and she still looks breathtaking and roughly the entire population of facebook liked the engagement post and I feel like the dumbest piece of shit on earth...I don't have any serious life goals. I tell myself I drink out of boredom more than anything else and it's probably partly true...I feel like I would achieve more if I stopped drinking but so what?..

&gt; I'm not likely to end up homeless or anything like that..I wonder how many homeless people saw it coming.....When I was truly ready to quit drinking that was it.  There wasn't going to be a situation when "I couldn't imagine trying to explain to them that I needed to stop forever".  You don't have to go into your whole life story.  Usually "no thanks" goes a long way.  But "I don't drink anymore because I used to drink way too much" works too...But if I found myself in a situation where I felt that I didn't want to explain myself I'd avoid that situation...Early sobriety feels like a long time.  But it's not.  Somewhere between 8 months and a year I became really proud of what I was doing in my life.  I lost a good bit of weight.  I hadn't embarrassed myself by doing something stupid.  And it became very easy for me to talk about the fact that I don't drink anymore.  And with the confidence to talk about it I got approval and support from *everyone* I talked to about it.  It didn't come right away though...Early on I tried to make sobriety as easy as possible because it is so hard.  I avoided situations like you described.  Or if I felt like I couldn't avoid the situation I'd make sure that I had someone with me that was "on my side".  Either my wife or a really good friend would be with me.  They'd have my back and help me not drink...Good luck.
I hope that when you are sober a year from now you will look at this post and be astonished at how much you have achieved. I just looked back at 6 months ago when I felt "very secure" in my recovery.....yeah that was a big eye opener followed by a big back pat...You aren't the only Ivy Leaguer here.
