I still have lots to work on in my life. I smoke I'm overweight and I still struggle with bouts of depression. But these mountains have reverted to molehills now that alcohol is out of my life. Everything used to be such a struggle because everything revolved around alcohol...Now I can focus on what matters. I've started losing weight I've restarted going to the gym and I'm a happier person. I used to think I had a temper; but it was the alcohol that had the temper. It was the alcohol that didn't care about what I ate. It was the alcohol that controlled everything in my life. No longer...I'm still struggling with smoking (especially hard when everyone at AA seems to smoke) but I know that if I was able to quit drinking I can quit smoking too...Thanks for all your support SD. I don't know if I would've ever made it this far without you. Here's to two months of not drinking with you and IWNDWYT!

That's great swifteh.  Keep at it. I'm sure you'll only feel better as time goes on and the gym becomes your new habit.
Stay on this path my friend your story is very inspiring. Put this wonderful feeling you're having right now in a jar and smell it during difficult moments ahead to stay on track. There is no doubt in my mind you'll quit smoking too!
