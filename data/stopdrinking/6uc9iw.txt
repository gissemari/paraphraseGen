I never thought I would post here but after lurking for a couple months I've realized it is time. This won't be easy but it will be okay. This is going to be long because typing is therapeutic for me will put a tl;dr at the bottom lol...I'm only 26 and the first time I stopped drinking I was 21 years old. I had actually *just* turned 21 in college and chosen to be sober for 6 months. At that point I had a long distance girlfriend and the night before my 21st birthday I was sitting in a car with another girl from school drunk as all get out and almost cheated on the most fantastic girl I'd ever met. I knew the next morning I had to take a break or I'd be throwing that relationship down the garbage (it ended 2 years later when I drunkenly threw something at a wall...)..My friends were **not** supportive of me trying to stop in college. They thought I was judging their drinking when at parties I wouldn't say anything. Sort of like when I was vegetarian if I didn't tell people they wouldn't get all "meat defensive" and critical of me and everything would be waaaay easier. It's like labeling yourself a "not drinker" gives drinkers weird anxiety. So I'd walk around literally holding a solo cup full of coca cola...6 months later my roommate wanted to brew beer. I got back into beer. And then beer got into me. And I just haven't taken account of it because everyone else around me drinks soooo much. Like my roommate's boyfriend drove over with a beer open in his car drinking it openly and although she was like "youre stupid" they still stayed together. ..The doctor asked me a couple months ago how many drinks I have a week and I think I said maybe 1-2 a night mostly weekends. He asked if I ever drink in the morning - no I can always wait until after noon (same with a cigarette - these two things go hand in hand though for me.)..He didn't seem to think it was a problem...I haven't told my therapist even but it is more like 4-5 beers a night not just bud lights or platinums but also fancy local craft beers. I don't get black out drunk ever but I tell people I have a crappy memory - do I just have a crappy memory or has drinking since I was 18 done this to me?..I drove with a beer more times than I could count this past year. Couldn't make it home from mom's without two road beers. Tipsy radio = the best. I would live for leaving a place just to be alone and drink. I hit a car once and just left. I have been a bad person...My dad got a DUI two years ago. My brother was abusive to me growing up because of his addictions he punched me beat me to a pulp and emotionally abused me and I thought he had been sober this past two years but just googled and found out he had a DUI in Sept 2016. I didnt hear about that one but then my dad told me (while we were grilling and having beer of course) about it and basically my brother almost died again. He didn't even have his glasses on when he went to drive home. Wow. And my dad's dad was an alcoholic and my mom's dad was and my mom's younger brother is. My mom's the only one who isn't and my uncle that is in prison also isn't an alcoholic (but he sold cocaine so...)..It's too much for me to keep ignoring...When I told my friend about a job change that I may make and that it would require me to stop drinking and stop smoking tobacco AND stop smoking weed - he looked at me and said **without drinking and smoking who the heck will you even BE** and he drinks and smokes a lot (drinks a lot of my beer n vice versa and smokes my weed so it is beneficial to him for me to be engaging in these habits I keep that in mind.)..So I won't be stopping weed yet but I am stopping drinking. My girlfriend just got a job at a brewery serving amazing local beer but is also stopping drinking too she says (for her own reasons she def drinks waaaaay less than me.) She already told me that they have a seltzer machine in the back with all sorts of flavors (i love seltzer) for me to try when I want to visit her and not be drinking. :) So she's supportive and even if she doesn't know the extent to which I think I've been struggling with this it's nice to have someone to check in...But I want to check in here. I think I will likely relapse especially since there are two birthday parties this weekend at bars but GF will also be with me too. ..Maybe I should go buy a 24 pack of grapefruit seltzer on my walk home from work now. You know that is what I'll do today. I won't drink with you today that I can promise as I finished all my beers last night and realized that was 8 beers on a Wednesday and I dont have my ID on me to even buy beer right now. So I'll go home and watch my favorite TV show with my two friends who don't drink :)..**Tl;DR: my brother and dad are alcoholics and I have realized that I am too even if no one knows how much I used to drink and how little control I had over it I am doing this for me.
----------immediate responses--------

My parents have destroyed their health with alcohol. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic and I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. There isn't even much agreement among medical/psychological professionals or even among the dozens of people I have met in AA and other meetings about what alcoholism is. Is it a disease? Is it an allergy to alcohol? I don't know and I don't care. All I need to know is that I am a MUCH happier much more compassionate person without alcohol in my life. I have lost friends since I quit drinking. (But probably not as many as I lost because of drinking.) I t's not an easy change to make but it is so worth it from my angle. Good luck to you. Not drinking with you today!
When I was desperate enough I got help. I didn't go to bar have alcohol in my home or hang with anyone who abused alcohol. I saw a therapist and went to AA. I was totally honest with my doctor because I needed medication to detox safely. You may also I don't know. .
Good on you! I won't drink today either!
