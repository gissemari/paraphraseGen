Hello everyone..I have been a lurker on this sub for about a month or so. I had previously seen people's posts and thought "I don't drink a lot or very much". I was actually thinking about unsubbing a few days ago because I never believed I have a problem with alcohol until last night. I drank way too much and ended up vomiting all over my room. My parents heard me fall down and cleaned me and my room up at 3 in the morning having to put me in the shower and put clothes on me. The humiliation was enough to make me want to be alone forever. This is not the first time this has happened to me before either. I have had a devastating past due to drinking and always thought it was just a one time thing but the reality is that this problem is not a one time thing. It will go on until I end up in prison or dead. I see alcohol as a way for me to get my shy personality out but always ends up making a fool out of myself. I don't know how all of the veterans to this subreddit make it all those days without a drop of alcohol. I am struggling to even make it a few days without drinking let alone years. If you read all of this thank you just trying to make a better future for myself and not destroy it with alcohol.

You've taken the first step.  There are some great resources on the sidebar check them out. 
I had to change my attitude from  trying to stop drinking  to  going to stop drinking  to be relatively successful. ..Everyone has bad days but eliminating drinking as the solution to my problems was my step one.
