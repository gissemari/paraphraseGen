I have been feeling amazing lately. I have been making many healthy life choices lately. I even stopped smoking cigarettes a couple weeks ago. ..A few days ago I had a really tough conversation with myselfabout my relationship and realized I wasn't so sure it was what I felt was bestfor me anymore. I brought it up with my SO and he said he agreed. We just aren't right for each other and its ok. So that's a bummer but we are handling it well. ..Further along with that process I now need to look for a place to live. Another hard discussion with myself. I have a dog that I adopted when I was much younger because I wanted a dog. I am not and have not been responsible enough to own a dog. I love him so very much but I need to realize that he needs so much more time and attention than I can give him. I can have many more options for living if I am on my own...These are things that are sad. These are also things I know I need to do to keep myself in a healthy forward motion. ..Oh! Here's the kicker. A co-worker I am close with responded to me telling her this with "but are you drinking now because of this?" she was concerned I would relapse from being stressed. I honestly hadn't even thought about it once. Alcohol is such a non-option for me now. I never thought I would get to this point in my life. Like wow.

Sounds like some important insights there. I know I had to put myself and my sobriety first which involved some tough decisions. I'm glad to hear you're coping through difficulties I found that tough at first but I new that drinking never soved anything for me so it was important for me to face my problems and try working through them as best I could sober...Congrats on 80 sober days!
