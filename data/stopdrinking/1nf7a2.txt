I made the decision to stop drinking a little over two months ago. About a month or so in I started relapsing. At first I was worried and felt guilty but pretty soon I managed to convince myself it wasn't a huge deal. After all it was no where near my old habit I was still sober and feeling amazing most of the time. Well now I've gone from "relapsing" once a week to twice a week and it's starting to feel more and more like a habit again...Anyway I'm recommitting to sobriety. No more excuses.

Two months is a damn good stretch. I envy you for it. The next one will be even further. I say take a screenshot of that badge to mark your progress then reset it and start again. It takes guts to admit you faltered. We're here to steady you if you need. Be well friend. And good on you for recommitting.
Sneaky stuff alcohol. It managed to convince me I was in control for 3 decades. Good on you for see it sneaking up on you.  ..So what's your plan this time? What worked last time and what approach needs to change this time?
I made it a solid 35 days before my last relapse. It wasn't even a gradual attempt at moderation there was no sneaking up I just went out and killed a fifth of brown liquor one night...Regardless the morning after was enough to recommit to sobriety and now i'm back on day three with a hearty reminder as to why i'm gonna stick to my goal and to be thankful I didn't backslide into daily boozing...Be proud of your two months!  If your like me the desire to reclaim your previous record is considerable incentive on its own.
Glad you are coming back before it gets bad again relapses can be such a slippery slope......What are you going to do differently this time?  And yeah it's been asked before but its worth repeating.
Welcome back. What changes are you making this time?
