Also posted this on r/addiction but I love this subreddit and have found a lot of help here:....Hey everyone I'm looking for advice on trying DBT work. I've been in NA/AA for about a year and have learned so much. I've had a lot of sober time a lot of reflection gotten far. However the days trip me up every time. ...I put so much stock in counting days that I don't appreciate the collective time I've had sober-- only consecutive. I have the "once you relapse you go right back to where you were before" mentality drilled into me. When I relapse I feel like I HAVE to really go down before coming back to sobriety. ...Anyways I love the programs get a lot from meetings enjoy spending time with other addicts in recovery. But I need more tools. ...Do I have to go through DBT work with a therapist? Would a sponsor work? Can I do it on my own while still attending a few meetings?...Would love some advice from somebody who has done both.

I had to look up what DBT was.  .Sounds interesting.  I'd try it.  I've been reading a lot of sobriety-brain books and I like what they say..I'd give it a shot.  
You could start off with a DBT skills workbook. I haven't used any but there are a ton on Amazon. 
Thanks for introducing me to DBT. I'd never heard of it. 
I hadn't heard of it so I looked it up. Sounds pretty similar to what SMART does. Is there any of that near you?
You're been to AA/NA for a year so surely you have a sponsor and have asked him/her this question?
