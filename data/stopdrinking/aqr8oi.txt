I've been weaning off of alcohol to avoid withdrawl.  I did it once before and even managed to moderate for a few months.  Then I took a trip to cancun back in october.  Almost got weaned down a few weeks ago then had one too many and lost control... for a few days.  Tonight I was feeling a bit of withdrawl so I took a double shot to push it out.  Been struggling for the last hour not to take another.  I know I'll need at 4 before sleep tonight and I told myself no more than 6 today.  5 tomorrow and saturday. 4 sunday and monday. 3 tuesday and wednesday 1 thursday and friday.  Similar plan to how I did it last year.... just don't remember the cravings being this strong.  I think I did it slower last time but I'm taking a family vacation and my wife doesn't know how bad I've gotten again.  Anyone got any tips on craving control?
