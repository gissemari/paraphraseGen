I apologize for the humble brag but I'm really excited for today. Two years ago today my whole life changed. Well it actually fell apart and I'm happy it did. Sobriety has been the most challenging yet rewarding thing I've ever experienced. This year alone has been a struggle but I've also grown a lot as a person in recovery. ..SD you all got me started and sent me on my way to start recovering. I am forever grateful to everyone here! Thank you guys IWNBDWYT!

Therapy yoga and meditation have been a great help. AA has also been beneficial for me. It's still one day at a time that keeps me going. Eventually all the day start racking up!
