At first I fought the cravings. Taking it one day at a time. It was working. Then I slipped. I was overwhelmed with something at work and I decided I was going to drink. Nothing could stop me at that point...Now I am trying to make today Day1 again. I'm not going to stop. I will keep getting back up if it takes me 100 relapses. It's better than saying f it and drinking every day.

&gt;I'm not going to stop. I will keep getting back up if it takes me 100 relapses. ..It takes what it takes to get there and it's not the same journey for any 2 people.  I for one am thrilled you made it back to try again...Hang in there friend.  
I slipped a week ago and I came back at it again. I have been putting a lot into reflecting on why it happened and what I need to be doing differently to not follow the same path next time I feel I need to drink it has helped and got me through an urge yesterday. We can do this!!!
Good attitude. One day at a time!!  :)
I know it's trite but I do love the AA blessing -- "Keep coming back; it works if you work it!"  
I slipped too. But feel stronger in this 2nd attempt. Keep coming back. .."The certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time." (Thomas Edison - he was a bit of a dick but he knew something about perseverance)
embarassment is easier to get over than a hangover. gad you came back
There's nothing to be embarrassed about if it was so easy there would be no subs no AA no smart at least your back here keep on trying.
