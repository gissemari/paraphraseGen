What is it about the holidays that makes everyone keep giving me booze? Ugh. I'm re-gifting all of it but for now it's sitting in the kitchen taunting me...I know there's no such thing as 'just one drink' for me so I'm coping by eating an ungodly amount of chocolate pringles and anything else I can find. I've been trying to shift some weight over the last month but I'd much prefer to put it back on than to break my sober streak. Really hope the urge to drink goes back down to a manageable level soon. Not the greatest feeling...If anyone else is struggling tonight hold on with me. We can do it.

Can you get it out of the house?  Got a trunk of a car?
