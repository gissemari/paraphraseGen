(I sat down yesterday and wrote a couple of pages about my drinking history.  I hope to continue to do this.  I am going to post sections as I complete them.  Wall of text warning)..The purpose of writing this is to tell my story - the story of one guy's dance with one of the most addictive dangerous and destructive drugs on planet earth...alcohol. ..The tricky thing about alcohol is that even though it is addictive dangerous and destructive; its consumption is condoned expected and even celebrated around the world. It is a catch-22 that many like.myself have found themselves in - you know quitting is the best thing for you but the messages you get as a newly minted non-drinker are so negative that it becomes hard to stay the course...The result is that you talk yourself into moderation and ba-da-boom ba-da-bing you are back to the dangerous and destructive aspect of the drug. It is easy to see why many who struggle with this addiction find it so hard to break the chains and why the World Health Organization provides the following key facts as of January 2015:.. Worldwide 3.3 million deaths every year result from harmful use of alcohol this.represents 5.9% of all deaths... The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 disease and injury.conditions... Alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. In the age group 20 - 39 years approximately 25% of the total deaths are alcohol-attributable...You can see why I mention that this drug is addictive dangerous and destructive. What is more of a mystery is the culture surrounding the consumption and more importantly the over-consumption of this drug...My family's cultures and traditions certainly revolved around the consumption of alcohol. I can remember my maternal grandfather running a home-made kegerator with 8 gallon  pony  kegs when I was kid. It was a great thrill for me to run from the kitchen to the den to pour the.perfect beer for one of my adult relatives. I also remember the time when one of my uncles after drinking too much from the kegerator wanted to fight my dad. His wife talked him into leaving but he was still in a rage. He had walked out the door with his glass beer mug and before he got into their family car he threw the beer mug against the front of my grandparents house with the mug breaking everywhere. This was my mom's brother and they had kids that.were about our age. We used to do some things with them and that relationship was ended with that episode. ..My uncle quit drinking for a time after that and relapsed and went through alternating periods of drinking and non-drinking. He ended up dying of heart attack at a pretty.young age (during a period of heavy drinking and the associated health problems. His weight had ballooned from drinking a ton beer and his heart just exploded. He was a great guy when.he had his wits about him and a total asshole when he was deep into a binge (a charge that I have unfortunately been guilty of during my drinking career).
