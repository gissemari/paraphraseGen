Today is my 3 year cakeday on Reddit!! For the past 2.5 years ive primarily used Reddit to post Simpson's screenshots and drunkenly giggle at pictures of kittens on r/aww but in the past 6 months this subreddit has really become my homepage. I started reading posts and comments on here months before I mustered up the courage to actually quit drinking myself and now that I have I am truely indebted to you all. Every post on this sub (no matter how short or incredibly long) has helped me to stay sober and helped me to become a better person because they remind me that im not alone in the struggles I'm going through. Thank you to all the friends ive made on here and thank you to everyone who is contributing and being supportive....I know I'm supposed to post a pic to reddit on my cakeday so here's me while I was jogging this morning (I totally jog now that I'm not a lazy drunken idiot and it rules!).. http://i.imgur.com/mxJl4if.jpg

Nice! 
How can you run with that beard? Surely every person you pass must stop to congratulate you on that fine example of facial hair.
[Congrats on 115 days my friend and thank you for posting](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/youre_awesome_jensen_ackles.gif)
Psyched for you man. You're doing great. Almost at 4 months. That's a third of a year. Is that some crazy shit or what?
Congratulations on 115 days sober &amp; on you jogging! That's great!
Nice! I love the beard!
Great work
