Hello. ..Been with this sub a few weeks and want to thank everyone for sharing all your posts and comments have helped me a lot. I am unsure if this post will help anyone but I have always wanted to share my last drinking experience and what it finally made me realize...Want to make this as short as possible but quick back story. I am almost 26. I officially started trying to quit drinking  February of 2015 and have been fairly successful spite 6-7 relapses. ..Anyways here is my final drinking experience. It was the weekend after I had a great trip with friends where I stayed sober. It was day 63 of sobriety where I still had this gnawing desire to try drinking. With the thought of "there still has to be a good feeling with it drinking cannot be gone forever". Anyways I bought a bottle and brought it home. I stared at it for roughly 30 minutes before pouring myself out a line of 5 shots. Now the amount of alcohol is not important but my logic behind the line of shots was this. "63 days is currently the longest I have gone without drinking. There is no way I can drink 5 shots in seconds and not feel something from it". So anyways I took the shots started a shower and expected to feel that wonderful euphoria that I have not felt in years. Fast forward 20 minutes to where I am out of the shower and back at my desk. I feel almost nothing no numb face no relaxation just a rush of energy random thoughts and a small loss of coordination. (Also my stomach was killing me from those shots.) I think to myself "well shit guess I increased my tolerance way too much". Anyways I just kind of sat there disappointed. This substance I have loved for the last few years who has brought me so much "happiness" no longer makes me feel anything. Of course I did not stop there and continued to drink until I passed out. The next day I laid around too sick to do anything yet too restless to sleep. That continued over to the next day where I had to take off work because I could hardly move. ..Anyways what I realized in that instance is I literally had 0% fun with that drinking experience. I then thought about the last few times I drank and how each time over the last couple of years it had become less & less "fun". I am a person who likes to understand things so I spent a lot of time talking to my therapist reading about addiction and then doing my own trial and error. At the end of the day it finally hit me that drinking is just something I can no longer do and there literally is not point for me to do it anymore. Ever since then this time around has been the easiest of my other tries in quitting drinking...Hopefully this share is not breaking any rules and I am not telling anyone here to "try drinking  again". Just wanted to share my experience and how I derived at my conclusion of "drinking fucking sucks". ..I will not drink today.

I get where youre coming from. I look back on my drinking and just none of it was fun. Especially those times I wasnt even enjoying taste just chasing a buzz. It's all awful.  .Congrats on the sober streak.
