Too tired from fighting the useless relapse guilt/shame cycle to to exercise. What shows are there that aren't scary or cringe inducing and alleviate anxiety a little? Would watch kid shows but they make me ponder where it all went wrong haha. I think I'll need years of sobriety before I can watch the classroom scene from Annie Hall again.

Im 12 days sober at this point. Broke up with my ex 2 months ago. I was in the darkest place of my life. Sobered up started feeling better about myself and my situation. But I couldnt have made it through without The Office. Its great for distraction. And it gets funnier as the seasons go. My favorite episode is the one about Depression. Its great. The american version not the british one :)
i binged friday night lights when i first got sober.
I love watching cartoons when I need to relax. My favorites are Adventure Time and Bob's Burgers. ..Bob's is such a great show. It's funny and wholesome and just the right about of weird. And Linda is the perfect troll mom. All the seasons are on Hulu right now. 
Peep show.Black books.East Bound and Down.The mighty boosh.Rick and Morty.Toast of London.The League of Gentlemen.
