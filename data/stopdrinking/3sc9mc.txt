Part of me can't believe I made it this far after my relapse back in July.  But I did and I'm proud.  Now I'd like to do something fun to mark the occasion.  ..The first thing that comes to mind when I consider it is to order a six-pack.  Why?  That is the dumbest idea I could've possibly had today...But I still want to do something to celebrate/reward myself.  Not sure what to do though.  I don't smoke pot anymore but the craving's there.  ..Should I order out?  A club sandwich would be nice.  ..At the moment I'm getting started on a game of Splatoon while I consider my options before making a decision...I guess I'm kinda thinking out loud but I'd also like to see what you guys do in situations like this.

Congratulations on two months! That's huge! You should definiteily [treat yo self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsABTmT1_M0)!..For me I would probably pig out a bit. Get a big ass burrito drink a big ass cream soda and watch The Big Lebowski.
Do you have any sober friends you can celebrate with?
You are doing great. ..When I have a day like you're having I always try to remind myself that I am still in Tuesday and my only job is to go to bed sober tonight.
I would have a hot fudge sunday! When's the last time you've had one of those??..Congratulations!
Happy happy happy 60 days! Keep up the good work.
