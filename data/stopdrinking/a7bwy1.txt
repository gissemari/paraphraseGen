I feel like I can moderate my drinking. I can have 1-2 drinks maybe two times a week and that's it. I have struggled in the past with it when I was younger but I can control it now. My wife (who drinks occasionally) wants me to stop and is awful to me when she discovers I have drank. I'm not hiding it but sometimes I like to have a drink while cooking dinner. If she realizes I've had a drink she gets pissed. She seems to arbitrarily decide when it's ok for me to drink and when it's not and doesn't let me in on the rules of the game. I don't want to stop but I'm willing to stop simply for my wife because I hate dealing with her attitude when I drink   it's just not worth it. We are going to counseling next week for the first time to talk about this and other issues. But I feel like if I'm not stopping for me then I'm not being honest and will fail. Am I in denial here? Does any of this make sense? If I can moderate then what's the problem? Or is that addiction talking? ..Any guidance is appreciated!

While it's not okay for her to regulate your drinking for you if she has such a strong reaction to you having a class of wine you may be in denial.  ..I find it highly unusual she is asking you to stop if you one have 3-4 drink per week max. Why does it bother her? ..People often under report their drinking. Is this a large glass of hard alcohol or a small glass of wine? Most wine glasses filled are well beyond one drink. ..You came this sub you know there SOMETHING going on with your drinking and it's adversely affecting your life. I think consoling with your spouse is a terrific idea.  ..No one here knows you and can answer this question for you but it's a good step to be open to change and asking questions. 
We all make choices...She makes hers; you make yours...I know for me if I do something and resent it I'm headed for trouble.
