On Saturday night I drank so much that I threw up multiple times blacked out completely and came within an inch of falling downstairs and breaking my neck. On Sunday at around 5pm when I finally managed to drag mysef out of bed my mum sat me down at our kitchen table and explained to me in detail how worried she was about my drinking and I have admitted to myself that she's right to be concerned. My drinking is not normal...For over a year I have been drinking alone in secret multiple nights a week. Even when I'm drinking socially my focus is on consuming more alcohol rather than on the people I'm with. I genuinely don't understand the concept of "realising I'm too drunk" and stopping. ..I've come to accept that just because I don't drink daily or in the morning or on park benches does not mean I don't have a problem because I do. Even if my problem is more the quantity of alcohol I consume in one sitting and an inability to stop once I've started than how often I drink (although 5-6 nights a week is still too much). It was easy to justify my intake at university because it feels like "part of the culture" there. Now I'm at home and working full time and I haven't managed to limit my drinking to an appropriate level. ..So at the very least I've decided not to drink for all of January while I reflect on my past relationship with alcohol and decide whether I want to try to be more mindful and cautious in the way that I consume alcohol or treat Dry January as the first step towards permanent sobriety. But I'm not thinking of it as "Dry January" because that whole thing kind of feels to me like a nudge-and-wink joke about how terrible it is to not drink like it's something you're meant to struggle through so you can make it to February and finally get pissed again. ..But I'm going off topic. I'm not sure if alcohol will ever pass my lips again. It's something I need to spend a lot of time thinking about and if the end of January comes and I'm still not sure then February will become Dry February and so on and so forth until I've made the decision about whether I can risk keeping alcohol in my life.

This is how my drinking began too. I wasn't ever on a park bench but too much when I drank turned into nightly too much. You're smart to check yourself now. Good luck and come back to this sub it's the best!
Good for you   it sounds like you're remarkably self-aware and have identified that you have a problem. I think doing a Dry January is a good idea. I did one last year and it ultimately led me to give up alcohol completely that June. ..What I'd suggest is keeping a journal of how you feel each day. Jot down how you feel in the morning whether you maintain your sobriety this month or slip up. Don't feel bad about the latter: I factored in "cheat" days during my dry January and it was useful inasmuch as I wrote down how badly I felt when I woke up hungover. Not that I think you should do the same!..Alcoholics are funny. They might tick nine out of 10 boxes indicating that they have a drinking problem and they'll use the one they didn't tick as justification for why the other nine don't apply. You seem to be approaching the problem in a sensible healthy way and I wish you all the success. ..&amp;#x200B;
