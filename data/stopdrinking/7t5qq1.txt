2 years ago today I was sitting in a jail cell sobering up.  Spent 5 days there beginning detox and reflecting on what I had become and figuring out who I really want to be...Day by day struggle by struggle whatever it took... I was not going to go back.  Not once.  Not one drink.  ..Find some encouragement in this.  If I can do it so can you.

We have the exact same sober date.  I was not sitting in jail but a PO's office.  Practically twinsies.
I just found this sub. I'll have my 2 years May 21. I'm pretty happy about it.
