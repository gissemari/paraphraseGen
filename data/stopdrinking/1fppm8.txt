----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I hit 6 months this past weekend!  And have more than two weeks "sobriety" from my eating disorder!..Struggle: My alcoholic sister is making a further mess of her life and is about to be homeless probably..  =/..General Chat:  I just started training for a triathlon!
Good morning sobernauts!..Triumph: I finally got off my ass and started working on other aspects of my health.  It's been 5 days since I've chewed any nicotine gum and I'm counting calories.  So far so good!..Struggle: sugar.  I am trying to limit sugar and it's making me cranky and twitchy.  Quitting booze was such a big deal and here I am freaking out over whether I can have a handful of jelly beans...General chat: today is national running day.  I'm going to get at least a mile in today.
Triumph : 128 Days. For real...Struggle : I smoke way too much. Way way too much...General : Last day of school for my kids. This should be a kick ass summer...thanks for sobriety.
Triumph: Review at work went okay - been a tough year and they acknowledged that but still have a lot of faith in me...Struggle: My cat got out and I don't really know when.  It's been several days now and it appears she's not coming back - I'm heart broken.  Also I miss my wife and kids more and more everyday...General: hmm i dunno - playing skyrim for the first time and having fun with that.

* Triumph:  I had only 6 beers over the course of about 6 hours last night.  Amazing.  Usually I would go about a 12 pack in 4-5 hours almost nightly.  I feel great today and consider this a big stepping stone.  I even poured out the last drink of each one...* Struggle:  Still needing to have that first beer or I get ansy/jittery/whatever you want to call it.  However it is getting easier and I expect to only get better...* General:  I am working on losing weight/cutting back drinking and just started less smoking today.  The smoking may have to wait though as the other two are way more important to me.  I have a girlfriend who loves me and helped me notice all these issues over the last 4 months.  She is the world to me.
**Triumph:** My therapist is cutting back our sessions as he feels I'm making great progress. ..**Struggle:** My best friend's wedding is slowly approaching (early September) and I am having anxiety about it. ..**General Chat:** My father and I finished putting hardwood floors into the home I will be moving into in a few months. Working alongside him on these projects for the house has been great for rebuilding our relationship and regaining his trust. 
Triumph: Joined a couple of groups on meetup.com (again) and am determined to *actually* go this time and not make excuses....Struggle: Slipped last night and Saturday. My therapist has more or less given me an ultimatum; stop drinking or therapy will end (she'll refer me on to addictions team instead)...General chat: The weather is quite hot here (South England)! We've had a rubbish year so far it's been cold enough for gloves and woolly hat even in some days in May! Hopefully the summer is here at last.
Triumph: Like many others really truly started focusing on my health again.  Woke up at 6:30 this morning and ran 4.5 miles!  Eating right and exercise gives you a high that as I'm realizing again can't be matched...Struggle: Finding myself irritable some nights during the time where I'd normally have a drink.  Still trying to find ways to better cope with that stressor...General: Start working on a documentary today!  The first project where I will be handling all of the sound design by myself.  Can't wait to take it on with a sharp mind.
Triumph: Finally united my daily goals with my long term aspirations using lots of pen and paper to-do lists. This may not seem big but my lists are my "higher power" for helping me work towards being the person I want to be instead of the person I wish I was. Slow and steady consistent progress.....Struggle: Dad(81) came back from the cardiovascular doctor with a horrible report card; hypertension tons of plaque in the arteries and something screwy in one of his lungs. His last doctor must have been drinking (HA!) or something cos he said Dad was fine and that he didn't have to watch his salt intake. Feeling pretty lucky he imagined some problem that didn't exist and went and saw a specialist.....General: Making new friends through creative groups; writing art bettering yourself etc. that don't revolve around chemicals. Not worried about running into old bad influences/walking triggers as they aren't the kind of people who would ever dream of anything besides get drunk and high during their free time.     
Triumph: 38 days today and still going strong...Struggle: PAWS. I can handle pretty much everything except the deep feelings of depression. They make me feel really out of step with my kids' natural ebullience... which in turn makes me feel really lonely and tired...General: I got myself a FitBit and it really feeds into my love of futzing with useless data.
Triumph: Almost 2 weeks of sobriety..Struggle: Dealing with legal issues guilt anxiety relationship I ruined...General chat: Riding my bike to work every day staying active enjoying some sun in the summertime.
triumph: i quit my job and i'm moving to a city in a little bit! (i have money saved up)..struggle: i can't lie i've been thinking a lot about the possibility of drinking ""socially"" in the future lately. in my head i still know that i shouldn't and i'm still trying to think "one day at a time." i really need to get a sponsor and "tell on my addict" IRL - i think i'll bring it up with my meeting-friend in the car today. ..general chat: 100 days!
Triumph: Hit two weeks yesterday!..Struggle: The novelty-sized toblerone bar in my freezer that I've been slowly decimating...General chat: Going to a bachelor party this weekend but the best man is in recovery so it's not going to be alcohol centric.  How convenient for me!
Triumph: Day 2 and feeling so much better. No hangover and withdrawl symptoms are pretty much gone. It's amazing how much better I feel just being honest with myself and actually wanting to quit drinking.
Triumph: my fiance and I got through some tough issues this week and I am really happy for us. We're adults! (Almost :P)..Struggle: studying for LSAT's is mindnumbing...General chat: I've decided to stop AA for awhile. I feel like I do it just to make other people happy.
Triumph: I've been running. Yesterday I ran nearly 2.5 miles straight which is probably a record. Soon I'll be able to do 5k! feelsgoodman.jpg..Struggle: I had a rough week. My dad's been in the hospital for over a week for hip replacement surgery and its complications. We also found out he has cancer but we don't know yet how far it's progressed. verysadface.jpg ..For a couple days I found myself looking at the beer in the store. Not *wanting* it but looking at it (instead of ignoring it like I usually do) which is probably a precursor to wanting it. So I became extra vigilant and found other ways to deal with stress until that feeling subsided. ..General: I saw my first lightning bugs of the season.

Triumph: 8 days today not a drop. Even hung out with some friends that drank and I did not. Felt really good...Struggle: Smoking sugar sleeping...General chat: Day off work should be good. ~75 degrees or so.
Triumph: I have made it to my senior year of high school. .Struggle: I may have failed my pre-calc final because I spent "too much time on reddit" 
**Triumph:** I've been eating healthy exercising and finally getting some decent sleep...**Struggle:** I've been struggling with the implications that come along with admitting I'm an alcoholic never being able to drink again etc... I'm also starting to wonder if my marriage will hold up to my sobriety. She likes to drink and even though she's being supportive I have a gut feeling she doesn't fully agree with my decision to quit drinking and she's not that keen on the fact that I've asked her not to drink at home for the first bit...**General Chat:** The weather is starting to warm up here finally which always puts me in a good mood.
Triumph: 5 1/2 weeks sober! (longest I went in previous attempt was 6 weeks so eager to surpass it this time!)..Struggle: Getting adjusted to new job still. Made a final decision I need a new sponsor because I can't trust her to do my 4th step (that I'm feeling I need to do soon!) and feeling very alone in my feelings/frustrations...General chat: Going to see the Lumineers in concert tomorrow!
**Triumph:** If all goes well tonight I should be hitting the five month mark!..**Struggle:** I have been having thoughts that closely resemble "maybe one day I can moderate". It's weird because I feel so fulfilled by my life and I've begun to really incorporate "sober" into part of my identity and it feels so right. I don't feel like I want to drink and I don't care to find out if I can moderate again but for some reason the thought is still vaguely there...**General Chat:** I don't know if it's the weather or I'm still gaining benefits from quitting but life has been extraordinary lately. I'm eating right exercising I'm making progress in working with my dog work has been great and my anxiety is the lowest it's been since I can remember! I finally feel like I'm living like everything has aligned and I'm right where I've always been meant to be.
Triumph: Made amends with my younger brother this morning. It went extremely well...Struggle: Having some anxiety around building new friendships and at work...General Chat: It's a beautiful day and I'm about to take the dog for a walk!!
Struggle: Over ate a little bit of lunch today and kind of slacking at work after a long stressful deadline last week.  .Triumph: Caught up on a backlog of some personal stuff and am actively making plans as the coordinator for a small trip with friends two weekends from now.
Triumph: Ran a 10K on Saturday! Did not die!.Struggle: Work stress blech..General Chat: I'm visiting /sd less and need to step it up. Good luck to all!
Triumph: The last two weeks have consisted of little besides being dragged to bar after bar after bar by a visiting friend my boyfriend getting laid off looking for a new house in a city where everyone's rent seems to have gone up 30% and a crushing depression that makes me cry for hours inexplicably alternating with anxiety that makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack. These are all in the triumph column because despite all of this I still have 199 days today. I can't believe how much not drinking I've done lately!..Struggle: God The Universe and Everything are conspiring to make me want to drink but I am so far beyond craving alcohol now that those awful stressed anxious sad hopeless terrified lost feelings are sort of disconnected. A year ago all of this translated to "I need a drink" but now it just translates to "I'm losing my mind." No matter how rationally I'm thinking I FEEL like screaming crying killing myself crawling out of my own skin and/or quitting my job. All the time. ..General chat: My man is going out of town for four days and I'm actually having positive feelings again. I can't wait for 4 days of clean house no dirty dishes no dirty socks no video games no red meat no shame about my tight budget no whining that I'm working late and no paranoid freak out when I see my friend's band on Saturday and (gasp!) stay out past midnight! I even get to be woken up by my adorable bunny since Mr. Man won't beat me to getting her breakfast. Wow writing it all out I'm getting really excited. This is the first time in two years I've felt free XD I'm so glad I'll be sober so I can really enjoy it!
