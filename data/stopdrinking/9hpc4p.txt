Waking up this morning again without a hangover I was able to read some pages from a book published in 1917. I read these lines and realized that struggle is as old as life but with alcohol I thought I could escape it. With alcohol I have only created more struggle and robbed life of its joy. Be well everyone. I will not drink with you today.

Welcome to your spiritual awakening! IWNDWYT!
Lovely post!  Alcohol was the thing that kept me from feeling confused unskilled not enough. It was what I turned to when I felt myself the worst person on earth. Randy Newman's song "Guilty" describes it perfectly. "And it takes a whole lot of medicine/ for me to pretend I'm somebody else."  It's different now.  But it was a rather lengthy transformation. "Costing not less than everything." Be well! IWNDWYT
