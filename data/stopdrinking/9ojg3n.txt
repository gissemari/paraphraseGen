Apologies for the inevitable wall 'o text. By the way please feel free to kick my ass for being a selfish resentful child. I sure have been...Not going to lie; my alcoholic brain kicked in and I started planning. It took a real effort to snap out of it...My wife and I are not in a great place. We haven't had sex in almost three months now. She and I already had a sore spot with how different our sex drives are; for me once a week is ok but there were times when it just seemed to slip her mind and I've never been able to fathom that...Regardless I own my part in this most recent dry spell; I relapsed yet again in what was already a bad year for relapses and she confronted me while I was drunk so I ~~acted completely rational and did not say anything hurtful whatsoever~~ made a total ass of myself and regret how I acted...But now I find myself in a bad place. I love my wife and I want our marriage to recover but I find myself slowly getting resentful about something I think it could be rational to get resentful about if it went on for too long. Again I own my part but if the consequence of my actions is to be in a sexless marriage I WILL eventually drink again; the right thing for me would be to end the marriage and deal with THOSE consequences...I just don't know what "too long" is and it's breaking my heart.

Sounds like maybe some marriage counseling could help?..I know my husband and I have mix matched sex drives and sometimes we get into the cycle of he wants sex and I don't so then he starts pouting when I say no which is not sexy and then doesn't want to have sex when I relent because I'm not 'into' it but I'm not into it because pouting isn't sexy and then we start fighting.....As lame as it is scheduling sex helped snap us out of it and back into our groove. No awkward miscommunications or beating around the bush that makes us feel unsexy and not confident. Even if one of us isn't into it at first eventually we both end up in it.
