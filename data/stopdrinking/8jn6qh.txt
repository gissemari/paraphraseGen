Hi r/stopdrinking. ..I've recently learned the extreme extent to which my mother was abused as a child. The worst kinds of things imaginable. Because of this she suffers from BPD DID PTSD and depression. I didn't know until recently that she is also an alcoholic. She hid it from my siblings and me and now that we are out of the house some things came to light. I don't think she has admitted to herself that she is an alcoholic or if she just won't admit it to us. She can go days without drinking but then the next day a 26er \(750 ml\) of hard alcohol will be gone. She has some incredibly destructive and abusive habits when she's drinking and it's really rough on my father. It also mixes badly with her medication and I"m constantly worried about her to the point of having nightmares. I wouldn't be surprised if she drank herself to death and soon...It's made me question my own relationship with alcohol and see the much much more sinister side of it. I'm not a heavy drinker\- don't really drink throughout the week but I can binge pretty hard on the weekend and have a few hangovers a month. I've cut down on drinking and I'm doing \(trying to do\) my first ever sober month. I've tried before but it doesn't seem to stick. I'm really bad at giving in to peer pressure and the FOMO is real. I think as soon as I tell myself I'm doing a sober month something inside me resists and I drink sooner than I would if I wasn't "doing a month." ..I'm not sure what I'm looking for. I guess it's just good to know there's a community here. I can't talk to many people about it \(hence throwaway account\) because I don't want to betray all of my mother's struggles and at the heart of it that's why I'm doing it. Any thoughts or words of wisdom are appreciated.

Welcome aboard!..Sorry to hear about your Mum... addictive tendencies can certainly run in families so you're very wise to be questioning your own relationship with alcohol too.....Here's a couple of resources which I found really useful:..The book/YouTube Channel '*This Naked Mind*' and the book '*Alcohol Explained*' really helped me understand my drinking problem and gave me some useful tools to stop and *stay* stopped without feeling like I was depriving myself or missing out on anything... Understanding a bit of the science behind the interaction between Alcohol and the human brain made a big difference!..You might also look into the sub r/alanon for additional support as the loved one of an alcoholic it might be a good fit in your situation.....Starting with a 30-day challenge is great but if that feels too daunting start small... just dodge the First Drink just for today and do the same again tomorrow... the important bit is putting down the bottle and you can figure the rest out as you go along!..I won't drink with you today hope you'll keep us posted......Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Okay first Welcome to SD &amp; I love your username except now that song is stuck in my head lol...I am sorry to hear that your mom has been through so much and this putting yall through stuff too. As far as your own sobriety: Try telling yourself I am am just doing today sober? or While the sun is up? or ten minutes? I find that on here the first month is kinda broken down. Every week you get a new "flair" so its kinda like a mini goal you have a daily check in to commit (which sounded like it wouldn't carry any weight with me to be honest but it has kept me sober several times "fawwwkkkkkk I said I wouldn't to everyone already" lol) there also is the chatroom on the side bar and then reading other people's posts/helping others but just sharing your thought. Soooooo you gotta lot of people and resources here to help if you want it. Honestly I had to get sober when I was ready.... not because my exhusband was beating me until I agreed not because my family and best friend were worried about my health not because I hated everything about myself &amp; what I became not because I was fine avoiding everything in my life not because I desperately didn't to want to/refused to become my parent ..... I could cope with all that with alcohol. I had to do it just for me and my sanity on my terms when I was ready...Anyway glad you are here and wish you the best.
