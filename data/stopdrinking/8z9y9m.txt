This time last week I was feeling like absolute shit!!!! Today is Day 8 and even though it's only been a weekI cannot get over how good I feel..I thought that the weekend was going to be really really hard but I got through it with flying colors and I couldn't be more proud of myself. As I look back over the week I see a lot of things that are different already I did not have one mean nasty fight with my husband this week and say hurtful and mean things that I didn't really mean which was almost a given when I was drinking. I I have a clear head this morning and I am determined to make this work! I am so grateful that I found this page and that there are so many other people out there struggling as I am  and that we were all able to share our feelings here! .Hope everyone has a wonderful Monday.   ..I will not drink with you today!
