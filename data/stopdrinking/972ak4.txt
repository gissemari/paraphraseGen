I've been a lurker here for about the last year. This sub is full of amazing people and has been really helpful for me. I've had 4 periods of extended sobriety in the last year with my longest streak being 59 days. After each one of these streaks I returned to alcohol. I don't have a good reason why. One time I just really felt like drinking while traveling another time I went out on a date and decided I would drink. I'd usually go a few weeks after relapsing where I'd model my behavior on what I deemed to be a normal relationship with alcohol. A couple of beers here and there a bottle of wine at dinner on the weekend etc. Each time it inevitably turned into drinking every single day some days significantly more than others. After a weekend full of drinking on top of 3 full months of daily drinking I've decided it's time to a fresh start (again)...I created an account asked for a badge and made my first post. Thank you to everyone on this page for sharing your journey. IWNDWYT

I'm totally with you. I have some significant streaks but then I start drinking again. I lose touch of why I stop...Let's do this!
Good luck! You can do this and I'm rooting for you. IWNDWYT
