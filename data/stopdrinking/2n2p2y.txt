http://i.imgur.com/Sy4RO6u.png..Note: The chart shows the development of the last 12 months. I had some relapse so it's not actually 88 days :) Blue indicates shares or funds. ..Exported some data from my account. Interesting to see that during the time I was drinking I never really cared about my finance and threw the money out (30 /40$ for a cab? Fuck yeah why not!)...I have marked the time where I've tried and finally became sober. I also subscribed to /r/investing. I've tried my luck in day-trading but quickly realized that I'm switching addictions... day-trading also gave me some sort of *kicks* and *rushes* so I had to give it up...How did your financial situation improved?..

This is great /u/yhelothere! A lot of us here are suckers for charts - it's so awesome to see quantitative measures of our success...I've been meeting with a financial planner and some investment counselors since I got sober. It actually feels good to turn my investments over to the "professionals." Part of sobriety for me is realizing what I really do and don't want to spend my time on. Turns out I don't want to spend it on managing my money and doing laundry. :)..Congrats on the investing success! 
Great job! I love graphing progress because I believe our intuition can deceive us with things like this. I'm logging my weight every day during my weight loss journey and it's so much fun to look over it...I have really started focusing on wealth management and planning for the future. Before I would think of money in terms of today and this week (maybe this month). If I could pay for my immediate bills then what's the problem?! Ha. Now I am excited to be planning for retirement and starting to actively do it (which will be in like 40 years)...Congrats on seeing a real change like this. It's so important to have tangible improvements for us..
Not a chart but this is enough to get me turgid..[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/wnJobVo.jpg)
Great chart. Thanks for sharing!..This is one area I'm excited to apply my sober mind and effort to. Drinking has really hampered my financial goals. I'm excited to look back in a year or two at my progress.
