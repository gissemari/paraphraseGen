I'm using the Sinclair Method (TSM). ..Using this method a dose of naltrexone is taken one hour before drinking and it stops an individual from enjoying it. Over time alcohol is no longer a temptation and the addiction can subside completely...The medication itself is not addictive and as you decrease the frequency of drinking you also decrease the frequency in which you take the medication...Since using TSM my drinking has significantly lowered and as time passes I feel increasingly indifferent to alcohol. Meaning that even when the medication is not in my system anymore I do not desire alcohol...I'm on a path that supports sobriety without having to  white knuckle  my way through or struggle with the physical addiction...Many people have been supportive but some haven't. This kind of bothers me as true criticism is welcome but simply just being against a method without explanation is annoying and unhelpful...Alcoholism is different for all of us as we are all individuals... thus all people succeed using different methods. I wish people would understand
