Relapsed into a 30 day shitshow. Not my first but despite more time between relapses they last longer. Was a heavy marathon drinker so I am on anti-seizure meds amongst a slew of others and vitamins. They help immensely compared to my last time which I did cold turkey...Still sweating like mad but I know that goes away around day 5-7 usually although I do dread waking up in a pool of sweat every 45 minutes despite trazedone. ..Did manage to eat food and even go outside today despite crazy anxiety. Each day is getting better and now I need to decide if it is back to treatment or an addictions councillor. Too anxious for AA right now but maybe in a few days and collect yet another damn white chip...Sorry for the long post just wanted to mention it somewhere.

I know how you feel. Day 3 here after a 2.5 week binge. I think I am cresting the hill hopefully will sleep halfway decent tonight. It still surprises me how supposedly intelligent human beings like us would keep poisoning ourselves despite the consequences. In know we all have burdens to bear but how I hate this one.
