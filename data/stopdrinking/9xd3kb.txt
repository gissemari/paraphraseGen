Yea I know I drank too much. I know alcohol played a bigger role in my life than it should have. I know the amount of alcohol I was drinking was terrible for my body and made me feel like trash most mornings. It only negatively impacted me though right?..Except when I was too drunk to share that quiet evening time with my wife after the kids are in bed. ..Except when I was hungover and short tempered with everyone on a busy weekday morning...Except when I was distracted by obsessing over when where and how much I could drink...Except when I became a grumpy bastard from sobering up after an afternoon buzz...Except when I wanted to sit and drink instead of running around playing with my kids...Except when I was too drunk or hungover to listen and be supportive of my wife...Except for those times I drove when I shouldn't have and put myself and everyone else on the road at risk. Not to mention the risk of a DUI and losing my great job that provides for my family...Except when I would get argumentative about stuff that doesn't matter because I was drunk...Except when I was drunk and clumsy accidentally broke things that weren't mine...Except when I failed to accomplish things I said I would because alcohol sapped all my ambition. ..Except when I was too drunk/hungover to get up with the kids even though I told my wife she could sleep in...Except when I monopolized conversation with inebriated rambling...Except when I demonstrated to my young kids that adults drink everyday...This list could go on and on but I think you get the point. Before I stopped I honestly believed that I was only hurting myself. Being sober has allowed me to truly examine the last few years and see things as they really were. My life is so much better now. It's like someone turned down the difficulty level from insane to easy mode. To those struggling please know your life can get so much better. Keep your heart and mind open and when you're ready for day 1 embrace it. I never thought I could feel this way about not drinking. I didn't lose a friend. I won a fight to the death with my enemy. I am never going back. Fuck that poison. IWNDWYT .

Great way to look at the way it impacts everyone not just the drinker. 
Thanks for sharing! That's a solid list.
