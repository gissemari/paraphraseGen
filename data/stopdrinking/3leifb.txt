I go to college training to be a nurse. An odd thing happened the other day. I happen to sit next to a lady who works part time as a drugs and alcohol councilor and we got talking about drinking. She is also sober. She asked me about my sobriety and I lied and said I hadn't drank for 2 years. The truth would have been to say I have been struggling with controlling my drinking for 2 years with various lengths of sobriety and binging in between but for some reason the lie just came out. I also told her I was fine having a drink at odd occasions too which in my experience is complete and utter bollocks as every time I do this it very rapidly leads to a bender from which I have to drag my sorry self with much effort. I'm not sure why I'm sharing this- I suppose I thought I was ok telling people about my addiction but it turns out I'm not really possibly. Ironic really when you consider she's probably dealt with all manner of addiction from all walks of life and is probably the least likely person on the course to judge me. Anyway I'll see her on Monday and I plan to come clean and apologise for being full of shit.

At least you're not lying to yourself!  Stay strong stay vigilant. 
&gt; Anyway I'll see her on Monday and I plan to come clean and apologise for being full of shit...This is such a huge step.  Please let us know how this goes.  I'm totally excited for you; I had a moment like this when I returned from relapse in 2009 where I had to be totally honest after lying about something trivial.  In being honest about my dishonesty I risked my re-employment at the lawfirm where I am currently employed.  Instead of losing that job opportunity I developed a reputation for painful honesty among my co-workers.

I've done this too! Then I look at Step 10 and tell people " I want to live am honest life and what I told you about__________ isn't true. I'm not sure why I chose to lie but I am also choosing to correct myself " ..10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
