Today while I was doing so reflecting. After I quit drinking I went into a deep depression couldn't seem to find the will to do anything I was paralyzed with the fear of not having my crutch to deal with the stress of life. I would just stay inside all day long afraid to face the world. It got so bad I was planning on running away from it all and even loaded up my truck to go off camping and never coming back. I finally got enough will power to ask some good friends and my family to get me some help and it was the best thing I've ever done getting things out in the open with everyone talking about my struggles it feels like the world has been lifted off my shoulders. I was up early today got my yard taken care off and am bout to run errands. Don't ever loose hope it will get better still have a lot of work to do but at least I'm making progress. IWNDWYT
