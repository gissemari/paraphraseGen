I had been experiencing withdrawl symptoms last weekend and had to force myself to drink to curb myself from them thinking if i drank less and less they would go away. They were only getting worse and I was missing work because of it. I finally did yesterday what I should have done last week and sought out medical attention. My sister dropped everything to come get me after I admitted it to her and that I needed help. For the third time in my adult life I had landed in the ER for this very thing. So here I am Day 1 again and this time I know in my heart that I can't moderate. I can't control myself the way I thought I could. My longest time before this was 4 weeks and I really hope this one sticks. Thank you for reading and lastly thank you very much for the community. We all struggle but we don't have to alone.

I am proud of you for going to get help. I won't drink with you today.
I'm glad you got help. What are you going to do differently this time so it doesn't happen again?..
You're so right - you're not alone! You've shown real courage in opening up to the important people in your life. That makes it easier to get support and harder to rationalize drinking. I'm committed to not drink with you today. Some days I can only commit hour by hour. But that's good enough if it keeps me sober. I'm rooting for you! 
Well done. It's hard to do those things but they work.
