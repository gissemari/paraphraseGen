Day 1. 3 relapses in a year but this time it is serious.  My wife is kicking me out.  Been about 26 hours since my last drink.  I told her I made 24 hours tonight and she said "That's great" but I do not think she is taking me back this time.  I will not drink with you today.

Welcome back IWNDWYT 
Are you going to try to do things differently this time?..AA is what saved my ass. But there are other programs. Check out the sidebar on the r/alcoholism subreddit. ..Good luck 
Glad you're back. It is tough when your loved one kicks you to the curb. ..I spent the first year of my sobriety trying to show my daughter that I was working a program and really in recovery. Didn't work. ..I spent the second year in Alanon learning to detach with love. It kinda worked. ..The third year was pretty smooth for me except for when my kid fought at me. I had learned to walk away but still sobbed my eyes out. ..This last year she gets on to me and I walk away while she screams  don't you dare walk away from me  as her voice gets quieter and finally is too quiet to hear. ..What I have learned is that recovery is for me. I am a member of AA because I could not do it alone.  I needed support of people who understand what I was going through. And in just the last year I have come to believe that my recovery is for me I make amends and that is for me too. She does not have to forgive or even believe!! ..What I'm saying is that the next couple years may be tough but the harder you work on you and your sobriety the more you will learn and the better you will feel. ..IWNDWYT
