Hey r/stopdrinking just wanted to say thank you to all the people posting here. Been lurking for 2 weeks now and just learning and taking comfort in the fact that I'm not the only one struggling with alcohol...I stopped because alcohol for me always leads to drugs. I'm about to be 3 weeks completely sober. First time since 7th grade(am 26)...The main change I've noticed is that I'm becoming a lot cleaner and neater. There was also an article I read in TIME about how being conscientious is the number one determining factor for success. But anyway that's been my biggest change so far. I'm also in a pretty good mood almost 80% of the time. ..Anyway thanks to everyone here. Good luck to people just starting. People ahead I hope to be where you're at one day keep going cause everyday you're sober it shows others that it's possible.
