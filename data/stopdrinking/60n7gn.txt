Hey everyone..I've hit the 50 day mark and have been asked to document my thoughts on things. It's the longest period of sobriety in my booze ridden existence so a big milestone! ..Hopefully I can help some serial 'relapsers' like me that fail to get past the weekend and struggle with the little voice that says "moderate....when you feel better". ..In the last 3 years I have relapsed probably 40 times. Never give up. ...Bit of history but not war and peace.....I was a red wine addict have drank heavily since 17 years old. In January I blacked out for the last time waking up 2 days later knowing this is it. Life begins at 40 (well 37). I need to be here for my daughter and my wife but most of all I owe it to myself to live the life I've been given fully. I've wasted so much time and won't waste anymore. ..The good thing is that it's working already. Life is indeed beautiful and the future is full of wonder. It's also scary as hell but I feel alive.   ..*It has not been easy* but I'm giving you my honest heartfelt opinion that it can be done and it is totally worth every ounce of pain. Cravings go you will get better. **Give it time.**..My mantra - I continue to work at it every day and every day I get stronger. ...Some ongoing proof......[Me at my worst one year ago](http://imgur.com/V6j6dcw) ..[Me at my best this morning!](http://imgur.com/QtECyLt)...**A list of highlights from the last 50 days good and bad**...* I've lost about 10kg in weight. That's with no exercise and a fairly healthy diet mixed with huuuuuuge sugar cravings from time to time. My eating habits are so much better now but I sometimes gorge on pizza. I don't feel anywhere as hungry consume way less crap in general and less calories overall. I think I'm about ready to start running now spring is here. ...* [Sparkling water](https://www.sanpellegrino.com/intl/en) is my go to. I love it. It's my new addiction. I also now drink tea. This is completely new. ...* I'm up every day between 6am and 7.30am at the latest. It's actually easy and mornings are my favourite time of day. Time with my daughter time out walking the dog playing video games whilst everyone's asleep. So awesome....* Until recently everyone knew me as the dude who stays up till 2am drinking and sleeps in as much as possible. I'm known as horrid in the mornings and grumpy most of the time until the weekend...That's changed. My wife now loves me more now that I get up and make breakfast feed the dog and use the loo an hour before she's even up lol. I am always happy and calm. I laugh alot and take little seriously. I'm confident again. ...* The mental sharpness has come back. I'm clear can string thoughts together like I did when I was young and am secretly starting to think I might be fairly intelligent as my teachers once told me. Maybe that's pushing it but I'm reading loads and listening to audio/podcasts all the time. Watched the big short the other day and followed it perfectly. I would have pretended to understand that stuff last year. I am still bad at Math. ...* Enthusiasm for things is growing wonderfully but is also getting too much. I feel there's so much to do so many cool things to be involved in or to find out about. It makes living normal home life and going to work quite hard. A great problem to have but it's exhausting....* At the same time as being clear and focused on my job and running my business I'm simultaneously vacant as hell as my brain is thinking about books science politics health relationships money media and the complexities of the next final fantasy expansion. I'm also utterly perplexed at how Emma Watson has turned into such a stunning woman. Amazing. ...* My lizard brain is waking up and it's able to process a lot which is great but a total mindfuck all at once. ...* Laughter is natural. It's much better and flows way more than you think it will. I now belly laugh all the time. I laugh alone at stuff especially old episodes of 'Bullseye' on Sky TV (one for the Brits but seriosuly funny when you see the prizes they give out). ..I'm also not joining in conversations too eagerly trying to be funny. I just find everything hysterical and can sit back. I've made new friends already by being present and talking to everyone - I'm spending time with folks who I actually get on with and make me laugh as apposed to people that also drink wine. ...* Meditation and mindfulness work. Just do it. 10 mins a day..Willpower is bullshit to me and only lasts a week. Mindfulness and discipline work better. ...* I crave drink every day at the same time; 7pm. After 50 days I now wait for the craving to come like a bell tolling a coming storm. I just wait for it to pass just like the rain passing over the house in winter. The blue sky is always there just let the clouds pass. It's getting weaker every evening....* Time heals. Love conquers all. Yes it's not a sales pitch for a new Disney film. It works. Give things time spread love where you can and that peace will be returned. ...* My depression is gone. This I am serious about. It's gone. ...* I am waiting every moment for it to return with fearsome evil abandonment and cripple me but so far so good.*...* Playing PS4 sober is fantastic. Rewatching old movies and TV is wonderful now I'm actually paying attention. I am loving Horizon Zero dawn and getting back into FFXIV online....* Going out is still hard just because the whole world is against you and alcohol adverts are everywhere. It's like there's one huge crack den party going on where the world is getting hammered and thinks it's ok but you're the only one who's noticed that heroin is deadly and is turning us all into zombies. I guess as above we give it time. I don't preach to anyone....* Drinking loads of water - The toilet is my new place of rest. I'm hydrated like a motherf&&ker...* Just started the wheel of time by Robert Jordan a series of books I never thought I'd ever attempt as they're so massive. It's brilliant. ...* I'm planning a trip to some mountains next year. My dream is to make it to base camp Everest. Got to have a dream. ...* Lastly This sub is my lifeline and I'm here every day. Thank you all for reading and I hope I'm writing something like this in another 50 days. ..Much love

Excellent post! Keep it up! 
Congratulations!! Right behind you on my 50th day today!!!
This is a great post. I too have found now that I am sober that there is simply not enough time in the day to get all the things done I want to get done!..I started waing of at 6am then 5 am and now I am up at 4:00 am everyday and go all day long and end my night feeling like damn I wish I had like 2 or 3 more hours to read this or write something or watch that documentary I keep putting off...It's great to be able to be present and dependable for your family as well. I realized just how selfish I had been when I was drinking. In the moment I didn't but now looking back I see how selfish and destructive my drinking was. And I was a wine drinker too. I use to think drinking wine and knowing all about it made me sophisticated when in reality it made me a bore and stole the beauty and wonders of life from me. 
This is the start of something special! Nice one

Wow! Love the before and after. You look so HEALTHY!!
This is fantastic! My favorite bit is the dream. Since being sober I'm kicking items off of my bucket list! You go!
Fantastic! All the best to you   
Go man go
Wow!  You look great!  Congrats and thanks for sharing!
Thanks for sharing this post! Every night around 7pm is when my 'craving' kicks in too. I guess the conditioning of that nightly drinking just takes a bit to get over. I also really related to this: "Going out is still hard just because the whole world is against you and alcohol adverts are everywhere. It's like there's one huge crack den party going on where the world is getting hammered and thinks it's ok but you're the only one who's noticed that heroin is deadly and is turning us all into zombies."  Perfectly said. I know that feeling of feeling like you're the only one not drinking and watching the whole world just blindly drink the poison. I have a friend who decided to stop drinking as well. I often wind up chatting with him through text when I get too hung up in those situations. Even though it's rude to be on your phone when out socially I've found that taking pictures of the booze I will proudly not be drinking and speaking to someone of the same mind in these situations to be helpful. You look amazing btw! Congrats. :)  -Jen
Fellow red wine addict and serial relapser here!   Congrats on 50 days! 
51 days looks good on you brother. I share many of the same sentiments as you. I'm a world away but it's funny how us sobernauts can be so similar even though we all lead such different lives. Carry on friend. Here's to 51 days!
Very cool.
you look great really.  not to be a buzzkill but some online publications have taken pics from this sub and embedded them in stories about alcoholics who quit drinking. inspiring articles yes but you might be all over the internet.
My SO mentioned to me the other day that I seem to laugh and smile a lot more. And I do. It feels great. ..Love the pictures - you look so handsome in your new picture.
You look great!! Very healthy! Thank you for sharing your update rock on!!
I LOVE your post! Congratulations on your 50 days and much thanks to you for sharing your personal observations and giving us something to aspire to in the coming days or weeks!   I'm feeling more and more optimistic about my future. 
BOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is such a great post and you look fantastic!  I am only two weeks in and I am already feeling more focused and intelligent!  .Thanks so much for this. 
You're so good looking and your post was so English   your wife is a lucky lady!
Congratulations this is fantastic! I'm marching along right next to you. Reaching that point where the benefits of quitting so clearly outweigh the "benefits" of drinking is huge. In my experience it gets even better though it's important for me to not stop appreciating them to not take them for granted. ..On that note an aside: each year Bill Gates writes an annual letter for the Gates Foundation. (https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter) This year the letter took the form of a response to a letter Bill received from Warren Buffet a huge contributor to the Foundation. It's an amazing exchange but Warren starts by making the point that each year he rights a letter to his shareholders reflecting on the what he has done well or poorly and what he has learned. He notes that he is actually the primary beneficiary of this letter because it allows him to think things through. And he asks Bill to write a letter for the same purpose. I'd add that another benefit of such a letter is to memorialize one's thinking during a point of reflection...You have written your 50 Day Milestone Letter. It's a great contribution to this community and will undoubtedly help others (you've helped me) but I think you may find that you receive the greatest benefit. Come back and read this letter in a week a month at your 100 Day Milestone. ..I look forward to your next letter.
Right on! One of the best posts I've seen on here in a long time. 
Congrats on 50! You look great!
So awesome man!! Such an inspiration. Keep it up!
Wow! Thank you! I am looking forward to what's ahead :)
What a beautiful and inspiring post. Congratulations and thank you for sharing! You look so handsome - I'm sure that makes your wife happy too :) I will not drink with you today.
Why post removed??
Well done sir. Thanks for the inspiration and congrats on the 50 days
Amazing. The pics were night and day. I love what you said about needing a dream as I can relate that life at times can feel unfulfilled. I need a dream to keep me going.
I'm on day 52. Jealous of your weight loss! I haven't lost a pound. I guess I've been indulging in too much comfort food hmm.
Good job on 51 days.
This is an amazing post!  Thank you for sharing.  
Wow You went from Not to Hot! Haha Seriously though you look great now congratulations!
Wow you look Marvelous !!!!!
A sparkling water toast to you.   Keep going! :)
This is amazing you look fantastic. Congratulations! You deserve it. .I wont drink with you today! :) 
Dude we're sobriety bros! Today's 51 for me and I'm 37 as well...So many of the things I've experienced align with yours that I'm almost suspicious that I relapsed and blacked out last night and finally hit send on my own story. :)..Congratulations and stay strong. 
Congrats! I agree with other comments 50 days looks good on you. It sounds like you have an amazing life. Happy for you. Keep up the good work!
Well damn dude. This is amazing. Congrats! And lookin good! 
This notion that there is too much to do and not enough time is really hopeful to me. Fear of lack of stimulation and boredom (which are awful excuses) are always what trip me up when I've abstained for a period of time. 
This. Post. Nails. It.
Thank you so much for this. I'm on my second day after a good bout of serial relapsing---this really gave me some perspective for the plans I'm going to carry through on. "Willpower is bullshit and only lasts for a week"---that sounds about right. 
Great job! 
Holy shit you look amazing! Total hottie :-)..Well done on all of it I'm really happy for you!
Thanks for this been lurking this sub for awhile but uncertain if it was down my alley. You seem to have been similar to where I am now. You've given one internet stranger some hope so again thank you.
Well done mate! The Wheel of Time is an awesome series in the true sense of the word. Keep up the good work and don't be afraid to ask for help if becomes difficult. (Sobriety not the books.).Love and fellowship. 
Wow!! Thanks for sharing! You look great!
Sexy Sexy! You look great! ..I'm interested how my depression and anxiety will be as I continue.. Will I need to be on meds still? Very intrigued- Were you ever on anything?
Thank you my friend. Reading this gives me hope and seriously motivated me even more. Thank you so much again.
Good job!
those lists wonderful. So happy for you...pics: That beer size is absurd and today you look handsome and healthy! 
What a great post! And how great you look in your recent picture! Very inspiring.
Your post brightened my day. Congratulations on 50 days!
I'm so happy to read your post. I was struggling and thinking about picking up a bottle of wine tonight. I stuck with the pet store and came home to read posts. I remembered my commitment to not drink today. 
I needed this. You have a way with words. Thank you sir. 
Wow. This is remarkable. You are remarkable...I like your comment about how you felt the need to be the funniest or most interesting person at the party (I am summarizing but this is what I got from it). I did that. Always had to chime in say something hilarious...For me I think it was driven by my own self-dissatisfaction. Maybe I needed confirmation from others since I couldn't get it from myself. ..I have saved your post. Your writing carries a wonderful tone and I'll keep in my back pocket for the next time I'm feeling down. Congratulations and thanks for sharing your story.
I love this post and am thankful you shared it.
Awesomeness! 
Love this. Thanks for sharing.
Enjoy the wheel of time!  That was the fantasy series I grew up with and nothing else still quite measures up.
Very very very inspiring. Just found this sub a dew minutes ago. I seriously need the change. This was a great read.
Congrats! I loved reading about all of your positive changes. And you look like a different person!
You're inspiring me. Your struggles sound much like my every day struggles and I really want to feel the way you do. I'm proud of you. I need to just call it quits right now. I need to stop working at a bar where it's too easy to drink on or off the clock. I am entirely apathetic about everything and it scares me. I want to feel things again. Good things. Maybe quitting drinking will help. Thanks for your post.
You are a cool dude.  Thank you :)
Thank You!!!
Wow this was great.  I really enjoyed it.  I thought it was ironic the first picture with the beer the label was Freedom.  Your new picture looks great.  I can relate to the being quiet and not trying to be funny.  I  just discovered La Croix  and Kambucha.  MMMMm  I won't drink with you today.  Thanks for the inspiration.  What a turn around in 50 days.
Day 4...stumbled upon this post. Amazing and inspiring! Thank you :)
