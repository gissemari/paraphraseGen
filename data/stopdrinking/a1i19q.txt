A little while ago I read a post where someone vented a bit about  serial relapsers' insinuating that we were somehow less serious about sobriety.  That we were less committed. It *almost* sounded like we didn't belong. ..Being an addict I often feel that I really don't belong anywhere. That's why I overused- it made me feel more accepted more like  the crowd'. So when I came here my little oasis of safety and read that it really got to me...The truth is serial relapsers are incredibly strong. They know what Day One feels like (read: total shit) and they keep coming back to it *over and over again* when it would be so much easier to just give up and dive headfirst into a bottle forever. (Maybe we serials are a little masochistic?) But we keep coming back for more after every slip. ..To all you serial relapsers out there here's to you friends. The only way you can fail is to stop trying. ..Whether you're on your 1st Day One or your 100th you're still trying and that's awesome! ..I'm proud of you for trying. I'm proud of you for being here. I'm proud of you for not giving up. .And we're here for you whenever you need us!!.IWNDWYT ..-SW

I am a serial relapser so I can relate ;p  It's true the first few days are the worst and I've gone through that multiple times.  I am at day 29 here looking forward to day 30 tomorrow  :D
Good post! Just to add to what you've already said here is what the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has to say about relapse:.."Because an alcohol use disorder can be a chronic relapsing disease persistence is key. It is rare that someone would go to treatment once and then never drink again. More often people must repeatedly try to quit or cut back experience recurrences learn from them and then keep trying. For many continued followup with a treatment  provider is critical to overcoming problem drinking.".."Relapse is common among people who overcome alcohol problems. People with drinking problems are most likely to relapse during periods of stress or when exposed to people or places associated with past drinking." Persistence is KEY!!
I don't think there would be an SD without us serial relapsers so....you're welcome. :) And if all it took was one bottom-out and then we merrily skip away alcohol wouldn't be a problem would it? I only need to snort turpentine once to figure out it's not for me so I'm not in any danger of needing to subscribe to /r/stopturpentine. But alcohol is a doozy of a drug so yeah if I need to re-re-re-re-restart a few times nobody should have a problem with that. 
Good stuff SW I agree. I too am a serial relapser. I keep coming back because as strong as the liquor's hold is on me my will to loosen that grip is even ***stronger***...IWNDWYT
I have said in meetings you would thing I'd be really good at quitting I've done it so many times! I've quit and relapsed so many times I can't even count. But now it's seriously affecting my health so I'm much more scared this time of another relapse...But if it does happen what can you do but get yourself up dust off and try again? I'm glad to have found this sub it has been a big help so far! IWNDWYT
&gt; we were somehow less serious about sobriety...No one in this world but us knows how hard it is to not give up.  To not just say 'fuck it' and to keep working.  To live with the struggle.  Nothing is harder than getting back up and saying 'I won't drink today'.  I didn't make it on my first attempt.  I had to reset more than once.  I have nothing but the most profound respect for people that say 'I won't let this get worse.  I refuse to quit'.  I'd reset a thousand badges rather than delete one.
I know if I ever stop trying - that's when I'm in serious trouble. ..Thanks for your post...IWNDWYT
Great and meaningful post. In my opinion I'm on day 1 everyday I decide not to drink.  Like it or not (again just my opinion) we are all on this ship together. We all have good days and bad days. One more time....just my opinion.... anyone who admits to themselves that they have a problem with alcohol and works at getting it out of their lives for good is one smart tough son of a bitch. I will not drink with you today. 
Hear hear! I think it shows almost more strength to keep falling down but KEEP getting back up! We have a genuine desire to stop drinking our journey is just a bit different. 
Sober history is valuable. It seems to stick eventually. At least it did for me and I tried to quit seriously too many times to count. I made it to 3-4 days sober what seems a billion times. 7 days a handful of times. 30 days twice and 63 days once. ..  I think it will stick this time...but for today.....IWNDWYT    
Great post! ..IWNDWYT.
There is far less shame in being a serial relapser than in being someone who never tries to get sober at all.
I am an isolater so I don't really have drinking or drug buddies but I have some acquaintances and friends of a sort who are in their addiction. The difference between me and them is I am a serial relapser  and they don't even try nay don't even seem to entertain the thought of sobriety. ..That being said I just got out of rehab and I have 65 days sober  with 3 of them out in the world.  That is amazing for me. ..Going to the noon meeting in just under 2 hours. IWNDWYT
I've had three day 1's this month and on another right now. Thanks for the post. It's really depressing to try fail fail fail try again. The idea gets in your head that you can't do it and might as well say "Fuck it." Suddenly you're wanting a drink more than you want your spouse's love or to just keep on living. It's such a pain in the ass to make yourself commit to even one night sober...But hey I'm here today. And today at least I can commit to not drinking.
Anyone in recovery who decrees that "such and such is not a real this or that or is not doing such and such right" is a total hypocrite and to be ignored. Everyone has the same  problem alcohol (or drugs) and nobody is better at recovering from it than anyone else. The point is to support each other period.
This is me for sure... I'm back on the wagon now for real. Feeling depressed and skin crawly but at least I'm sober this morning.
Someone with many years of sobriety likes to say "I am two days away from one day sober." I've been "stopping" since 2009 and have had many restarts. Currently on my longest "run" of staying stopped and can say I've learned something from each time of sobriety...and relapse. I cannot say I will never relapse I just know I will not drink with you today. ..&amp;#x200B;..Grateful for my day count but I know I'm two days away from one day sober. That's my real situation.
AA contributes to relapses. From day one you are told your powerless and that you need to rely on an imaginary friend to provide you with support. ..They all count the days of the thing their never going to do again and implement a policy where if you have one sip of alcohol you have to turn in your precious badge and start all over again. ..I'm a year sober with no recovery program other than not drinking. Rather than going to AA and focusing all my energy on something I'm never going to do again I prefer to engaging in hobbies and healthy sober relationships I enjoy and bring fulfillment. ..I know so many people that are on this recovery wagon and doing everything AA says only to just relapse months later. People in 12 step programs all look at you like you're not trying to stay sober and that AA is the only way to get and stay sober when in reality the only thing guaranteed about AA is relapse. ..
In this game the only way to lose is to give up trying.
It takes as many times as it takes no more no less. We are as different as we are alike in many respects. 
Thanks for this! I'm a serial relapser. I'm gonna keep going! IWNDWYT
This is a great post and one I can relate to all too well.  I have quit so many times I stopped counting.  I've made it months and even years sober and relapsed.  It happens to the strongest of us.  Now at the shittiest point in my life I've committed to quitting - again - and it takes so much strength to quit and anyone who tries deserves respect.  Love to all.  IWNDWYT 
Day 1 here.  Gonna make it to two then three. 
Addicts are notorious for projecting their shit onto those around them and every drinker who every woke up hungover and said "never again" then proceeded (at some point) to drink again is a "relapser".  ..I would bet that there isn't a problem drinker out there who hasn't gone through this cycle dozens if not hundreds of times so I wouldn't take their criticisms/projections too seriously.  ..We are all on our own path and all we can do is wake up each day and try to chose what is right for us in that moment.
Thanks for this post. Just starting again and needed to hear this. I will also say that every time I quit I feel like I get closer to it being the last time...IWNDWYT 
The thought that serial relapsers aren't serious about stopping is something that even the relapsers themselves struggle with. Being one myself I often get relatively angry with myself waking up hungover and think to myself  I must not be that serious or I'd stop doing this to myself  but the truth is for a lot of people maybe even most people have to find peace in their own way and that can mean relapsing a thousand times before stopping completely. ..One other thing that isn't necessarily about alcohol but might be interesting to someone is that I've been working on weight loss for a LONG time as long as I can remember. I have just lost my first ten pounds and it's for two reasons- 1) because I was persistent and didn't give up and 2) I stopped drinking so much beer. I realize 10 pounds is not a lot but it shows that if you stick with something you'll eventually see progress however small. 
I'm proud of the people who stick with it even after they've relapsed. It's a respectable stance to try once more after being brought low.
It's took me half a decade of quitting and relapsing for sobriety to stick. Every time I tried to quit it got a little easier. Stick with it enough and eventually it will happen we just hope it happens before it's too late. 
Thank you so much for posting this SW. IWNDWYT
It's common to relapse a lot. Expecially in the beginning. I'm finally not relapsing. Persistence is hard. .Thank you for your kind words. IWNDWYT!!
Great post. I am a serial but I keep on trying.  I never fit in anywhere either.  The booze always helped. Thanks for sharing this. Needed this. 
I celebrate every sober day as one I wouldn't have had if I no longer cared about anything and just drank every single day. I literally give myself gold stars on the calendar for every sober day. I try to get as many as I can in a row or a month. That's my insanity. At least I have some stars on my calendar.
This is such an important post to read - having to confront yourself at Day One and to keep trying must be so incredibly hard. ..IWDWYT
I love this sentiment - if it wasn't hard as shit to do this we wouldn't have a support group!! I'm in awe of everyone who tries to kick this thing. 
Gatekeeping a sobriety based forum is about one of the shittiest things you could do. We're all here to improve. Did this person learn to tie their shoes on the first try? Self improvement takes time. Anyone who wants to get sober and is willing to try is welcome here. If they relapse they're still welcome here. We offer advice not judgement. 
Hi SW.   This is my first time trying to quit and - with huge help from this site - Im lucky enough not to have relapsed (yet!).  BUT - I know that I am only a hope and a prayer away from this happening. My devil voice still whispers "go on - just one wont hurt" and it is a continuing battle to resist this BS.  ..The daily  posts from relapsers really help to reinforce the need to be vigilant.   Obviously I don't wish relapse on anybody - but I greatly appreciate your willingness to share your stories and your determination to keep trying.    You all help to make this site and to hell with anyone who says differently.  I wish you the best of luck.  IWNDWYT
I have been on day one all week. I feel like complete garbage and I know the cravings will be back in force tonight...I haven't gotten past day two in a long time either. Not since I acknowledged I have a problem...I am sick of poisoning myself. I want to be strong not weak. 
Beautifully written and hauntingly familiar
Most people can't quit the first second third or 10th time.  I quit for months at a time before having a beer because I thought I had it under control.  I think it's a long road and you just have to keep at it.  Alcohol is that much of a dangerous drug to us.  
So true
I have to reset my badge today. I've been on the verge of tears all day. I'm ashamed and feel completly hopeless. I KNOW I enjoy being sober. I KNOW I have this community and that I can get multiple days under my belt usually without many issues. ..I didn't want to send in a badge reset because I'm sure mods are sick and tired of seeing my name pop up asking for another reset. I wasn't going to. I was going to unsubscribe from stopdrinking and just say fuck it. I'll get sober eventually. I'm gonna stop trying for a while. This post. This is going to keep me here and keep me trying at least for today. ..I have a Dr. Appt on Monday to discuss my drinking anxiety and possible depression. I'll try my damndest to stay sober until then. I wasn't going to and just do one last hoorah even though I truly didn't want to binge but just gave up this morning and figured it was easier than trying. I'm a serial relapser that's slowing falling apart and for today this post saved me from deleting SD and buying beer...Thank you for this I appreciate it.
I can't imagine anyone with a serious issue NOT having relapsing issues until one day they don't anymore. .. Before I came here and was really ready to stop I tried to quit probably 300 times. My husband got tired of me saying "I'm cutting alcohol out my diet" only to be halfway through a box of wine the next day. So I stopped telling him so when I would inevitably relapse I wouldn't feel like a failure in his eyes!
IWNDWYT!

Excellent post. Recycling is the norm not the outlier. Read some of Dr. Prochaska's papers on self-change and the stages.
We're all serial relapsers until we're not.  For two years or so I'd quit drinking every few weeks or months usually after doing something I was ashamed of because I was drunk.  Then something in me told me to start drinking again whether it was feeling better ("I feel great... a six pack won't hurt") or something bad happened ("What a terrible day at work... I deserve a drink or two.).  I might have been okay with my drinking for a while but eventually it was back to being drunk everyday until I decided to quit again.  ..Three years and three months ago I finally quit for the last time I hope.  What's important is to quit one more time than the number of times you relapsed.
As a serial relapser thanks for a bit of validation my man. 
I'm batting around the idea of drinking tomorrow so this post really hit. I'm definitely a serial relapser. But I learn from it every time and gain more self understanding every time. The goal is to stick with it forever. But I'm trying to learn not to hate myself when I relapse. Learning and working toward recovery for me is learning to love myself at every stage. I don't need any extra judgment from other people.
It takes unbelievable strength to get back up dust yourself and try try again. It could happen to any of us! Much love to everyone.
Damned straight this.  Reducing your use of addictive poisons is always better than the alternative which is always using evermore and evermore of them until death parts the two of you.
I used to go to AA with a guy who serially relapsed for a year...When they asked if someone had less than 30 days he always raised his hand when it applied.  I don't know if I would have the courage to do that.  (I did relapse once but if I did it very often I think I would have given up.)..He eventually got a different sponsor and had over a year sober when I moved away.  (Not trying to suggest AA or anything; it's just part of the story.  :) )..IWNDWYT!
Thank you for this. Your post really gives me hope.
I'm new to posting here but I have been lurking for awhile and I probably "quit" 100+ times before I finally posted. The people who relapse and come back give me hope that if I do slip up it isn't the end I can reset my badge and try again. We're all in this shitty cycle together so we might as well make the best of it...IWNDWYT!
Almost all of us started out as relapsers! Hell I went through a period of quitting every morning and relapsing every evening. ..I appreciate the relapsers here. They are us. I appreciate all the voices here. Everyone who struggles with alcohol or ever has is part of our group and someone I can learn from. ..
Man fuck whoever said that. We're all doing the best we can. I've never been more serious about anything in my life I'm just having to figure out a path that works for me
I was a chronic relapser for years. I got tired of living through the same bullshit and stopped lying to myself.
Those are the people who say  dry drunk  or  drunk-a-logue  or throw other criticism around in their sharing at group meetings. Always telling the group what they think is the wrong way. Glad we don't have to deal with that here.
More the 90% of people with any addiction relapse within first 90 days.  This year 2018 the first year that I sincerely wanted to quit drinking. Had twice just made about 90 days. Now I will be very vigilant my first 90 days.  Today is my 8th day. 
I should be a serial relapser given how shitty sobriety is for me lol
In my experience from the addicts I know there are few (in my experience none) long-term sober folk that weren't at one point serial relapsers myself included. Not only are you guys strong you're getting stronger and you are building the strength you'll need to get sober and make it stick. Failure is a step to success. Don't let anyone make you feel differently. When you hold down sobriety long term it's hard to remember those early days or to not yell and get frustrated with the people who are making the same mistakes as you without remembering those mistakes are necessary. Much love to you.
It's common to relapse a lot. Expecially in the beginning. I'm finally not relapsing. Persistence is hard. .Thank you for your kind words. IWNDWYT!!
This attitude about "serial relapsers" is angering me too. I also don't know why many people (on this forums included) reset timers when they relapse like they are starting again. Let me tell you: you are not starting again combined sober time is what matters and when relapse occurs you shouldn't regard it as a catastrophe - like saying something along the lines "I lost everything I achieved while being sober". This is simply not true...*I would compare quitting drinking to a diet (food addiction if you will). Say you are on a diet and you excercise every day eat healthy lose 20 kg build muscle your colesterol and BP is lower your knees no longer hurt. Then one evening you go out with friend and have a big fat pizza a soft drink and a cake. So you relapsed. But in spite that you still have 20 kg less then when you started dieting your muscle is still here your knees still don't hurt. You lost NOTHING and you don't start all over again. The worst thing about relapse of any king is that kind of thinking. The only important thing is that the next day you continue with your diet.*..I myself decided to stop being a drunk around 11 years ago and in that time I achieved: 3 months abstinence 10 months 6 months 2 years 3 months the most. **Currently I'm sober for 5 months**. I also have a codependency to benzodiazepines unfortunately so I have been to rehab several times during that 11 years which is free in my country (Croatia) free meaning that the tax payers pay for treatment as we have a social healthcare and the rehabs have helped alot I met many interesting people there some of which are now my friends. I cherish every sober moment and as you might have read I AM a serial relapser but I never gave up and even thought about reinstate my drinking habit after every relapse.
Couldn't agree more. I was a serial relapser for roughly 5 years. I will be celebrating one year on Dec 28th. Keep at at!
All these comments kill me. I have so much respect for all of you. I'm sitting here at work. Drunk off my ass. Disappointed in myself because I'm trying to get sober. I've been trying for a long time and nothing seems to work. I hate it. I hate it all. I don't know how to be strong I don't know how to string days together. I was 3 years sober and fell off the bus and it feels like 2lehat I did back then is impossible now. I hope you all do better than me. I wish you all the best. 
Well put. Im sorry you had to read that especially reading it here. I honestly take my hat off for those who just keep trying I honestly dont know if I would have it in me to keep trying when I fail so many times. Also it wouldnt be called to battle an addiction if you would just set your mind on it and quit and problem solved. It is a disease. Keep fighting everyone! 
I think we're all here for the same reason - to improve ourselves. You are welcome here!  Best wishes to all. 
I don't know if I quite understand what a 'serial relapser' is. Is it someone who tries to quit relapses tries to quit relapses etc. or is it someone who says "Ya I've been dry for six months I'm gonna drink for a bit"? Cause the first guy sounds like me for 13 years always trying to quit and then 'moderating' until I was back to drinking my face off and trying to quit again. Once I accepted I was an alcoholic and I could never moderate quitting was easy. Being the first guy just means you need to wake up. ..But that second guy: he is in a lot of trouble. He's playing Russian Roulette with booze and that's not a pastime you get to play over and over. 
I was a serial relapser might still be. I spent 2 whole decades fucked up.... numb to unfiltered life. I needed my relapses every single one! I had to ease back to reality and relearn EVERYTHING!!! when your reality is warped by drugs and alcohol it's not as easy as " just dont drink". Eventually yes it's that easy but I'm working on 2 years trying to gain total control and acceptance of this whole new me. I was a kid when I started using so I didn't form proper coping mechanisms. I've learned a great deal from clawing my way out of hell and sometimes I just missed the damn place!now I dont. Some things are still a bit raw sometimes feeling real emotions is terrifying. But I like the real unfiltered me she's much happier than the party girl. And if I relapse again I'll come back with greater knowledge of myself. Because if I relapse I'll be back. Reality is real to me now. Being faded feels alien.
I preferred my husband when he was a serial relapser more so than when he just fell back into active addiction and stopped trying.....
Wow I can't believe someone took a pop at serial relapsers... ..Firstly I would imagine the majority of us are serial relapsers and more importantly what an ignorant and toxic thing to say that goes against everything this community is about...Well said OP.
I needed to read this today. I'm back at day one for what seems like the trillionth time unfortunately. It sucks like you said. I must be a masochist. 
You get it.
This is great. I've met many people in long term sobriety who should read and think about this. 
I have drank several times since July 1 and don't feel comfortable keeping a badge because I feel it's a disservice to those who truly count each sober day. For now I'm on a journey to feel my actual life and examine my feelings about alcohol each time I consciously choose to use it or not. I suspect that answer will reveal itself to me by how this "occasional" drinking thing goes. The word "relapse" has not crossed my mind and it only would if I end up where I started...I've seen my dad live with the "serial relapser" mindset and towards the end the relapses were more like self-flagellation. It was either collecting sober time or drinking around the clock for days or weeks because he had it burned into his brain by the old AA models that any deviation from lifetime sobriety was failure. He now uses Naltrexone and drinks occasionally something I never thought I'd see him do. The all-or-nothing way of thinking is gone and he is going on a few years sober like it's nothing. YES sober even with those occasional beers. Nobody can convince me that periods of "fuck it I relapsed" near-death drinking interspersed with good 'ol chip-collecting capitol-S Sobriety is somehow better than the life he lives now.
Being on my first real attempt at sobriety I'm going to keep this post hidden for a dark day that may (or may not) come in the future.  But it won't be today for I am not drinking with you all!
Those who keep getting knocked down and get back up are stronger than those who haven't even been knocked down 
I enjoyed your post.  The last time I took a drink was my only real relapse.  I spent a week too drunk to remember and the reason it took a week to get sober was because I couldn't face day one again.  I'm so scared of dealing with day one agian that I know I can never drink again.  Stay strong! 
After years and years of relapses it makes me question one's desire to quit. At some point it just turns into "breaks" or times of not wanting to drink/cant. I'm watching this happen to someone I love for 8 years now. 
Thank you :( ..Day 4 Attempt 82 (or something.... might be 182 who knows actually keeping track wouldn't really help me)
Anyone who's ever come to the realization they're an addict has relapsed many times. I've only relapsed once after asking for help but I decided to stop every damn day until it was time to go home and I picked up another night's worth of drinks again.
Yeah dude! Addiction is extremely tough and I think impossible to fully understand. It can be easy for someone with time to lose the kind of understanding that brought us in in the first place. I've lost it at times. Never feel unwelcome and never forget you're no worse (or better) than anyone.
SW... I love you ! The truth about people who are in recovery is that they walk away from people who relapse as I suspect they fear their own relapse. It is only the ones who are supportive and empathetic that actually "get it" and you are one of the wonderful people... if you ever step inthe rooms and stay a while you will TOTALLY Get where I am coming from ...currently writing from rehab :)))).www.bearjay.com .
It took me 5 years of quitting smoking for a successful quit and I am hoping I can get a successful quit of drinking done in a lot shorter time span (have been trying to quit for about a year now). You are absolutely right and of course the easiest day to get sober is now...I think that every quit attempt has the chance to carry momentum into the next. Unfortunately you can always slip into a worse spot...always. So don't do that. 
I think sometimes people struggling to get sober have the problem that they look at their life as being only from a successful point of sobriety onwards. But if you're sober for a year  slip up for a few days and then become sober again  that first year isn't wasted. The number of days sober is just a number.  It's the life you lived not grasping for a bottle that matters.  
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! So freekin' true.     ..I believe if you have a drink problem you find it hard to quit. So therefore once you try and put down the bottle you are going to relapse at least once. Because if it was that easy to give it up first time really there is no problem. ..I've received a couple of comments (not negative) but not exactly positive and it almost makes you feel like you're not wanted here because you relapse so much. (99% of the time everyone is lovely and supportive) ..Thank you for this   
There are very few among us who woke up one fine day decided that we were never going to drink again and did that...The vast majority of us did the old "in and out" with sobriety for a few years and absolutely knew what booze was doing to us and did it anyway.
Amen and amen. Thank you for this! IWNDWYT.
I really want to give you a hug.
Well said old bean!
Test.
I quit every day for about 3 months. To the point of coming back here every morning and having my star reset..Today I'm at 178 days and I'm glad I didn't give up. It feels like I learned what I needed to learn.
I'm crying as I read this. It seems so simple to just not drink yet here I am on day 3 again. I just want to be normal. I love everyone of you. IWNDWYT 
I would rather feel the pain hurt and endure a thousand "day ones" than allow myself to become comfortable with "one day" any more...Sobriety is a process not a destination. ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
Something I've noticed about relapse is that it has a lot to do with where people are at when they quit.  When I quit I was married had a steady job a stable living situation and supportive friends and family.  Without all that help it would've been way harder to stay off the booze...Honestly people in recovery circles can be extremely judgemental about relapse without stopping to think that maybe sobriety came easy (easier) to them because of external factors.

I need to reset my badge again and that will make 44 times since 2014 I've had to. But I keep trying again. You're not alone friend. We repeats are here for you. IWNDWYT 
This is a great post. I'm glad I finally got sobriety down and I know that at any moment I could relapse so I gotta stay on my toes.
If you're not serious about sobriety you're probably going to relapse.  But you can be as serious and dedicated as they come and still come up short now and then.  So how do you tell which category a person falls into based only on their number of relapses and no personal information?  You can't so stop jumping to conclusions and demeaning people.  Even the people that think sobriety is some sort of short term joke and isn't important...is that funny and deserving of ridicule?  I'm pretty sure we've all been there.  We're the ones who should be understanding and compassionate and willing to help if they decide that actually want it not holding them down with insults and contempt.  "If you want what we have..."  That's not much of an invitation to a person who you're coming across to as a judgemental elitist.
So strange that this is the first post I'm reading on SD since I relapsed this past weekend. Haven't had a drink since Sunday night tho. Gonna have to reset my badge ugh. I've tried to cut back and have gone 20 to 30 days here and there but this was my first shot at really quitting. At least really feeling like I wanted to quit not just take a break...  I honestly didn't really enjoy it (the drinking) that much. Gonna try for a dry December. I hate alcohol. I hate that everyone drinks and it's so looked down upon by my circle to not drink (maybe that's just my perception). It's killing me I know it. It's poison yet I still consume it!!! I wish I could moderate but thinking about it...  it's so all encompassing. It's easier to just be done with it than trying to "meter it out". So I had 4 beers Saturday and 4 beers Sunday. Nothing crazy but just depressed that I couldn't stay quit.  I know I'm not a full blown physically dependent alcoholic but I was drinking more and more. 40 something days was a bit of a reset tho... Ahhh I'm starting to ramble. Apologies. Just trying to get some thoughts out on paper I guess. Can't wait until drinking is the new smoking. Love ya SD peeps.
If you are a  serial relapser  then you are also a  serial recoverer . To relapse a person must first be in recovery. Never stop quitting!
I don't believe for a minute that anyone in this sub who has any substantial amount of time sober didn't relapse more than once.  I tried for years...sometimes I tried harder than others sometimes I didn't try at all.  But I kept trying until I figured it out.  You'll get there too as long as you keep trying.  ...I'm rooting for all y'all.  IWNDWYT 
Amen.
As a relapse I can't seem to get my head around it. I have the thought and I drink. No matter how committed I am. I think some people just end up in the perfect spot or have a certain understanding. All of our addictions go through different pathways and need different mechanisms to keep them at bay. It is true that some of us come here half hearted in the beginning but if you are coming back you have the right intention and will get a foot hold eventually!
I'm that guy. Thanks for this. It helps!
:) Thank you...IWNDWYT
"The only way you can fail is to stop trying."   ...THIS!!
Thank you my friend!!
Well said!
I am on day 11. As a serial relapser thank you. And sometimes you feel much more committed than others.
Try to focus on how many days you didn't drink not the number of times you slipped up. In the past a relapse for me would result in depression and continued drinking afterall "I FAILED I'M USELESS". Now if I ever slip up (which I hope sincerely is never again) my attitude will be "You made it XYZ number of days no reason for you to stop trying yesterday was a mistake learn from it". Out of the past 180 days I drank 20. Not a cause for celebration exactly but a lot better than half a year drunk.
Well put! To hell with those that think they are immune to the serial relapses. Think about  normal  drinkers - they relapse a ton:) IWNDWYT 
There is a subtle (or maybe not so subtle) distinction between relapse and just trouble getting started stopping drinking.  I drank alcoholically for 30 years and tried to stop (and needed to and should have) many times but never considered myself to have relapsed because I never really launched recovery activities.  I couldn't successfully stop drinking I just paused occasionally.  That remained true until I embarked on a recovery path or program.  After doing so I haven't had a drink or drug for a long time and my obsession with using alcohol and drugs has been completely removed...However all I have is a daily reprieve and if I pick up again now after substantial extended sobriety I would consider it to be legitimate relapse.  I know it's a thing but "serial relapser" seems to be a judgey and discouraging label.   When in practical reality difficulties in getting started stopping drinking are the result of the fact that breaking physiological/mental/emotional addictions is very hard.  Even breaking well ingrained habits is super difficult.  Keep trying to take recovery actions and eventually recovery may emerge after which relapse is possible but not required.
thats super lame. I was a serial relapser. But they look at it wrong. The option is to give up or to get up and fight. And if you fall down you either give up or get up and fight. Just cause people fall down doesnt mean they need to give up. 
I needed to read this. I've had a problem for years and managed to sober up for a month and a half and let myself go right back where I started when shit hit the fan. It's getting harder to get myself to stop but this makes me want to try again.  Maybe one day it'll stick for good. 
Maybe I had to go to that place to get to this one. (Eminem - Not Afraid) It took me many tries to get serious about getting sober long term. 
Relapsing and the whole cycle sucks so bad. Sure relapsing isn't the end of the world unless you act like it is but it all just gets so draining. And you get more and more guilt when you let people in and know you're an addict and then you get back into it. Every time I have to tell someone I've relapsed (especially after reasonably long periods of sobriety and improvement) it just sucks. I can see their trust and belief in me just sort of draining away no matter what they say. 
In an interview Sarah Hepola (author of the memoir Blackout-fantastic read!) gave she said  sometimes you have to quit something 100 times to make the 101st time stick.' She's been sober for 8 years. Don't give up! 
Well said. 
Totally agree. Thanks for this post and I'm glad you said something. I love this subreddit so when I read something that's discouraging or insulting it's extra disappointing to me. I will not drink with you today.
I've heard people with years sober share how they feel awkward when relapse is the topic of an AA meeting because they've never relapsed. They managed to come in and stay dry on their first try and feel a bit like they're viewed as not 'real alcoholics' because they don't have the same juicy stories of successive hard bottoms as us serial relapsers...Just goes to show that you can always find a reason to feel like you don't belong...Shame is a weird thing. I don't think I've ever felt more shame than when I've been coming to after a relapse. I get to a place where I don't feel like I can show my face or be honest to another soul on earth. And the thing is that \*nobody\* is asking me to feel that way - all that anyone wants is to see me hear the truth and see me get well. ..Whenever I've snapped out of that shame spiral and gotten back on my feet I look back and try to figure out what all that shame was even about. I never really can. I think it's just part of the human condition that can get particularly nasty with this disease.
I've avoided being a serial relapser by never signing up to be a 'sobernaut'...I'm not interested in badges and I'm not interested in labels...I'm very interested in gaining control of my mind so that I'm able to make informed choices that work for me and for the people around me...I don't know if that's harder than signing up for a program or not - but it's what I'm doing and so far it's working out ok. No regrets here.
This! Thank you. 
Thank you. I needed to hear this.   
I was a serial relapser until I wasn't...took me about 2 years to finally put some "time" together...don't give up...one day at a time and the months and years take care of themselves.  
I'm drinking my fizzy water now (lemon flavored)...  :)   much better than the vodka I used to swill down!  Keep up the good work!
