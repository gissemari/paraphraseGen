So someone else mentioned that term in their post.  I'd never heard of it before.  In a nutshell it describes why our relapses seem to get worse and worse.  You can google it but here's what the first listing showed:..>Kindling due to substance withdrawal refers to the neurological condition which results from repeated withdrawal episodes from sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. Each withdrawal leads to more severe withdrawal symptoms than the previous withdrawal syndrome..Kindling (sedative hypnotic withdrawal) - Wikipedia.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative hypnotic_withdrawal)

Yes "Chronic *Progressive* and Fatal"..
I have definitely experienced kindling. My last relapse I was so shaky weak sick for days. In my recurrent drinking days I was always shaky but it definitely got worse-like can't eat in front of people because my hand is shaking so hard and I have tremors through my body. Crazy that it took me so long to realize why
I've been in a cycle of sobriety followed by relapse for almost 2 years now and this is a very real phenomenon. My first few times it was just shakes and anxiety with some stomach issues. This last time around resulted in auditory hallucinations panic attacks and finally a seizure that landed me in the hospital. It's nothing to play around with for sure and is why no one should attempt going cold turkey. Thankfully I was given medicine to help me detox until I made it into rehab. 
[Information on Kindling is also linked in the withdrawal section of the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_alcohol_withdrawal) - it certainly focused my mind to want to avoid going through withdrawal again. Plus if I gave alcohol an inch I don't know how easily I'd find my resolve again alcohol had its claws in pretty deep.
I'd never heard of that.  Thanks for sharing this.
My last bender was only about a week or so in duration after a period of 7-8 months of being sober.  No big deal right?  Wrong...This time they had to double my diazapam to detox with and they kept me at the detox center for 9 days.  Even now being a month since my last drink I still feel the fog.
