I think I chose the wrong month to quit. Well not "wrong"...hardest!..On the other hand if I can get through this till gone 1st January it should be all down hill from there on. Next bump in the road will be my 40th a few days later. I just need to focus on being fitter slimmer and having a bit more cash in my pocket for the summer months I guess. If I can do this you guys can too. IWNDWYT.

Keep going!!! IWNDWYT 
I hear you. For me this is also the greatest time to pull the trigger. Family friends and finally I will be taken care of. It's a beautiful present just for me. It's been a good decade of buzzed to sloshed holidays. This year though. It's just me. I'm here. Remembering the tiny moments actually laughing really taking time out for everyone. I know not everyone has the blessing of family and friends and I am finished being ungrateful to them by not allowing myself to finally be the true sober me. I deserve this gift as do they and having it to share with them just puts the icing on that cake. Hope you had a Merry Christmas! I'm off to my sober slumber.
