I hit 6 months the other day and I just went back and read my post from the day after the last night that I drank. It makes me cry. Thinking of how I felt back then. How much I've been through since then and how much happier I am. Life is still hard but it's so much more manageable. I enjoy life and I'm learning so much about myself. I've left a lot behind - people negativity old habits etc. I don't know what else to say I just wanted to share my joy I guess for those that are still struggling. It can get better you just have to let it. IWNDWYT.

I recently went back in SD time too it's a beautiful thing how stopping drinking has taken us so far from those days.  I hear you!  Congratulations on 6 months of Freedom    
I just read you recent post at one year sober. You have come such a long way from that day 1. Happy for you!
