Currently watching this Scottish film about heroin junkies - substance struggle seems quite uniform across the spectrum of substances emotionally at least.  Thoughts?

There was a character in the novel very anti-drug  who became an alcoholic too but I don't think a lot of time was spent on that guy...The whole "I'm getting clean! Better go get high first" logic that Rent Boy employs does seem familiar....I've for sure thought gotta get my head together and do something about this I need a drink first....
