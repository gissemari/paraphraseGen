Hi everyone -..I recently relapsed on alcohol after running out of my benzo script a few days early (I'm agoraphobic and have suffered from debilitating anxiety since puberty.) I'd been sober from alcohol for about 6 months beforehand. I was taking 1-2mg of xanax and about 1.5mg of Ativan daily and suffered terrifying withdrawals when I ran out. I decided to spend the weekend drinking thinking that once Monday came I could call my doctor for a refill. At first I tried to limit the amount to about 5 drinks per day but my alcoholic brain convinced me to drink as much as I wanted - "I may as well be comfortable while I wait." But the weekend dragged into Monday (my doctor wasn't in) Tuesday (my pharmacy was out of my prescription) and Wednesday (after telling me all day that my prescription would be delivered to the pharmacy soon they told me it was still out.) Throughout which time I was having about 15 drinks per day...Finally on Thursday I have my prescription for 30 1mg Ativan with one (non time-specific) refill. I'm not recieving the xanax script anymore. I had to take two today already to quell my terrible anxiety and shakiness (I quit drinking immediately) I'm still having WD symptoms and the day is only half over. How do I set up a taper schedule so that I can slowly reduce my dosage and have enough to last 1+ month? Who knows if my prescription will take days to fill next month. I can live through the psychological aspect of withdrawal but want to be sure I'm taking enough to prevent having a seizure. If anyone has resources I could use on safe tapering I'd appreciate it.

We can't give medical advice here. You really need to talk to your doctor and be honest about your alcohol consumption.
