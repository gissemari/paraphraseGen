I saw a few people this morning who lapsed out and today was their first meeting in weeks/months. I was out for nearly 7 months myself. Coming back was hard and it somehow felt even harder when coming back to a familiar group. I imagine that it feels even harder than that when many people look up to you. After I made up my mind and came back everyone was so supportive and genuinely excited to see me. ..I hope that Tom comes back around sooner than later. I hope the same for anyone else who can relate.
