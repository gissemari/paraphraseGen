Didn't have much of an appetite the first two-three days but it's come back full fold now. I can't stop eating. I am still pretty restless and I really struggled to not be bored this weekend. That being said it wasn't that bad. Overall I am starting to feel better...I went to two meetings with an open mind. I have gone to AA before but I just can't get into it. The first step makes sense to me but as soon as God comes into it I kind of tune out.  A lot of people spoke about things I completely could relate to and how they planned on getting through them (not drinking). That part I did like. I am going to go back but I don't think I am going to go everyday. I am going to find a group I like two or three nights a week and go to them...Overall my mood is up I have been eating pretty well (minus the sweets) and exercising a little bit.  Thanks SD for all of your suggestions stories and most of all for being here. I'll keep lurking.

Congrats. All you need to worry about today is not drinking if you don't want to. AA can be a useful tool i just don't personally agree with the idea that a 'slip' puts you back at square one with all the implied doom and gloom that I think contributes to major 'what the fuck' drinking and using. At least that's been my experience. I still keep in touch with long time AA friends but I am not an active member. 
That's awesome! Open minded exploration of your options and working some self care. Keep at it and you'll be feeling right as rain in no time. I allowed myself to sit in a disconnected funk for too long.
