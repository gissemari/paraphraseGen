I've never posted on here but I'm hoping this will help somehow. I have been drinking since I was 19 I'm 21 now...It started off with me being a fun drunk.. then I turned into an overly emotional dramatic drunk. Ultimately it ruined my relationship...My ex of a few months broke up with me about a week ago and I'm in so much pain. Basically he lost feelings because of all the arguments we were having (mostly when I/he was drunk). I was even drunk when he broke up with me...I rarely drink to the point where I puke but I like to be buzzed.. all the time. And now that I'm going through heartbreak it has been one of the hardest things not to drink. I have vodka at home and every time I get sad I want to just numb it. I'm really struggling but so far its been about 6 days sober. I'm trying to go for 30 days but I know I probably won't last because of spring break coming up and what not...Any advice from people that emotionally drink?

I got rid of all alcohol in my possession when I quit returned the bottles and everything. If you know you're an emotional drinker to start but drink to feel nothing try to access the root. Heartbreak is never easy I've had binges after failed relationships but I realized I couldn't *break up* with myself. Good or Bad I'm still here and I got tired of disappointing myself. 
As u/doubleGGboobs said I'd get rid of the alcohol home for sure. There are a total of zero scenarios where booze readily available helps when you have a drinking problem...6 days is a great start! Tomorrow will be 7 thats a whole week! A week becomes 2 then 3. You're on the right path :). ..Break ups are hard. I know drinking made my heart problems worse in the past. Best of luck you can do this!.
