I don't know exactly what it is but as I get closer to hitting this milestone the cravings for a drink are stronger...It could be me feeling excited and wanting to celebrate. I used to celebrate with alcohol... But it wouldn't be a celebration. It would be a failure...I am not going to drink but I am sure going to struggle until I pass day 100. I believe the cravings will pass once this becomes just any other day.

Buy tickets to see go to the theatre or plan a hike for around that time. Give yourself something else to look forward to in the same time frame. You may retrain your brain to be excited for tickets instead. the reward will be going to something fun and healthy.
It will. Approaching a milestone is often hard. You might not get the enjoyment and pride you anticipate till you see 100 in the past but you will then.
I experienced this too!  And then again at the one year mark.  I don't think I'm going to "celebrate" any more milestones.
I don't know why 2 little days can make such a difference...but somehow seeing 3 digits seems bigger than a star with a 4 in it. I'm just rolling with it. ..I will not drink with y'all today.    within  
I am coming up to 100 too and am going to celebrate by buying some new speakers. I am also consciously planning what I want to do differently in the next 100 days (seriously reduce sugar intake) so that I have a next phase plan to keep me targeted.
