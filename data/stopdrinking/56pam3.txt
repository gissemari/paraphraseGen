I honestly say this weekend was awful. I struggle with personal problems (in therapy because of them) and I must say I gave up yesterday. I gave up on myself and fucked up. It was like taking three steps backwards in personal growth. Well everyone on SD know the feeling after relapse... Yesterday I relapsed into old habits emotionally and because of this I feel like crap...I also feel a lot of sadness and regret which doesn't help at all. I especially miss the people I lost due to my fucked up behaviors related and unrelated to drinking. Friends lovers. Family members. ..ALthough I feel sad and stuck there is a silver lining. There is something which I'm proud of. I stayed sober and I didn't smoke. I went to the cinema so I kept a promise made to myself! I honestly wanted to give up on this too. But I promised myself and I did that. And I knitted myself half of a glove. That's three succesess. And almost 21 days.

Not smoking or drinking is huge.  Nearly 3 weeks - Congrats!!!
That's a great achievement in my book.  What movie did you see?  ..I've made the commitment to go to a movie instead of drinking in the past and haven't even been successful.  Glad it works for you  though!
