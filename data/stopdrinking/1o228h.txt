**Triumph**: I did a century ride (100 miles) over the weekend.  I'm still kind of recovering from it.  I'm still unusually sore and tired.  But it seems to be getting better.  Yay me!..Funny: my therapist asked why I didn't type up a post about my ride and share it here.  I said that it didn't feel like a recovery-related event.  I think that's a huge step forward.  In the beginning everything was recovery related.  I'd think about how I'm doing *this* because I don't drink anymore.  But now they're just accomplishments.  Feels like progress...**Struggle**: I've just been tired.  See above...**General Chat**: FUCK DALLAS!
Triumph:  Made it to 100 days today.  I took the day off yesterday to golf and felt great the whole time.  I was hardly tired at all afterwards. I'm exercising regularly now and it's paying off.  I'm an older guy so this is a big deal for me.  I haven't felt this good physically in years.  .Struggle:  Dealing head on with some of the issues that I used alcohol to suppress or dull or forget about.  Difficult but at least now I'm dealing with them in a healthy manner. 
Triumph: **I AM FINALLY DONE WITH ALL MY LEGAL ISSUES** AND I FOUND A SUSTANIAL JOB AND START WORK TODAY. On top of that I moved and i'm settling in nice.    .Struggle: After all the success lately I have an uneasy feeling like someone will snatch if from me. I am not use to hard work and persistence paying off (probably b/c I never done it as long as I am now.)    .General Chat: (football) I'm torn with my Ohio state Buckeyes. I don't want use to loose but statically we will do better in the overall season if we don't carry the nations longest winning streak past week6 but now its week 7 so it is too late we have to keep winning. 
Triumph: I was surprised to see a 50 next to my handle yesterday.  Time felt like it was moving very slowly for a while.  But feels like the pace has picked back up recently.  ..Struggle:  Like ComedyVolunteer I'm also focusing on weight loss.  Dropped 25 without trying then stalled.  Started /r/keto two weeks ago and just starting to feel like it is working.  At the very least it has given me something else to focus on...General:  I wish the gov't would get its act together.  I've gotten into canoeing and kayaking recently and the river accesses (national parks) are closed.  Minor gripe compared to the folks more seriously impacted I know.
Triumph: I've been symptom free from anorexia and bulimia for 4 months. It's so intricately tied to my self worth. Last night I became paralyzed with fear that I couldn't leave the house or eat anymore because I was too "fat." I said some things out of anger but managed to use my coping mechanisms and positive self talk to get me into a better head space. ..I know it doesn't seem like a big triumph but leaning on eating and starving and emotional eating really weighs (ha) on my ego and it's very hard to walk away from. ..Struggle: Yesterday i ran out of milk. It wasn't fun...General chat: Someone in my fantasy (not SD) requested a trade. Wanted Peyton for Aaron Rodgers. HA!

200 days without alcohol.  I've been back to the gym for the past 6 weeks.  Things are looking up.  Thanks again to you guys on this sub for all the support.  You've saved me.
Triumph: Looking at my badge makes me smile..Struggle: Can't decide if I want to try moderation..General chat: My cat's breath smells like cat food.
**Triumph:** I haven't had a drink since Monday. This has been the longest I've gone without a drink for a long long time. I've sought out medical support (medication) and have the opportunity to see an addictions counsellor this week. ..**Struggle:** I haven't had a drink since Monday. Almost all of my social events and interactions revolve around alcohol and I can already tell this is going to be an incredibly big challenge for me. I'm only in my mid twenties and my closest friends are all coming together for a holiday over New Years and the itinerary we have set up already has things like "hangover days" and "blackout drunk night" written into it. It makes me anxious about not only the coming days but also about my future. ..**General Chat:** What did you guys do when first quitting to deal with replacing social activities that used to center around alcohol? I know "get hobbies" may seem like the obvious answer but as a grad student I've pretty much devoted myself to academics for my entire life (and as of the last year or two alcohol). I never played sports as a child or enjoyed playing instruments and I am certainly not artistic. In many ways I just feel at a loss because I don't know what to do - all AA and SMART meetings are too far away for me to attend or clash with school. I honestly feel like I have never really had a strong commitment to a hobby before so I can't get "back into something you used to do" which is often suggested around here. 
Struggle: I'm pretty hungover. I was doing really well. I had only about four beers in the two months I really felt good. Healthy wealthy and in control. But my birthday started creeping up and it really started getting me back into my old habits. 
Ive been in a job that pays enough that i can actually live off of my salary and have spending money. Im very thankful to be sober! 
Triumph: Successfully handled a confrontation with someone who's involved with one of my hobby groups. I put my objections right out there without stewing about it and I think that we've got things resolved. ..Struggle: That having been said I was still kind of angry afterwards. Luckily I had a nice long bike ride home to burn off most of that...General chat: Never got into the GTA franchise myself although I like this [MC Hawking song](http://youtu.be/JykGi0oeLi8) a lot. I'm still mostly a Mass Effect fan although I have started getting into Dragon Age and will probably pick up Saints Row IV when the price drops.
Haven't had these cravings since last time I relapsed yesterday I heard myself asking for a cigarette and I've been taking a peek at the spirits in the freezer. I'm a bit better this evening though alsough my dry-drunk period is starting to wear me down
Triumph: Had a great 19th anniversary yesterday with both of us sober!..Struggle: Trying to deal with a lot of family issues cross-country. My mom is having health problems and a barrel-load of other trials and much of my energy these days is consumed with trying to keep her focused and positive. I used to accompany most of our conversations with a very large glass of wine and I still miss it when I have to pick up the phone...General chat: I'm taking a fencing class so that's pretty cool.
Triumph: I just booked a two-and-a-half-week-long trip to Buenos Aires including a week of intensive Spanish classes there! Other things on my provisional program are visiting the [Iguacu Falls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguazu_Falls) and travelling around in Uruguay for a bit. It's my first holiday alone so that's pretty scary/exciting/new for me. The planned trip to Namibia this summer fell through because my ex broke up with me; that won't happen this time at least!..I (finally) put up the curtains in my new apartment which is also quite a victory as I used to think I had two left hands :-) Preconceptions boo!..Struggle: I sorta-kinda signed up for a running clinic but training three times a week from a cold start is a bit too much too fast for me. Maybe in spring again? In the meantime I'll keep on biking to work and going to yoga that's also exercise...General: From Friday to Sunday I'm going on company trip to Bruges. The weather forecasts don't look too good but I've arranged an adhoc support network (including help to **pre-emptively** empty the minibar).
Hey there I'm new here! ..Triumph: I guess my triumph this week is deciding that I need to stop drinking and signing up here. I've tried before but didn't have much for accountability. I'm hoping this place helps. You all seem very friendly and helpful and I like that. I haven't had a temptation yet and that feels good too. I'm hoping this will be easier for me than I'm making it out to be in my mind!..Struggle: Well I decided to stop drinking! hehe. I'm just a bit nervous already on what to tell people because most of my friends drink quite a bit and being in my early 20's means a lot of my social interaction is centered around drinking. I'm not so much worried about having things to do (I have plenty of hobbies and books to keep me busy forever!) but more about how to resist once I really do get an urge to hang out and "party" with my friends. I'm nervous they won't understand (my good friends will understand the more 'acquaintance' type friends might not) or will question me about it too much. I have a hard time wanting to admit to anyone that I have enough of a problem that I want to stop drinking all together and I'm afraid they'll want to push past my excuses. Especially with Halloween coming up I know there will be a time very very soon that all I want to do is get trashed with my friends! I'm kind of scared! And so far my bf is being extremely supportive but I'm so scared that the second he let's up that I might fail which is way way too much pressure to put on him. It's not that I would blame him either but he just wants me happy and if I'm sad I can't have a drink he may offer me one and then it'll be even more hard to resist. Idk. I also feel sad that there's just this big part of life that (at least for a while) I can't participate in. I feel sad that I can't control myself and it's come to this. There's just a lot to think about and a lot to process. I guess I'm also still pretty upset at myself for getting so out of hand this weekend (part of what made me realize now is the time to really quit. That I need to and have to.) and I just hope everything works out. I'm so nervous. ..General: My bf just got me animal crossing! And I'm having a blast making Halloween crafties and decorating! I love Halloween! Anywho I look forward to having a community to come to if I need. Maybe this will be a nice place to make a friend or two as well. :)
Triumph: it's fall break.  The kids and I have been chillaxing with steadfast dedication...Struggle:  meh.  I'm doing alright...General chat: next weekend I'm doing a 200 mile relay with 11 others.  I'm dreading the logistics but I know it will be fun.
**Triumph:** Ran Portland marathon last weekend and did well. No hurt and a beautiful day. ..**Struggle:** Learned that following through on a stated intention can make shit real fast; and then the game changes and is confusing again. ..**Chat:** JimBeamsHusband talks about it--how an accomplishment that seems not really stop-drinking-related is all about recovery. I've shed tears three times in the last 20 years that I can recall. One was at the birth of my son after complications. One was last year after my first marathon. The third was on Sunday. Somehow this is all related and I am grateful and humbled to be here. 
[Uh oh!  Guess what day it is.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWBhP0EQ1lA)
Triumph:  Back from vacation and settled back into work life.  ..Struggle:  The restaurant is closing for a major renovation/rebranding after the Christmas season.  Result is I am off work for 6-8 weeks in January and February.  I feel like this is a big time for me to make a huge decision on my future.  Either stay in the restaurants and make a career of it in management or get out and use the degree.  I may be 38 but I feel like a 16 year old making a decision about my future.  That said I know I have a set of tools to help me make the decision and people in my life to support me and help me both make my decision and go forward...General Chat: Thanksgiving weekend this weekend so being a very corporate restaurant (ie the majority of our traffic is business lunches/dinners) we will be slow so I get a 4 day weekend.  Going to see the movie Rush maybe Laidback Luke and have been invited to a Thanksgiving dinner with a co-worker and some friends.  Gonna be busy but good.
Triumph: I felt like a kickass boss today. I've always received positive feedback from my staff which is nice. But now that I have my anxiety and depression under control I feel *confident* and that is definitely showing in my work. I think I'm much better at giving direction and feedback now. ..Struggle: keeping my diet and fitness under control! I keep losing weight very slowly thanks to no booze calories but I've let too much sugar creep back into my diet. I've also been driving to work instead of biking. Time to nip that in the bud before I get lazier...General chat: It's the end of gardening season and I'm sad! I hope to get a few more tomatoes and peppers before the weather turns too cold. I'll miss fresh herbs the most. My cats decimate anything I try to bring inside.
Resetting again -- keep stumbling at 7-8 days.  I'm going to redouble my efforts and start actually attending meetings.  You guys are a big inspiration to me!
Triumph: 2 weeks today! That's my longest sober period in almost 4 years! I feel great and I've been more focused without alcohol. Much more productive with my schoolwork. ..Also GTA V has been consuming some of my time too!
Triumph: Have remained sober despite brutal relapse a few days back. Trying to forgive myself have gotten back on antidepressants noticing slight difference in overall mood...Struggle: Still haven't forgiven myself still have 2 months till graduation.
**Triumph:** I hit 100 days sober!!!! In honor of being sober 100 days I deadlifted 100 pounds at the gym. feelsgoodman.jpg...**Struggle:** Struggling with finding a new job and beating myself up over having a pathetic resume. I have been avoiding writing this resume because my lack of skills. ...**General chat:** I'm finding passions and hobbies in life and it feels amazing!!! I am glad I stuck with sobriety.
