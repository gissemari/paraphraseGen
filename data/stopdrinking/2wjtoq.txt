It means as much to me as it does my family to have made it 1 whole year with a perfect score. On the night before I quit my wife took the kids and left because once again I was yelling at the dinner table. I was drinking bottom shelf spirits from anywhere I could find it. The bottles had been hidden in couches under my truck seat even in my bag I took to work sometimes. There were days I would take a swig in the parking lot right before I went into the office. When she left that night I laid in bed wondering how it came to this and why I'm doing it even if I'm no longer enjoying myself. I realized right then that it would be worse to keep going the way I had been. I had been weighing what I'd rather do for so many years every day....I would think in my mind that it would suck more if I didn't have a bottle handy to sip on and relax from a long day. But now I truly wanted my wife and kids back and to be able to "enjoy" something again. I threw my bottle in the trash laid back in bed and cried thinking of them. When she called the next day I told her I was done and I needed her help. I admitted I was an alcoholic (which I had never done before I'd always fought against believing it). When she came back I was on the road to recovery. It may be cliche to say it but it really was hard at first. I was so temperamental I was a pissy crab ass. I was able to get Gabapentin from my doctor. That really helped curve the withdrawals. I took that for about a month and will admit my coffee addiction has never been worse lol but it's been manageable and I'm less of a crab now ;). I know I will never drink again but I also know that I will always be an alcoholic. ..I honestly believe that what really changed from any other time I "tried" to quit was that I finally broke through denial and realized that I had a problem. When my inner voice said that I am no longer living any life worth living simply BECAUSE I continue to drink alcohol I knew that it was easy to fix my life. It was as simple as admitting it to my wife and asking for her help. It used to annoy me to think of her being right. When I accepted her truth about the matter and appreciated her care and love to make me whole again I had saved myself. I told her recently that if she hadn't left that night I may not have quit. I always ended up staying mad when she was home and somehow being alone and having her really leave snapped me out of the sickness of denial. ..I hope this wasn't too boring and drawn out. I just wanted to tell my story since I've sort of been a lurker up till now. Some of my family and my best friend know about my problem and I've had support from them. I was lucky I guess that I didn't have to drop any friends because I was a lonely drinker and wasn't very social to begin with. My wife and I have talked about that subject and how we both realize that an alcoholic can't keep alcholic friends if they continue to drink. It just can't happen. You have to cut it from your life. I can handle someone having a beer around me that's not what I'm saying. I will say though that if you're struggling to quit admitting it out loud to someone that you have a problem and need help is a really good step and most people that care about you will support you. The worst thing you can do is not get help. I was able to quit by making the decision myself but the support around me by my wife helped me through the decision. Take it as a flashlight in a dark tunnel. You have to walk with your own two legs to get out of the tunnel but the flashlight helps you see so you can walk easier. Nice analogy huh? Ok I'm done. Good luck everyone I'm proud of all of you because I know the strength it takes to go through every day with a sober head. Life is never easy but when we live sober we're seeing clearer and making better decisions for ourselves and loved ones. Carry on. .Love you K...

Nice work! 1 day behind you. Though our stories are quite different they all tie together. We all do better when we seek the help we know we need and let others show us how it can be done. Life is infinitely better than it was a year ago today.
Thanks for sharing this. I love the idea of being sober for every single day on a calendar year.  Congratulations!

Great story thanks for sharing!
Not too boring or drawn out at all. I can totally relate to the denial you describe. I hope I never forget the day I finally asked for help because I don't want to go through the events that led up to it ever again. ...Congratulations on a year. I am so happy for you and I am happy for your family.
