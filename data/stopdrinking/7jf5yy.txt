is a lot better than shaking a beer belly itself.  ..Losing weight is one (of several) reasons I decided to stop drinking and it's starting to happen!  Two people commented to me yesterday and today that I looked like I've dropped weight.  20 pounds in 50 days.   ..Not drinking 35+ IPAs per week will help do that.  7000 calories per week 28000 calories per month 336000 calories per year.  Empty calories: the cornerstone of a healthy diet.  IPAs are high ABV so I was clearing way over 50 units of alcohol per week.  Hello hypertension and other health concerns.  What was I thinking?  Why would I inflict so much damage to my own health?  If alcohol did that to me on the outside I can only imagine what it was doing to me on the inside.   ..Yet it's not been easy for me to stop.  It's been a two year struggle actually where I go in cycles and toy with "moderation."  Invariably I went straight back to terrible habits which kept me in a loop of self-loathing...This time I have committed to abstinence and I am completely at ease with that decision.  I feel far more confident during this attempt to stay sober specifically because I know moderation is simply not an option for me.  I have unplugged my personal bullcrap-ulator that tells me I can drink "a little".  ..Santa might like being a plump jolly old elf but I dont so I will not drink with you today.
