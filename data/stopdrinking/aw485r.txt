As Homer Simpson once said "self improvement has always been a passion of mine" and it is for me as well. February was my first full month not drinking and here are the results it had physically and financially:..&amp;#x200B;..||November|December|January|February|.|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|.|Weight Loss/Gain (lbs)|\+3.2|\-1.4|\+3|\-6.4|.|Avg Calories Consumed per day||2205|2126|1569|.|Dining Out Spending|$346.06|$199.29|$277.48|$92.62|..&amp;#x200B;..All of my alcohol purchases are logged as "Dining Out" because I only drank when I was out with friends. Not only did I save money not buying alcohol but I had more self control and cut back on the amount of food I was eating when going out. Also February wasn't lower because I stayed at home. I still attended every birthday party and friend gathering I was invited to. ..What have I learned? I really really enjoy losing weight AND saving money at the same time. I feel like I've been given a jump start on hitting my goals for the year. I turn 40 at the end of this year and I want to get into the healthy BMI range by then. I only have 20 lbs to go. I'm surprised at how much energy I have every day not just the days after a party. I don't miss hangovers and can actually do things on Saturday/Sunday morning now. ..What did I miss out on not drinking? I still hung out with my friends like I would have anyway. I missed the taste of IPAs I used to love and that buzz. However that buzz is fleeting. I don't gain anything long term from it except for regret and shame. ..I hope this somehow helps anyone struggling with temptation. If you list out all the pros and cons of not drinking it really helps put things in perspective. IWNDWYT

Well said.  Congrats to you and thanks for sharing. ..I'm a couple of days away from 90 and my life has transformed entirely.  I have HUNDREDS of dollars per month to save or spend on tools gear and toys that will bring me enjoyment for years to come.  I've lost 15 pounds and 5 1/2  off my waist. I have energy and ambition to workout regularly and do all sorts of projects I'd previously neglected.  I've picked up old hobbies again and enjoy my now plentiful free time. I wake up every single day feeling rested and having no guilt or shame.  ..The only trade off that I occasionally miss is like you said the taste of the poison occasionally and a fleeting buzz that leads to self destruction.  ..That's a fair trade in my book.
To self improvement! I will not drink with you today :)
Congrats on 30 days and thanks for sharing! IWNDWYT  
I thought I was the only idiot that keeps odd data. I am addicted to stats. Latest is I ate meals out 52x in 112 days of sobriety. That is 52 of 336 meals. When drinking it would have been closer to 200x. I have lost 47.4 lbs.  I think these exercises help keep me sober. Hope it does for you also..
Numbers dont lie!!!.Iwndwyt
