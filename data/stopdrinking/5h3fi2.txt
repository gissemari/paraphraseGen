Long time lurker occasional poster repeat relapser here. I've spent the last year or so drinking my life away during my late twenties which should arguably be the best time of your life. I do it because it makes me feel better about being alone and really the times when I'm most concerned about my drinking habit are when I'm chugging beers or pounding half and half mixed drinks from midnight to 6am. I can have beers with friends and be just fine but if the night ends early or I just feel like keeping the drunk going I'll stop by a gas station and buy four or eight 16oz beers. I'll wake up feeling like shit the next day (unless I spend 12 hours in bed and even then) and because I feel like shit I'll want to keep drinking to make me feel less like shit. I've pretty much been doing that for the last 6 months. Every day every night drink drink drink pass out...I hate this stupid fucking spiral. I know it's ridiculous to drink 8 or 10 or 16 beers in one night. I wouldn't even drink that much water in a day so why would I do that to my stomach and my liver? Come on man. Anyway if you read this thanks for putting up with the ramble. I made a promise to one of my best friends last Saturday that I was going to get on the right track and since then I relapsed once (although not to binge levels just 3 beers) but I still felt bad about it. Last night I was really really feeling like following that old path through my brain of "Well I'm lonely and unhappy right now and drinking will make me forget that for a while so might as well just do it" but instead I packed a gym bag and hit that motherfucker hard. I WILL WIN THIS BATTLE AGAINST MYSELF. FUCK YOU DUNE YOU'RE GOING TO BEAT YOUR OWN HEAD...Here's a u/poem_for_your_sprog that may fit for some of us in this sub. Thanks for reading...A blissful brew; a taste or two;  .A drop; a drink-delight;  .A drip; a nip; a savored sip -  .Will keep you feeling right.  ..A pint or two is fine for you  .And sweet to sup a spell -  .A glass of wine is quite divine  .And really just as swell!  ..But three and four and much and more  .Beyond's a drunken haze -  .And large amounts by all accounts  .Will fuck you up for days.

Hang in there! Also a long time lurker and relapser. The last time was the last for me though! Find yourself a GOOD support system. Maybe a few new friends who don't drink. Not saying you have to ditch your old ones but I know how tempting it can be to give in when everyone around you is indulging. Best of luck!!
I never made it longer than a month until I stopped seeing it as a battle against myself. I had to learn to work with myself and the twisted alcoholic recesses mind to be gentle with myself and let myself be what I am. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy was the system I learned. I took it for anger and anxiety but it works for every kind of "unwanted private event."..Once I stopped fighting myself and let go of the battle mentality (paradoxically?) I started to win in the struggle against drinking. I know you can win yours too.
When I was overcome by the realization that I was fighting against myself that I was self-inflicting this this song helped me a lot...Don't disturb..The beast..The temperamental goat..The snail while he's feeding on..The Rose..**Stay frozen compromise**..**What I will**..**I am**..Bend around..The wind silently..Thrown about..Again I'm treading so..Soft and lightly..**Compromising my will**..**I am**..I am..I will..So no longer..Will I..Lay down..Play dead..Play your doe..In the headlights locked down..And terrified..Your deer in the headlights..Shot down and horrified when..**Push comes to pull comes to shove**..**Comes to step around this**..**Self-destructing dance that never**..**Would've ended 'til I**..**Rose**..**I roared aloud here**..**I will**..**I am**...I am..I will..So no longer..Will I..Lay down..Lay dead..Play this..Kneel down..Gun-shy martyr..Pitiful..I rose I roared..I will..I am..(I thought it was "I am MY will" and I think I like it better that way)...A Perfect Circle - Rose Lyrics
