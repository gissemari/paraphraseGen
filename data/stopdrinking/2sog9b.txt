My small feat of courage was to tell and accept to my sister who wasn't ready to accept that I am an alcoholic and may still be for a while. Not to juice any muscles but I want to acknowledge that I can finally accept who I am not to declare I will stop drinking but to accept who I am given how it has destroyed my life so far. I know I will have my relapses as I have only accepted who I am recently but I really do want to stop and I want to find the better life as I have lost everything. Some people may come here as lurkers' sanctuary but I am only here for answers and support and I hope I can at least get the support now that I have been so upfront and maybe a few answers. And I do promise that if I ever become sober I will be here for you to discover your answers...I am a very internet shy person as I have mentioned about; even if I give you my real name you won't find too much about me. Below was my confession. I poured the rest of that bottle into the sink because I got the courage to speak here..So I hope you lurkers out there like who I was and still am you would do the same and speak out as that is all the change you need no matter how temporary it may be...My confession to myself:.http://redd.it/2snvtg
