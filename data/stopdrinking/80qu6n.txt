Quitting has been one of the best decisions I've made. I'm starting a better new job Monday. My 8 year-old son told me he's happy I don't drink anymore (I may have teared up a little). My wife is happier and is able to focus more on her growing business. Her and I haven't been fighting anymore.  I don't wake up with hangovers anymore. I can drive whenever the fuck I want. I have energy again I've been going on walks with my family. My head feels clear i feel like I can think quicker better. My daughter isn't going to have to see me at my worst. I'm finally gaining weight. I was able to quit smoking without the "got to smoke when drinking" excuse. Everybody around me is proud of me. ..The list goes on but y'all get the point. ..I just wanted to drop by and say how relieved I am. Anybody who is struggling just hang in there.
