That is how much I have saved in 60 days of sobriety simply by deciding not to drink each day. My drinking habit was about 4 beers per night which meant I was buying a six-pack every day even if I didn't finish it. Where I live (NYC) a six pack of beer comes to $13.15 after tax and bottle deposit...Shortly after I quit drinking I set up a daily auto-deposit with my bank. It transfers $13.15 from my checking account to my savings account at midnight each night. 60 days later I have a beautiful shiny balance of $789 in that special savings account. And that's just two months-- you do the math on where I'll be after a year...This tactic has been huge for me and if you're struggling with the commitment I'd encourage you to set up something similar. It's a tangible reward for your new lifestyle much like your badge here at /r/stopdrinking...As for my overall progress I'm doing great. I've taken a step back from this community because I've found that reading the stories here is the only time I ever think about alcohol. I haven't had a craving in 3+ weeks and have spent plenty of time around alcohol and in trigger situations (company happy hours family vacation going away parties at bars). My physical fitness is insane...I had basically given up on the notion that my body could ever look this good again. I've replaced my daily after-work beer with a big protein shake and I make a B-line to the gym from there. I've packed on about 5 pounds of muscle and I have legit movie star sixpack abs for the first time in my life. Fuck yeah. My blood pressure is way down my bloodwork at my last checkup was clean as a whistle and my face looks younger...In closing it's worth it. If you're on the fence it's worth it. It's worth the painful withdrawal. It's worth the uncomfortable conversations with your doctor. It's worth the isolation you feel for the first few weeks. It gets better much better lightyears better and if I of all people can do it then you definitely can too. ..Big thanks to this community for all the support. I don't know if you saved my life but you helped me save mine.

Congratulations.  It sounds like things are going really well for you.  Keep it up movie star!
Congrats!!! I can't WAIT for my finances to improve. ..You're an inspiration :)
Very very good progress man and it gives me hope. Cheers!!
Amazing isn't it?
well done! Thank you for posting!
Sometimes a post makes me want to say "Thank you Jesus!" even though I'm an atheist! *-)
Genuine question from someone who's sitting on the fence trying to decide whether to go full-sober.....I understand being a heavy alcoholic and drinking 15+ beers or most of a bottle of liquor every night and *that* becoming expensive. But for the people like myself (and OP apparently) that only had 3-5 on the weeknights (*if* I drink on that weeknight) why not just buy a 30pack? I mean it's a hell of a lot cheaper. I guess everyone has their taste preferences but $15/night just seems crazy if you're drinking less than a 6-pack. ..I'm not trolling or trying to derail the conversation honestly. I've considered sobriety but I'm one of those who can drink in moderation so it's not as much of a health risk as drinking a bottle a night so on so forth. I don't drink every night and some nights I have just one or two. ..I might subconsciously be looking for motivation to quit or at least give it a try for a month or something. Maybe I should have made this a self post! Anyway I still enjoy reading everyone's stories as I contemplate how I want to move forward with my life.

I had a baseline consumption of about 4-6 a day too (4 EUR here in the Netherlands) and if you figure in the weekends and bars I reckon I've just about earned back the fees for my Spanish classes (which aren't even halfway through!). The savings of the next two months are going to go toward my holiday in Argentina and Uruguay :-)..I used to have the unshakeable belief that I don't like sports of any kind but then again I also thought I could never stop drinking. So I'm doing (very light) yoga twice a week and am thinking of doing a running clinic :-)
Even more of a reason to stop. Math.
I'm also at 60 days and feeling just better and better each week. I've been saving so much money that I can use some of it to buy new indie games for myself and not feel bad about it. I realize I used to skimp on absolutely everything so I could save money for more alcohol and now I can do all sorts of other fun things! Last night I was at a happy hour with colleagues and while they all were paying up on their $50+ tabs I was leaving cash for the $5 fancy ginger beer I sipped all evening. It felt great! Keep it up 60 days buddy! :)
Don't forget what you are saving on drunk food drunk online shopping and don't forget the bar/night club.
I was drinking  around 3 bottles of wodka each week + ~15 beers.  I am now sober for 324 days/46 weeks...3 * 46 = 138 (2070  = $2800)  .15 * 46 = 690 (1035  = $1400) &lt;&lt;exactly the half funny...3100  ($4200)...Expensive self destruction... ...Edit: ..Wodka kcal: 1liter = 2150kcal. (138 * 0.7) * 2150kcal = **208.500 kcal**!!!..Beer kcal: 1 liter = 430kcal. (690 * 0.5) * 430 kcal = **148.350 kcal** !!!..All together: **356.850 kcal** = 709 big macs = walking 4.200 km (2600 miles).
A year will stack up to the amount of a DUI.  Comparison for comparison's sake.
Awesome! That's a lot of money!  And a lot of sobriety!  I've been sober almost that long....where are my abs....???? Just kidding I've lost weight too!!  :).
Got to love saving money!  I got to say though I saved that much in the first week or two of sobriety.  I had a very bad spending habit at bars and on drugs.  I've likely saved several thousand dollars already and i've only been sober for twenty-six days!.
High-five!
This post is pure awesome.  Thanks! Second last paragraph really stood out for me.  Time to get off the fence. .
