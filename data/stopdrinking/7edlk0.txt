Warning: This post may be about nothing...I'm feeling particularly down right now. For most of the day I was okay. It was a normal day as far as I can tell. I went to my 9-5 job that I get no enjoyment out of I skirt by doing as little as possible before someone can call me on it. I keep thinking to myself do I really not like it or is it something else? I feel I don't have a passion. That flame went out when I finished school and I guess I've felt in a dark place ever since. Depression is a bitch. It comes and goes but when it's here it really makes itself known. It makes you feel it no matter who you're around or what you're doing. It demands attention. I'm starting to see that it's definitely a factor in why I drink. Why I have drank in the past. It relieves me from the daily struggle. Like so many before me and many yet to come I've used it as an escape mechanism. To save me from my own mind instead of dealing with it. Confronting whatever lies beneath because I'm too afraid think I'm too weak not good enough. The list for those reasons is quite extensive but I'll keep it at that. With anything in life there are good and bad days but even on the good days - however few they felt - I would drink. It became a habit. I replaced exercise weightlifting playing sports with drinking. With watching Netflix getting drunk wasting away the past 5 years of my life. It really doesn't feel like that time has gone by. In my mind I'm still in 2012. ..I realize complaining about things doesn't really invoke change. That consistency in discipline brings about changes. This daily change is difficult and I can't say I've fully committed to never drinking again. It seems like a tall order. I get why it's easier to say I won't drink today. It's much easier to grasp and hold out for the next 5 hours instead of thinking of the next 5 days or weeks or months or if I dared years. So instead I'm trying to focus on today while I sip on some ginger ale. ..There are so many things about my life that I am unsure of that I don't feel any direction. Floating. Floating through relationships or lack thereof since I have not done a great job staying in touch with others. Wading through my lack of career. I've really tried to think on that one for the past 6+ years and still have no idea what I want to do what I think I'd even enjoy doing or what I would even want to try. That's funny to me because I don't enjoy what I do now so what would be so bad about trying something else that I end up not enjoying? There's a mental hurdle I've got to train to jump over. I know a lot of effort will need to be made to work on these dark clouds that are seemingly overhead tonight. But I guess a sliver of hope is that I realize the storm will never go away if I continue to drink. If there's one habit that I have can help me the most it's never picking up the bottle again one day at a time. ..If you made it this far thank you for reading. I just needed to vent. Something that I usually don't do but maybe should to feel a slight weight off my chest from time to time. Thank you to everyone here in this subreddit all of your input storires everything helps me feel less alone.

Hi tauruso. I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling right now and feel a bit adrift in life. I hope you don't mind if I try to give you a bit of advice...It has been my experience that when I'm in a position where I feel down on myself and life and generally depressed making even the tiniest of goals and accomplishing them gets the ball rolling for me. Sounds to me like you've made the crucial realization that drinking is not a choice and you deserve to take pride in that. Have you tried taking other steps to improve your physical health? I find that actively trying to make myself more up to the task of doing things is the best approach to accomplishing or at least making progress towards my goals and that always starts with physical health. That means sleep hygiene moderating your circadian rhythm to get restful sleep eating nutrient dense foods with a lot of fiber starting off with light exercise and increasing the intensity etc. ..Though I'm still young I have sadly had occasion to get the ball rolling again far too many times and I've consistently observed in myself that when I get healthy my goals in life begin to take shape and actively pursuing a higher quality of life is something that I feel like I can manage. Remember the mind-body dichotomy is a fallacy. A sense of physical well-being goes a long way and I'm personally convinced that it's an indispensable foundation for a fulfilling life. Even baby-steps are a start. I personally find it helpful to remind myself how fortunate I am to be able to have so much control over my physical health to keep myself dedicated.
