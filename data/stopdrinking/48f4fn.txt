I stopped drinking some time in November and had a good 80 days in before I had a couple relapses. This month has been easy. I've let all my friends know (which was one of the problems with the relapses). Its easy to say "Oh I dont drink". I've gotten so focused on gym/work/fun projects that the month has flown by. Why drink when you can do more fun things?..This sub-reddit has really helped me. Thanks everyone.

In my experience if it's easier on another go around then that means the shit is about to come - later.  The most last time I sobered up it was fine and dandy - for two months. Then shit hit the fan.  So keep on trucking and don't get overly-confident and thinking you can do anything and avoid relapsing.  Take it easy. And be proud. 
Well done. I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. I say these words to myself any time the beast whispers to me then laugh at him whimpering in fear.
I can't really recall one thing I managed to get right the first time I tried it in my whole life.
Thanks for your post.  SD is a safe place for us.
Congrats! Happy for you!! What fun projects if you don't mind me asking? I found knitting exercising and writing to be fun but I'm kind of looking to branch out and feeling pretty stumped.
I have found not drinking to be pretty easy and this is the first time I made an effort to stop. What that makes me ask though is "If I fall out of line will it be this easy the next time?"..I have to believe the answer is no and that is what kicks the thought of "just one beer" out of my head anytime it creeps in...If it is easy right now recognize that as a gift that you have to make the most of. Many out there are not so lucky. Good luck!
