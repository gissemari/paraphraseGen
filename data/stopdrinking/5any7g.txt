[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety check in see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..**Triumph:** On Saturday I went to Grace Cathedral and had the great pleasure of meeting fellow SD moderator /u/mare_nectaris_ at the Peet's downstairs. It was raining off and on but she kindly traveled across the city to make the meeting easy for me (I am still using a cane while my foot heals). The coffee shop is right next to a room where I sometimes go for meetings (for those of you who are in AA and who will be visiting San Francisco there is a great meeting there at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesdays). After chatting for a while over coffee we went upstairs to the cathedral and looked at the AIDS Chapel where Keith Haring did the altar. (I remembered being a little girl in Pennsylvania and saying to a friend of mine  Why is there a Keith Haring on your wall?  and her saying  Oh that's just my Uncle Keith.  I was shocked!) Afterwards we went outside and looked at the fountain and the labyrinth in the courtyard. It was a really wonderful afternoon for me...**Struggle:** I am trying to care for my mother (she turns 87 this month). It is heartbreaking to see someone you love get old. She drinks while at the same time being extremely critical of *my* past drinking. (And yet she offered to smuggle wine into the hospital room when my drinking put me there!) The way I see it all I can do at this point is stay sober be a good example through my choices and keep loving her...**General:** Did you know that the Long Island Iced Tea was invented by a man named Bob Butt? (Sometimes the jokes just write themselves don't they?).
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: didn't drink this weekend and decided to stay home instead of tempting myself. Felt good to make the decision and waking up and getting in a good workout Sunday then opting out of Sunday funday also made me happy. ..Struggle: I'm dragging ass on getting started with GMAT prep. I need to order the books ASAP so I can take it by early January. ..Also I'm not all gung ho about sobriety anymore. A major part of me keeping with it instead of making a half-assed attempt at moderation is that I don't want to waste money just to have a buzz (it's also a waste of calories) and I know that I'll blackout within 3 weeks. Here's to hoping today goes well. I'll worry about Thursday when it gets here. ..General: when I went to a rush event for my fraternity during my freshman year the guys (who eventually were my brothers) were telling me about a dude that could drink anyone under the table. I took this as a challenge and announced that I could drink 23 Long Islands and be fine. They cut me off after 11 and had to walk me back to my dorm (I wasn't dead weight but I definitely wasn't sober) but were shocked when I was up and ready to work out the next morning at 8 am. I was a dumb ass at 17 but damn being young and invincible was the    
Triumph: my new job is going really well I doubt it would be if I was drinking...Struggle: oh man the feels. All the feels are coming back and the anxiety is godawful. Especially the shame of remembering stupid times when I was drinking...General: I'm so tired.
**Triumph:** A friend reached out to me recently. We got sober together but haven't seen each other in some time because I moved and she randomly wrote to me and asked if I'd started drinking again. She wanted to know if it was as bad as it used to be or if it was not a big deal... because she was thinking of picking it back up. I told her that I'm still sober and I told her why and I even sent her the link to this sub. It's possible she's reading this right now. I hope she is. She told me that my words helped anyway. I hope they did...**Struggle:** My job is wearing on me. It would be better if I could just put up with it for the time being but I'm very impatient and restless when it comes to work. I don't like being unsatisfied in my job...**General:** Esta elecci n me decepciona much simo. Ojal  podamos abstenernos todos y llevar unos a os sin presidente... y tener un tiempo para pensar en lo que hemos echo a perder. Sorry I just love Spanish.
Triumph: I wrote two paragraphs yesterday. I may write more today! Maybe it's not impressive but I was stuck for years. Maybe I will finish that story. I need this story to be finished...Also yay! 44 days. That's two more weeks than I even expected...Struggle: I'm in a very frustrating moment in my therapy when I discover many shitty things about myself and I still don't have tools to change them. I look at this big pile of crap and I want to give up already. There's no 'out' from this cave for me now...General: I think about getting the semicolon tattoo. 
Triumph: there's this 9 next to my name and I honestly don't think about drinking except when I'm in here or as some kind of old habit...Struggle: Halloween candy.  I'm looking at a couple of grocery bags full of it over my shoulder right now and considering putting them out on the street along with the rest of the trash this AM...General: I seem oddly fine with not drinking so far.  Waiting for the novelty to wear off and things to start feeling uncomfortable.  I guess I don't trust this.  I should say I've been sober this long only 2x before in perhaps 20 years so I don't have a lot of experience.
**Struggle and eventual triumph:** I'm off to see some stand up comedy tonight and I will be eating burritos and shamelessly drinking water
Triumph: Set up a new weekly routine which dedicates time in my schedule for the gym Monday - Friday been to the gym three days in a row so far which is a good start. Also got my star. Very happy about one month alcohol free...Struggle: Trying really hard to work on relationship and not argue but have had a couple of huge fights lately.....General: Feeling blessed to finally see the reality of alcohol and the negative impact it had not just on my life but on others around me. Coming to the understanding that it doesn't make you smarter funnier or a better dancer is enlightening.
**Triumph:** I'm traveling for work. Late last night my wife sent me an [inspirational photo](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/16/ef/3a/16ef3a744837ed8fa38f0bbee99d541c.jpg) about kintsugi the Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold. I'm not hiding my cracks and breaks as much...**Struggle:** Massively behind on two major projects. One is totally my fault. The other is totally out of my control but I'm a key to getting it done. It's easy for me to get wound up and stretched thin.
Triumph: A situation came up this week which I will remain vague about with another person. My initial reaction was to unleash a torrent of rage and accusations at this person. I wanted to drink at them so badly and then in the aftermath blame them for making me drink. I did not do any of those things. Instead I talked and listened and accepted what I needed to accept. Life went on and I did not drink. ..Struggle: I'm dog sitting this week for my brother. It's weird and kind of scary being in his house all alone at night. My first night there I found his liquor stashed in a cupboard in the living room while searching for extra blankets. It didn't really interest me but there it was. I also know he has a fridge in the basement full of beer. I have to admit the thought of beers did cross my mind but I'll be damned if I venture down to that creepy basement to get them. Of course I could buy my own beer and bring it there. But no I'm not going to do that either. I'm glad I just have to get through one more night there...General: Did you know that [Loganberry](http://loganberry.com) is supposed to be uncarbonated? I grew up on the stuff and I always remembered it being fizzy. Nope it's supposed to be flat. Still tasty though.
**Triumph:** I didn't drink yesterday even though I so hard wanted to escape. I ate a whole bucket of ice cream instead which is not that bad...**Struggle:** I have serious anxiety and depression about my life and newly started school. I feel like I don't belong there and I get anxiety there...**General:** I'm just glad I'm sober today. Take care bros n sis'..
Yesterday started with several minor frustrations that I would normally have carried with me all day in order to assuage them with alcohol.  Instead I reminded myself that drinking wasn't an option and lo and behold my brain simply forgot about the minor frustrations and just got on with it...This morning instead of sleeping late having slept poorly from drinking I rose early worked out and am going to make breakfast for my family.  Looking forward to a great day.  I will not drink today!
Triumph: I moved into my new flat! I bought enough food for at least a month new furniture and survived an IKEA trip. ..Struggle: I finished my latest freelance project and now I have to find more. I've only just started doing this so feel kind of confused and stressed but in a good way! I used to always panic about money but somehow I feel like everything will work itself out. ..General: My two months sobriety will include fireworks because it's bonfire night in the uk. Celebrating in style! 
Triumph: I've run every day for two weeks.  Just for ten minutes but I still did it.  ..Struggle:  still dealing with the idea of forever.  Trying to change the mindset that it is just today but rational me knows that i might never get to drink a glass of wine with  a steak ever again or go wine tasting with my girlfriends...General: I love Coffee. 
**Triumph:** My significant other and I went traveled to my alma mater to watch a football game this past Saturday. In the past travel = alcohol football = alcohol. But this past trip? No alcohol. And we had a great time! No worrying about hangovers during or after the game. No worries about being caught in stadium (never happened but still). ..**Struggle:** I can't say that I have any worth mentioning today. Every challenge that I have is welcomed. Okay I'll say one. My focus at work is still hit and miss. It's terrible...**General:** My hypothyroidism medicine seems to be working. I'm resting better and my mood is elevated. I was getting hit by it alcoholism and sleep apnea. Having changed all three has made a tremendous difference in my life. 
Struggle: house mate was drunk and still drinking when I got home. He had my favorite beer too. Saying no to the offer was easy. But it was hard to keep it that way. ..Triumph: I went so far as to open a bottle... but I didn't even give it a taste. Did a run on my treadmill and took an early bed. ..General: need to set boundaries for myself and my living space. Need more things to go do when the cravings hit. Thinking about going to a meeting just to have someone to call when I get so close to drinking. ..Today good or bad I will not drink.
**Triumph:** I've bagged an audition with a really good band. It's next week fingers crossed for that one.....Cycling to work is going well and helping me with my fitness plus arriving at work in a great frame of mind. Hopefully this winter won't be too unkind weather-wise so I can continue...**Struggle:** I'm struggling to get the writing I need to do to improve my website done. It seems cracking procrastination is even harder than not drinking for me. I'm managing to get some smaller tasks done I think I need an hour to breakdown exactly what's required into small items so I can tick them off one by one...**General:** Did you know I have a one-legged uncle. He does the hops for the brewery.
Triumph: Meditation queued and ready to go her in a few minutes. Making big progress in that area of things so far. ..Struggle: Might not be working where I was working before I got out of rehab so gotta find a new job soon.
**Triumph:**  Taking the time to really consider what I want my life to look like through deep introspection and therapy...**Struggle** Trying to repair the damage done to family and deal with the constant shame that eats away at me.  
I LOOOVE Grace Cathedral!  I'm so glad you two ladies got to meet up!  Actually my ex-wife's father was a deacon at the Cathedral back in the 90s and because I'm still tight with the family when I visit SF I sometimes stay with the verger of Grace Cathedral on the grounds!  I learned to love labyrinths from that church.  Anyhoo.....**Triumph:**  I've been increasing my physical activity and the gains are showing.  Definitely a flatter tummy increased weights at the gym and I have some ab definition.  Yay!!  Working on reminding myself to love my body no matter what but I love having a hard body!..**Struggle:** It makes me nuts that there's still a part of me that says "Well maybe I can just have a drink at holidays or maybe after 2 years."  I KNOW that no good can come from it and I dutifully remind myself of all of the reasons I want to stay sober.  I just want to totally ACCEPT it.  Grrr.....**General:**  I identify with the sadness over watching those you love age.  My mama is doing okay but I worry about my dad.  He's still drinking and it's definitely affected his cognition at this point in his life.  I had to work very hard to accept his choices and just love him no matter what.  Sending you a big hug! ...
Triumph: Today is day one. I'm tired of waking up sad and hungover and not able to function at my best. I know that a big cause of my drinking is some of the past abuses I've had and I also made a psychologist appointment to start to resolve these issues. I'm happy that I'm committing to this and while I know it will be hard I want to change for the better!..Struggle: I'm excited but scared. I know it'll be hard and there will be lots of temptations. ..General: I'm excited for Survivor tonight!
Triumph 4 months!  Wahoo!  I think this is the longest I've been sober I stopped once before but I think I only made it 3 months.  I've lost about 30lbs so far and have been feeling great about myself and life. ..Struggle:  I love my wife but it's starting to drive me crazy again that she has zero sex drive.  We go out we have fun but what's the point.  I'm too young for /r/deadbedrooms...General: Armand Hammer did not start Arm &amp; Hammer.  How disappointing is that.   
Struggle:  I fully understand I'm addicted to drinking. Today is the first day that I am ready to quit. For myself. 
Triumph: I went to a bar last night to meet up with an old friend only drank water the whole night and managed to have a good time sober at a bar. Also I've come to terms with the fact that AA is simply not for me which really scales back a lot of the cognitive dissonance and mental distress I would experience every other time I've gotten sober. ..Struggle: Trying to get my life back together lately but I can feel outside pressure from friends and family wearing me thin. None of these people seem to take in to account what I want to do or my thoughts and feelings on the matters at hand. None of them even care enough to ask...General: It's almost sweater weather!
Triumph: Got my 30 day coin last week; on my way to 40 days. Longest I've been sober since 2013. ..Struggle: Still eagerly awaiting the newly-sober brain chemistry settling down. The debilitating depression hasn't hit for a few days and my libido is starting to peek in the door though so I hope this is a positive trend. ..General: Psyched to go to Scotland for the first time next week! Visiting ancestral homes and tracing my mother's side of the family tree. I've looked up some AA meetings for the towns we're staying in... I'll probably stick out with my Texas accent haha.

Triumph: I'm able to take ownership of a work event. We are having our first committee meeting today and I'm excited to be able to lead it! It's hard to believe 131 days ago I was in such bad shape...Struggle: I'm really stressed out financially but I know it would be way worse if I was drinking...General: Now that Halloween is over I'm excited to BRING ON THE HOLIDAY CHEER!
**Triumph** : didn't drink last night and felt great going to bed sober ..**Struggle** : today is only day 2 and I'm worried about my weekly potluck dinner with friends tonight since some will be drinking..**General** : feeling good nervous about the future but also hopeful. Gotta stay positive and hopeful.
**Triumph:** I am now 6 days sober and I was approved for in-patient treatment yesterday..**Struggle:** It may be up to two weeks before space is available for me and my depression and anxiety have kicked in big time..**General:** I am getting to spend some quality time with my husband and puppy rather than drinking until I black out every day.

T:   Plugging away at nursing school.   ..S:  My sleep schedule has been pretty messed up...G:  The weather.   We hit 80 degrees in November.    What kind of nonsense is this? 
triumph: i still have a job after over 6mths. and i told 0 customers to fuck off this week though sorely they tempt me. and I had wonderful holiday season with friends- got to do all the things I wanted in balance with family and everything without getting too stressed. No meltdowns in sigh and only one almost-panic attack issue. High five myself...struggle: my stupid ass got my shitty old car clamped last week. I was in ladies meeting and the demon traffic wardens for once checked the backstreets. apparently i hadn't paid the car tax back at start of year ( thought I had; i paid the other car bills but probably I was wasted). so spot check = clamp and all the associated fees. I thought I would have a little cash left for the first time ever to put for presents. nope. lentils and rice till payday...general: keeping up tradition of irresponsible non-good-adult life choices we maybe going to adopt another dog. i'm actually dying of suspense to hear from the shelter tomorrow. and I am sick- again. work is just the biggest festival of germs. so i'm sick and pissy----and yet still happy to be sober.
Struggle: I was at a wedding last weekend for a really good friend. I was tempted multiple times. Even people who knew I was sober asked me if I wanted a drink. It bothered me...I asked my sister how much alcohol was in a mimosa she was drinking because it looked yummy. She said it doesn't matter. That's exactly the kick I needed...Triumph: Almost done with my company's major project...General: I've started thinking about what I can do to celebrate two years sober. Soliciting ideas.
Triumph:  Sober Halloween!  I found out I am still clumsy at walking in the dark even sober.  Nearly fell into a ditch while taking the kids trick-or-treating.  It was a fun holiday and one that I'll actually remember..Struggle: Trying to work up motivation to organize stuff with friends like bowling or meeting up for coffee.  Just not feeling it this week.  Lots going on with work and kids.  Maybe I'll try for Saturday instead..General:  Feliz Dia De Los Muertos.  I am remembering all those loved ones who have gone from this world.  
Triumph: First week and a half at my new job down. I really lucked out landing a job like this with no degree and no experience. It has been challenging so far but I know I can do it...Struggle: Trying to balance family life and fitness with two jobs and school! ..General: 200 days sober!!!!
**Triumph:** Today was my dad's 60th birthday. He's a really wonderful all-around guy. In fact he stopped drinking right before I was born. He has never started since then and we come from a family full of alcoholics. He has three brothers that have drinking problems ranging from functional to completely dysfunctional when booze is involved. I was able to be there for him and my family all day and enjoy a wonderful day with them and I was NOT in any way shape or form hungover. ..**Struggle:** It seems I picked the absolute worst time to stop drinking. I'm back at home with my family and a lot of old friends from high school. I'm in a wedding this weekend which means the wedding and the rehearsal dinner with a ton of people that are used to me drinking. I'll be honest and say that I had two drinks last night. I haven't reset my badge yet but I plan on doing it after the weekend. I'm just going to moderate this weekend and start fresh on Sunday. I am confident I'm capable of this because I don't have any trouble moderating for a brief period it takes a while for things to go back to the way they started. Either way I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm almost there. I just don't want to have to deal with explaining to a ton of old drinking buddies that I never see that I'm not drinking. ..After this weekend I'm in the clear for a long time until Christmas and I'll start to tell my friends and move forward from there with no alcohol in my life. ..**General:** I've been stressed at work lately but oh well. I'm confident about my ability to stop drinking for good now and am looking forward to it but I also know it's not going to be a miracle solution to all of life's problems. I do know however that it will definitely be a lot less things to worry about: financial trouble health anxiety damaging relationships performing poorly at work being in bad shape hating myself etc. It's onward and upward from here. 
**Triumph:** Got a lot of sleep last night..**Struggle:** I need to grade a whole lot of papers tonight. I used to do that while downing a six pack over the course of the night. Have to do it sober this go round
Thanks for this!
