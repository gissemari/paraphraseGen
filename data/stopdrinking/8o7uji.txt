I'm a male 40 years of age. I was wondering if you guys think that recovery is different for men and women or do we face the same issues and struggles? I don't think that there is but would love to hear from others!!!

We all want to get better right? There's the same issue and struggle right there. 
39 year old male here I find that every persons recovery is different regardless of gender/age whatever. This process can be wonderful gut wrenching and scary as hell and that is all in one morning!

The issues and struggles may be the same but I think that generally speaking women who struggle with substance abuse face more judgement. Especially so if said women are also mothers. 
I think that generally speaking women who struggle with substance abuse face more judgement which is a massive barrier to recovery. Especially so if said women are also mothers. 
I tend to think of sobriety as a long plane ride. ..We've all come from different places are going different places but for a while we're all going together in the same direction even if we're doing different things while on the journey .
Seems like we all relate to addiction exactly the same which is interesting.  I don't think I've ever really considered how kind of odd that is until just now thanks for bringing it up!  When I read posts it could be anyone talking unless a person relates specific information regarding their gender I can't even tell.  We all get cravings the same the same urges the same moderating crap the same voice of addiction pestering us... yeah it is interesting!  Huh.  Considering men and women generally are portrayed as having vastly differing experiences in most other things in life such as personality behaviours communication etc..IWNDWYT
