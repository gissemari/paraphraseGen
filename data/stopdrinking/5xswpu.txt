So yeah i have been here for a while now getting settled in and what not. The people hete is pretty cool as you would expect they have some issues in life as myself so its nice to talk to people that gets it and doesent turn it in to gossip. Like SD in a way. As i said before this is a place with much freedom if you want to go downtown you are free to do so. Wich makes it easy to relapse of course we had a guy coming back to us last week fucked up on bensos and alcohol ( dont ever try that) trying to pick a fight with everyone but after he started attacking people in the street the police came and threw him in jail. The good part about it was that the staff handled it well i have seen so much worse in hospitals a phych-wards.. ..Anyway my cravings is at 4/10 2 days ago they were almost 10 its really like a rolletcoasterride but now i have good support here my hopes are high that i Will beat this and continue my jurney in life without all the effects of alcohol. ..Im already thinking different about my future there is optimism and dreams for a change im still not sure what ill end up doing but its nice to think about when you feel a bit liberated. ..Aaanyway have a nice day my friends!
