The first few times I stopped drinking a few years ago I had a sense of vitality new interests that I had been engaging in things to do that filled my day &amp; thoughts to where the alcohol cravings were basically non existent. Over the last year &amp; a half or thereabouts nothing motivates me to not drink. Not new interests not the many hobbies I have not the business I'm building time staying occupied stories I'm writing....none of it erases the cravings. So I'm going to have to dig deep &amp; just take it day by day. Or week by week actually since my binges are once a week. ..A few weeks ago I didn't do a weekly binge &amp; cried for 2 days because I didn't have that weekly release. Misery consumed me. I'm still trying to find a way to obtain that release without alcohol...I know what all the amazing benefits are of not drinking but there's no inspiration left in that for me. I'm at a place where I don't feel good either way. I no longer have that freeing sensation with not drinking. I don't feel better not drinking. I need to work on my health overall even though I do live a healthy lifestyle (except for the once a week binge session). I'm struggling but I think I might actually pull it off. ..My whole thing is that I constantly seek inner peace &amp; tranquility that only alcohol provides. I had a horrible childhood where many bad things happened to me. I dealt with those demons though &amp; know how to manage my anxiety but leftover emotions from it &amp; an abusive marriage I endured for far too long damaged my psyche. I am actively working on finally getting to a place of peace but when the leftover emotions intrusive memory recall nightmares etc rear their spiky heads only alcohol soothes. Even though I know how dangerous that is &amp; that I'm fully addicted...The real test of me not drinking will be in about a week. If I don't binge drink one day next week I'll know I'm standing at the beginning of the road to recovery. ..I do want to walk down that road. I imagine this road to be a beautiful winding path actually green lush thick with trees tropical flowers exotic fruits to pick along the way &amp; at the end a calm ocean with turquoise water gentle waves &amp; a refreshing breeze. A spot in the sun for me on the warm sand.

I guess I drank for too many years...I need to remain abstinent for my mind to "rewire" itself and truly appreciate the benefits of not drinking...Every drinking session causes another battle with physical and mental withdrawal depression because I drank and anxiety because I'm anxious for more alcohol... I cannot drink and have inner peace which is what I really crave...Good luck to you.
That's very frustrating. The euphoria of not drinking is always a great motivator so it sucks that you're not feeling that. I hate when that happens to me. Of course as long as you remain sober it will return. Good luck I hope things pick up soon.
