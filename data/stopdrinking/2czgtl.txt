I was drinking at the bar. Probably a microbrewery because it was a thickly lacquered pine slab smooth slightly tacky with a deep yellow glow. I was gulping something down. Probably an IPA because it was in a pint glasses and that used to be my snobbery of choice. I did not dream of the flavor. Taste was incidental because I was telling whoever I was with (also indistinct) that I didn't t really like beer or wine or whiskey only the buzz and the oblivion. At least I was honest. ..We were arguing about where on the relapse cycle I was and whether it applied because I "wasn't twelve-stepping and that particular model relied solely on one method of recovery." Great my addictive voice has become an academic too. ([the post by Nika65](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2cwuq4/relapse_and_the_relapse_cycle/))..In the back of my head a voice was pleading with me telling me that I don't have to throw all the progress away...I work feeling authentically hung over. I've not been sleeping well hydrating properly or exercising sufficiently this week. Deadlines are piling up. In the past I would have temporarily escaped into alcohol and let things get worse. I've made another pot of coffee this morning working on the first of several liters of water and will try to get get some chunks of tasks done. Thanks for being here and showing me how to handle this shit.  .(edited for link and typos)

Drinking dreams are a normal part of recovery (so normal the SD sidebar FAQ covers the subject); similarly when I stopped smoking many years ago I had smoking dreams. ..I used to believe that all dreams are just random firing of our brains during REM and that the only significance was the conscious  narrative we impose when were awake ie. my dreams make me say wtf I'll just go drink is the *wrong response*...But then I heard this [RadioLab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91536-dreams/) about the research of a Harvard professor who studied a group of subjects who were exposed to Tetris gaming just before bedtime who subsequently reported that their brains kept dreaming about Tetris solutions. His theory is that our brains keep pinging away at conundrums that bother us. Thinking about this I don't think it's much of a stretch to believe that our brains deprived of the old friend alcohol is "pinging away" while we sleep. Awake we need to be aware that our alcohol-free brain wants us to return to "normal" and even while we're sleeping those neurons are firing away trying to solve the problem of how to compel us to drink again. The answer upon awakening every morning for me is: NOPE...As you know the good news is that the dreams fade. .
I quit smoking several months ago (seriously? who has a harder time quitting drinking than smoking?  this girl apparently) and had constant smoking dreams for awhile.  ..I also had "eating all the carbs" dreams when I was on a low carb diet.  I think this is pretty normal if you have cut something out that used to be a huge part of your life. :)
