Two days ago I posted about relapsing very hard. I am feeling much better today physically except my sinuses are still very itchy and inflamed. My inner ears and the roof of my mouth in particular are swollen and uncomfortable. ..Has anyone experienced this before? I realize I am probably still detoxing. Initially I thought the swelling was related to vomiting so many times during the relapse. But I have read a few articles online about sinus issues being linked to alcohol allergy. It would be surprising to learn via my first relapse that after all these years I may have been allergic to alcohol the whole time...Edit: I def. plan to see a doctor just wanted to see if the community has any experience with this.

This is possibly a very good thing to discuss with your doctor while sitting down to talk about your drinking 100% honestly.  
Maybe you are literally allergic to alcohol?  Talk to the licensed health professionals but try to be as honest as possible about your alcohol use and abuse.
DISCLAIMER: Mouse and Crosby say to see a Dr. and I wholeheartedly agree...I sometimes got like this after a real bender. For me it was a histamine thing. Most forms of booze have a lot of histamine and that can incite an allergy storm where everything my immune system sees is a foreign enemy. Lasts a few days then goes away. Alcohol allergy is really rare. Histamine sensitivity is much more common.
