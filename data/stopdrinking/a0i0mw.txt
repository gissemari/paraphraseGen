I've been lurking here the past month but it wasn't until yesterday that I decided to post here and make a new account. So first of all my native tongue is Spanish sorry in advance for any mistakes...I'm a single mom university teacher and I'm soon turning 35. I was a young mom my eldest son is 16 youngest is 7 they live half of the week with me and the other half with their dad. Though I don't usually drink around my kids I've had trouble in the past with addictions specially when I'm without my kids and out with friends. On 2012 I was diagnose with BPD and after years of therapy things are going better. Before that I had to struggle to stay in control of my drinking habits and once I started drinking I could easily loose myself and try other drugs (cocaine weed cigarettes). ..Since therapy my habits have change I've spent months sometimes without drinking (and by extension without any other drugs) but when I do is like opening the gates of hell. I have no limits on what I can drink. I suspect some level of social anxiety because this has never happened when I'm absolutely alone. ..Last weekend my youngest son had a big thing with his class and the three of us agree on going together (my ex my 7yo son and me). It's summer here so the kids were in the pool and parents by the barbecue with tons of beer and wine. I get really nervous around them so I started drinking early like many of the other parents. Long story short: we kept on drinking until late at night. Luckily my son was sleepy so before it was too late my ex and son drove off and I stayed with the other parents. I was absolutely drunk to the point I shared family secrets with a bunch of strangers cryied and expose my family (mom and dad) on a pretty big issue...I don't even like alcohol I struggle to eat healthy excersise control my anxiety. My kids and I have a beautiful relationship and usually there're no yelling or disrespectful behaviour from any of us towards each other. So how can I hurt all of that so much just because of alcohol? I was disrespectful with myself and even if they didn't see me get wasted It's hurting them as well. I know I will always have this tendency I just don't want to give in ever again. I feel so hurt by my own actions... Hurt for my family they don't deserve this... we all don't deserve this...Sorry for the long post. I really needed to share..

Thanks for sharing. I keyed in on where you speak of disrespecting your self. That is a core concern for me.  I seem to do best when I start my day with a dedication.  Just a few minutes where I try to tune my mind. A prayer or read a poem.  It gives me a better chance for a positive self assessment when I lay down for sleep at night.  ..It sounds like you have some regrets about your behavior and over sharing with strangers. That is one of those things that I would struggle to let go of.  I hope by sharing this you can just let it go and get back to being awesome. You are awesome! ..
