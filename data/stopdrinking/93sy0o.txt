So up until recently everything has been going pretty well for me emotionally.  Which is unbelievable for me as my life is a complete and utter disaster.  I hate to complain but I have nobody else to talk to (literally) and I REALLY do not want to go drink even though I'm angry and lonely...As of now I'm 32 years old.  I have no job no friends (by choice they are all alcoholics) I live with my father (alcoholic) but not drinking now he just switched to sex addiction.  I lost my last job because I had abused drugs and alcohol so bad (was suicidal) that I literally couldn't learn the job and was having panic attacks and derealization on the job.  This was a horrible let down for me because it was a decent job making $21 so I could've had my own place and a life!..So on top of this all my dad's house is falling apart.  It literally rains in my room and the other rooms upstairs.  It was a flat roof house that my dad never once put a single penny in since he owned it.  The water is backed up in the laundry room so I can't do laundry here.  It also smells of sewer water mold and mice crawl on me at night.  This is my life.  I'm not complaining because I know my actions got me into  this mess but now that I want a life and want to get out of my hell of a life I'm having so much trouble!..The final straw was last week when suddenly after 13 years my cat disappeared.  This cat is my only comfort in life.  As I said I have no friends my family are messed up and I havn't been with a woman in years.  My little comfort is being able to lay down at night and have a purring cat at my side.  And this is the kicker I believe my father got rid of the cat because he blames him for his doing having fleas.  Which is not true his filth and not taking care of his dog is why it has fleas.  He doens't wash it or take care of it.  So I'm 95% he took him away somewhere.  ..Anyway I was feeling pretty optimistic about moving ahead in life up until this happened.  And I'm filled with rage.  But hopefully this will help and I won't have to go out tonight...thanks for listening.

I'm so sorry to hear what you are going through. The fact that you have gone 40 days without drinking under some absolutely horrible circumstances is a testament to your strength...I will not drink with you today. 
I am so sorry you lost your cat. Sounds like a support group ( in-person) may guide you more fully. Keep moving forward it's the way out. Please stay strong -Sobriety is the beginning of many improvements. What has alcohol given to you? Usually in my case Nothing-it only takes from you. Stick with the group for strength and support. I will not drink with you today..
