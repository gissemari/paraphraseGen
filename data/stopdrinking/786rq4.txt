I've been noticing each weekend that I have been completely exhausted by lunchtime (39 days sober now).   It's really been bothering me...Finally looked at my Fitbit and confronted the truth.    Of course I know I put on 40 pounds while drinking.   But since quitting my movement has increased.   On weekdays I get 50% more steps (walking) than I did when I was drinking.   On weekends I'm getting 100% more steps on the weekdays.   Plus carrying those extra 40 pounds of beer gut the whole way!..And to be clear these aren't exercise steps these are just being upright and being with the kids instead of being curled up with a hangover or behind a desk at work.   I'm just not yet conditioned for regular life.  ..I hope this helps someone who is struggling with fatigue thinking it's PAWS or something.   In my case I've become physically twice as active as I was but my body just isn't ready for it yet.    ..If anyone else has any suggestions I'm all ears because I'm not sure how to tackle an exhaustion problem without adding even more exercise.  I'm thinking to mix in some moderate cardio conditioning during the week and put in more sitting breaks in the weekend.
