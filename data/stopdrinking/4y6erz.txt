I typically drink every night after work and sometimes before work as well (I work late nights and overnights.)..I decided yesterday morning to take another shot at sobriety. I had a surprisingly easy day. I had one little mental battle during the day which I won with relative ease. It wasn't until last night as I tried to gt some sleep that I really started to struggle...After getting frustrated not being able to fall asleep for hours I decided to get on the iPad and listen to some poetry for a little bit. This is when Charles Bukowski's *The Laughing Heart* came on. I'd read this poem many times before but it really hit home in a way last night and I felt re-inspired by it...So I'm sharing this here in hopes that it can inspire somebody else a little bit on their own path to sobriety...> your life is your life.> don't let it be clubbed into dank submission..> be on the watch..> there are ways out..> there is light somewhere..> it may not be much light but.> it beats the darkness..> be on the watch..> the gods will offer you chances..> know them..> take them..> you can't beat death but.> you can beat death in life sometimes..> and the more often you learn to do it.> the more light there will be..> your life is your life..> know it while you have it..> you are marvelous.> the gods wait to delight.> in you...I will not drink today. Wish me luck and good luck to all of you too!
