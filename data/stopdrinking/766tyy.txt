The night we got there I struggled because I haven't done a vacation without drinking. ..The next day WE WENT TO A FUCKING OKTOBERFEST. There was a guy wearing whatever that stuff is they wear at Oktoberfests singing song after song after song about beer. He must have sang the word "beer" a hundred times in five minutes. ..I made it.
