A lot of my friends are depressed and drink to cope with it and it doesn't seem to be a problem for them. Why is it a problem for me? Why do I NEED to drink to feel normal when they CHOOSE to drink to feel good? It feels so unfair. My irrational thoughts are telling me  why should you quit when so many people around you are choosing to keep using drinking as a coping mechanism?   I want to be able to do that too. Drinking is the only thing that makes me feel good anymore and my therapists and doctors want to take it away from me. I think that's fucked up. ..I'm going on day 4 and I can't stop thinking about how it tastes... how it feels... I don't know if I can make it. I haven't made it past 4 days in months. I'll have the opportunity to relapse tomorrow... I don't know how to resist.

Have you thought about taking some  me  time? If certain things are triggering some cravings then maybe focusing on yourself with something may help you not think about alcohol. Staying busy away from alcohol keeps me sane....Early on when I was thinking about getting a drink I would beg myself to just wait till tomorrow and then I can have a drink but not today and then tomorrow would come and I wouldn't feel like drinking. That's what I think of when people say to take it day by day. It's crazy but it works...
"Comparison is the thief of joy" T. Roosevelt ..One thing I believe is that my perception of someone else's relationship with alcohol (or anything for that matter) is likely very skewed. I know that I portrayed many different things to different people regarding my relationship with alcohol and I think this is common. Another thing I believe is that one's relationship to alcohol is seldom static...At any rate I choose to not drink because I know that drinking will make me physically mentally and emotionally worse off than not drinking will. It just boils down to that ultimately. What others do or don't do with alcohol is about as relevant for me as what other do or don't do with orange soda.
