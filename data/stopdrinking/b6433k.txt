I'm kind of nervous about this as there's a stigma surrounding rehabilitation services. But I've been having troubles kicking the sauce on my own for years now. I can go prolonged periods of time without touching a drop but then I'd get bored and hit the bottle harder than before. This came to a head Monday night. I made friends with someone at the local pub and went way over my limits and collapsed on the way out the door. I can't deal with drinking anymore it destroyed my life before and now it's doing me physical harm. So I've given in and reached out for help...&amp;#x200B;..I guess that's what I'm writing this for too. I'm venting my frustration at myself while committing myself to stopping my alcohol consumption once and for all.

Don't get down on yourself for the past. You're taking a huge step for your future and that's what's important so congrats on joining rehab. If you're willing to put in the work it is sooo worth it. My life has improved greatly since I stopped drinking and it's only getting better. IWNDWYT!
I commend you for taking the needed steps for you to quit drinking. Do not beat yourself up. You are taking care of yourself the exact way you need to!
