I've always wanted to escape to a fantasy and maybe that mindset fueled my near decade long nightly routine. But I'm stuck in reality and at the moment it feels almost wrong because what's currently happening in my life was a fantasy to me years ago but now it's actually happening...I lost a job about 2 months ago that I hated (not from drinking). I wasn't overly angry kinda indifferent but regardless being fired doesn't help a healing ego. I binged for 1 month. Today (well Thursday) I hit 1 month and I was offered a job for what I went to college for...A person here said something along the lines of my dismissal being a new stepping stone forward and they were correct. I'll be going into this job sober and actually looking forward to putting my hard work from college to use...It's been an emotionally numb time for a third of my life but this spark really feels good. I can say truly I am happy (also terrified!)...I want to say to anyone else out there who is struggling or striving for whatever you're seeking don't give up..I won't give up either!..IWNDWYT...
