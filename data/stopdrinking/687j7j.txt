I tried to drink moderately convinced myself I could but still experience problems. So I decided to back off again for a while...What I found is that peer pressure is killing. Tonight there is a party of a friend. Parties like these simply are drinking fests and for me it is better to avoid them. Up to now I have already two friends telling me that I cannot manage to not attend: "you cannot do this. You know about this party of months now". It makes me feel so guilty but angers me at the same time: who the hell do you think you are to manage my life?..Anyways I made a mistake yesterday already by drinking a bunch of beer and when drunk I texted my friends that I will be there. ..I have slight hangover at the moment and my body says: dude just stay home tonight. But now everyone expects me to come and I would even feel more guilty when I won't come. But at the same time going there feels like being a lapdog to the guys who shamed me for deciding not to come...The peer pressure is killing me. But what I see is that some of my friends just do not respect me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm actually afraid that I will lose my friends by not going to parties and stuff. But to be honest another voice in me says that I actually should turn away from people that shame me for not doing stuff and try to decide what is good for me and what is not. ..Alcohol is such a struggle.....EDIT: the reason I started drinking again are family issues that I could not cope with anymore. My brother is a drug addict. My father is an enormous jerk who has been playing "attract and repel" for whole our lives. Last week he texted us that we as children were not desirable to be born in the first place thinks we are failures and does not regard us as his children anymore. I think he sent the text because he feels we are distancing ourselves from him and his toxic behaviour and he loses control. I'm sorry I'm a bit of a mess at the moment...

If you lose friends because you're not out partying with them then they're not really your friends. Took me years to learn that and made a lot of bad decisions because of it. The dad thing unfortunately you don't get to pick your parents. Some are just assholes. If it's detrimental to you then faze it out of your life. Life is way too short to give toxic people energy. Focus on the people that are positive in your life and it will be reciprocal. In the end that's all you can do. Best of luck
