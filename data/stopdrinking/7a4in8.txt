Hi ..I hope you're all doing well. I write from Spain...I've just relapsed for the first time in about two years. I'm ready to work the steps I've realised that I've dry drunking for all of that time. ..I want to work the program but I'm currently in Spain with no meetings in English I use intherooms sometimes to help. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Is there a way to find a sponsor easily?..Thanks

There are no English speaking meetings anywhere near you? Hmm... I'd try calling the local Intergroup (you can just google [city/country name] and intergroup) and asking for the contact info of an English speaking AA member and asking him/her for help working the steps. How long are you in Spain for?
