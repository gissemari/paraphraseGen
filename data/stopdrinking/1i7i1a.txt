Last time I relapsed on day 25 which led me on a 2 day bender. Today I stayed sober and have now been sober longer than I have in the past 5 years. I've landed a new job a nights/weekends job as well and have managed to save money for the first time in the past 2 months. ..To everybody who posts...thank you from the bottom of my heart. It means the world to read strangers stories on the Internet. Good luck with your sobriety this weekend. To those who have wanted to stop now is as good a time as any.
