I rarely feel more invigorated or alive than when life grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me awake to the urgent nature of this disease through someone's untimely death.  I had thought about this man recently wondered where he had been and sure enough I got the word he is dead.  Again I am left to wonder what more I could have done why didn't I call him try to help him.  I could sense his desire to get better and I shied away.  I know it's not my fault or responsibly but it is still so jarring. ..I have been fucking around in recovery going 80% in or 90%.  Well I'm on vacation no one needs to know.  Well just maybe some pot that won't be too bad but any substance use always leads me back to misery chaos thoughts of suicide and the rest.  I can draw a straight line from a single drink a single bong hit to a catastrophic meltdown of my mental health. ..I don't know if I have ever been more serious about redoubling my efforts to build a long term sustainable sober lifestyle.  I am cautiously optimistic as I have been here so many times before.  What am I going to do differently this time?  I have to build it all from the ground up stronger than ever.  I have to remove any reservations that I can safely use when x happens or in y years.  I have had enough.  ..[This](https://www.iwanttochangemylife.org/tools/Relapse-Prevention-Five-Rules-Of-Recovery-YaleJournalOfMedicine.pdf) article has given me great inspiration lately I hope it can help someone it's a super solid blueprint for a sober life ..I love you all we can do this together. ....

It's not one day at a time for me. Its one hour at a time one meal at a time. On my drive home it's just make it to so and so exit and then you can give in and when I get there it's just make it 4 more exits and then you can give in. All the way home every day. It's not easy and that's how you know it's worth it. I've been to too many funerals heard about too much domestic abuse and watched too many friends to to jail for life all before I turned 30. Best of luck you have all of us that have your back who are rooting for you. ..Book suggestion if you like to read that rebuilt perspective for me: Solve for Happy by Mo Gawdet. 
Today was the funeral for someone I went to high school with. Only 51! He had a stroke a few years ago but I guess never quit drinking. He was a year older and we weren't close but it does hit home how serious this is. It is good to use these hard examples to strengthen our resolve. .
