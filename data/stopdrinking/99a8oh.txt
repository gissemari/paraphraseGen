So if anyone read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/98hlrm/im_just_not_a_good_person/) about my relapse thought I'd update ya'll. Went to work today chatted with the group about the party and had coffee with my married coworker (whom I blacked out and hooked up with during my relapse). Learned some good lessons (common sense for some but BRAND NEW to me) that I thought I'd share. ..First thanks to this subreddit for all the amazing support. Was feeling like utter garbage but everyone's kindness really helped. I was honestly expecting to fall into my usual 2 week depression but... weirdly enough I feel like a normal human today? Don't get me wrong there's still a TON of residual shame but HOLY smokes am I bouncing back so much quicker than I used to (I had a decent stint of sobriety prior to this relapse). **Lesson 1:** **My mental health is SO much better with sobriety in the long term I can handle my emotions rather than giving up and spiralling out of control.**  ..Second chatted with the coworkers everyone laughed at how hungover they were after the party but lots shared about how they regretted drinking that much. I told them I decided to stop drinking. They all supported me and a few lamented that they'd like to do the same. Betting if I had declined to drink I would have had support! **Lesson 2:** **Other people regret drinking as well even people who aren't alcoholics fall to peer pressure. Speak the F up next time.**  ..Lastly the married coworker wanted to meet for a coffee and chat so I agreed. We made small talk for a minute he was great and tried to make it less awkward. He is a nice guy I mean we are friends. We joked about him sneaking out and I apologized for being so drunk. But then... HE ASKED IF WE COULD KEEP IT GOING. Uhm no. I politely declined except all I could think was SERIOUSLY DUDE COME ON. There's a few other details that make me think he's definitely done this before I don't get the impression I'm the first or that he regrets it. He was TOO smooth about it all. Gross. **Lesson 3: I might be a garbage human when I'm drunk... but that doesn't mean I'm a garbage human when sober.** (thanks for the people who responded to my first post who introduced me to this concept - legit new to me!) ..Bonus: No one saw anything I checked with all my rumour mills. I am definitely relieved but feel I got off easy doesn't seem fair but I'll take it. ..Thanks everyone have a great evening!

I'd never heard Lesson 3 before. Thank you for sharing. wish I had reddit when I was quoting the first time. 
Lesson 3 was a huge relief for me. Glad you've shared with us.
I love this! I'm so impressed! How ...adult of you! Mature gracious insightful... I love all of your lessons and think that lesson no two is really important to take with us as fresh sobernauts. We are not the only ones needing support! Well done I will not drink with you today you good person!
That reminds me tomorrow is trash pick up day . I gotta roll the trash filled cans out to the street tonight . By the time I wake up tomorrow they will be empty . All the trash gone . I'll go out and bring the empty free of trash cans back up off the street . They are so much easier to move when the trash is gone from them . I think I'll be more thoughtful of what I fill those cans up with from now on . Not everything is trash . But it's good to have a way to get rid of what really is trash . And to have empty can to start with . Yea taking out the trash is good  ! Knowing what is and isn't trash is even better .  
It seems like you're turning your crappy situation into a great learning opportunity and maybe even a source of strength. Im genuinely happy for you. 
I do believe that if we really want to we can turn almost anything .. we can turn it to our advantage . Sometimes we got to really really want yo! Iwndwyt 
I'm so glad for you. And I don't think you got off easy--you faced all the pain through this and never flinched. You even shouldered more than your share. This is why I think you can freely choose compassion for yourself instead of worrying you are eschewing accountability. You are not at risk of shirking responsibility for your actions; you are not even at risk of shirking responsibility for other people's actions. ;-)
You guys didn't even hook up what does he even want to keep going lol?.. Glad you're bouncing back!..
I love lesson 3.  Please please let it be true in my case also.
Drinking and the desire for more and loss of inhibitors while drunk are part of the disease once you start that train in motion ... you are only responsible for the first one... be aware and mindful ..
YAS GURL...The whole "drunken words are sober thoughts" or any other iteration of thinking that what you do when you are under the influence is somehow the REAL version of who you are is NOT TRUE.  Who came up with that???  Glad you were able to learn from this experience and not spiral.  You are stronger than you know.
That co-worker sounds like a nasty piece of work. Please stay away from him as much as you can he sounds horrible...I am glad you feel more positive about what happened and you are not beating yourself up about it...This is a wonderful group everyone is so supportive.
