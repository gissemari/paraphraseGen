Today is a big deal... Well as is every other day clean and sober... But I always seemed to put those who had 3 years on a pedestal but today I realize that the accomplishment is not about all the hard work but about the gifts I have received. For those of you just trying sobriety out it is hard work but the rewards are unimaginable. Thanks for the support of this subreddit... (I rarely post but long time lurker and wanted to share with everyone.) reach out and remember even though someone has multiple years they mayve struggling and will grateful to share with another alcoholic!
