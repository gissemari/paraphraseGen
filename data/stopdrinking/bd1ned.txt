Relapsed yesterday. Got stressed and had three beers. So worried it's too late for me   I'm 27 turning 28 and I worry my health is already in the toilet and my liver sucks and I ruined myself. I try so hard to be good but I can't I just want to obliterate my thoughts. My therapist is gonna be so disappointed in me...Ugh I'm sorry. I won't drink today. And I will try to be positive even if it doesn't come easy.

Stay strong dude  
Good luck to you you can do this! Even if you fall seven times you win by getting up eight times.
You know the body is pretty amazing at recovery. From my 56 y/o perspective you have a lifetime of healing in front of you. Try and look forward and not behind. (Talking to myself here too!) IWNDWYT
Figurativelyfugue .. at 28 you are not too old for anything. I'm in my 40s and trying this life as a different healthier and all round better way to live. I have kids who need me- a loving husband who I've put through hell- a family that's all but given up on me... but I'm 35 days clean and it's made me a better version of myself..I'm a better mum wife sister and daughter. Please allow yourself the same chance that I gave myself - to see how life could be so much more without the presence of a numbing agent. Sure you feel the sadness the disappointments- but you also feel that great joy and happiness so much more. You are letting yourself feel all human emotion as we're supposed to - real and raw. Every single day it is your time..One day at a time.
Do you have diagnosed alcohol related health problems? You're quite young. The body has an amazing ability to heal itself especially the liver.
