So I posted on here a lot the first few months of my sobriety complaining about how little sleep I was getting.  Not much has changed but now my sleep issues are due more to bad habits than anything else.  During my first two months sober I wasn't going to fall asleep anyway so I became a nightowl and those bad habits (drinking caffeine at night looking at my ipad/playing videogames till 1 2 am) have stuck.  ..The only time I feel in danger of relapsing is when I'm exhausted and not thinking clearly.  I have two weeks until I start teaching/taking classes again so I have time to get this under control.  I'm getting this sleep thing in check starting today.

This is always a good post; and I think you are putting your finger on a lot of what goes on with us in new sobriety.  For me I found that if I stopped drinking coffee after a couple of cups in the morning if I remain active (I frequently bike commute 15 miles round trip to my office and back) and as I get close to bed time shut everything down in that last hour I am able to go to sleep with rarely an issue.  On those rare nights where my mind is racing I pull down my bed covers get in a reclined position on the couch next to my bed and listen to classical music until I nod off.  When I'm aware that that has happened I slide into bed.  Problem solved.  One other thing in recovery our biological time clock usually resets.  It's important to pay attention to that i.e. I'm no longer a nightowl.
