Hello everyone I'm happy to be here with you all.  I am 22 years old &amp; I've been struggling for a while. I have had issues with alcohol since I was a teenager but convinced myself  everyone my age is doing this  which even if it were true doesn't make it ok. I think my main motivation for saying ENOUGH poisoning myself is my health. It clicked at my ripe old age /s I have been setting myself up for a slow and painful death for nothing. ..I drank alone mostly. It started out with big groups but I was young and drinking WAY too much. Shockingly (or not) that ended badly so I haven't been back in the bar scene much which definitely saved me a lot of money and embarrassment. It sounds bad hearing it now but of course I convinced myself it was all good for a few years...I told my partner tonight about my depression withdrawal symptoms. I've gone through mild depressions since I started drinking in my late teens so I'm familiar with how it effects me. This is different; this is a dark terrifying place. ..I'm scared my brain isn't going to recover fully and I physically won't be able to experience happiness again. I'm worried about my dopamine receptors.. if anyone has any information on that subject. This is a place that is so bad it may be the the thing that keeps from picking up another glass. Tonight I'm thankful for the support I received and will in the future. For that I am lucky.  While I am not yet having more intense symptoms I am thinking of those who are. My thoughts are with you guys. You got this. ..Thanks for listening and I wish you all the best on your journey with sobriety. IWNDWYT !!! :)
