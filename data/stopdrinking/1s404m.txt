Had a relapse recently that resulted in a bender after the holiday. ..I blew all my pay (I only work part time) on booze put my job at risk and almost got booted from my house...Last night was the last straw I stupidly (and drunkedly) walked from my apartment to my car in my underwear. One of my neighbors spotted me and called the friggin cops. I get a knock from three officers who gave me a BAC of .34. They wanted to haul me off to jail or the hospital but they called my mom who convinced them to just have my mom pick me up. I probably should've gone with them to the hospital...So now I'm here at my parents detoxing hard just to wonder what the fuck happened...Tomorrow I'm finally going to that 3/4 house that everyone has been telling me to and finally taking that Antabuse that's been at the pharmacy for almost two weeks. I haven't taken it yet because there probably is some alcohol still in my system...Surpisingly my sponsor was not super pissed I went three days without a phone call or meeting...Thanks!

As I'm fond of saying lesson learned. But lesson learned comes with the understanding that I won't make the same mistake twice. If I do that's not a mistake anymore it's intentional. Good luck.
Stop drinking. You can have a life. Good Luck to you.
