And I did relapse last night. I am ok. As far as other than drinking there was no bad behavior. And I did learn a couple of things. When I have actual plans it is time to tell people I have been making plans. Not just that I am thinking about drinking. Also that I will be taking an antabuse tablet the morning My ex husband is supposed to be taking our son for his half of the week. Days that I don't have my son are the hardest and an antabuse tablet on a Saturday will still be having an effect a couple of days later. they make me break out when taken all the time. But twice a week shouldn't be bad. I can do this and I am trying to remember One day at a time really will work. Aim small shoot shoot small.
