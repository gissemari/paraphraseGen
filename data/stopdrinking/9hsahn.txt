Relapse is as serious as a heart attack - fight like a boss!.I meet many young men in recovery when I visit my son in sober living. Three men to a townhouse in a group of 5 houses. They are amazing - so inspiring. I describe it like a frat house but without the drugs booze and sex. It also seems like an all day everyday AA meeting - these guys share their past and their struggles with each other and they bond very quickly..You relapse and you are out. Officially you get 3 days to pass the drug test again but in reality the guys that do just seem to quickly drop off the map. It's a sad time because everyone knows that it could have been them..Guys come and go as they progress in their recovery and get their lives back. Many remain friends after they move on from sober living and visit their buddies regularly at the houses. It's a brotherhood and community in every sense..A few weeks back a young man who had graduated from the houses some time ago and who visited regularly had a relapse. He had been driving under the influence. He happened to be driving on a long bridge when he was stopped by the police pulled over to the shoulder and hand-cuffed. In his intoxicated state and facing jail time he decided to make a run for it and jumped off the bridge. He quickly drowned..This sad story is a lesson that relapse can have very serious unintended consequences that far outweigh a sobriety date reset. Everyone needs a few phone numbers that they can call anytime of the day or night - it could literally save your life.
