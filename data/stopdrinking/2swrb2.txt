This is where I fell off the wagon last time.  I spent ten months back in the drink then resurfaced five months and a day ago...It is different now; I bit the proverbial bullet and changed my lifestyle.  I lost some friends along the way.  And my husband too.  ..It is all pretty tough.  Yesterday and today have each been a struggle.  I don't want to drink but I absolutely understand the appeal.  It makes you believe for a few moments that your problems are gone...I keep reminding myself that I know the difference between a "bad" day and a "lousy" day.  I am grateful these are only lousy. And I am grateful for the strength to start growing again--for real from the inside out.  Sometimes we all feel tiny and vulnerable and that's ok.  This life thing is a package deal!

Congratulations!  You'd be surprised how many people have a date like this in the back of their heads.  "The day I started drinking again."  A friend of mine always makes it a little over a year then goes back out.  There's some kind of block.  I don't really know what it is but I think it's not real.  Good job overcoming it :-)
Good for you it isn't an easy thing to do to be a raging alcoholic and get sober. Keep it up it becomes better and pays off. It's quite the investment 
Do TODAY and don't worry about when you "fell off the wagon" last time.  In fact get off the wagon and walk the walk like the rest of us.  
Congratulations on your achievement!  I haven't been sober that long in the last fifteen years but it *will* happen this year.  Keep up the good work!
