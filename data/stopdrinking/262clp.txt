My near-term goal since my last relapse has been to get enough sober time to feel protective of it. This is now the longest I've been sober continuously since I was 16 (about 16 years ago)...With that to build on my next goal is to get more active in AA. I see a therapist now and talk there but when I go to meetings so far I just sit in the back and listen. Time to start figuring out what it would mean to actively *work* that process instead of just learning from observation...Thanks for the star. Take care!

Congrats on gaining your star /u/DoolittlesGhost!
30 days is a great start getting active in AA is even better. You can only sit on the observation deck for so long until you've seen it all enough times to accurately predict the outcome. Welcome!
