I'm only two days sober and the struggle is real. I've stopped drinking a few times in the past but this time it feels the hardest. I flip flop between waking up at 2am feeling like shit and then by 2pm I'm ready to drink. I have a good job and wonderful kids and I'm terrified I'm going to lose it all if I don't smash the brakes right now. Any advice for a struggling friend would be welcomed.

Don't take that first drink. Cravings do pass but you need to make the choice that feeling like this is temporary so is the drink and then ar ou und and around. Kindling is a real thing. I'm on day 4 and it hasn't been as bad as the last couple of days. Stay strong. Your mind is strong and you can resist. Take it slow break it down in increments of time if that is what it takes. Hydrate shower distractions and playing the tape forward tends to help. 
I found each time it got harder and harder.  So much so that I am at the realization that there is no option to take that first drink again.  On previous attempts I knew this hard reality but there was always a part of my brain that said 'it can't be forever'.  When I would take a drink I would tell myself it's just this one then just tonight it will be easy to stop tomorrow etc.  I have realized that if I could stop at one or two what's the point ?  I drank to get drunk.  After 1 or 2 I would only be planning the next drink and driving myself crazy with the when how and talking myself into it.  That cycle of chasing is horrible.  I have the choice to never have to feel like that and not plan my days around when a liquor store will open or close.  It's actually a relief.  ..&amp;#x200B;..The first few days are the absolute worst but it gets much much better.  ..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
