23 y/o here and a friend from school reached out and invited me to go to AA with her because she heard that I was sober and in recovery. I went to the sunrise meeting this morning and it felt great to be up and around others so early. I grew up in church so it reminded me of that but in a really good way because I felt like I belonged at AA more than I ever did in church (hmm... theres a story there lol). Me and my friend were definitely the youngest there but it was kinda cool to be surrounded by folks at very different points in their lives. It was also a wake up call in some ways. hearing everyone share their experiences reminded me of how critical sobriety is for me if I dont want to end up with the same story at 50. Hearing folks so much older than me describe relapses and recommitment and ending right back in AA just enforces that drinking is a dead end-- I know that I would be the same way that I couldnt drink again if I dont want to also stop again start over again. I got a white chip which I am very grateful for. For a moment I felt like I deserved a blue 90 day chip because I have been sober that long but the more I thought about it i realized that there is no rush. nothing to prove. I have time to get that chip still because I can still be in AA in 90 days and i will still have 197 days of sobriety. the white chip is a reminder that its as important to choose today that I will live sober and work towards true recovery and healing from now on even if I have been already doing my best. Thank you so much SD-- I wouldnt have been able to do this without yall! But it is really nice to be around some flesh people ;) Glad to not be drinking with you all today!

I too am 23 and a lot of what you said has run through my mind as well. It's humbling to sit in rooms with people with years of experience (whether it's drinking sobriety or both) and learn from them. ..."Drinking is a dead end" How right you are!
At the meetings I go to you can pick up whichever chip you want...Even if it was your first meeting you have 90+ days sober so you're entitled to a 3month chip.
