If you are struggling and feeling overwhelmed - just get through the day eat something delicious - find a show to binge on Netflix from your bed.  It works. IWNDWYT!

I needed this. Had zero plans or urges to drink. Arrived at a friend's house where I'm staying for the next few days and they left a bottle of wine chilling in a bucket with a welcome note. They don't know I've stopped...It's a lovely gesture (actually it isn't I hate it) but how do I gracefully leave it alone?

It's a lovely gesture but you don't drink so just pour it down the sink. As you do it think about all the reasons why you don't drink anymore.
I tried seltzer water today (lime) which I learned about here and like it. The carbonation helps and it's not full of sugar. I could chug these suckers and I just might because I won't have a hangover in the morning!
having candies !!
