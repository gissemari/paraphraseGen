Greetings sobernauts! Hope you're having a great sober Monday wherever you are. It is the end of Day 8 for me and I am sober. I had to do my food shopping today and navigate the supermarket without venturing near the alcohol aisle which was tricky as some provisions I needed were is the same location. Why they put deodorant and booze in the same aisle is a mystery to me. Anyhow I got through the shopping trip without being tempted to buy wine or cider. Stocked up on same of my favourite foods instead. Went for a power walk to the beach this evening and it was energising. Cleared my head. So another sober day in the bag. I've enjoyed being on SD today. Reading your posts is so helpful to me. Thanks ladies and gents for sharing. Best wishes to you all especially those of us still struggling.:-)

Congratulations!
Deodorant and booze: one stops sweat while the other one causes it!..Good job on 8 days - keep it going!
Well done on achieving yet another day in sober land and on doing the power walk I really need to do more activity. I have walked the dog (puppy still at nine months) twice today but need to do more. Well done on the shopping too. I try not to look down the wine aisle but always take a glance and as you say it's hard as other things are near I have taken to drinking loads of sparkling water which is close to the booze!.Anyway well done and may we all stay strong and sober.   
Great job on day 8!!..Power walking to the beach sounds AMAZING! i hope you enjoyed yourself :)..IWNDWYT!
