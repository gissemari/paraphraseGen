I am feeling overwhelmed right now. I work full time and go to school full time. For whatever reason I thought taking 3 literature classes would be a smart idea... and the fact that I haven't completed a semester since fall '07... I am changed and sober now! Well yes... In some ways I am changed. However I am finding depressive episodes are really difficult to deal with when working and going to school full time. Maybe less work maybe less school; maybe just blow my brains out. ..I can't focus on my homework. I can't focus on my job. I can't focus on my sobriety. I have left myself with very little time yet too much time in my head. I often forget how easy it is to lapse on taking action; and how difficult life becomes after just a few days of inaction... things just seem to pile up :/ oh well live and learn. I scheduled a new appointment with my psychiatrist have a plan to go to a meeting after class and focus my attention on the here and now...Please post either your hardships you are struggling with or a clever song to ease the mind from over thinking!

[Chords of Life] (https://youtu.be/4vVRaAtKQAE) for something mellow. ..[Glass Prison] (https://youtu.be/gwDgX7Un3AQ) if you want to hear an incredibly technical and spectacularly arranged song about the first step. ..
I went to school full time and worked when I started out on this road.  I found that so long as I looked after my sobriety everything worked out. By that I mean that I went to regular meetings.  They took precedence over everything else.  If I didn't have sobriety I had nothing.  I now have two degrees and but I still have to find the right job...Congrats on 1000 days that is an amazing achievement.  Keep it simple  \o/..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8eQR5DMous
Dude.... First of all:       . Kick ass on the 1000 days!! ..Glad you're doing the right thing by going to your psychiatrist and not letting it fester too long. I think we as humans many times have a tendency to put things off that we know we need to do. I don't think that's an addict trait I think it's just people. The problem with us if we put off something really needed it can have much worse ramifications than putting something off might have for a normie. ..I am really digging Postmodern Jukebox lately. http://youtu.be/sB6HY8r983c
