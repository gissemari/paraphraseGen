Help. Woken up from vivid dreams and feel so panicky. Not sure if I'm actually awake. I think I'm having a panic attack. Depersonalization and derealisation. I've felt this before and I hate it. Am I still drunk from last night??? I am so anxious. Please help me stop. IWNDWYT (relapsed badly the past few weeks. Downing a bottle of wine a night)

Hi please don't panic. I don't know how to help you but I can listen and understand. I suffer with anxiety but with a hangover things can get blown out of proportion in your mind. Get through the day and know that I will not drink with you today.
Focus on your breath... YouTube some meditation videos (there are some for panic attacks) to help you get through the worst of it. I know you must feel awful right now but know that you are not alone and you are inherently okay. Deep breath. IWNDWYT.
Thank you. I'm feeling better now. But I don't want to forget the feeling so I am not tempted to drink. 
Hangovers get worse as you becoming physically dependent. Not just physical symptoms mental too. I had a mental breakdown 2 weeks ago. I had to find a meeting. Im still scared to go and talk to people people scare me...but I'm doing it. My advice is find a meeting.
