I finally made it to 30 days after a really bad relapse. It only lasted 10 days and 4 times of drinking for me to realize again why I quit drinking in the first place. In just 10 days I lost everything. My job. Almost lost my fiance. Almost lost my eye. Definitely lost a bunch of respect i had built back up for myself. I was facing 3 1/2 years in prison ((all charges were dropped with tons of thanks to my fiance)). Even the opportunity to get my son full time. I lost. It. All. I had been so so proud of myself and for whatever stupid reason thought i could handle it. I was sadly mistaken!..Now. I am fully committed to working the 12 steps and going to AA meetings daily. Sometimes even twice. I am constantly reading AA literature. I even started going to a church that i really love ((and I hate church lol)) I have really found the inner peace that i don't think I had last time and it is an amazing feeling. I believe in myself now more than i ever have...And holy shit if i can do this so can you!!..IWNDWYT!!

Somehow I find that each of my relapse is worse than the previous one even if it lasts less. I manage to do more harm in a weekend than I did previously in a month. Accidents relationship issues health everything...&amp;#x200B;..Looks like you went through some tough time but you're on the right track now! Congrats on month sober!
You got this! IWNDWYT
