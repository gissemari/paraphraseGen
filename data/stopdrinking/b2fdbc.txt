Morning all..Hope you are all well.  ..Had a great AA meeting last night the reading was about resentment and it spoke volumes to me.  .I know AA is not for everyone and the religous conatations can be a bit much but here in the UK its very low key.  But if you can make it to a meeting do for me all I have found is a bunch of people who care and a comminity.  .This disease wants you to be alone it wants you to push everyone away so it can feast on your sanity and soul.  Dont let it reach out.  ..Ok enough rant.  ..Day 9 works going to be a nightmare but I know I can do this without getting stressed and if I do it wont end in me drinking.  ..Have a good day all and let me know if you are struggling.  ..Iwndwyt.  ..
