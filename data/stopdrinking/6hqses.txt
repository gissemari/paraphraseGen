Ended up back to square one. Been drinking quite heavily every day for the last 4 weeks. Not even sure why? Just been picking up continuously it's become a very strong habit that I'm almost doing without thinking. Today I need to break this habit. Right now though I'm taking it an hour and even a minute at a time.

Welcome back you got this! The cravings will pass.
Good for you for starting again. I understand that bewilderment at what you have been doing. Glad you are having a moment of clarity on the need to stop. Hold onto it!
Welcome back.  Most of us have had a badge reset.  I am sleeping great and I've saved $288.  What's not to love?  I won't drink with you today.
Made it past the first 24! Now on to a new day and another 24 hours of sobriety. Slept pretty well too which was a relief. Already feeling more clear headed. God that stuff is poison.
