So I was at a friend's house yesterday afternoon.  We were BBQing and swimming and the kids were playing.  These are my "mom" friends and completely unassociated with my "drinking" friends.  They have no idea about my struggle with alcohol.  They may have seen me have a mimosa during an afternoon of baking cookies but that's about it.  I told one of them one time that I quit drinking because I didn't like it anymore I liked to get drunk too much (haha in my best mom laugh).. But no one knows that is a problem in my life.  ..So it's over 100 degrees here and it was such a fun day and her husband offered me a beer.  He cracked open an ice cold beer straight out of a cooler with condensation running down the sides. "Oh no thanks" (continue putting sunscreen on and pretending to be extremely busy)... fuck that looked good... then each of the other ladies "I think I'm going to have a beer that looks good!"..Fuck...I could have one... or two.. and since I haven't drank in awhile I'd get a really good buzz especially if I chugged it.  No one would know I was buzzed... hell no one would think anything of it... this is probably my only chance to do this since I can't in front of my family or with friends at work because they are all aware of my drinking problem....I won't have to tell anyone and keep my sober time...But I didn't.  I'd be lying to myself and letting myself down... and everything I've worked so hard for would be flushed right down the toilet.  Even though no one would ever find out... ..And I was ok with not having a beer... but for a split second I had those thoughts... then my thoughts went straight to this sub and how I couldn't wait to share this story.  I'm glad I stayed strong but it reminded me what a fine line there is with sobriety. ..And by the way.. they each had one beer... ONE...that was it.. one beer on that 100 degree plus day while swimming and BBQing... LOL... Seriously who does that?  And that is exactly why I am an alcoholic and they are not...Thanks for letting me share!.Be kind and be patient fellow SDers!.<3 SW

&gt;Seriously who does that?..No shit! I'll never understand that either.
&gt; **And that is exactly why I am an alcoholic and they are not.**..*sigh* ..Pretty humbling for me when I finally figured that out.  :( ..GREAT JOB!  ...&gt;**they each had one beer... ONE...that was it.**....Here's a confession from me (one of those long-time sober people.) ..Back in March my husband and I went out of town for his birthday... and I was watching the people at the next table pour an inch or two of wine into their glass.  ..I sat there - staring - my mind was **screaming**. .*"Oh FFS!  If you're gonna have wine have a flipping GLASS of wine!"* ..My husband noticed me staring... and quickly said playfully .."OK THEN!  How about some dessert????"  ..&gt;**I'm glad I stayed strong but it reminded me what a fine line there is with sobriety.**..My Disease is how I think...My Sobriety is how I act. ...Most of the times these days they are pretty close to the same thing. :) ..But SOMETIMES - even still and now - I also get one of those .."Maybe... just one!"  thoughts.  ..Thank goodness like you I think it through and don't. ..Thank you for sharing this!  You made me laugh nod and cheer!
Oh man well done for surfing through that urge!
I've had a couple of those recently (moments not beers!) and was feeling bad about it. My sponsor just said "we all get 'em it's no bad thing. It's how we deal with it is important." And that made me feel safe about it all. Like I wasn't fucking up. He's a good guy my sponsor and you're a damned good poster :)
Fuck ya! Same thing happened at my wife's parents house in the pool. They didn't know I had stopped drinking and that is literally all I use to do over there... and all her parents do. They are the fortunate that don't have a problem... but her other siblings does and she is juggling swords like I use to after drinking that first sip. I had several struggles but I stayed strong and am even happier now to read that we both made it through. Keep it up home-girl! I'm chasing your high score.
That's it... I am buying tons of sunscreen. The perfect SMOKESCREEN to avoid beer is SUNSCREEN! :) All kidding aside great job!
Hanging out with earth people in early sobriety can put you in temptations way. Good for you that you didn't breakdown and drink.
Good work and thanks for sharing...Have you considered that it might not be the worst thing in the world if your mom friends (or anyone else) knew that you don't drink anymore? I share that information pretty liberally and I get almost universal respect from people. More than that you'll find other people who are in the same boat as you or people who need to know that there are people in the same boat as them...And most importantly it will make it less likely that people will offer you that beer.
And thats how i reset my badge...but gj OP
&gt;especially if I chugged it..That's how my dysfunctional thoughts progress - starts off with a deceptive 'just one' beer slowly sipped commercial then thoughts of chugging to maximise the buzz and other crazy shit make an appearance. Then I wake up and shut ALL my crazy thoughts down. Luckily it's rare.
This was hilarious. Thank you!
The most utterly insane thing we can do as alcoholics is take ONE drink. .."If you're like me and you wouldn't waste your time on one motherfuckin' drink welcome to Alcoholics Anonymous" is what one man says every time he is finished sharing at my home group. 
Not to sound like a total creeper or anything... but I was interested and went back and read some of your earlier posts. ..You have clearly come so far and are doing so well. The Mother's Day card in particular was beautiful must have meant the world to you. ..I digress - you made the right choice. Learning to deal with those little mad moments is one of the hardest parts of getting sober. You've done so well. I'm proud of you. 
Ignore the one beer thing they're not like you and you're not like them. You didn't even need "that one beer." That one beer will fuck you up and you know it one... two... three... twelve. Tomorrow the next day next week. Then all to do over again...What I keep in mind is that first day of not drinking it was fucking horrible just plain brutal. The world was going to end that day. It didn't but I sure as hell don't want to repeat that day...My point? You don't have to repeat that day because of your strength. Keep plugging on and well done!

Thank you for sharing! I need stories like yours to get me through  my own "just one" itches. 
Your friends and family wouldn't know about the ~~one beer~~ two beers you had with your friends but they'd probably notice the 26er you'd have picked up later that night!
Good job with your decision!
Yeah my friends the normal drinkers could have a couple and stop. Me I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there so I could get home and drink myself into a proper stupor. Good on you for dealing with that. ..I've been having to go through that as well lately in particular friday's after quitting time at work. The honeymoon of sobriety is over for me and I'm dealing with some strong urges to drink lately.  I made through another friday though. 
You inspire me to stay sober!
Good share.  Good willpower. Good introspection. You are on the right track! Yeah they only had 1 beer because they aren't like us. &gt;And that is exactly why I am an alcoholic and they are not..Exactly!..&gt; No one would know I was buzzed......&gt; Even though no one would ever find out... ..You would know. You are the only person (besides us) that really cares about recovery. Only think about how it would make you feel. Sure they wouldn't care. That's just that part of your brain that wants the beer trying to trick. Obviously you would know. Could you even enjoy the beer. How much beer would it take to wash down all that guilt and sense of disappointment in yourself? You did real good that day. Keep it up!.
GOOD FOR YOU!! I'm very proud of you! So happy you made the right decision. :)
That is super awesome! One of the reasons my drinking tormented me so much at the end is because I KNEW that I couldn't drink "responsibly" or "moderately" and I would have to continually lie to myself and others in order to maintain my drinking. I hope to never lie to myself in a way that ends up with me drinking ever again...You made a good decision to not drink and I hope you continue to make it every day!
&gt;And by the way.. they each had one beer... ONE.....I am always shocked by this kind of behavior.  When I hang out with other people and they are drinking I see what I was always too drunk to notice before... people do not drink as much as I thought they did.  
&gt;Seriously who does that?  And that is exactly why I am an alcoholic and they are not....Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. A lot of the time I get a table who will only drink one beer with dinner. It still frustrates me and luckily I'm at work so I can stay busy but come on drink up people! (I'm a server if that wasn't clear) 
I love this story especially the "who does that?" part because I was thinking the same thing. It's hard to understand at first that we are different when it comes to alcohol. I've learned that other people that don't have a problem also don't understand why I am the way I am.
I appreciated the fact that you said you would be letting YOURSELF down; not your family or friends.  You are approaching it the right way.
