Long night at work. Exhausting. Teaching random teenagers how to cook. A new one every month or so. I get home and roomie has another random over. They're asleep. I don't have to talk to a stranger which is nice but I lose my only friend for another night. Schedules are tough sometimes...Coworkers have been telling me that I'm grumpy. That I look half alive. I told them that I've just been sick. I suspect they all think that I'm just stoned. Truth is the detox cycle has become quite familiar. I know that I'll be okay again in a day or so...I raised some turkey's. Started in the spring. The plan was to cook organic bird for my very non-organic and traditional family. I was told I had to work for Thanksgiving and had the family make other arrangements... It turns out I don't have to work for Thanksgiving but I can't bring myself to tell my family because I would rather sit in my underwear in front of the TV drinking all day then deal with them...The worst part is that I know after a full week that I'll be prime to have a relapse. When thanksgiving rolls around I know that it will take very little to convince myself that it's all okay. I can just have a few and wake up tomorrow feeling fine. Maybe even refreshed...So I make lists. Lists with multiple headers. Headers with sub headings. I managed to cross off 10 things from my list today before work but the list grew by 4 in the process.  Cleaning. Laundry. Chores with the animals. Getting the lawn ready for winter...Tomorrow I'll take a bird from the freezer. Put it in a brine to thaw for a couple few days. ..Sleep may be a far away dream. But at least I've earned it this time

Nothing changes if nothing changes.  What actions are you going to take to get out of the hamster wheel you've been in?..Especially in the beginning I needed *In Real Life* support from AA when nothing I was doing on my own was working...Also you can hide your badge (shows 381-days) by un-checking the box in the sidebar that reads: "Show my flair on this subreddit. It looks like:".  You can see it as a reminder of how long you've been on this journey but no one else can.
