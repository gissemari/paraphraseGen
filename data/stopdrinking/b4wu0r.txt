I posted about a week ago when I was newly sober regarding the context of my relapse and battle with depression. I just wanted to check in...I've successfully made it through my first week and made some positive development. I'm in the process of moving home with my parents and intend to stay here for the next 5-6 months while I get my head together. As stated in my previous post I found my room mate dead in the apartment where I had been living. I was actually fine being there before my partner left me as I was seldom there alone. Once I was spending all my time there my relapse and decline in mental health happened. I feel relieved to be out of that environment though extremely uncomfortable living with my parents at almost 30. I also joined an AA group that I like...I had a doctor's appointment started anti-depressants and got referrals for both grief counselling and a CBT course that's covered by OHIP (Ontario version of Medicare). I've reached out to a number of psychotherapists in the area as well so hopefully I will find someone I can work with. I'm in the process of planning my future and am applying to college programs for the fall to help me move towards my goal of working in mental healthcare. I realized the core of my issue was that I was going through an extremely difficult personal time while I also lacked a broader goal. I'm hoping school and working full-time will help me to rediscover my sense of purpose and lift me out of this listlessness...On a less pleasant note I'm really struggling with facing my emotions without alcohol to numb them. I'm hurting so much simultaneously mourning my best friend my relationship and the possible future with my ex-girlfriend. I've been ruminating like crazy over that relationship and I hate it. I know this rumination isn't helping my depression but I also don't know how to stop. It's like I'm really just starting to move to acceptance with the loss of my room mate and I haven't had the energy to process and grieve for my relationship yet despite it ending two months ago. I hate this. I think I might legitimately hate my ex for leaving me so soon after a major loss...Despite this things are moving in a healthier direction. It's just hard to see when I'm still feeling so much pain. Thank-you guys so much for this community. Though I'm not the most active member reading your posts on my front page has been massively helpful this past week. I will not drink with you today.
