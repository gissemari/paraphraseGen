I am so much less self obsessed. I used to constantly talk about myself in groups always steering conversation back around to my opinions struggles feelings etc.. so embarrassing. I now am a normal person who enjoys learning about other people and topics completely unrelated to myself! What a relief!

hahahahaha YES!!! I can 100% relate..it's like how did my friends love me so much? some of them are just like old me though. sometimes I just sit at a party and everyone around me talks about themselves while sipping on their drinks. louder... and louder... lol
