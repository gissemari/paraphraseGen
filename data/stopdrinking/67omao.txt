All of you guys on double & triple digit days sober are awesome...I think for some of us we might be beating ourselves up not being able to make it out of single digits. Or even make it past 2 days sober...I keep a spreadsheet and each morning I write down how much I drank the prior day. You have to learn to be honest with yourself and this is a good way...Now I can see:.. - days sober per week or per month. - total drinks per week or month..I keep trying to maintain sober streaks but when I fail I know I'm not truly starting back at '0'. I can see that my weekly or monthly average keeps getting lower. ..I drank less in April than March even if I never made it past 3 days sober.  In May it'll be even better.

That's a good plan! Although I have now been more than 20 days without a drink my prior streak of 100 days included days when I drank but not more than one or two drinks in a single day. I counted those days as a win because I was able to maintain. I've only been flat-out drunk three times since November 2016. That's much better than my previous average of three times per week. Baby steps. 
Thank you for posting this! I'm glad someone else does this too. &amp; I love the idea of using a spreadsheet. 
I really like this idea. I've had far more sober days than drinking days in the last year but I keep resetting my badge. A spreadsheet showing progress would be very encouraging. Thanks!..
