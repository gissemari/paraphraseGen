*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..I absolutely love hosting check-in! I remember when I kept relapsing I thought I'd never get enough sobriety to be the host so I am beyond excited to be here. ...It's been a great week so far and I have the day off today. I plan to keep busy and stay out of trouble! ...I will not drink with you today!

I will not drink with you today
Flooded in again. Guess I won't be drinking with anyone Thursday. A couple more inches and I get to shop for a new truck. 
I will not drink today no matter what happens good or bad.
I will not drink with you today!
Oh man! I missed Wednesday's check in and it was my birthday and my day 40! Anyway-I didn't drink on my 56th birthday and IWNDWYT!  
Need a badge reset. Had the worst week in a long time and gave in and drank a couple boxes of wine. Now I feel fucking terrible and more depressed than I have in a long time. I was doing so good going to the park and losing weight. Now I just feel like a piece of shit. I've been avoiding this place like crazy the past few days. I'm ashamed to ask for the reset but I need it to hold me accountable. Once again I'm at day 1. I will not drink with you tonight. 
IWNDWYT. I think the 6ish month sober stretch did a lot for me that wasn't undone in 3.5 months of quickly getting back into my old habits. Not nearly as sore in the organs and joints this time around. And equipped with the knowledge that I definitely can't maintain drinking in moderation. I don't want 1 or 2 drinks I want 10 or 25. But I want even more to not feel like shit constantly. The only time it's ever comfortable are between drinks 6-12. After 12 it's a chore to keep it going and a hangover is a bitch when work gets in the way and you can't start the day hair of the dog. Don't miss sneaking sips mouthwash at work when the withdrawals kick in and my heart is pounding.
IWNDWYT... despite the fact that it's day 2 and I just received an invitation for Friday night drinks on a Thursday. 
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
IWNDWYT
Iwndwyt 
I am not drinking today! 
IWNDWYT. ..I'm eating too much Halloween candy but doing it soberly and tracking it properly. ..Mising out on 600+ calories a night in booze certainly helps make room for fun sized treats. 
Got 11 months recently yay...I'm almost one year sober now cause of doing the steps in aa and going to regular meetings. Now I live a great fulfilling life. :)  if u r struggling ever....that was a great learning experience for me. Perhaps it'll help u too.
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! This ones for the mayor
I won't drink with you today.
Dear Thursday nope no way not today. Best regards me.
Checking in!..&amp;#x200B;..30 days is getting close.  I can taste it.
Only beginning my third day but I will not drink with you all today!
Day 3 - made it!! IWNDWYT
Day #6 and meeting #5 tofay. Haven't been spending much time on Reddit but learning a lot anyway. IWNDWYT. 
7 months today. Won't be drinking   
I had such a good night's sleep last night finally.  Sober sleep is wonderful. Day 12 for me and I will NOT be drinking with you today.
Just woke up. Made it to day 5 and woke up well rested and I am feeling better every day. And off course I will nog be drinking today! Good luck to all of you today!
IWNDWYT BC IT IS MY 100TH DAY. I will wait a few hours until my flair catches up to make an official post cuz I'm just that damn excited. 
Iwndwyt!
Morning all! Busy day ahead today at work glad I'll be capable of being productive. IWNDWYT!
Only slept 4 hours today but I woke up with energy...IWNDWYT
Hi eveyone
Morning from the UK! Study day today in London - at least it's a day off work!..Doggy with her paw cancer was seen for review at vets last night. They think they caught it all when they amputated her toe and they also checked her lymph glands etc which appear okay. Am starting to feel more reassured and hopeful now... There was one day when she was diagnosed when I did want a drink- I could taste it in my mouth and throat and I heard Mr WhineyMcLoserFace the relapse lawyer in my head saying " Well it would be understandable to drink really - you've just found out your dog has cancer- and you can always start again tomorrow..."..I went to a meeting instead and the urge and thoughts went away. It's been a while since that twat Mr WhineyMcLoserFace the Relapse Lawyer rocked up. So I sent him packing again...Have a great day out there sobernauts! I will not drink with you today  
Not today!
Thank you! I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT! It's been a rough week with a ton of overtime but it would of been 1000x harder with a constant hangover! Getting closer and closer to my first sober month in a years :)
It's still Wednesday here in Oregon. Didn't drink today and I will not drink with you on Thursday either!! 
I'm not going to drink today  
Good morning beautiful people! I won't drink with you today!   
 You can't keep dancing with the devil and wondering why you're still in hell ..Not anymore! IWNDWYT
Not gonna drink today
Got two intense personal news vectors yesterday.  At least one directly related to drinking.  I am grateful that I do not need a drink to hide from these things.  I can deal.  I have some support.  I have resilience.  IWNDWYT
Good morning fellow sobernauts! Once again I will not drink with you today. Stay strong everyone... 
My hardest day of the week but  IWNDWYT!
Love checking in and reading the posts. Nothing better to keep you motivated. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
IWNDWYT 
Morning all! 52 days under my belt (flair is wrong!) - it will be 53 days once I get through today!!! IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT 
I'm thinking a lot today about alcohol in kind of a reflective mood. Currently 146 days sober. I will not drink with you today. 
Good morning from Scotland!..Creeping up towards that month but right now everything is just... Okay. Have to brace myself for this weekend when Halloween drinking kicks off for my friends and all the parties are happening. Ugh. I wish I could stay home with a movie instead.....Whatever. I Will Not Drink With You Today SD! :)
I will not drink with you today!
I'm not drinking today!
IWNDWYT! 25 days... (Badges still not working obvs)  ... Excited for 30 ...!
Good Morning!..IWNDWYT

Day 93.  I will not drink with you today.
I will not be drinking today no matter what happens today.
Hey SD IWNDWYT!
Yay Picardy!  I'm glad you have enough sobriety to host our check in and you're doing a mighty fine job.  I will certainly not be drinking with all of you today  
Good morning from Alabama I missed yesterdays check in site was down a little bummed by that cause it is very important to me to check in and read the post to start my sober journey each day and make this commitment to not drink today. So therefore I will not drink with you all today be well and safe out there.. Peace
Good Thursday morning. I've been having a lot of emotional ups and downs. I've been pretty explosive and unpredictable with my loved ones but I haven't had a drink... I hope they'll understand and forgive me. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT - day 4. Working from home next 2 days which would ordinarily be a trigger for each evening - I wouldn't drink on the job. But home working would mean I'd not need to be up early or drive or get dressed so the next day I could be hungover in private. Not this week!
Good morning everyone I hope you all have a safe and sober day IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT  
No drinking here congrats on 70 days u/-picardy-third-! I loved doing the check in as well amazing how many of us there are!!
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT
Count me in :)
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
I'll join you and stay sober today.    
IWNDWYT

Checking in......IWNDWYT
Checking in today! Yay!
IWNDWYT
Badge reset. IWNDWYT.
Not drinking today!
No booze today! Maybe this is my second check in for the day as I have been busy as hell and cant remember!!
Tired beyond belief tonight after working super-late last night and being up early for a phone meeting that didn't happen. But I got there with my crucial deadlines and a cool new client literally appeared out the blue - an industry association in the environmental tech space with one of the coolest CEos I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Gives a gal a certain inner smile to be called up as a "captain's pick" for some work! Not celebrating with booze - sticking to my sparkly water and not drinking today not tonight and not tomorrow either. Happy almost-Friday everyone!.
I will not drink with you today.
Checking in for day 5. I will not drink with you today gladly. Haven't felt this free in many years!
not drinking today
I will not drink with you today!
Hey everyone I will not drink with you today! I will instead go for a workout eat healthy have some tea and wake up feeling like a human :) 
Digging your gratitude!  Today will be 2 weeks for me and I'm not gonna screw that up!  IWNDWT!..
Good morning everyone. I will not drink with y'all on this rainy chilly day. 
I will not drink with you today!  
IWNDWYT!  
IWNDWYT- made it longest I ever have (32 days) before falling off. Sucks just as badly as I Remember. Here's to committing to today and making it longer this streak. 
I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today
I completed my 2 weeks of sobriety.  Looking forward to the next 2 one day at a time. Iwndwyt. 
Day 4. Feeling confident about a booze free Thursday.
I will not drink today. I go to chinese and watch venom afterwards. It's pretty good to be unemployed again and have my own time to do things and improve some skills that values. I have been over a year with my girlfriend and she says is willing to engage with me and that she haven't been in touch with such a wonderful human being ever. Well I'm pretty much happy and taken. Eventhough i see myself as nobody going nowhere. Well let's see how it all goes one day at a time. Have a great day everybody! 
I will not drink alcohol today 
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT
Not today. Not today. Not today!!!!!
I will not watch any cable news today or drink for that matter.   Getting that early morning jog in before another bout of rain hits NC.  ..Have a fab day everyone!  IWNDWYT...  ey.                      
Sober today.
Checking in! 15 days under my belt now. 
I will not drink with you today!   
I will not drink with you all today 
I'm meeting a friend later and I know he will want to go for a drink but I have too much to do tomorrow and I will get a 7up instead. Not worth it. IWNDWYT. 
I'm not drinking today 
Day 9. I was quite anxious last night and my brian thought a drink (or 10) would help. I didn't cave and I slept really well. I will not drink with you today
I will not drink today 
I will not drink today.
Hit a meeting last night and ran into a kid I've had beers with at the local pub. Nice kid 10 days in. Great reminder. Not drinking today.

I will not drink today.
30 days today the longest I've gone without drinking since I realized I needed to quit. Its not been all great but I feel fantastic and able to face the not so great stuff. I will not drink with you today!
Hey SD!..I will not drink with you today...Have a great Thursday!.
**IWNDWYT**!**!**!**!**  Rock on SD!  XOXO
Three weeks complete. Just found this article on The Guardian website worth a read [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/no-healthy-level-of-alcohol-consumption-says-major-study](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/no-healthy-level-of-alcohol-consumption-says-major-study)..IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT!
Glorious sober morning soberniks!  I hope all will have smurftastic day because you resisted the Evil Oppressor's chains and shackles for another revolution of this fine planet. Vigilance! IWNDWYT 
i will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT.  I made it through three days of a business meeting that I normally drink heavily at.  Even decline the late night invite to a colleagues room to share a bottle of red and watch the ball game.  Was in bed at 9:36.  
I will not drink today!
Grateful for a new day one in which my choices will not be dominated by negligent selfishness. IWNDWYT
Good morning. I'm starting day 5302 sober and IWNDWYT.
I have missed checking in the past two days. I've been distracted and a little down about an injury keeping me from physical activity. Last night it kept me shifting around a lot trying to find a comfortable position and not sleeping well. I'm really trying to take it easy taking anti-inflammatories and resting it...Not a reason to drink and it hasn't crossed my mind but this is SD and being sidelined could have been a trigger in the past so there's the relevant statement for today.  Ho hum.../pityparty...I do not drink; therefore I will not drink with you today.
Congrats on 10 weeks and thanks for the check-in this week -picardy! Robert Louis Stevenson said..."Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant."  I view the daily check-in as a common seed planted in all of us each day. I am grateful for the opportunity to be here each day. I will NOT drink with you today! Peace
Day 5. Back to work today after a few days off due to a fever. Looking forward to being productive after being a lump on the couch for 48 hours. One day at a time IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
it's day 12 and it was a cake walk up until now but my anxiety is now in full force. The emotions I've felt have been very real and raw. I don't have a desire to drink. I don't want to feel like this anymore though. I'm hoping my brain chemistry is still fixing itself out and that I can work through this. For right now it can just be overwhelming and tough. IWNDWYT
Nope.
IWNDWYT 
Day 69 and Im definitely in for another day of sobriety.  
Good morning! I just found you all and I am so happy to be here. This morning marks day five for me and although I know I'm not done detoxing I feel a little better. ..Today I will not be drinking! 
I will not drink today but I will be confident &amp; drive safe to and from this interview I will fkn rock :) Thank you for everything u/ForDB !!..[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
24 days strong. Let's make that 25 :) 
I will not drink today.
Good morning everyone! iwndwyt!
I'm not going to drink alcohol today 
4 weeks today won't be drinking today. 
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT! I made it through the conference and it was so much better without alcohol! Even at the big party last night instead of wondering when I would get a drink when I would get the next one etc until I finally did something I was embarrassed about and just enjoyed the music and food and people and have nothing to be regret today. Wahoo!!!!
I will not drink with you today!
It's a beautiful morning and IWNDWYT friends. 
IWNDWYT  
Iwndwyt .Almost a month now 
IWNDWYT
Happy Thursday!  Day 2 again.  IWNDWYT! 
Just for today I will not drink. I will also try to be more mindful.
IWNDWYT.  
I had a couple dreams last night where I relapsed and I woke up pretty scared and disoriented. But I reminded myself that it's just a dream and I'm ready to not drink with you all today!
Congrats! Love the day off. I'm working today but I slept well I'm prepared and ready to go. IWNDWYT!
Yesterday was my first birthday sober in my adult life. It was also the best birthday. My boyfriend flew my parents in (they live 5000 miles away) ave it was a total surprise. He's amazing. If I was drinking I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much. IWNDWYT
I will make damn sure not to drink today. I'm doing the work and it feels good. Here's to a happy (but rainy) Thursday. 
For I think only the second time this Sober-Tober I woke after sunrise and thus missed the day "officially" begin. There is no point to that. Just sayin'. Also sayin' IWNDT. There *is* a point to *that*.
I will not drink today. 
I'm not going to drink today. ..I think it'll probably be harder than the past 5 days. I had my first cravings yesterday. I didn't give in but they were there and I had to use the old "not today. Maybe tomorrow but just not today" ruse to quiet them...My best streak of the past two months was 9 days. I want to beat that.
Checking in to say I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today..
I will not drink with you today
One more day! So grateful for this life. IWNDWYT!
Good morning. I will not drink with you today. 
IWNDWYT.  Day one for me.  Good morning everyone.  :)
I will not drink today!!
Resetting today I will not drink today
60 days today tomorrow will be 61...IWNDWYT..
You'll never get what you deserve if you remain attached to what you're supposed to let go of..I truly believe this and the thought of new doors opening for me keep me going! IWNDWYT! 
IWNDWYT! 
Treating myself with chick-fil-a this morning :) Excited to not feel like shit and looking forward to another sober day..Also where is my flair?  I got a response from the bot but no flair :(
I will not drink with you today.
Me too! Me too!
I'm not drinking today really wanted to have a few beers last night but I didn't and I'm happy about that. I'm sure the struggle will be real tonight as well always is when I get this close to friday and I've gone all week without but I know better. 
Good morning! I went to a meditation class last night and learn a few different meditations. It was amazing. I plan on doing at least 20 minutes a day. IWNDWYT...P.S. My badge hasn't gone up for a couple of days. i should be at day 35 now. Anyone else having this issue?
Helping a friend wire a building and wow would I not be able to handle the extra work after work if I was still on the hooch. IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! IWNDWYT! IWNDWYT!

IWNDWYT
It has been a great week- I'm caught up on schoolwork my house is clean everything is done. I managed to get a couple bigger house cleaning projects done recently in case I decide to end it. Still broke but at least I care and won't go in a small debt because I can willingly ignore my finances by drinking. Today I will have to guard carefully as I am being handed a couple of bigger projects to lead at work and success is usually one of my rationalizations. Going to a meeting today that will set off my anxiety. But I'm going to do it and will get through it fine. I knew today would be hard so I spent last night cooking for my staff and co workers. We are going to have a huge lunch of ribs fajitas chorizo and eggs chicken chips etc. and I won't set it out until noon. I won't do that because I will eat a decent amount so when I get home (probably leaving early because of so many hours worked) I will be full and that will help me not want to drink. I hope I nap for a couple of hours. I just have to make it through today. Tomorrow I will re evaluate.
Today I will not drink. Day 7! How do you get the number of days to show up next to your name?
I'm not drinking with you again today. 
I won't drink today!
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today :)
I will not drink today. ..This weekend is looking like it could be a challenge the weather will keep me cooped up inside and in a poor mood due to friends bailing on plans. But I'll stay strong. .
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT!
currently hungover and hating myself IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT!
IWNDWYT! Day 4... Went to kickboxing last night instead of sitting at my parents house because I knew that would put me in a negative headspace. Here's to making better decisions! 
IWNDWYT!
Had a dream I had a drink and worried when I woke up but then realized it was just a dream. I will not have a drink today! 
Let's stay sober everyone!
IWNDWYT
No drinking today or the next 24hrs.
Day 2 first time trying this in earnest. I'm still feeling kind of shaky &amp; sweaty from coming out of a bender Monday/Tuesday... not pleasant. It's easier to just stop. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT everyone. 
Pledging today 
I will not drink with you all today!.
The days pass no matter so might as well make them good days. IWNDWYT my friends  .
4th day today and I am NOT drinking. 
I did not drink on October 18th..Nor did I drink on the 19th 20th or 21st..I didn't drink on the 22nd 23rd or 24th...That's 7 whole days I didn't drink...Today is another day also I won't drink with you...Thank you all.
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today   
I will not drink or do drugs with you today.
Day 7 here this is the longest I've gone without a drink in at least 3 years. Heading to my first AA meeting and a little nervous. Regardless IWNDWYT!
Checking in one day down here.  Congrats on 100 OP!
In a really good place this week after something of a wobble last week. This place certainly helped as did journaling exercise and my great friends and family (they didn't really do anything other than just be great and that kept me happy)...Belted out 57km in the last 3 days in under 4 hours and 2 decent gym sessions on the weights too I've attained a whole new level of fitness to anything I'd ever had before in my life and I just turned 40 earlier this year! Mad. ..Today I woke up 3 minutes before my alarm fresh as a daisy. Absolutely glorious. That shit didn't happen when I was drinking largely because I would never actually set an alarm (what's the point when I'm going to ignore it anyway?). ..I really much prefer the version of me I am when I'm not drinking by a factor of many many multiples. And that self-respect feeds back into not feeling such a need to numb myself through drink and drugs. ..And for that reason IWNDWYT.
IWNDWYT 
Not yesterday not today not tomorrow...IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Congrats on 70-Days u/-picardy-third- and for hosting this week!..I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.

Checking in from the mountains of western North Carolina. I will not drink with you today!
Good morning to everyone.  Yesterday was a breeze but that doesn't mean today will be easy.  I pledge to all of you my family and most importantly to myself that I will not drink today.  Thank you guys. 
Not drinking with all of you today. 
IWNDWYT    
Not today alcohol. Not today!!..IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
Drank last night. I could list all my "reasons" but really they would just be excuses. I had a beer and didn't enjoy it but had another 3 anyway. It's like a compulsion. Today I am buying that lock for the fridge my husband keeps his beer in. And next time I want a drink I will remind myself how bad it tasted how it made me feel gross and sick not happy or relaxed and how I feel today! ..Thanks for being here SD! IWNDWYT  
 
Iwndwyt!
Not drinking today 
Not today nope
Another beautiful day sober. Waking up early to meditate drink some coffee then going to bookshop and have lunch with my mom. I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink today.  
Thursday. I am dragging myself through this week but I certainly will not drink with you today! 
Iwndwyt! 
I'm in. Iwndwyt. Down with booze! Up with sparkling water!!! Long live pellegrino!!!
Checking in =)..Stay strong today x
IWNDWYT 
I'm on day 4 and I will keep this train going. Not drinking today!
I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT!
Guys I don't know if this is the correct sub for me.. I don't want to completely stop drinking and live a sober life I just want to gain control of it. I'm going by a set of rules let me know what you guys think. I've been drinking way to much while alone/during the week and 24 hour hangovers are the result which just leads to more drinking and less productivity...&amp;#x200B;..1. No drinking Sun-Thurs.2. No drinking alone.3. No liquor just light beer/wine (I tend to blackout when drinking liquor)
Day 10! Approaching the 2 week mark! IWNDWYT
I'm all in for not drinking with you today!
IWNDWYT 
Im here
Today Thursay I will keep the alcohol out of my body. No more counting though. ODAAT. Each day.
My mom quit drinking! I think it's been ten days or so   she realized she still had liquor in the house and asked me to take it away. She was sober for about 13 years during my childhood and has been off the wagon for 10 years or so...Besides being gently encouraging (I told her I was proud of her) I'm trying to not make a whole thing of it and I'm trying to not get too excited or too hopeful yet. I think I might benefit from al-anon but it's my understanding that alcoholics are not supposed to go. Any insight from people with al-anon experience?..Now I've got this bottle of vodka in my car. I'm not tempted to drink (fuck yeah!) but I am torn between finding someone to give it to so as not to be wasteful or pouring it down the drain for the drama and catharsis.
Relapsed badly. Badge is incorrect. I will not drink with you today. Best of luck everyone.
Not drinking today! Going to get some work done and grab an early night. Take care everyone 
I just want to preface my check-in today by saying that I apologize for not having being an example of how great it is to be sober. I've lapsed several times over the last couple of months. I **will** however stay positive throughout this and one day I **will** make it. I'm drinking considerably less since joining this community. ..I woke up this morning 10 minutes before I had to be at work. I was tired aching and severely dehydrated. Last night once again I convinced myself that being drunk for a couple of hours would be worth the cost this morning. Once again I have proven myself **wrong**. Not only do I feel terrible I spent my grocery money last night on booze. So there's that. ..All that said I'm not drinking with you today. I **will** break this cycle eventually. *I have faith* that if I keep coming back here one of these days I'm not going to leave and drink for a couple days and crawl back with my tail between my legs. IWNDWYT
As if this stage in my path (just over one week dry) I can't  vow  to not drink today; but I CAN vow not to drink within the next hour at least. (Because I away from the house and driving. The house is where I keep the booze and drinking and driving us stupid and suicidal.)
My boss came in today looking like absolute hell from drinking too heavily last night. He had to leave at lunch today because he was so severely hungover...I'm so glad that's not me anymore. Feeling great after lunch and I hope to always keep it that way. IWNDWYT! 
For today I will not drink with you. I'm back on 2 days but the lapse has had an unexpected effect. Instead of being wracked by self-loathing it showed me the following day that my drinking the night before had been totally pointless. ..&amp;#x200B;..For about a week I'd been waking up from such great sleep I was in such a good mood all day I was upbeat and productive. Now waking up after a bottle of wine the night before I was tired unproductive and melancholy...&amp;#x200B;..Now unlike before it is easier not to drink after coming to the realisation that it really wasn't worth doing. Sobriety feels a lot easier. Of course its only two days but it does feel less of an effort.
Life is stressful. So glad I'm not drinking today. IWNDWYT.
Happy Day!! I will not be drinking with you today  
Today's my first day working with my new sponsor.  Seems like a knowledgeable guy and I'm excited to start working the steps with him.  It's time to get the help I need to really make the most of this sobriety.  IWNDWYT
Day 5.  No badge no drinky.   IWNDWYT!
This is my day 1 again... IWNDWYT.
First time here. Made 5 gallons of cider and I'm not going to drink any today. ..I want better sleep to lose weight to feel better. I want to stop drinking.
I will not drink with you today.

Nearly 10pm and I made it today. Came fairly close to caving. Once it hits midnight it will be Friday. A week is almost in sight. Amazing. If I can do it all of you can 
How do you get the flair?
Today I start my journey. I'm excited nervous and insanely anxious.

Have a great day off! I had yesterday off work so I know the feeling.  ..Checking in for today everyone! Tomorrow is Friday I'm so excited...IWNDWYT!  
Not today!
Late check in today but i am definitely NOT drinking!
I'm at my first business conference without drinking and IT'S FINE. Happy hour starts in half an hour and I don't want to drink! I've done a kick ass job professionally while I've been here and not worrying about drinking has been so freeing. Looking forward to treating myself to a Diet Coke at happy hour! 
IWNDWYT 
IWNDWYT! I'm having dinner with my dad and for once I'm going to have a glass of sparkling water and not half a bottle of wine.
Day 1 here (newbie). Posted my story on the main page if anyone is interested. I look forward to the journey ahead and I'm very happy to be here with you all...&amp;#x200B;
Im having a bad bout with my OCD this week but if i know anything its this. I will not drink with you today! Drinking isnt gunna solve shit!
So my badge says 72 days but the sobriety app on my phone (that I check in to every day) says 75 days. Either way I feel great!! IWNDWYT! :)
IWNDWYT. Bit of a rubbish day yesterday. Speaking to others has relieved it to a good degree. Acceptance as is often the case is key. But also backing myself to a greater degree especially when I have run my actions past someone else and they agree I did ok in this situation. Anyway it will all be fine and I won't drink. 254 days!
Day 25 of not drinking. IWNDWYT 
my home meeting was cancelled today but I gutted up and went to a different meeting. felt good to see fresh faces and hear new stories. IWNDWYT 
Just for today I am not drinking.  6 days sober longest time sober in five years.  Though had a guy at the meeting tonight be like "don't count 'em"...idk I get that but also trying for 90 in 90 so...kinda have to count at least a little...
IWDWYT
Not today. Fought off a craving by remembering how poorly I would sleep if I drank
IWNDWYT
Haven't had a drop today.  Won't tomorrow either.  Screw booze.  Never again.  
Didn't drink today. Looking forward to a hangover free Friday!
