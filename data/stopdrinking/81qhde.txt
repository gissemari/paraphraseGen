I recently had to reset my badge and it hasn't been easy.....Last night I went to the gym and as I checked my phone after the workout I noticed there were over 30 messages from my friends in our WhatsApp group. It was Friday night and at least half of the messages seemed to be related to drinking. My friends (all moderate drinkers) were gushing about the lovely riesling or merlot or sparkling wine they had uncorked and were now enjoying. Friday night time to relax after your week at work and have some nice drinks! ..My first reaction was a feeling of sadness and of being an outsider especially as I've really been struggling lately. But almost immediately I felt a slight sense of repulsion too. **I** know alcohol to be a **poison**. I know (only too well) what an incredibly dangerous substance it is both from personal experience and from all the research I've read - according to which alcohol is the 2nd (or 3rd depending on the source) most addictive and harmful drug after heroin (and cocaine). (Most of you probably know this too.) But alcohol is legal in our society and it's glorified and romanticized. Drinking is fun! An elegant glass of red wine or champagne makes such a cute photo to post on social media! ..Now let's replace booze with drugs and imagine a WhatsApp conversation between a group of friends:..**Person 1**: "Yay it's Friday night! I just had my first line of coke great quality! What about you guys? [*smiley*]"..**Person 2**: "Ooh you've SO deserved it! [*thumbs up emoji*] Man I've had a really tough week at work. It's smack for me tonight. My dealer will be here any minute! [*smiley*]" ..**Person 3**: "Hey guys sounds great! I thought I'd go for speed tonight it's been a while. Last time I did it I ended up having quite a night remember? [*laughing crying smiley*]..Sounds a bit... different doesn't it?

The sad thing is i have had those drug conversations. Especially legal highs (when they were legal) as they were so varied. I lost interest in drugs many years ago but struggled with booze because its so 'normal'. It was easy to say to people that i was over drugs because they were affecting my life but some people don't seem to believe that alcohol does that too unless you're out of control visibly. Its madness that society doesnt realise alcohol is a drug too! 
How about "my kids just went to sleep it's Friday night and I'm going to smoke some meth because being a mommy is HARD!"??? 
Ha!  This is hilarious.  I was texting my friend a sort of "yay weekend" bitmoji yesterday and there were like a half dozen of my person literally sitting in a glass of wine martini glass mug of beer etc. and happily splashing about.  What the fuck???  Now I'm picturing my little spectacles/sweater dress clad bitmoji rolling about in a pile of crack rocks or jauntily leaning up against a giant heroin needle.  Fun times. 
Excellent post and gives me a different way to think about drinking now!  I am going to try to remember this tonight as my husband and I go out to dinner with friends who are moderate drinkers (they are not close friends and I would never tell them I have a problem..Too much pride and I live in a small town!!). I know I will be sitting there wanting a glass of Cab so badly. My sweet husband says he will not imbibe tonight with them which will help for sure (except watch us have to split the bill with us not even drinking which will really bother me!! Not because I am el cheapo which I definitely am but because I have made a commitment not to drink and don't want to fund others while I am resisting.  That doesn't make sense! And one of the benefits of not drinking is how much money I am saving!) Maybe I will actually envision them snorting a line as they raise their glass and hopefully I will be repulsed by that.  Thanks for sharing.  IWNDWYT.
I have a friend who brags about how she has been in the drunk tank three times in the past two years. She's a 35 year old woman. ..I've never bragged about my drinking. I find it repulsive...I like the twist on perspective here. Alcohol is a drug and I think that is often forgotten or overlooked.
I love this. That's a huge trigger of mine missing out on the drinks with friends. I'll remember this in the future! Thanks! :)
