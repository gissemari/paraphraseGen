Just realized that my brain responds best to hearing other people talk about issues I struggle with. Watched James Hetfield from Metallica talk about getting sober and I think it really helped. What videos have you watched that really sunk in for you?  I'm sure this is a repeat topic but I didn't see any great ones when I searched. Thanks.

There are some excellent AA speaker recordings on YouTube - I particularly enjoyed [Anthony Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sg1L2ysRqc&amp;t=2s) and [Craig Ferguson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEfWdT0t-qY) they are hilarious!..I also enjoy the '*This Naked Mind*' YouTube channel but there are loads more besides when you start going down the rabbit hole......[Why Some Of Us Are Addicts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHbuaq5h2A4&amp;t=3s) by Robert LeFever is good and he also has a channel.....There are lots of interesting talks on the [Neuroscience of Addiction](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=update+on+the+neuroscience+of+addiction).....I also enjoy Russell Brand Gabor Mate Kevin O'Hara.....There's lots there to keep you out of mischief!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Alcohol mastery on YouTube. Great series of videos.
