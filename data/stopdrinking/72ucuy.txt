ahhhhhhhhhhhh i just wrote a post about how i'm sleeping terribly!  i'm so jealous!  you give me hope!!  thank you!!!
You &amp; I seem to be outliers in the good-sleep camp. .The day I quit drinking I started sleeping like a baby again.
For me the sleep got better and better the farther I got away from the last drink. I was lucky to get 3-5 fitful hours a night when I was drinking; now I get a solid 7-8 or even more if I allow myself the luxury. It didn't happen all at once took a couple months probably but it's one of the best things about being sober...Waking up to realize that I have just gone another day without alcohol - is also awesome..
