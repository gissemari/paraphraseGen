I'm only 4 days sober from drugs and alcohol but man I feel good to finally want to face life on life's terms. I've been struggling the last 4 months being in and out of AA rooms. I'm finally ready to make a change and see what life has to offer. It's such an amazing feeling knowing your not alone and that you don't have to function that way anymore. For anyone reading this feeling that they are powerless over alcohol and their life is unmanageable know that you only have to take it one day at a time. Know that things will get better. Life is what you make it don't wash it away with alcohol. I saw a quote on Tumblr this morning- "drugs gave me wings but took away my sky" How true. It feels good to be able to share my experience strength and hope with other alcoholics so that we may overcome this crippling disease. Stay sober my friends! I hope this helps someone out there. You don't have to drink today. God bless.

Glad to hear you are already feeling positive and hopeful. I love the tumblr quote. Another one I heard on SD: "This elevator goes all the way to the bottom but you can get off any time!" :)
