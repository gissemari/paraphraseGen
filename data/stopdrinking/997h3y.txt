I was what I feel people call "functioning" alcoholic.  I had no D.U.Is.  not trouble with law.  Rarely got "wasted" but always buzzed to above safe driving levels for example.  I never had issues at any job because of it.  .My only trouble ever was with my social life or wife or parents etc.  And then it was me arguing I am not an alcoholic because my life wasn't screwed up by it. or getting angry at the people I loved because when I was under the influence I could get angry at anything even T.V commercials I found were stupid set me off into yelling rage and fast heart rate.. I had to grab beer from fridge as soon as I got home from my day.  If I had a day off it was after breakfast and all day.  Day drinking was fun and that was my own party.  Almost always by myself.  Get buzzed play a video game go swimming whatever.  Keep the buzz going all night.  Rest and repeat. ..In college is when I started.  Parties every night.  5 dollars for all i can drink keg.  I partied and ended up dropping out.  This should have been when I quit but instead I just adapted my habits...Now fast forward to last saturday. I drank a 24 pack.  Then a 6 pack.  Then a 12 pack all with an old friend I hadn't seen in a couple years.  She was my bestie from college.   She is in AA I found out after the beers were gone.  2 months sober until that night. This took place from 5pm to 4 am.  11 hours. 44 beers.  2 people....She was drunk and emotional  told me why she was in AA and how this is a relapse for her.  She also shot down all my excuses about drinking.  One example was when I said "well if I smoke weed I don't drink.  I just can't smoke because of my job" (licensed electrician and a damn good one if you ask my peers)..She simply said "I have known you for 12 years.  I still know you.  You cannot fool me.  I have seen what you do every day."  I stopped and said damn you are right. . When I woke up with a terrible hang over I told my wife "I am addicted to alcohol and cannot ever have anymore"..She just hugged me and said she loves me and she agrees. While I cried like a baby..I asked her to tell my parents for me because I was so emotional.  I FEEL like a complete failure.  How could I let myself do this?  Why didn't I just have fun every now and then.  I thought about beer constantly when I didn't have it in my system.  If I ran out and was buzzing I would ride a bicycle miles to buy more.. Now this is my third day sober after 14 years.  I have the shakes but otherwise I feel good physically.  Going to focus on my terrible financial situation and my career path to "fill the time" I would otherwise be buzzed.  I figure it might even fill the void of my addiction....Any advice is welcome.  I am mainly concerned with when I will stop feeling the shakes and a mild depressed feeling.  Also what to do when I am losing my mental battle and need beer/alcohol.  I have not gone to AA yet because I go to bed when they meet.  I wake up at 3:30 a.m for my job.  They meet at 8:30pm by me.  I did see a sunday session available that i am considering because they meet at 6 p.m.

This part of your post violates our "no asking for medical advice" rule as does your title. Would you be willing to edit this out retitle your post and post it again? Thanks.
