Hi everyone..In my neck of the universe no one really understands the struggle how hard it is to *just have a few.* They don't understand how we use alcohol as an emotional crutch and psychological numbing agent or realize we are constantly in a struggle with a predator which almost always gets its prey...That many of us deal with depression and self medicate in order to cope. Most everyone will vanish when times are hard... when we decide to end the deal we made with devil many years ago...My worst moments have been physically alone while getting sober but the army of voices of everyone on this sub sing a beautiful song... *I won't drink with you today*..You are my support group... your stories.... your support... so to another day.... onward and upward...I love you all. I hope to be there for you as much as you've been there for me. I won't drink with you today!..Love you all..
