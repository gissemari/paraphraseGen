My bottom may not be the bottom of some people but it is my bottom. My point of being extremely disappointed in myself. Here's the rundown...I'm 29. Late blooming college student. Server at a restaurant. Writer. ..I've been flirting with sobriety for the last 2 years. In 2015 I went sober for 4 months early in the year my longest stint to date. One night I was out on the town on day 120 and decided I was going to drink. I got hammered. Fast forward to October 2015 I had a 2 month stint before getting hammered around Christmas. Fast forward all the way to summer of 2017 I went 42 days. In that time I was writing comedy sketches with friends working on a movie and joined an improv comedy class. Relapsed right before my 29th birthday on July 20 and completely stopped writing and started going to improv class on Sundays hungover. Drank up until last Sunday 9/10/17...I was at a concert. I duct taped a pint of vodka to my leg to get past security. Still bought big beers slammed vodka shots then my friend had a dab pen (it's like a vape for weed but weed x100). I immediately blacked out and the next thing I know I'm being pulled over. I told the cop immediately "yes I've been drinking. Yes I've had too much to be driving." Luckily she was a very nice woman just doing her job. She took me in didn't have my car towed or impounded booked me and had me call a friend to pick me up. ..I woke up the next day so bummed out. My phone was dead and my charger was in my car. My brother was home and I told him what happened and that I needed to find my car. Only problem I have no idea where the fuck I got pulled over and it says nothing on the ticket. We drove to the concert venue then drove back to my house the route I would have taken didn't see my car anywhere. My brother had to leave for work so I wait until my mom got home. I used her phone called the station and told them "heyyyyyy I was pulled over for DWI last night and..... I have no idea where it happened at." I heard the slight snicker of disbelief on the other end as she told me my car was about 20 minutes away from the venue in the complete wrong direction. So my poor mother has to drive me all the way to the city in rush hour traffic to get my damn car...I know how lucky I am to not have crashed hurt someone hurt myself etc. I really do and I'm incredibly grateful that a DWI is the worst of it. However I'm disappointed. I've also been sick all week because a good binge drink always fucks up my immune system and I get sick. I have depression and anxiety issues and don't like medication so it's been a tough week. ..Sorry for the novel but I had to type this out upon coming back to the sub. I'm excited about sobriety again. I'm always happier when I'm living my best life. I'm moving up in improv class and I'm excited to get back to writing and creating. I will never be successful if I don't leave alcohol behind. If I drink again I will lose all of my potential. That's what I'm the most afraid of. Does anyone have any recommendations on books or any other resources of encouragement? I'm on this sub and I'm planning to attend my first AA meeting which I've only stayed away from because I'm agnostic and I've heard of the religious tones to the meetings. I believe I can look past it for the sake of positive encouragement. If you read all that I will be impressed lol. If nothing else it was therapeutic to type that out. Thanks guys!

I like Joe Rogan on youtube.  He's interviewed quite a few sober comedians.  I'd hate to think if there was an accident.  This is a good play the tape forward.  I won't drink with you today.
You are lucky as all hell you weren't thrown in jail and had your car impounded. Must be Canadian.
