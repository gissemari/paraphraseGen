First off I hope everyone had a great Christmas and if I don't check in before a awesome new year...Thanks to the support of members of this sub I found the strength to be around my loving family even though they do enjoy a drink or 4...One member of this sub recommended an app that I now listen to at night called quit drinking with Andrew Johnson which really has helped me relax around booze and I have only had it 3 days a great tool...But i really want to thank everyone who gave me support and helped me stop beating myself up about my relapse...Feeling sorry for my self and guilty for hurting others really wasn't working so I put all my energy into being fun and involved in every part of the build up and the actually day...One day at a time IWNDWYT
