Today is my sixth month mark of sobriety and coincidentally my girlfriend's birthday. In the past six months I have seen my life evolve into a happiness and fulfillment that I never thought possible. I am more patient I am more thoughtful I am more active and most importantly I am more happy with the person that I am. ..This year I bought my girlfriend concert tickets made her a ring (a skill that I picked up through sober woodworking) wrote her a song made her breakfast and am taking her to a fancy dinner. Each of these gifts is not only a gift to her but also a gift to me as they are reminders of the progress that I have made in sobriety. No way in hell I would have been able to do or wanted to do all of these things if I was still drinking...While this post is admittedly self-serving I also hope it provides some motivation for those of you who are quitting or struggling with your own recovery. If you are constantly thinking  I wish I could do _______  sobriety may be the catalyst to get you up and moving toward those accomplishments. You can be the version of yourself that you are wanting to be! IWNDWYT

Now that I'm clear headed I'm finally starting a business. At last!..Tonight I emailed our first two clients who I met yesterday. It's like I'm watching myself achieve something. It feels really great.
Congrats on 6 months and thanks for the inspiration!
Good for you congrats on SIX MONTHS!! outstanding
The 17th is my 6 month mark of first trying to quit and man what I wonder I'd be able to do now if I'd stuck with it. This post gives me hope. Congrats to you!
