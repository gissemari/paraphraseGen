i need some support- not exactly what I need maybe some advice is all. But I'm currently going through a rough patch. the brother in law (We will call him Scott) has spiraled downward over the last few months losing his job hard to contact. it's come to light that he's using meth and in the last three weeks he's spiraled out of control...Scott's used every classic textbook addict cliche. ..Saying hateful things to those he loves asking for money making up excuses why my wife needs to come see him (so he can probably ask her for money) deflecting every family member's and friends' concern for his health to "stop trying to break up my relationship" (his boyfriend is a heroin addict) ..Scott has absolutely consumed my life for the past three weeks because his family is busy planning what to do next and they've hired an interventionist/strategist . The demands continue. I do not get to spend time with my wife but during the little time we have at night after work. My wife has taken off work countless times in the last three weeks to talk about Scott to talk about helping Scott and also because she's so depressed...Her brother has destroyed his relationship with his parents he insists that he can help himself meanwhile he is absolutely Terrorizing my life and it's affecting my mood daily life and it's consuming my thoughts. ..Scott is collecting unemployment recently had a big fight with his roommates and now I'm guessing is staying with his addict SO and using a credit card to buy food. He has no car. ..I'm done I want out of this shit I don't want to think about it anymore and I don't care what he does with his life. ..Two things:  myself my wife and her family all communicate very well. there are still plans moving forward in the hopes that Scott will accept our help. He insists he can help himself - he claims to be attending anonymous meetings. ..The problem with him helping himself is that he is terrorizing everyone's life day by day indirectly. He is selfish he is acting like an asshole and to complicate things further..I have gone through addicts in my life -so- many times and I'm fucking done. I understand that there is nothing to do but wait for him to accept help. ..But it is taxing my relationship with my wife i am grumpy and a live wire during the day and it's affecting my relationship with people who don't even know Scott. I'm also an addict and my attitude is causing problems too. ..I'm struggling with being a supportive husband as I realize this is not easy at all for the entire family and my wife. On the other hand this is damaging my progress in my sobriety and I'm not sure I want to be a part of "help Scott" anymore. I don't want to be selfish. I want to be there for my wife but there's just not a clear path for me to press on in a way that's wholesome for myself and the others...Has anyone been through this before? can you give me some pointers?

What role do you want to have in all of this? I've gone through something similar and I decided my role was to support my husband. That's it that's all. Not a good idea to become a family addiction counsellor or sponsor within your own family. Huge conflict of interest.
