I know tomorrow will be better. Also know my friends are probably out drinking celebrating a friends bday. I don't get invited anymore. This is though a good thing. I can't go I know I would relapse. And this journey is too important.

I'm here too.  Been alone all night pretty bored but I won't feel bad tomorrow in the light of day! Hang in there!
