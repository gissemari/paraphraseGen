Hi not exactly sure how this site really works but a dear friend told me about it. Me and my husband went camping this weekend and I relapsed bad. I've drank in the past but not to this extent since "quitting" in 2015. .I thought I could really handle it since I was with the one person I love more than anything besides my children. But I got way too drunk and blacked out. I was told afterwards that I started hitting my husband who has never laid a hand on me. I used to be in a very abusive relationship and all of this anger just came out of me on the one person I love so much. I started hitting him and I bit him. Some people saw him restrained me against my car and called the cops. They apparently did not see what I did to him. So he got arrested for just protecting himself. I feel horrible because now he has this on his record on top of him actually going to jail..I was treating him the way that I used to be treated in my past abusive relationship. That is what hurt me the most. So here I am trying to seek help and advice. He would only drink four or five beers and never got drunk. So he has promised to quit drinking with me all together. I guess the reason I'm here is to get some inspiration and stick with it this time. I feel like I've used up all of my chances and this is it for me. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. If you took the time to read this whole post thank you so much for your time. I'm also going to get into a group similar to AA and see a therapist to help me work out my anger issues..

Don't take that first drink I am the same way and blacked out this weekend with no bad fall out this time! But that's it for me things could've gone badly...they have in the past and it's all due to alcohol
For me AA helped me get to the underlying root of all my issues. I learned that I drank and smoked lots of weed not only because I liked how it felt but because those things gave me coping mechanisms...Removing the mind-altering substances revealed a whole mess of emotions and motivations that I had been covering up for years. While most of my sobriety had been positive experiences I've done and said horrible things in sobriety too. I've also avoided doing and saying horrible things because I know how to cope. I learned how to do this in AA...Stopping the drink is just the beginning. After that we get to clean up our lives. I believe you can do this. If I were in your case I'd try to get some advice from a lawyer to clear things up.
