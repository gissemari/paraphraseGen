Tomorrow morning at 830 am marks a milestone I never thought I'd reach. 1 month sober. While I know there's still a long road ahead mentally physically spiritually I'm so happy as I get to sit here and type this. ..Visiting the family for a few days to celebrate the 4th of July. Majority of my immediately family doesn't know. I plan on telling them face to face I went to detox and spent the last couple years in such a struggle. I live far away and didn't feel like a text or phone call would do them justice in getting to know such a major thing in my life. My mom and one sister know and that's it. ..All though there will be lots of alcohol around I am beyond confident I won't drink. I gave my mom and sister both permission to slap the hell out of me if I ever suggest it. My counselor told me to call her the second I have the urge along with my very best friend back home. BTW I had a bad experience with my recommended counselor started with a new one today what an absolute rockstar of a woman. Glad to wind up seeing her and starting on our weekly meetings. I will also be checking in on here tomorrow. What an encouragement and safe place this subreddit is. I am thankful for all of you in this community...I still don't have it all figured out. The anxiety worry and damn sure no sleep are all still present. But I do feel like I am on the right path to staying on my 180 degree turn away from alcohol. ..For all of you still knee deep in the fight I pray for you and that if given any temptation to drink due to the holiday tomorrow that you stay the course and not give in. Blessings to you all and be well.
