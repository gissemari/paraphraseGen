Ugh. I wanna relapse. In spite of it. That sounds so fucked up. But that's how I feel. He gave me his phone to take somewhere  where we would meet that (hard to explain and doesn't matter)and his phone is blowing up. I look at it and it's his ex saying she loves him too and such. I would open the whole texts between them but I dont even wanna read anything else. We just had sex this morning and the way he looked at me made it seem like he really cared for me. I'm such an idiot.

Does she know you have his phone? That's weird he'd be cool with you taking his phone if he was being that shitty. 
I would agree. Giving you his phone seems like a very odd thing to do if he's behaving badly. ..Stay calm and have a conversation. Do not jump to conclusions until you've got the facts. ..Great that you didn't use this as ab excuse to drink. Whatever happens you're ahead!
I'm gonna go ahead and second what others are saying: that seems SUPER bizarre that he would give you his phone if he had just recently been texting his ex like that. Definitely seems strange and worth a rational discussion. 
Unless he's a spineless shit who planned for you to find out so he wouldn't have to end it? It's easy to block exe's number's on smart phones. Either way I know you'll be OK and well done for not drinking. No man is worth risking your sobriety over. I hope you feel better soon.
