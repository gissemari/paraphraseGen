Since beginning recovery nearly 6 months ago (and after several relapses) I finally have my first job interview tomorrow since resigning at my worst. ..But all I can think about tonight is buying a bottle blacking out and completely blowing it off tomorrow despite being desperate for the work. ..So instead i'm ordering a large pizza coke and desert. I may gain 10 lbs tonight but at least I won't be drinking! ..IWNDWYT!

Best of luck on the interview!  That pizza sounds tasty.  When I was younger I went to an interview just slightly hungover.  Not the best decision I've ever made.  Stay strong!  Consider staying sober as an investment in the future whereas drinking is cashing out your savings to go to vegas.
Sending good vibes your way!!!  Good luck tomorrow!..I'm in a similar situation - - resigned my job a couple months ago at my worst too!  A few things at work really pissed me off started drinking right before the weekend ghosted from work on Monday and Tuesday then quit Wednesday.  I probably would have quit anyways even if I was sober but the alcohol made me resign like a spoiled brat...But all well!  Whats done is done.  I'm sober now and in a good mindset.  ..Good luck!  You got this!..IWNDWYT  
Smelling like garlic is going to be a lot more acceptable than stinking of booze. Good choice best of luck.
I'm so excited for you and your interview! Also I'm excited for your dinner! I had enchiladas tonight and I am pretty sure I was inches away from a food coma... maybe I'll test those limits by eating the ice cream in the freezer. Still better than booze!
Well done and good luck. The right decision was made.
