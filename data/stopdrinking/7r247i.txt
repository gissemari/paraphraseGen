I am doing well overall but I'm hitting the point where I'm starting to think "is this all there is?"..Not really an urge but more of an overall feeling of ... now what?!..I am working out again (feels great) going to Smart Recovery as well as a Zen Buddhist recovery meeting. Reading good recovery material meditating and trying to use all of my tools.....This discomfort will not last forever I know. Just putting that in writing helps...IWNDWYT..

Why did you stop drinking?..Knowing my "why" helps me in the trying times.
Congrats on 21 days!  Keep on keeping on...any discomfort now is still better than another day 1.
There's a ton of healing to do and it didn't get really good for me until about 100 days in just because of the pace of brain repair. All our dopamine thingies have to get regulated again all that stuff has to shuffle back into position and get topped up so we can feel stable and naturally alive...That context allows me to be patient--I am still looking forward to a lot of changes and that's exciting. My mind may pout from time to time but I am a shepherd to my healing process and can make the right choices in that spirit of trust and respect.
 This  is definitely not all there is. :)..When I stopped drinking I kind of felt a little underwhelmed too. Life doesn't get automatically better. But I had the freedom to choose what I wanted to do with my life rather than being a slave to my addiction. You get to make all the choices now. :)
