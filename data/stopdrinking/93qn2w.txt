Drank last night (awaiting badge reset currently)..I only made it four days. I feel like I'm never going to be sober. I'm so depressed (and hungover fuck). And my SO was super pissed at me this morning for drinking all the liquor.... not because he was worried or anything but because he wanted a shot this morning...We're both such monsters. I'm ready to just give up. I miss my Dad.

many of us had long illustrious histories of thinking about quitting quitting relapsing feeling hopeless before something clicked.  unfortunately it's part of the process for many of us.  Did you lose your dad?  Looking back I think when I lost my mom that's what sent my alcoholism over the top.  It has taken me a really long time to start getting my act together.  
Dont beat yourself up for the relapse the most normal thing for an alcoholic to do is to drink. Focus on what are you going to do now? Do you have a sponsor? Show up early to a meeting help them set the meeting up get to know them be a part of the group. Get through the steps man and truly amazing things will happen in your life.
