I know this is going to sound odd but I got drunk and had sex with my step mom. It really has been a long time coming but it only happened because of how hard I came onto her... I was wasted. I messed up....When I am drunk I have no moral or social compass as I am sure many of you can relate to. ..Long story short I am being kicked out of my house. Likely homelesss in a matter of hours. What do I do? ...Alcohol caused this. ....She didn't have my back at all. she is upset and my dad thinks this is all my fault... he is barely here and he is a asshole to begin with.

It feels a little bit like my whole life is over.

Hmmm...I feel like this needs some more explaining. How long have you had a problem? Are you planning on sobering up? What is your relationship with alcohol? Need more facts OP! The homeless question may be better for /r/AskReddit.
Wow that's a pretty serious problem .All I can say for sure is that now you have an unforgettable reminder of why drinking is not going to make your life better ... do you have any sober friends or relatives you can go to?
