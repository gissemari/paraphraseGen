Hi all. I just came across this sub tonight and have been looking through a few posts. ..I'll be up front. I do not have a drinking problem myself. But looking at some of these posts I couldn't resist the urge to make one myself and say congratulations to all of you who are hitting these milestones on your journeys with sobriety.  I know there will be many more to come. ..And to all those still struggling to start I wish you the best of luck. Take that first step and keep it up from there. You've got this. ..I don't know if this type of post is allowed or not me not really fitting in with the rest of the sub. But I just wanted to give you guys a little boost if I could and let you know you've got support from those in the sub and out as well! Good luck to all!

Haha- very kind! Thank you for making me smile  !
Thank you!
I hope these kinds of posts ARE allowed so many of us feel that other people who don't have issues with alcohol may not understand what we're trying to deal with and how difficult it can be...Thanks for taking the time to make such an awesome show of support!
