Today the withdrawals subsided hard and I was so relieved but incredibly nervous going into work today because I had a performance review.  Since I'd been drinking so heavily the past few months let's just say that I was expecting the worst. Alcohol every night had me in a constant haze during the day and I was getting very little done. I walked in and was straight up honest that I had been struggling in my home life and it was carrying over into work and that I knew that it's not a good excuse because business needs to go on regardless of what's happening with me. My manager agreed and at that point I felt my heart sink. But then he asked me  Do you want to do better?  And I clearly said yes and he buried it and gave me another shot. I haven't felt such a relief and drive of motivation like that moment in SO long and now I feel great. As a side note later on this evening we had a mandatory company event with an open bar and some of my buddies kept asking me to come grab a drink which I proudly turned down. These are the moments that make it worth it guys and yours will come too. Stick with it and IWNDWYT!
