TLDR at bottom...As someone struggling with their sobriety early on I'm looking for additional motivation...I started losing my hair about 4 years ago at age 28. I'm on the "big 3" of propecia rogaine and nizoral shampoo. It has for the most part halted it . I am however still a bit thin on the crown...I've long long wondered if my unhealthy binge drinking started the problem earlier than it had and has perhaps kept me from regrowing more than I had hoped to regrow once on treatment...TLDR - has anyone who is losing their hair and also on treatment for it noticed better results once becoming sober?.

I don't know on the hair but nice work on 8 days!
I'm on day 8 too and I've noticed my hair becoming significantly healthier. I was losing a lot of it and it was very dry. It has its shine back now feels softer and stronger!
I see baby hairs growing back but I am hoping more will come with having a healthier and hopefully alcohol free lifestyle..I will say that I absolutely do think that drinking caused some hair loss for me. I was 27 1/2 (this past summer) when I noticed!
I'm 52 F and believe I had major hair loss from binge drinking. It's finally coming back. So yes I believe drinking can affect hair!
