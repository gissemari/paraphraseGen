This seemed better a couple hours ago but now it's just shit. I've had to edit and re-read this too many times to count because I can't sentence properly. It doesn't feel as good as you remember it feels pathetic. ..I will not drink with you... tomorrow.

Please be safe. You can make the choice to put the drink away now drink some water and go to bed. Tomorrow is a new day.
I will not drink with you tomorrow!
Hey I know that you are hurting right now. It took me a lot of attempts to get where I am right now. (nearly 5 months sober) ..Keep trying and you'll get there. Have you ever been to an AA or NA meeting? Their program of recovery has been the difference maker in my life...I wish you all the best
I am so sorry you are going through that. You will feel better I promise. Hang on to the feeling that you are not happy doing that it will help you on the long run.
Hang in there. Be kind to yourself. Tomorrow is another day...Perhaps try and download a 10-20min guided mindfulness meditation (youtube or a free app) and have a listen and follow along whilst you fall asleep tonight. Then perhaps try again in the morning to ease your mind a little before getting in a self loathing frame of mind for the rest of the day...&amp;#x200B;..Hang in there :-)
I drank with you tonight. I'm sorry.
You have my support 100% of the way. I will not drink with you tomorrow!! You'll get through this.
One fight being lost does not mean the battle is over.  Real strength and courage comes from picking one's self up dusting yourself off and trying again.  Don't give up my friend.   You are worth it.  ..IWNDWYT.
Hi there! As is stated in the [Community Guidelines and FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) we ask that you do not post when drunk. Your post is removed. You are welcome to post again when you're sober - and we sincerely hope that you do. Thank you!
