I turned the shower on and all of the sudden it hit me. The blurry out-of-body memories of sitting in a cold shower shaking nauseated riddled with horrible anxiety drunk out of my mind. So drunk I struggle to turn the water off and I practically crawl out of the tub. Some days my boyfriend was there he would just sit with me while I was a wet naked inebriated mess. Then I would stumble out of the bathroom and into bed and fall asleep with the lights on...Day seven. Tomorrow will be a full week since I've had a drink. IWNDWYT

You dont have to feel that way ever again! Yay! Iwndwy
I can remember feeling like that....but if I still remembered then I just wanted another swig of vodka to be completely away from myself 
It's amazing how these crazy scenarios become  normal  looking back now all I can say is wtf!!  It seemed reasonable at the time.
The book This Naked Mind by Annie Grace really helped me early on. Stay strong and think of the hangovers that you won't have!
Yes keep it up and check out the badges! It is fun looking at them change color and shape. Silly as it sounds It excites me to see it and wait for the next change.
