I relapsed last night and i'm disappointed in myself. I've established myself as a non-drinker around peers and on that front I've done well...But last night for whatever reason i'm still trying to understand I was alone in my apartment and I ended up drinking excessively by myself...My question is is it possible to ban my cards from purchasing alcohol? I never use cash and I think having an obstacle like that would give me time to think. Why isn't there something like that? It sucks that alcohol is ubiquitous. I just want to buy chips

are you getting any kind of outside support for yourself like therapy or a group (besides just this sub)? That is the sort of thing my therapist and I work on in our sessions - talking through what happened what I might do next time what obstacles might come up for myself. ..Even something like taping a note to your card to break the automatic pattern of buying alcohol.
