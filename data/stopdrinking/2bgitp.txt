So it's been awhile since I posted and I even unsubscribed from this sub for a little while.  I made it to just over a month was stupid and went out for some fun with some coworkers.  Drinks were had it was a "good" night and here I am almost two months later sober for about four days now going through minor withdrawals feeling like I might as well  have slept the whole time.  I was back to drinking pretty much daily whiskey plenty of it.  I let my bills back up car repairs need to be done (not because of the drinking just maintenance) so now I'm broke.  ..The bitch of it all is I absolutely did it to myself and that's the hardest part to accept.  I was going good feeling healthier and more clear headed than I have in years and I gave it up over a night of free drinks and karaoke...So here I am and I guess the only positive thing I can take from all of this is that I was able to go over a month without a drop that was huge for me.  Time to pick myself up get back to my SMART meetings and stay strong...Edit: words

Welcome back! Gotta dust off and get on horse again. I'd recommend you change or add something to your recovery since what you were doing wasn't working. 
Here's what you learned:..* it is easy to fall back into old habits. One small drink can lead to one big problem. Here is a good link on how one drink can lead to problems: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23o19c/100_days_and_why_im_staying_sober/..* It's easy to fuck up. It's hard to fuck back down...* You are more than capable to do a month. And then another month and then another. You've already proved you can do it- you just have to keep it in your brain of why you need to keep doing it! Turn this negative into a big positive!
You know all that good life that you built up is there waiting for you. No one is going to make the decision except you- to not drink. You can do it you have done it and you will do it! All the best to you!
Hey OnaPalebluedot I remember you from before; you and I quit the first time at about the same time.  I relapsed too and it's a shitty feeling.  I'm doing my best to get back on track though and the amazing thing about this place is that no one will ever think less of you for slipping up.  You and I may not be rockstars on the first try like DavidARoop here but we can totally do it.
Welcome back :) It sounds like you have learned from your mistakes and will be that much wiser this time around. 
I'm so glad to see you checking back inn /u/OnaPaleBlueDot.  I know you have the capacity to get this whole sober deal.  
&gt; and I guess the only positive thing I can take from all of this is...You've learned the consequences of slipping and that is huge.  It's one thing to know something intellectually and quite another to actually experience it....Sharing your relapse experience has also helped me not drink today so thank you for that....Well done for coming back.  You could have easily stayed out and dug yourself a deeper hole to climb out of.
