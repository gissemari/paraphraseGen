I lost my father on Christmas Eve because of his struggle with alcoholism. Today he would be 53. I just want to let you know how great it is that you are here reaching out for help and I wish you the best. Today of all days I want to tell you how much I love every one of you. Stay strong. And Dad happy birthday. I miss you. http://i.imgur.com/Nr0mi.jpg?1
