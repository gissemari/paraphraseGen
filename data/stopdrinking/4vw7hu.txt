Hey hey Sobernauts!  ..In a "wow life is strange" moment my AA sponsee (a newcomer to Alcoholics Anonymous I'm helping to work the 12 steps) hit 90 days sober yesterday.  On a whim I got onto reddit and looked through my posting history and found my 90 day post was still viewable.  I shared the link.  ..Having helped this woman through her first 3 months it was interesting to share a snapshot of where I was at the same milestone in my own sobriety journey.  She loved reading that I had been dealing with many of the same struggles.  (It is one thing for me to tell her...it is another for her to read it as written on the same 3 month mark)..Having this subreddit to post and read helped me SO much in those early months especially and it was a great reminder.  ..Live.  Love.  Laugh.  ..Stay sober my friends...Mouse

What a nice thing to do for your sponsee! :) 
That's great Nonny! How rewarding it must feel to have helped this woman reach 90 days! I'm so happy for you and for your sponsee :). Thanks for sharing.
