Sometimes I forget that I need to quit forever. I think of the future and how I'm sure I"ll have this under control and I can have that glass of wine. Then I remember that I tried that before had 148 days under my belt and then ended up drinking for 2.5 more years. I just think in my head I have this alternate reality going on a Bizarro World if you will and this is a fixed time of not drinking sort of like a diet. When I hit my goal weight then I get off the diet eat a little more regularly etc. But then I remember that like a diet it doesn't really stop either. If I go back to eating the way I always ate I would end up overweight again just as I can't go back to drinking the way I always drank I'll end up a drunk again. I know this I do but then that fantasy creeps in. Is it just me? Is this something that I'll struggle with every day for the rest of my life?

Not just you. That is the Voice of Addiction talking. The Voice tries to romanticize alcohol. It tries to make you forget the misery alcohol brought upon your life. It tries to convince you that you don't have a problem after all and that you will be able to control it *this* time.     .Practice identifying the Voice and it's lies. Separate the voice from your true self. Embrace it with genuine curiosity and then tell it to fuck off.    .One day at a time works wonders for the first year of sobriety. Eventually you will acclimate to a life without alcohol. An alcohol-free life will become completely normal and you won't even think about it. Be patient. Just remind yourself that there is no negotiation with The Voice. You tried moderation and you **know** it is not possible. Good luck. IWNDWYT.
