Okay so it may be a bit of a misleading post title. I would probably run out of titles pretty quickly so this is probably a one off. It is Friday and some of you may be looking for a good book to read during your sober weekend and what better topic is there for SD than alcoholism...For those of that like nonfiction books about the struggles of other alcoholics Jack Londons's classic John Barleycorn (or Alcoholic Memoirs) from 1913 is well worth reading. Jack's story of his lifetime of struggles with alcohol from the time when he was a very young boy through his years as a famous author was written over a hundred years ago yet is timeless...[You can download Jack Londons John Barleycorn from Gutenberg for free](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/318) or even [Listen to an audiobook on YouTube](https://youtu.be/yvHA0p7yX8s)..As trivia the books name comes from a [famous poem from the 1500s](http://clubs.tuck.dartmouth.edu/barleycorn/who-is-john-barleycorn) and has been covered many times as a song. The most famous is probably [Steve Winwood and Traffic's classic](https://youtu.be/93mv8LPtmro) which is awesome although [Jethro Tull and George Dalaras did a pretty great version too](https://youtu.be/lD7bZ54oh6Y)

Excellent choice and superb post!
Thanks man! Ive never read it!
&gt;"Why not write all this up for the sake of the men and women     coming?" Charmian asked. "Why not write it so as to help the wives and sisters and mothers to the way they should vote?"."The 'Memoirs of an Alcoholic'" I sneered or rather John Barleycorn sneered; for he sat with me there at table in my pleasant philanthropic jingle and it is a trick of John Barleycorn to turn the smile to a sneer without an instant's warning...I think I'm going to like this. Thanks for the recommendation/links
