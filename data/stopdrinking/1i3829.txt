Well I made it to triple digits. I didn't do it alone. I went into AA NA (different atmosphere) and this place. My recommendation to stay sober is:  1. Decide you want to stop  2. Don't drink  3. Set up you support team (AANA recovering individuals etc)  4. Set up a recovery plan (what meeting you will go to how often you will talk to your people)  5. If you don't know ask somebody  6. Read and comment or create your own post at least once a day  8. Be open minded  I'm going to ramble about what has changed. My life is still difficult but I noticed I am equipped to handle it. I don't do bonehead things now that I am sober well sometimes:). Life is a beautiful struggle right now but I can handle it. /r/Stopdrinking is the backbone of my support team. You all are there 24/7 and you don't cosign any bullshit. Thank You all for your support..TL;DR You can do it!!!    .
