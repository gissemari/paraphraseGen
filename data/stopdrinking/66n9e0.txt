I'm about a month in so far this is not my first time abstaining for a long period of time. I really enjoy the clarity of mind and the sense of calm that comes with sobriety. I feel like I am my genuine self when I don't drink either which is refreshing because I'm used to (and very good at) hiding my true self from others. It's easy to feel misunderstood and alone during this time but I will assure anyone that is struggling that it is SO worth it. With patience discipline and a positive outlook you can become the person you were always meant to be. The sober you is the true you. Peace and love with you all.
