I have been drinking heavily (12-15 Drinks) each weekend night for the last 20 year. Used to be Friday and Saturday night I now have it down to just Friday but am miserably hungover on Saturday and sick of being a slave to this. I am struggling to give up Friday. Starting every Monday I start to get excited and countdown to my Friday  fun day  only to regret it every single Saturday morning. ..What did you all do to fill the time that you used to drink?  Is life still  fun ?..Appreciate any advice to  get over the hump .

I had to make a deliberate effort to fill the time. And I had to plan on what I'd be doing ahead of time. No leaving to the last minute or I'd be right back at it.  ...AA meetings were helpful. Getting to the gym. Meetups in the area.  ...Good luck.
Really for me I couldn't stop until I physically had to stop. For me it was a combination of an alcoholic mother in law abusing my wife and my first child being born. Told myself that that would never be me.  I think the exact route to enlightenment will be different for everyone.  .  .Sorry this isn't particularly helpful.  .  .Maybe you could have a deeper think about why it is that you regret drinking on a Saturday? What is it you regret not being able to do? Could you do that thing on a Friday night instead?
Thanks to the advice. Much appreciated.
