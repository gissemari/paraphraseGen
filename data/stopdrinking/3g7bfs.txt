New here but not new at taking a break from the sauce. So I knew Friday at five o'clock was going to be a dangerous time and as predicted the craving hit me hard. It's best for me to have plans with sober people on Friday nights but tonight I had nothing. The beast has been thirsty lately and I had no illusions about just one if I went that way it was going to be a high consumption evening. I was struck by how vivid the visualization was; sitting there in my office chair I could see myself walking into the store and getting what I usually get and setting about drinking it in my usual solitary way and it felt so gooood. So I decided not to leave work for a while and I fooled around a bit and thought about a few things and reminded myself of the things that usually help at times like these. I don't ever want to do these helpful things I want to drink but one helpful thing is to remind myself that a big meal really eases the cravings so one of my last-ditch efforts is to make a deal with myself that I'll eat a big meal and if I still want to drink then I can drink so I made that deal with myself. Another thought occurred to me and this is the point of this post: I didn't want to reset my stupid badge and I didn't want to break my stupid daily pledge and also I make cute check marks in boxes each day at home and I wanted my fucking check mark for today and not mess it all up and have to start over. It pisses me off that these dumb little accolades matter to me but Napoleon said a soldier will fight hard for a little piece of colored ribbon and he was right. So here I sit a little grumpy that I need colored ribbons to achieve something that should be easy and maybe amused at myself as well and also grateful to this sub because today I got through another day and I get my fucking check mark. Being grateful to you all for your help today pisses me off too. I hate asking for help. I do sincerely hope however that everyone out there who's struggling with this bullshit is hanging in there.

Well done on 5 days! One of my favorite morning tasks is putting a big black X on the calendar for not drinking the day before. Those growing rows of Xs in conjunction with making the daily check in pledge here have absolutely saved my hide multiple times over the last month. Whatever works! Hope you have a great day 6 tomorrow! 
I laughed in solidarity about the reasons you didn't want to relapse such as having to reset a badge. I totally understand that!
