Got sick the 10th. Missed a ton of work and just started feeling better the 15th. Thought I'd take it easy not push myself too hard. Despite my efforts I've been hit with something new this Tuesday and I'm still riding it out...I understand even sober people get sick the problem is I get really depressed whenever I'm ill. I hate sitting or laying down all day filling my head with useless crap like video games movies and books. In moderation these things are fine but without work or physical activity I feel like my life is being wasted. Also I had just started one goal and planned on incorporating another in March but now the first goal is being pushed back and I think the second will have to be too. Struggling to keep the chin up...Furthermore I'm not wealthy. I make enough to meet my needs but missing almost two weeks of work really stresses me out. Not to mention I'm about to enter the most trying three weeks of the term in school and I need my brain back to complete them...It helps a little to rant and to think how I wouldn't be able to get through this if I were drinking but just a little. What about you fine folks? How did you feel the first time you got sick after cleaning up?..TL;DR: I feel like poop feel like I *am* poop and feel like I'm stuck in poop..
