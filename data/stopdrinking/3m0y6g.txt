When I think about the future when I'm finished with school settled down into a family and working in my career it is hard to not see myself drinking with friends and family. I know what AA thinks about this I know what my IOP thinks about this and I know what my sober friends think about this "addict brain". I've heard it so many times and quite frankly I'm sick of that response. To me it is extreme. It means I can't trust my thoughts. It means that this malady is a forever thing and I just don't believe that. ..I'm 25 now. I've been worried about my drinking for three years. What really caused all this worry was how academically useless I was when I was partying. After a time I started think I was an alcoholic and so I just kept drinking because it seemed like my destiny. I wasn't going in the direction I wanted and so I sought help for my drinking. ..So I got sober last August. Had a four day relapse in March and went back to treatment. In the last year I've done a complete overhaul on my life. Learning how to step outside of myself and look at my feelings search for evidence and being okay no matter what. I feel really good about myself. ..The way I see it now is that if the day comes that I feel like my life is finally grounded that I will drink again and it will not be a problem. My mom is coming up on six years sober and when I talk to her about it she is very understanding. She says it is a big mistake to say that I'll never drink again and I agree. When I talk to my dad about it he can relate to being my age "when I was your age I was starting to cut back my drinking because it was becoming a problem. I learned how to reign it in." and my dad is a social drinker now. ..I guess I just want some input that isn't along the lines of "once and addict always an addict." "it's a progressive disease you'll be worse than ever" - all of that stuff. There are people who have done this many people. I hate the idea of being lumped into a category of people who simply cannot drink again. I think I'm just too young to even know if I'm an alcoholic or not. 
----------immediate responses--------

I never called myself an alcoholic young or old. What I did learn (through many shorter periods of abstinence) is that for me stopping drinking for a while doesn't reboot my relationship to alcohol. The clock doesn't restart it's not a new game. I picked up exactly where I left off...When I had kids after things got pretty bad I stopped drinking for almost 6 years. But not forever--I had a vision of a genteel me in the future enjoying my fine wine (in moderation of course). But the truth wasn't so genteel--when I started drinking again I was quickly back to being the booze hound I'd been with a thirsty vengeance. It took me 4 years of misery to stop again during which time I destroyed my marriage. ..Sounds like you feel like you need to try that experiment. You'll do what you do but know that it's a well-tread path and your thoughts were similar to my thoughts:..&gt; I hate the idea of being lumped into a category of people who simply cannot drink again. ..Nobody *likes* this idea. But liking or hating it isn't going to determine how it works out for you. ..I think I shied away from the definitions as well when maybe it would have helped me to ask basic questions like: is my life better with alcohol or without it? I didn't get to the point of seeking treatment but nonetheless .I'd rather have not spent the last 30 years sorting this out with its labels and denials. I could have used that life energy in a lot of different better ways. ..It just works out differently for different people and I don't think it's a matter of volition. My mother drank fairly substantially but as she got older reduced and finally stopped. She's in her 80s. Her brother (my uncle) on the other hand died at my age sitting on the crapper a drunk leaving two kids and an ex-wife. All this is to say you can't choose how your body responds to what you put in it you can only choose what you put in it. ..Great that you posted here. Keep thinking it through and don't get flagged by the labels. 
I was a little younger than you when I was first diagnosed as an alcoholic and like you it felt like a death sentence that I could never drink again.  I was in the military at the time and after I got out I rationalized that it was just the stress of that job that did it to me. So I started drinking again and for a little while I did drink in moderation  but then my drinking just got worse and worse..I even switched from just beer to liquor thinking (like an idiot) that it would be "healthier".  Less calories so lose some weight right? **WRONG!**.Plus I would down 10 gin &amp; tonics as easily as I would down 10 beers..Cut to now:  I'll be 50 in December and I finally stopped back in August.  Hypertension borderline diabetic and nearly 30 years of my life wasted.  Then there's that odd pain in my abdomen....gee right about where the liver is....wonder what's causing that?  I wish I had stayed sober back in my 20's.  Just about every bad decision and situation in my life can be traced back to alcohol.

&gt;I'm 25 now. I've been worried about my drinking for three years. What really caused all this worry was how academically useless I was when I was partying...Why do you think that later in life that alcohol will not have the same negative effects make you useless as an employee husband father et al?
Did your father have problems of the same size as you have had? You have been worried about **your** alcohol use for about 3 years. ..What would you benefit from drinking? You still will have all the hangovers. You still will feel shit afterwards. You could be sober at a social situation and go for a run the next morning. ..All those thoughts are in **your** head. No one else is forcing you to have a drink...Hope this doens't come off as preachy etc. I myself have been through that thing you are talking about and for me it just doesn't seem like a good idea. ..But if you feel you wanna do it ofcourse its up to you. Best of everything to ya!
Make a T chart and on one side write "What do I gain by consuming alcohol? " On the other side:"What do I lose by not drinking? " ..Let the pros and cons decide. ..I can have an amazing time sober there is ZERO good that comes with alcohol consumption that I can't get sober so why would I sign up for the shit show? My wife doesn't drink ( maybe a glass of wine for the taste once a month; but we don't keep it in the house ) and she's a "normie" and yet she seems to not miss the fun or the empty calories...That being said perhaps some controlled / moderate drinking is a good litmus test -I say go for it. 
There's nothing to stop you from drinking again someday. I call this "doing more research". Let us know what you find out. We'll be here...I can't imagine wanting to drink again because I remember what happens. I'm convinced that all the misery would return ten-fold. 
Don't think about it. There is literally no point in thinking about it. Nothing to gain nothing lost. The future will bring whatever. Focus on being sober today and the rest will sort itself out. 
I'm feeling much the same way as you not wanting to completely rule out drinking ever again and not wanting to label myself...But I've been thinking about my sister a lot lately.  She's been an alcoholic since she was 18.  It ruined her nearly killed her.  She hit rock bottom went to rehab got sober and was miserable until she reconnected with an old high school friend they fell in love and got married.  They lived with my parents for a year to save up money bought a house she had a good job for once and it seemed like she should finally be happy...She thought that now that she had things figured out she could have some wine or a beer.  I didn't know she picked up drinking again until she called me the week she was going back to rehab (we live 2000 miles away).  She got comfortable with drinking like a normal person and then got more comfortable and more comfortable.  ..There's no middle ground with her and I fear the same is likely true for me.  I can reel it in from time to time and hold off from drinking for a few days or go to the bar and only have one or two drinks but I know I'm fighting an urge that's going to overwhelm me eventually unless I make it a point to abstain completely.  ..I'm just taking it one day at a time and finding things in life that I like better than being drunk and hope that I hit a point where I've got enough things going on that I won't have time to drink/
I'm just looking through these responses hoping for someone to tell me I can drink and be alright...which tells me I cant drink and be alright.
&gt;settled down into a family..I thought this too when I was younger.  In my experience the family is never settled.  It adds a new layer of joy and a whole now layer of stress.  It's a moving target the future always sounds like a good place to rest but I'm starting to think it will never be true.  I think about when my kids are out of the house.  Maybe that will be the time to rest.  But that's the time when my parents will be aging and sick.  I've found it's becoming more important to rest and enjoy life now.
I heard someone say he used to be angry that everyone else can drink and he can't. What helped him get past it was realizing that he always **can** drink - it is his choice to stay sober. Framing it as "I choose not to drink" instead of "I can never drink" helped him realize he wasn't being controlled he was making the best choice for himself. ..*shrug* If it helps.
I don't see why you have to think that far into the future. You know by the time you get to that stage you may actually not want to drink.  You are thinking way way into the future.  This may not even be an issue at that point because you may decide you like being sober and not risking it and you may be so happy and fulfilled and fully identifying yourself with your happy recovery that you don't want to drink anymore...And maybe not maybe you will want to. But lots of people get into that position whether they are addicts substance abusers mild users or none of the above.  So maybe it will be a problem. But it will be a problem at that point.  This does not need to be a problem now. You know that now you don't want to use/drink and you want to be sober.  So that's enough.  I would recommend you not invent future problems to have and then start worrying about those invented future problems now.  You are assuming a problem will exist in the future and worrying about it right now. This does not make much sense because your current situation is 1. not this problem and 2. probably other problems in actual current reality.   So maybe focus on those problems for now and worry about this thing when you are settled and have a family and a career and then post on here again at that point.
