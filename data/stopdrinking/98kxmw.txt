I drank Friday. Six beers and a shot of whiskey. I had been thinking about drinking for weeks. It was causing me anxiety and I couldn't think about anything else. After I hit a year I thought I wouldn't crave it anymore and started getting complacent. I'm disappointed in myself but I have no urge to do it again. I spent yesterday in bed eating and feeling sick. Being drunk was kind of fun but I was definitely thinking  this is it?  while drinking. Not worth a day spent in bed or the money I spent. ..I've been dealing with a lot of friends leaning heavily on me lately and I wanted an out at least for a few hours to not think about things. Alcohol is not a good way out anymore. I have other ways of dealing with stress now. I need to set boundaries with people and not take on others problems as if they were my own. ..So while I'm disappointed in myself I feel like I got it out of my system and do not feel the desire to do it again. My sober life isn't perfect but it's pretty damn good most of the time and I see that now. So I'm back on the sobriety train I still have over a year sober one day off doesn't mean that that time sober doesnt matter. It does. I'll restart my count and while I may relapse again in the future I will just focus on not drinking today. I will get back to AA and focus on the good things in my life. I will not drink with you today!

Yeah I though the cravings would go away too and they have not...Nice work on all that time. You know you can do it now.
Congratulations on nipping it in the bud! I had three years sober started drinking again here and there and before I knew it a few years had gone by and I was downing 1-1/2 bottles of wine a night. I gained 35 lbs my brain wasn't working right my previously perfect blood work had gone to hell etc. The plan now is never to drink again.
