How did I make it to 18 months sober when 18 days seems impossible now?I'm avoiding alcohol but I'm deeply depressed. Something is terribly wrong with the life. Nothing feels right. I'm gaining weight again. I registered for a 5k last week in hopes that it'd motivate me to train. It hasn't.  I'm not going to do well if I even make it there at all...I'm trying to finish up graduate school so I can get a job but instead I'm sleeping until 1PM and playing videogames all night. I haven't had a productive day at work in weeks. I can't focus. I'm falling behind...The truth: I spent 13 years in college (5 for a B.S. with 2 minors 2 for a M.S. 6 for a PhD). I'm 30 I've never had a full-time year-round job. I'm over-educated and under-qualified for any job outside of my field. I'm in debt for degrees doing something that I don't wholly enjoy anymore. ..There are parts I do enjoy but lately I've been faking it. It doesn't matter. I'm stuck with this career. I have all this education but all I ever wanted to do was teach. I love helping people learn about science no matter the subject. However all I do now is write papers for publication do data analysis and spend my weeks alone in a lab looking at a computer screen. This is the worst possible job for me. I thrive on helping others and teaching. I'm an empathetic instructor not a detached logician...Don't even get my started with my family. My parents had to "cancel" thanksgiving saying it was for financial reasons. I know the true story. They are crippled by alcohol addiction and things are falling apart. I know it because I lived it. They drank a lot when I was growing up but it got worse in the last few years. They need to get sober and I don't have the relationship with them where I could do anything. I talk to them once or twice a year. When I quit drinking our relationship degraded even more. I have never even addressed this here on /r/stopdrinking because I really just want to ignore it...I care deeply for my wife but years of my depression and addiction are wearing on our relationship. The other night I had to leave my wallet at home because she wouldn't trust me to not buy alcohol when I went out. I don't know where this came from. Things were going so great now she can't trust me. After 18 months sober I "all of a sudden" lost my willpower. She is worried I'll relapse again. I don't blame her and I can see how it is jarring. The last time I drank we got in a horrible fight. I said some nasty things. "We" blamed it on the alcohol but in truth the nasty things I said just came to the surface. I had been thinking them for years. Alcohol is not the only problem in our relationship unfortunately. I had really wished it was...Why am I afraid of a 12 step program? I fear I'll have to directly examine my life instead of just going on backpacking trips and doing 5k's. Quitting drinking the first time was fun when it was all about "No hangovers anymore whoopee!". Now it's a slog through the mess I've made for myself......

Oh man. I could have written a lot of this. ..I was really terrified to do the steps but I mean it when I say they changed my life for the better. I'm so happy I got involved in the stepwork. It honestly has been such a positive experience. 
I'm in a very similar boat to you. I recently relapsed after about a year and a quarter sober. I'd started having nagging thoughts about drinking socially and felt deeply alienated as an alcoholic. I'm realizing now that I'm very unhappy with my life and I don't feel like I have the tools or coping mechanisms to fix it. On the other hand I have been trying to go to AA this last week and while I've appreciated much of what the speakers have to say I also haven't really connected with it. I wish I had advice to give you   instead just know that you're not in this alone. It's a struggle.
I feel this-I'm in a similar position! Congrats on making it 18months! Stay strong!
The steps have been less scary than I thought going into it. You only have to do one of them at a time. By the time I got the 4th and 5th step I wasn't that scared to do them. You don't have to do them perfectly. I'll do a better job my next time working the steps. Just getting the surface stuff out of the way this time. 
Oh my goodness I relate to so much of what you wrote here. When I stopped drinking a little over a month ago I had a lot of expectations of what my life was going to look like. I thought I was going to spring out of bed in the morning ready to attack the day and be productive and happy. I had big plans for going to the gym cooking everything from scratch and losing tons of weight while also immediately repairing the relationships I had damaged with my drinking. Life was going to be fabulous!!..The truth is my reality doesn't look like that today. I'm in med school and I can hardly wake up on time to get to any classes before 10 am. I'm eating like crap and sometimes find myself horribly depressed and anxious. Sometimes things feel pretty dark and bleak. Some of the damage I have done to my relationships cannot be repaired. I'm in debt I can't sleep at night and I wonder if my life has any purpose...The ONLY thing (aside from this sub) that can pull me out of those feelings is going to AA and working on the steps with a sponsor. It is the absolute bright spot in my day. Just having that connection with people who can relate has been so valuable. I know that I will be able to clean up the shitstorm I have created eventually. It takes time though. I just have to pledge to not drink TODAY. ..You are 17 days in and that is fucking awesome. I know how hard it is to come back after having a bunch of sober time. I'm really proud of you for coming back and being honest about where you're at right now. I haven't been through all of the steps but I trust in those who have. I hear it's pretty awesome on the other side :)...
Stop thinking about the 12 steps just think about getting to a meeting. If that's too much just don't drink today and worry about the meeting later. You need to take everything one day at a time if you're gonna beat this so stop sweating the future. Hell you don't even need to worry about not drinking this week - just stay sober until your head hits the pillow tonight. Rinse repeat and get to some meetings if possible...Hang in there brother.
I'm going to recommend the Carol dweck book on mindset. You seem to be stuck in a fixed mindset at the moment but that can change. Realise that everyone can grow- no mental attribute is fixed; it can and will change with practice. If you want to teach why not hook up with someone involved in teaching and arrange a day's work experience? Tiny steps climb mountains. Good luck friend- I'll be thinking of you and wishing you well

I was more afraid of my life threatening addiction so the choice was made.  maybe a good life (i didn't believe the 12 steps could help me or a sad death).  It was worth it.  The 12 step become operable when the pain of not doing them becomes greater.  When I don't use or drink I become worse.  They help me every day.  Give it a try.  Maybe  you get a better life.
Yeah hear you but my friend the monster lurking under the bed is a lot less rabid and much easier to domesticate  than you imagine... There are may options open more than you think and with your credentials teaching science can be your path.  You may have to start with the physics of water balloons in first grade (and how awesome would that disciplinary hearing be?)  ..Also it is possible to regain the joy of recovery no matter how many retreads - and trust I suspect a smile on your face now and again may do more to recreate it than daycount...Keep doing.....
Interesting. The steps set me free. 
I think this is the crux of why many people can't/won't /don't want to get/stay sober (god knows I have struggled)..Who wants to look at the darkest ugliest places in the soul?.It's dark sad scary ugly disgusting and strangely liberating (at least for me)..I could leave the big painful splinter in...let a callous form around it and live with the discomfort and pain or suck it updig the fucker out and get some relief..I would recommend an addiction counselor to help you understand your process..This was a great resource for me..http://drgabormate.com/book/in-the-realm-of-hungry-ghosts/.take care of yourself

You can imagine how terrified I was in August 2009 when I returned from 7 years in relapse-hell with career-ending and criminal consequences looming.  I trembled in shame disgrace and terror but it got better.  Better and better.  When you face your fears life gets easier and you can sleep.  ..I don't doubt that at 18 days you are still in the throes of acute withdrawal--hang in there.  You got this.
It's not very reassuring and it's so easy to ignore but I got better when I decided I was going to get better...For me that meant cutting alcohol out of my life AND working a 12 step program - it may not mean that for you everyone is different...But there is a difference between living dry and living sober - living sober is an active effort to better yourself in addition to not drinking.
I'm so glad you're here. Now try everything at your disposal and be scientific about it. If you can handle the peer review process you can handle shedding a light on the dark corners through the steps.
You have my sympathies and you are correct in doing the steps will force you to examine your life; and yes that is scary but I also have a question about this:...Do you want to get better?...I was told over and over that alcohol is a depressant and that it wasn't helping me.  "yeah and a rainy day is also a depressant too jackass" would be my thought afterwords.  But it's true quitting drinking did **wonders** for my mental health it wasn't the cure but it helped a lot....In my experience of doing the steps it was hard and a shit-tonne of work.  I met with my sponsor once (sometimes twice) a week and went to at least 4 meetings a week and contacted him on the days in between meetings.  He guided me through the steps I did the work I cried through the work (especially step 4 and 5)...But I **did** the work and I survived....A hand full of months later I have recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body; I've reached a state of neutrality with alcohol.  What does that look like?  It looks like me going to a friends (who I haven't seen in years) birthday he wanted vodka so I walked into the liquor store picked up a bottle and went to the party.  Everyone apparently got him booze the kitchen counter was packed with bottles.  To be honest it was kinda funny to hear people talk about how much alcohol he had saying things like "man you're stocked for weeks"!  Meanwhile I look at them and think "this wouldn't last me a weekend".  I ducked out when things went stupid ('bout midnight) drove home and went to bed.  ...Do I do this every weekend?  Hell no but I'm not afraid of it anymore.  Cripes I was just at a hockey game this Sunday nothing bothered me.  The step 9 promises on page 83 have come true for me but in order to achieve them I had to do everything from pages 1 to 82....Will this be hard?  Absolutely but it is absolutely worth it and you don't do it alone; you have your sponsor and your home group to rely on....I mean what do you have to lose?
You know people can put as little or as much as they want into the steps.  Maybe just going for the fellowship and meetings without doing the steps would help.  Of course doing the steps is encouraged but it's NOT a requirement.  I can tell you the steps have helped me way more than I expected they've really lifted burden after burden off my shoulders.
