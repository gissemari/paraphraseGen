I had to admit again to myself and my family that I'm not going about this right. I had to text and tell my boss again that I am going to check myself into rehab. I need to continue taking these first steps again and I am just really struggling with it all. I'm not sure why I'm even posting I think I could just really use some support. If you have any to give.

We all have to keep on keeping on. You are doing what is right for you. You can and will beat this!
You're making the tough choices and learning how to do this.  Sending you support.  Be well friend...I will not drink with you today.
