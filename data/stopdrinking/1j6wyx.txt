I have failed you all and for that I am sorry.  I just drank half of my first beer in 12 days.  I am in the middle of a panic attack and do not no any other way to fix it.  This was my first real struggle without drinking.  Cheers to 13 days next time.

Bravo to twelve days indeed cheers to 13 next time. :)
If you stick around and talk to people You will find alternatives other then drinking. I'm glad you made it back and so soon. You can do it my friend. 
You didn't fail anyone. You did 12 days and we're proud of you. Now start again and go farther. This thing isn't gonna stop overnight you'll get there

Thank you all for the kind words.  It means more than you can imagine.
One day at a time. See a doctor for the panic attacks. Alcohol isn't the solution.
People who don't drink don't see not drinking for 12 days as a big deal...I think you making it 12 days is amazing. That's no easy task and nobody can take it away from you. Don't beat yourself up too bad. Figure out what triggered you to drink...learn from it...and come back stronger. You can do it.

Hey buddy it was good meeting you in the chat. I think you are a good person and I think good things should happen to good people. I hope you can get through the beginning I sure had my anxiety and a panic or two but it got way more stable the longer I stayed sober. I hope you can find the serenity and hang onto it...:)
