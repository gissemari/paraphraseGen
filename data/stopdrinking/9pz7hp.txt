Tonight's been a hard night fighting the urge but I'm fighting it as best I can. Since I stopped drinking(96 days ago) I've been getting back into making music as a productive outlet and quickly started performing live. Tonight I did an acoustic set at the wine &amp; spirits shop I used to work at as I thought it would be nice to see old friends even though I don't drink with them anymore to at least try and make it like old times. ..It ended up just being a very anxious experience for me; being surrounded by all these phenomenal beers and spirits that I used to appreciate but would also over-indulge in which I had to remind myself of. My mind obviously went to the thought of  just one drink or two won't hurt  but I know that it's not that one drink doesn't hurt it's all the ones that would follow that would destroy all the hard work I've put in over the past 96 days getting me to the most stable my life has been in years. I decided to cut my set short and get out of there before the drinking demons that lay in wait within me began speaking louder than the voice of reason I've been busting ass to maintain. ..Anyways I just wanted somewhere to vent about it since it's the closest I've felt to relapsing since I stopped drinking. Being a musician I'm always in bars so I'm always exposed to it but tonight just felt like a lot more of a close call than I've ever had. Now off to a bar to do photography for my friends' bands where my drink of the night will be ginger ale. Wish me luck.

The impetus of all actions take form in *ideas* but entertaining and embracing them is the first step forward in acting them out. I can't control every thought that crosses my mind but I can control what I do with them. ..&gt; I'm always in bars so I'm always exposed to it but tonight just felt like a lot more of a close call than I've ever had...Maybe being in one of your old haunts with familiar faces struck a chord - the people you used to drink with the place you used to drink in. Maybe maybe not. Maybe it was something else entirely. Glad you were able to nip it in the bud. ..&gt;it's all the ones that would follow that would destroy all the hard work I've put in over the past 96 days getting me to the most stable my life has been in years...That's a strong motivator and difficult to give up. You'll be very thankful you decided to leave. ..&amp;#x200B;
