I'd like to introduce myself to this sub because I'm new and being a part of this sub is honestly the best thing that has happened to me. Reading everyone's stories reminds me of the self destructive life I lived because of alcohol. I too am an alcoholic drank everyday for almost 15 years and struggle with cravings daily. However I'd like to spend some time on focusing on things that have helped me with sobriety so far. .The first is EXERCISE. Anytime I feel like drinking usually at night I hit the gym and I will work out for almost two hours. I focus both on aerobic  and hyperbolic routines with a regimented workout plan that's challenging and leaves my body destroyed (in a good way). I DO NOT MISS A DAY! I'm looking to hopefully run a half marathon soon. .Second I've changed my lifestyle from revolving my hobbies around drinking to active hobbies that challenge my creativity mental fortitude passion and humanitarian aspirations (things that make me genuinely happy). This has given me the opportunity to meet some incredible people that I have grown to respect and learn from. I have a rekindled a sense of motivation and empowerment that I lost during my adolescence because of drinking and depression. It feels like I'm finally gaining control over my life again..Third I have radically accepted the fact that alcohol will be present no matter where I go and I will not let it control me. I am always given the option to say NO. I choose to live a better life. .Finally I've changed my philosophy on life to a healthy and conducive perspective filled with hope and love for not only myself but the wonderful people that I'm involved with. It allows me to live in the present moment and forgive myself for the past mistakes that I cannot change. I am not perfect. Thank you again to everyone on this sub for sharing your story and I wish you all luck in your ventures for choosing to live a better life!
