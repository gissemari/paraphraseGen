Today is a real milestone for me. After struggling for over 15 years with drinking I've made it much longer than I thought I ever would. ..I've picked up a couple of new activities Reading and Running. ..My Wife is happier with the new me which in turn makes me happier as well. ..Energy levels are up and I've started to look forward to traveling again which 100 days ago I thought would have been stupid without a drink or ten...I still dream about beer every now and then but at this point I just can't see any reason to ever look back. Drinking didn't add anything positive to my life. That not alcohol's problem though I just had no ability to moderate. ..Being around others who are drinking isn't something I enjoy a whole lot right now but I've been able to move from willful restraint when it comes to getting that drink at a party or when out for dinner to it being just a passing thought and to me that to me is a victory...The only real downside is that my Perrier bill has increased exponentially and I'm OK with that...Thanks to SD! My SD Flair give me a good feeling when I see the number increase daily. Believe it or not that's been a huge form of motivation. ..Looking forward to the next 100 days!

Amazing! Can't wait until I get to post for my 100th day. I picked up running with a group at work about a year ago now that I'm continually sober it means so much more to me and I haven't had to come up with a lame excuse not to go.
Congratulations! 100 is such a gorgeous-looking number.
Hail new centurion!
