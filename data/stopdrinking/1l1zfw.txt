But boy did I want to. Alone on a Saturday night....man was I struggling. Almost went out to the bar almost drank beer in the fridge (I'm on a housesitting job)......Decided instead to watch crap TV discovered sober recovery.com browsed r/stop drinking and went to sleep early figuring that if I'm asleep I won't want to drink. It worked. I must say you folks here in r/stop drinking have really helped me....more than you know.

Going to bed sober is my daily victory over my disorder.  Sometimes even now it's the best thing I do in a day.  But having put together a lots of continuous days of sobriety I now also expect miracles!  And amazingly those happen too on a fairly regular basis.  Good luck.
