I'm a woman and as a young teenager I was coerced into sex by an older boy. With the rise of the #metoo movement I now see the big problems with this (it was legally statutory rape among other things)  and how much it messed me up. For almost 20 years my problem drinking and problem sex went hand in hand. ..The last year before I quit drinking that boy now a man got in touch with me and we had an affair. (he was married I was single) ..The reasons were complicated and I'm still sorting it out now. ..I've been sober for almost a year and I am slowly putting the pieces together for some of my troubling choices and struggles. ..Last night I started to write a new book about a young woman who has a non consensual encounter with an older man and years later tries to "take control" of that experience by choosing to have an affair with him and all the things that happened in between those times and because of her choices. ..I was partly inspired by the story of Asia Argento how after she was assaulted by Harvey Weinstein she explains that she was in a weird gray zone partly consensual relationship with him that she's still figuring out and trying to understand since I completely understand the complex dynamics that lead to such complicated choices. I've been there. ..The working title of the book is "Asia". ..The news of her partner who I greatly admired (and still do) who was also a personal hero for his work and activism and general amazingness has shaken me and left me saddened. ..I'm determined now more than ever to finish this book and not to drink. I am in solidarity with all the women who saw themselves in both Asia and Tony and the pain they experienced. I hope he finds the peace he needed and she the justice. ..

I think putting the thoughts on paper could be very cathartic and help us see the patterns in our lives. ...I wish you all the luck with your book and your new life....IWNDWYT :)
The #metoo movement has really made me view my experiences in a different light. I was just talking about this last night and how all of my bad sexual experiences which at the time I didn't quite think of as rape (except 1 that was very clear even then) were alcohol related. Now I see that there were actually 2 other times that would count as rape by today's standards. Then a few other times when I just did really stupid stuff while blackout drunk. ..Back then (25+ years ago) I guess I just thought it was how guys were. They were always pressuring me and trying to force themselves on me from the age of 15 until probably about 28 when I got too old and smart for them. It happened all the time not just when I drank but alcohol makes you so much more vulnerable to all of that. ..In any case I am sorry that happened to you and I just wanted to commiserate since I was thinking about this just last night. I think it's fantastic you're writing a book because the times are changing and the more we speak out and share our experiences the better.
