Hey people..I recently finished my undergraduate degree in cultural anthropology with an emphasis on media science and technology studies..There I often struggled to align recovery with my academic practice which is particularly weird considering that for qualitative research you usually commit to a fieldsite and (in contrast to other presumably  'hard' sciences) you are actually allowed to feel things (which is also data)...While I don't want to make this a method lecture at all I just wanted to share a great piece of research on addiction with you. The book is called "Addiction by design" and is an ethnographic eight year study of gamblers and machine designers in Las Vegas. It's been a long time since a piece of academic writing resonated this much with me often leaving me with goosebumps. It's key points become very clear in this interview: .http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2015/02/09/the-addiction-algorithm/..You can check it out yourself but three toughts really intrigued me:..  people don't gamble for the excitement but exactly the opposite the enchantment wears off quickly and instead people try to enter the 'machine zone' as often/long as possible. Besides the high frequency of events it's the certainty of either win or loss that gives structure to one's messy life..  addiction keeps being presented like it's the gambling person's sole fault. This book instead tries to see how machines are designed to keep people addicted including architecture people being delivered food while playing. Just look at the mental map that one participant drew it's part of the interview. So depressing and true at the same time being stuck in the loop only anchored to the machine (or bottle)..  The authoer doesnt cast blame but rather treats her participants as experts on their addiction and more chillingly the phenomon of the 'machine zone'. Her aim is that such an approach might enable to step outside the loop for some time and offer another angle of reflection....All in all it just reminded me how much I love good social science and I am sure there are some fellow anthropologists/sociologists etc around! Besides I thought this research resonates so much with my thoughts on drinking I am curious to hear your opinion.....

Interesting interview thanks for sharing...You write:..&gt;Besides I thought this research resonates so much with my thoughts on drinking I am curious to hear your opinion......I'm interested in how it "resonates so much with your thoughts on drinking" if you want to elaborate...I notice the author writes in one paragraph:..&gt; In the U.S. there was a strong feeling that the full responsibility lay with the individual  and that recovery was a question of taking responsibility.  Anything that had the wiff of suggesting that some accountability might be shared by the casino industry and its products would be taken as denial and as undermining the therapeutic process ..What's your take on that?..Cheers!
I lived in the machine zone. Never gable but I feel the machine zone well structured outcomes. Press the button feel the feeling sort of thing ..Much less of a machine these days feeling those good human feelings
