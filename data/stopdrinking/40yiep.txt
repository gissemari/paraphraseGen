I honestly have no desire to drink. I even had a taste of a new mixed driink one of the bartenders at work made yesterday and was satisfied with just tasting it. Didnt get the urge to buy some high life after work. Ill admit it held my attention as i walked past it on chefs station but i didnt let it overtake me....Heres one struggle im having though. Im finding it much harder to get out of bed after a sober night than my normal drinking night. I didnt go to the gym today because of it but when i was drinking id carry my hungover self to the gym.

&gt;I honestly have no desire to drink. I even had a taste of a new mixed drink..So you haven't stopped drinking yet?
The reason I had trouble with jumping out of bed in early sobriety was that my body and central nervous system were recovering from the pounding I did to it in the last year or two of my drinking.  So good for you...Now on a cautionary note: I don't drink ANY alcohol even sips because I know that eventually that practice is going to start me on the road to relapse.  I've more than proved it to myself.
