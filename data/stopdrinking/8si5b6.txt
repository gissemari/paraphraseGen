i am finding a hard time thinking that i just dont know the sober me all i know is the person that has struggled with alcohol abuse and other substance issues through her whole life. I have no idea what success i would be in life if i didnt spend my teens and 20s trying to drink myself to death. i honestly didnt think i would make it to my 30s but here i am at 35. ..im doing work on not drinking some weeks and months better than others. i still occassionally have binges working on it through therapy. when i find myself sober for a month or for couple of weeks im invaded with fear i just dont know who am i without drinking i see myself sober and i hate myself too. sober me is a stranger to me. ..im feeling so hopeless today that im starting to think it might be too late for me. like what is the point? i cant recuperate the lost time and i cant change the past. but what is there for me in the future? all my friends and my SO drink should i leave everyone in my life to stop drinking and then get depressed and lonely only to drink again? ..sorry for the rant not sure if this is the correct sub and also not sure why i am sharing but needed to share this. tx..

Oh man I sooo totally relate to this feeling.  I would often complain in meetings about the fear of living life sober coupled with the fear of what would happen if I drank again.  It felt paralyzing. Hopelessness was real because in early sobriety I had none of the benefits that came with extended sobriety. I was always in some sort of pain whether I had temporarily quit or not.  That and any time I was quitting it always came with the expectation that things would improve as I'd imagine - they rarely did and this added to my hopelessness you know?  Look at me! Even when I "try" to right this is what happens.. what's the point?  ..Keep working at it. Sounds like you're trying and that's no small thing when it comes to addiction. I'm not gonna drink or use today so if you're down for that let's do it!
I want you to know that I think it's worth finding out about a new phase in life and what that can really be like.  Yes I believe it's worth finding inner peace no matter where we've been in our life up until the time we decide to change.  Personally with an open heart and a lot of curiosity and a philosophy of  do the next right thing  I've come pretty far myself.  I don't know exactly what I'm doing but I have a pretty good idea of some values that fit me and I'm willing to learn more.    I'm ready to find out.I want to send you positivity and hope .**iwndwyt**
