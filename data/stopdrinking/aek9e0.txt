the world lost an amazing photographer. he [struggled](https://www.instagram.com/p/BevHoQPFvKN/) but seemed reborn this last 5 years i'd like to think he lived more in the last 5 years than in the many years that preceded it. he had a new life in a new country and things seemed OK. suddenly... no bueno.

So sorry for your loss. You're right. It's never too early to quit!
I'm really sorry the loss of your friend.  It's very sad that he struggled and overcame and then died anyway.  I mean I guess we all die anyway in the end.  But I wish he could have had more time with that new life he made for himself.  IWNDWYT
My sympathy. Alcoholism is heartbreaking.
I'm sure he's very glad he got those five years of freedom.  So many of us don't live to see that.  Condolences on your friend's passing.
What was the cause? The liver is an unexpectedly elastic organ.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
