I have reached Day 4 or 5 a few times since the last time I reset my badge. I consider this a step in the right direction because at the beginning of the year I couldn't even make that...Still. I'm struggling with thoughts of growing up and getting older not to mention an Internet addiction to block it all out (I've been addicted to the internet since before my first sip.) And oh yeah: HAPPY FINALS WEEK! Will Rachie pass all her classes and graduate in May or will she spend more time procrastinating than it takes to complete the damn projects? Who knows?..Please send thoughts.

You can do it. Sending wishes for focus and productivity. 
You got this! Sacrifice Netflix internet and drinks for your finals it's important!! Go for an afternoon hike when you get a moment! The colorful leaves and crisp breeze help reset the mind. I'm struggling too...
Best of luck on finals!!
