I've been here before...I've said *and believed* that "this time is different"...And it had been every time...Yes I've relapsed almost alwaysbefore I get to two weeks...But each time I've learned something new. ..Maybe it was "I can't hang out at the bar with my drinking buddies and not drink" or "I can't hang out at ANY bar and not drink".  You get the ides... In a way each time *was* different albeit not in that way that I was thinking or hoping...So... this last relapse here's what I learned:..I Can't Drink.  Nothing else works.  NOTHING...So I'm feeling well not "good" but determined.  I know that each day is going to have its own challenges; some will be easy and others will be hard.  And in some perverse way the "easy" days can be the most dangerous...That's all I've got right now except for this:..I will not drink with you today.

The penny drops!..It's a bit like playing a video game and having to repeat a level several times before you figure it out and move on to the next bit.....Keep it up!..I won't drink with you today ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
Stay determined. You've got this...And YES be cautious with "easy" days...they can indeed be dangerous if we do not remain vigilant...So stay here an hang with us! ;)
