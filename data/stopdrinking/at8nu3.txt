I'm in the midst of day 27 and I have to go to the grocery store. Been thinking a lot about alcohol. Also thinking about the approaching 30 day milestone. I honestly don't think I can trust myself today so I'm going to wait until my oldest son is home and take him with me. I can tell him that I'm struggling and he'll keep me from straying. He'll also probably spend all my extra money on teenager crap like zit cream and slim jims so it's a weird kind of win/win. I have to get a little creative but IWNDWYT.

I ordered my groceries online yesterday to avoid going in to the store. I couldn't be trusted either! This is such a great plan you have :) Congrats and IWNDWYT
