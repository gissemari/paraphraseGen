Hello everyone. I just wanted to post to ask if anyone has had success in tapering off. I was down to three units a night and this weekend got drunk again on loads of red wine now back to square one. I used to drink not every day but most days (5a week) a bottle a night then more at the weekends. When I was reducing down I was having palpitations at night and I was so scared I wouldn't wake up. I'm not sure I can stop drinking and I just want to be free but I don't want to see the gp as I have children (who I adore) and I'm scared social services would be contacted conversely I am worried my heart will fail if I give up altogether. ..I'm lucky as my husband doesn't drink at all but he keeps buying me wine to cheer me up....and my parents got me 12 bottles of wine for Christmas which I had to find people to give it all to as I wanted to stop drinking wine so much. Blooming wine! I just feel like such a failure and wish I could be better.

It's highly unlikely your GP would contact social services if you've come to them for assistance with quitting alcohol. I'd definitely make an appointment...I've successfully tapered off of alcohol but it requires a lot of self control and discipline to stick to your schedule and not go over. If you find yourself unable to do it your GP will prescribe you something that will alleviate the withdrawal symptoms so you can comfortably detox...If you feel extreme discomfort (DT's etc.) go to the emergency room. I harp on this a lot but withdrawal is serious and can be life threatening...Haven't said all that congrats on being here and recognizing that you want to get better that is a big step. You're not a failure you're on a path my friend and there are bumps along the way.  
Maybe asking your husband not to buy you wine would also help?  You are not a failure - you are a wonderful person who just happens not to be able to control alcohol.  Just like I am and all the other people helping each other on this site.  Enjoy the squash; what flavour?
