I just narrowly escaped drinking. I was invited out with friends and I got dressed and everything. I am really struggling this time.

Go you you did a strong and smart thing. I will not drink with you tonight.
You should be really proud of yourself for making the right decision. It's hard but you're gonna wake up tomorrow hangover free and grateful that you resisted. I'm not drinking with you tonight!
