Well...I finally decided to go for it. I figured I should try and give up drinking for Lent. I talked with my doctor and she recommended that I start a bit earlier so that if I experience any withdrawals etc I can address those now prior to Lent actually starting. ..A little about me: I'm 28 I own two businesses with my Husband and I'm what my nephew describes as "very Catholic" (LOL) Anyway I've found my drinking has finally started to interfere with not only my work but my ability to practice my Faith...so...it's gotta go. I'm sure it'll be a struggle but ya'll seem like a great support group so I'm hopeful. ..Been lurking for awhile but decided to share today. I'll not be drinking with any of you today ;)

Congratulations on your first day! 
40 days will give you a nice solid foundation! It's nice to meet you!

Welcome!! ..Let's not drink alcohol today!!
Congrats ... and welcome! 
These guys are all great. It's a very safe feeling. I will not drink with you today. 
This community is why I've been able to stay strong these first 5 days. Without them and the support of my closest friends you bet your ass I'd be hungover in bed debating on calling into work. You got this!! When I want to drink I come here and read the posts and supportive comments and I manage to stay strong. Best of luck on your journey :)
Good idea just don't do it only for lent.  Don't stop afterwards.
I'm not Catholic but I went to Catholic school for my entire education leading up to college. You could pray to Saint Monica. She is a good patron saint for alcoholics because she spent 17 years praying for her son St. Augustine who was a notorious drunk. Support is everywhere. &lt;3
