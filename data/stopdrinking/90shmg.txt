As always I feel great. My mental state has improved I still struggle with things but it's much more manageable now. Friends and family still congratulate me and comment on how much better I look. That alone keeps me from drinking. My self esteem has never been great and at first it was a little awkward to have that kind of attention. I definitely embrace it now and use it as a kind of accountability. One thing I noticed is that I feel I have some sort of PTSD from drinking. I don't want to claim I actually have PTSD to discount the people who have experienced much worse things in life but I think of the horrible shitty things I've done. The way I felt absolute sickness for a decade hungover and anxious. Embarrasment of what i said how broke I always was. The demons in my head still try to convince me to drink but the fear of going back to feeling like that out weight them by infinity. That being said I traded on expensive hobby for another. Photography. I am obsessed with it. I actually quit the restaurant industry after 14 years to work at a photolab. Taking on a big change like that would of been impossible 396 days ago. Monday-Friday 8-5 I would of said no thank you I'll stick with free shift drinks and late nights. I'm very grateful for you guys helping me and others along the way. Iwndwyt
