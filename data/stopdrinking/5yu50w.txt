I finally had that dream the one alcoholics often talk about.  I dreamed I had relapsed and drank my ass off and done a bunch of absolutely mortifying things that you can't even really apologize for since no apology could ever be enough.  I woke up sweating and unsettled.  I didn't even have a hazy hangover to dull the anguish...But I got over it.  The mind recognizes that it's just a dream but the emotions take a bit longer to catch up.  They did.  I know I didn't drink and I'm not going to.  There is no excuse to do that.  Not today.
