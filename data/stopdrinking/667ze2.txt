[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** Back when I was a drinker I was terribly fat and bloated which made me an easy target for insults. The neighbor on the other side of the back alley who was angry because I opposed an illegal annex he wanted to build once screamed at me that I was a fat pig. But now as a non-drinker I am slender. I have lost about 20 pounds just from not drinking and I have cheekbones. Sometimes I purposely leave by the back door of my apartment building instead of the front so that I walk by his house and he is forced to see me -- little ole me that he can't call a fat pig anymore...**Struggle:** Dealing with nasty neighbors...**General:** I have been reading a book about *hygge* which is a Danish concept of comfort well-being and happiness. (Apparently the Danes are the happiest people in Europe.) According to the book *hygge* is the feeling you get when you're cuddled up with a cup of tea on a sofa in warm socks under a soft throw during a snowstorm. Or the pleasure of delicious comfort food eaten with a loved one at a table lit by candles...There was no *hygge* in my home when I was drinking. It was just me passed out amid the squalor and waking to pain and headache. Now I have a cozy blue fleece blanket my best friend gave me and I get under it at night with a good book and the pleasure of accomplishment of another day sober. It's very *hygge.*..What's a moment when *you* feel comfort and well-being?.
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph:     I'm in a relationship! I am so thankful that I learned from SD and AA the rule of thumb "wait at least a year"! It is completely worth it...Struggle:     Having waited 14 months to start dating it's so new to me right now. Thank goodness alcohol isn't an issue - he knows I don't drink and respects it immensely. It's just...interesting (?) to do this sober when I was black out drunk for so long...General:     For comfort I love herbal tea. I get cozy under my down comforter and stack up a million pillows on my bed and play soft Celtic relaxation music.
Is it Wednesday? It's 1am where I am currently and I am ashamed to say that I am drinking. This is my first time at /stopdrinking. I think I might have to join you tonight and remain sober. Good luck to all of you. 
T: Two days down!.S: Wednesday is usually drinks with work day. Will give it a miss this week at least..G: I have a tiny flat and find it difficult to be comfortable in it but having time to read and listen to music is helping.
Triumph: one week been a long time with no beer in a week..Struggle: dealing with chronic illness..General: enjoying my new job where I work from home and have a lot of flexibility in my days
T: made it through Easter with my family who are a bunch of drunks..S: all of the things I need to finish for work.G: omg hygge! I love this idea/word for the coziness of life. I have this fabulous fluffy robe that I wear once I get home from work makes everything feel so much better. .
Found this on the internet. Love drinking not sure when it happened but now I need it to give me back control. Not really sure why or even how I got to here...actually it's the end of the line if you google "successful alcoholics; how to stop drinking" ..Good chat kids! 
.i am so happy for you Lee. Enjoy your life!  I am grateful to be here on SD with all you wonderful people. I will not drink on this .beautiful Wednesday..
Triumph: 5 days down and unlike the other times I quit it doesn't actually feel like a chore. I am enjoying the new clarity and look forward to going forward...Struggle: The shit I was burying with alcohol is starting to resurface looking into ways to deal with this long term. Exercise is helping short term...General: I realised my biggest alcohol expenditure wasn't the booze but from lack of preparation leading to lazy impulse buys and takeaways. Big win from quitting and cooking from home.
**Triumph** made it through a 3 day out of town conference without drinking alcohol..**Struggle** several dreams in which I drink and have an *oh well* attitude. I'm not sure if this is sign that I'm risk for a relapse or if I've gotten so good at silencing Pedro during the day that my dreams are his only avenue to tempt me. Either way I'm being more vigilant and visiting the sub twice a day. ..**General** the Danes idea of  hygge sounds like my perfect day or heck an ideal way to spend an hour. 
Triumph: This past weekend I remained sober through some really triggering parties...Struggle: My husband is away this weekend &amp; I hate to be alone with my thoughts. It will be good for me but still hard...General: I usually get excited for fridays so I can get drunk. Im excited for this Friday to come so I can get a nap! ;)
Well its day 2 since I feel like I certainly decided to improve my life. Hopefully.  My body hurts in all sorts of places and my mind isn't with it yet. I've been unemployed for a while and have been on a training programme so have the best chance to get a job &amp; start earning properly. A lot of the time I think I drink out of boredom so actually having a job will help. But job hunting is stressful so it will be a challenge not to drink out of stress. Honestly it's high time I sorted my life out. Much love to all the redditors here I will not drink with you today. 
Triumph - Making the decision to become and stay sober..Struggle - I'm in a "safe" little bubble right now because I haven't been out on the road or in any work situations that challenge my sobriety. So I'm considering how that scenario plays out...am I flat-out saying I'm done with drinking? Is there a lengthy rationale/explanation for close friends? Or do I take it in stride make no fuss and keep conversation to a minimum. Do I fake it to avoid any conversation whatsoever? CAN I fake it. Or worst: when that time comes does my resolve fall apart?..General - I know in my heart I am doing the right thing for my health my family my future. I will keep fortifying myself with information and continue checking in here at SD. Sharing stories and supporting others here reinforces daily that I am not alone and I'm so grateful for that. I will not drink today. 
Triumph: I'm hearing you on the cheekbones! I've lost 15 pounds and my face has way more definition. Related triumph is that I am kicking butt at gardening/cleaning my outdoor space which is a thorough workout! Love to exercise by doing productive stuff. ..Struggle: feeling guilty that I'm not with my dad right now. I don't know how to handle his decline. My husband needed me back home for a while but it sucks to be nine hours away from my dad stepmom and grandmother. Having trouble finding balance. ..General: I am loving making jewelry right now. My style is changing as I get more practice and I really like what I am making. There are so many beautiful beads and I love finding good color/texture mixes. And of course keeping my hands and mind busy helps in sobriety. Hooray for crafting!
Triumph: Our closet remodel has turned into a full bedroom makeover. I'm really enjoying working on this with my SO it's good for us to have a project together. And I dig the almost zen like state of painting walls. ..Struggle: I love my grandchildren with everything in me but they can really wear me down. The situation being what it is we are more like weekend parents than traditional grandparents. I feel so ill equipped to handle small children sometimes and I have no idea what I'm doing. By the time the weekend's over I feel like I deserve a drink or 10 which brings on a whole other set of feelings to deal with. ..General: My moment of hygge- sitting in bed with the comforter pulled up the fan on low a cup of 'Relax' tea and a book on my Kindle. I try to end my day like this everyday :) 
Im on my way to another funeral. Luckily I'm sober and can be there for my boyfriend. Also I am grateful to have my health ( for the most part) on the bright side I'm going to see Me First and the gimme gimmes tonight.
**Triumph:**  I realized that when I'm drunk I bite my nails because no impulse control and when I'm in a drinking cycle my anxiety makes me bite my nails too. Even just these sporadic bouts of sobriety have helped me begin to get a handle on this habit and I'm starting to get longer nails!!..**Struggle:** Due to my new job I spend a LOT less time with my SO and adjusting to it is hard. I think we both feel a little distant but it's hopefully just because we're used to being together 24/7..**General:** I just started reading station eleven and I'm pretty excited about it.
Triumph: I'm oddly delighted that my sobriety counter is a on a prime number today. I've been making prime number days into little goals...Struggle: Maybe I am in perimenopause. My body/hormones feel out of whack. I'm fatigued and moody. Bleh...General: Hygge- Most Saturday mornings I go for a run with friends. Hygge comes when I am freshly showered feeling pleasantly tired from the run drinking coffee and doing the Saturday crossword.
**Triumph:** I've had some excellent trail runs the past week. Sunny warm but not hot weather and the wildflowers are out...**Struggle:** I've drifted away from old friends since I quit drinking. A group of them took a trip-of-a-lifetime together. FB has been filled with their incredible pictures. I didn't get an invite at all. Some low grade disappointment resentment sadness. Then I see the pictures of all the beer and liquor and don't feel like I missed out quite as much...Sunny mornings on my porch with a cup of coffee. Ah...
T: I'm sober and will not drink today. ..S: I went to work this morning and was sent home on suspension pending investigation and probable firing because of my last shift (restaurant industry) when I showed up at 6am still feeling it from the night before. Ugh. I'm so much better than that. ..G: I've found in the restaurant industry that a lot of people party hard. Anyone who has worked in the industry knows this. A surprising number of people drink before or at work - chefs servers bartenders bussers... the whole lot. Realizing this I gave myself leeway in the past to do all of the above. But there are PLENTY people who are just there  to work as hard as they can responsibly to achieve their goals whether that's to continue in hospitality or something else. I'd rather be in the latter group. 
Triumph- I feel more committed to sobriety now than ever. The last time I had this resolve I lasted 17 months and relapsed FOUR YEARS ago. Took me four years but I'm back on track. Some girls at school asked me to drink with them and I said "no thanks I don't drink". Easy peasy!..Struggle- the stress of balancing work school and a family (there's a reason most people go to school in their twenties and not thirties!) has kicked me into a hyper state of anxiety. I had a teensy nervous breakdown and am taking some time off work. BUT I'm not using that time to day drink like I would have. Going to do some yoga be outside and get my head clear...General- I'll be done with school in four months and when I get a better job I'll be able to be financially stable as my sober husband and I won't be throwing all our money away at bars...Cheers!
T:  Not drinking on Sunday (see struggle)..S:  We told our college age kids we are getting divorced.  Still struggling with the decision..G: Really good progress at meeting yesterday on a big project.
**Triumph:**  I made it through a 4-day 40th birthday party on a Utah mesa with some of my closest friends and didn't crave a drink at all.  I was able to get up before everyone and go for a trail run along the cliff edge and just be so present for the whole thing!  I feel rejuvenated and relaxed.  YES...**Struggle:**  Now to keep that calm throughout the week.  I actually "OM"'d my way through traffic today and that rounded vibratory sound kept me focused and relaxed as we drove 20 mph on the highway.  I will keep up my meditation and set aside time for reflection and time outside.  I think that should do a lot for keeping me in the right head space...**General:**  Being snuggled between my girlfriend and her dog cozy under blankets in the middle is so deeply comforting.  I also feel that way when I meditate and stretch.
Triumph: 97 days sober! Woo-hoo! I was telling someone the other day this feels like a bigger accomplishment then getting a college degree. I'm continuing to get more tranquil and better at sitting with my feelings...Struggle: I've been getting a lot of headaches lately and it feels like I NEED a nap in the afternoon on the weekends. I struggle to stay awake if I'm not constantly drinking caffeine which bothers me a lot too...General: Reading on my couch or outside on my balcony especially in the early morning is very tranquil for me.
T:  There are leaves on the trees!!!..S:  I think my dog has ear mites.  Failing at school still not giving up (sometimes being stubborn has a positive side) ..G:  Hygge well when my house is clean all of my shit is taken care of laundry and dishes put away ... maybe one day I'll get there and stay there.  There is always hope.
Triumph: Staying sober this weekend after drinking Thursday night..Struggle: Meeting new people who are sober it seems like everyone I know is drinking all the time smoking weed or using other substances. I want to be a social person but it's hard when everyone you know wants to either be drunk or stoned when they hang out. ..General: A moment when I feel comfort and well-being is also when I sit down with a good book and a cup of tea at the end of the day. Also when I walk outside in the morning sober and see a beautiful day ahead of me. 
Just commenting to see a 3 at the start of my badge.
Did my Taxes last night I owe over 3k and was thanking my self for not drinking or else I'd have tried to get that lower and lower and probably would have done lot's of things to flag an audit. Not drinking makes me responsible and I feel great for it. Even if I do have to pay a shit ton of taxes...Happy sober days ahead and to celebrate the midweek I'll make dinner for a girl I like and watch a movie. It's nice to not feel like shit either...Have a great day my SD peeps! 
**Triumph:** One of the things I've been revisiting in sobriety is painting and I set a goal: finish 200 paintings by december 2017. i'm at #62 which feels good. i'm still not very good (i took a decade or so break from visual art) but i can tell that my skills *are* improving. it may be a marginal improvement but it's happening. that feels really really fucking great and i know i wouldn't be able to dedicate so much time to it if i were drinking...**Struggle:** i can't tell if this bluesy feeling is seasonal circumstantial or chemical but it's a pretty persistent malaise underneath it all. it maybe worth trying an anti-depressant although i'm not sure. i'm going to talk to ALL THE DOCTORS once my new health insurance kicks in and see if i can suss it out. i'm not as down in the dumps as i once was (not even close!) but i feel like i'm struggling enough to seek outside opinions. ..**General:** i've been playing a super mario game on my phone and uh yes i am enjoying it. ..thanks for sharing about "hygge!" i love the word and concept. .&gt; What's a moment when you feel comfort and well-being?..cuddling with the dumb cats in a very clean apartment while wearing my pajama romper (post-long bath naturally) and sipping on a piping hot cup of tea. 
Triumph: I've started seeing a psychotherapist and I'm excited to confront my mental health issues to better myself and my relationships!..Struggle: I work at a brewery and I had a beer last night. I'm not sure how to reset my clock but I'm really beating myself up about it. ..General: feeling very anxious and always worried my boyfriend is going to leave if i mess up again. ..I will NOT drink today
Triumph: I successfully potty trained my son via bribery. And I got to spend the long holiday weekend with him which was amazing for a million different reasons. Seeing how similar our personalities are even at his young age (he's 3) is so hilarious and awe-inspiring. ..Struggle: I ate sooooo much ice cream pie and BBQ this weekend so working out the past couple of days hasn't been fun. Ah well it was totally worth it. ..General: I feel comfort and well-being when I'm in the zone having an amazing run. There's no feeling like hitting mile 5 and getting that epic endorphin rush that makes me want to run another 5 miles (even though I rarely push it because I have old man knees).
For some reason I'm having a hard time today. I woke up wanting to drink and that hasn't stopped. If anything it's intensifying as the day progresses. I'm going to hit the treadmill and run like hell at lunch to see if I can get some relief. 
Triumph: I am coming up on one sober month!   ..Struggle: I still get the urge to drink when stress is hitting me hard although less so over time.   ..General: We are finally getting settled in our beautiful new home. It's been great having something positive and productive to direct my energy towards. Quitting drinking before the move has been a great motivator to stay sober and never drink in this house. 
Triumph: Only in my first week of sobriety a coworker asked me if I've lost some weight! The answer is no I'm just not terribly bloated like I've usually been :) Hanging in there. Not drinking today! 
Triumph: Gf went to the gym got a personal trainer is quitting smoking getting on a diet today because I've been pushing her hard every day to start changing her life around and it's paying off. .Struggle: she's gonna try to quit sugar on top of that think itll break the camels back. But anyway about me...yeah life is difficult. .General: supposed to get super on the job hunt today... If i can do that ill feel a bit accomplished. 
**Triumph:** Finding SD! Reading through it has changed my mindset about quitting drinking. This is the first time that I have actually truly wanted to stop.  **Struggle:** Dealing with the collateral damage of my drinking. There are several things hanging over my head - explaining missed days at work getting to the doctor and calling back a friend. . **General:** I'm feeling both excited and scared about committing to not drinking. Trying to take it day by day.

Struggle: my two year old daughter is incessantly asking to play on my phone but we haven't finished breakfast yet...Triumph: I'm actually awake early enough to have breakfast.
Triumph: haven't had a drink in 4 months. That is an honest statement. I haven't been drunk in 4 years but have had a drink or two here and there. Bad decisions. Entire time I was talking to other people with a drink in my hand the internal conversation went like this "why are you doing this? You know you shouldn't be doing this. It's just one I can handle one. Don't have anymore. This is it. No more" in a repetitive loop. ..Struggle: headed to Italy soon and all I can think about is all the wine and lemoncello and how great it would be and sure I can just have a few while I'm there. ..General: want to put my pajamas on and go to bed.
Not going to drink today
On a quiet warm sunny afternoon lying curled up on top of my blankets just basking in the sun like a cat sort-of reading.
