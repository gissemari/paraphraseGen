Alcohol is sneaky and it's easy to get complacent. I was thinking  what can a few beers hurt  ended up getting blackout drunk in bed by 10 pm.

Man..  $hit certainly happens...  Keep your head up &amp; start again today. It's a slow process... Booze is certainly a serpent that sneaks up on you...
Planned to only have a couple beers yesterday and it turned into 12 beers and 9 whiskey drinks 
I hear you I'm one drink away from fifteen drinks. Take care of yourself today.
