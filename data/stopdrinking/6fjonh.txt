Hello everyone I am 30 year old male who has struggled with alcohol for about half of my life. I began drinking heavily after my parents divorced and reached the point of oblivion about 6 years later when my younger brother took his own life. ..I have been in recovery for the last five years and managed to pull together two years of complete sobriety in that time. The last year has been very different. After reaching my 2 year mark I slowly began to tell myself that I could control my drinking and that "things were different now." Since that time I have nearly hit rock bottom everything I was able to manage while I was sober has fallen apart. It was a slow process at first but then quickly spiraled out of control. ..Thankfully I didn't end up dead or in jail but having to start over has been incredibly hard. I am trying my hardest to forgive myself for the past year and not feel like a complete failure for what's happened. However I am asking for help again and working the same program that got me sober the first time around. ..I have been telling myself for months that I was going to post on here. I've followed this subreddit for years but have never had the courage to post anything. Anyway thank you for giving me the opportunity to reach out this community has done a lot for me the past several years and I hope it makes things a bit easier (if that's possible) in the future.

Good luck man! I'll not be drinking with you today.
Welcome aboard.  I've been posting like crazy.  I think it works into my subconscious mind all the positive things I post about how great it is to be sober.  Post away my friend.  There is a lot of wisdom and experience and kindness on the board.  I won't drink with you today.
