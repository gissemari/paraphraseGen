Tomorrow morning I will be heading down to San Diego with all of my old drinking buddies for my best friends bachelor party. Out of the 12 guys going I am the only one who is sober and am also the only one who will not be getting absurdly "guys night out" drunk every night. On our way to the beach house we will be stopping at FIVE breweries. FIVE!!! I will most likely get stuck playing team mom all weekend and driving everyone around which will suck but I'm going to try and stay positive and not be a dick. Lord knows I've annoyed my fair share of sober drivers in my day. ..Saturday we'll be going to the Chargers v Seahawks preseason game which should be pretty fun and our house is right on the beach which will be aweesooome for morning jogging. Everything besides that is going to be a struggle. I'm not worried about drinking I'm worried about being the party pooper. Wish me luck!

&gt; I'm worried about being the party pooper.  ..Don't poop at parties have fun.  
Wow that sounds intense.  But I can understand wanting to still support your best friend and have fun celebrating his last day as an eligible bachelor.  And yay for beach jogging - I love that!
Doesn't it feel great knowing for sure you won't drink? I love that feeling. From powerless to powerful. Have fun!
Just think how good you'll feel in the mornings on the beach!  And plus if you go to a Pizza Port it's actually some of the best pizza ever made IMO.   Good luck!
Good luck!
Make sure to be absurdly cheerful loud and boisterous in the early mornings when you come in from your run. Your hungover buddies will love you for your spirit and if not you are allowed to take pleasure from their pain in this circumstance. You'll set them a good example of loving life.
