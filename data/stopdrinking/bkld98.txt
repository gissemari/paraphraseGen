Bought a bottle of wine last night after work for the first time in nearly three months of being *mostly* sober and almost ten days completely dry.  I thought I deserved it while I mourned the would-be birthday of my best friend who died by presumed suicide/OD 18 months ago.   Enjoyed  two large-ish glasses with dinner and through dessert super impressed with my self-control!  In reality I stayed up longer than I wanted (long enough to eat a second totally unnecessary second dessert) and then went to bed sad with a dirty kitchen and a full glass of water sitting untouched on my nightstand. ..Here's what I already regret this morning:..I ended an awesome weeklong streak of restorative 8-hour sleeps.  Prior to last night I'd finally fallen into natural and healthy sleep patterns waking up for work without an alarm at 6.  Fitbit tells me that - of the 5.75 hours I logged last night - .75 was spent awake 1 in restless sleep and the rest in variable patterns of light (mostly) and deep (a couple spikes.) ..I am craving processed food - my stomach feels empty and sick at the same time.  It's not the standard TERRIBLE level following a night of heavy drinking but it's enough to frustrate my plans to eat a healthy breakfast and go for an energizing morning run with my doggo...My head is fuzzy and my body feels sluggish.  I am dehydrated and sure crying can be blamed for part of this - but had I been drinking sparkling water instead of wine... I'd have allowed my body to replenish itself over the course of the night. ..The worst impact is on my mood.  Since committing to drastically reduce/quit drinking I've struggled with depressive states and also allowing myself to be (like actually feel) happy without alcohol.  Finally in the past week I've begun to notice an underlying improvement in my core feelings and state of mind.  This morning I feel guilty and anxious and blah.  Worst of all I'm not processing the grief over loss of my friend - and I've inhibited my brain's ability to recall and settle on happier times with him. ..Sharing this experience today after months of being encouraged by others' posts to keep myself accountable and - hopefully - help someone who's inching closer to the mistake I made last night.

This is a very helpful reminder to me about what even two drinks can be like so thank you! So sorry about your friend. I've also reached for alcohol to process strong emotions (also in relation to suicide as an issue with someone close) which in my experience either inhibits them or makes them more negative. I'm prone to the 7-9 standard drink solitary binges but on plenty of occasions have stuck to 2-3. But a sober period of a couple of months really highlighted how run down even that can make me feel and once you're used to a lot of sober sleep sleep after any alcohol is substandard. I \*know\* that the full-on binges are awful for me but it's very helpful to be reminded how much better life is with no alcohol and how even 2 or 3 affects mood sleep diet and well-being generally. Don't feel too bad about having done this. It's all useful information gathering for you and for us reading your post!
