I'm currently coming out of a period of increased drinking following some significant life changes. I'm not a daily drinker but I tend to go hard on weekends both when things are going well or a bit less well in my life. These weekend binges ended up destabilizing me mentally and emotionally for days on end and a couple have led to some terrible decisions that have affected my relationships over the past couple years...&amp;#x200B;..A week ago I decided to quit again in part because I'm in a strange place in life that needs as much mental clarity as I can muster. I've quit for several months at a time before and I usually don't have any problems staying away from alcohol when I set my mind to it but this time it feels different. Today I have an oddly strong urge to go out and get drunk with friends (maybe because it's Friday?). I only smoke cigarettes when I drink for example and I just went out and had a cigarette for the first time in a week. Nervous energy is coursing through me and I don't know how to direct it. I'm also alone in this city right now so there's almost no accountability except to myself. That explains the cigarette which feels like part of a wider weakness right now.   ...This absolutely terrifies me.   ...I struggle to admit to myself that I have a problem but my patterns are undeniable at this point. It's even harder to recognize when my friends and colleagues also like to party on the weekends though they never seem to struggle with it to the same extent I do (or maybe  some do and I just don't see it). It's like there's part of me that recognizes my problem and then another part that wants to downplay it and normalize it. I want to be able to recognize the problem without creating a cycle of shame and self-anger that just perpetuates the mindset that wants to get drunk in the first place. I need to be both positive and firm but I'm feeling negative and weak.  ..  .For the first time in a long time I feel like I need to reach out for support. So yeah here I am. IWNDWYT!

Everything you write rings so true for me - right down to the cigarettes! the nervous energy feeling daunted by a lack of accountability and just wanting to go out and get fucked up I know those feelings so well. .I'm only 12 days in but I've been really relying on my phone to distract me. Like just scrolling through subreddits of dumb gifs and stuff and letting my brain feast on that instant gratification. Anything that keeps me from physically walking to buy booze for another ten minutes and then I find another thing after that. One boring ass foot in front of the other! IWNDWYT
