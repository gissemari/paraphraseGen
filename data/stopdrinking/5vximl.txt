Good evening guys..I'll try to make this as short as possible but I have been experiencing the hardest period of my life for a couple of years now. I'm a 22 years old guy and I am facing very obsessive behaviour which is driving me insane and ruining all my chances in life...I remember when I was a kid I had some teddybears which had to be in the same order in my bed otherwise something bad would happen to someone I love. That was also the period my twin sister had cancer and it really had a bad impact on me being still that young...That's the earliest memory I have of my OCD. When my cat died I had to think 3 times about my cat otherwise someone would die in my family. It felt crazy thinking that stuff. It kinda went away when I became older...The year after when I turned 10 years old I moved from my home country in Europe to Mexico. It really had an impact on me leaving everyone and living there with my parents was really strange. My mom drank heavily and we had to move back to our country in Europe after 2 years because she was depressed..I went back to another school where I knew no one was bullied and always felt like that kid that was left out. I always had the feeling I'm different then the rest out there...Things went downhill when I was 16 and tried to kill myself over a girl because my mom and dad divorced when we came back to Europe had problems adapting myself back again into my home country and had the feeling that nobody loved me. Spent some time in mental hospitals and started to live in a studio for kids in youth care/child protection with some emotional and financial support...There I started smoking weed. The whole studio complex smoked weed they all didn't seem to care. I became addicted to marijiuanatook hard drugs but somehow I still got my grades right and I graduated high school. I moved back to my dad's and things got better just smoking a joint once a week...Since those years passed I always had the desire to quit smoking weed and cigarettes and alcohol for a couple of years to regain those lost years. Cigarettes because I smoke a pack a day and hate how I destroy my body. Weed because it makes me look like a junk and makes me even sleep more. I have a condition (sleep delayed phase syndrome) which makes me sleep 12 hours a day. Alcohol because it makes me even more emotional then I already am. ..This has been like that my whole life. The last year I have spent smoking weed and sleeping the whole day only to eat and go back to sleep once again...For 4 years I have been trying to quit smoking weed and cigarettes mostly succeeding for a week of at best for a month but I relapsed for some reason (= addiction or paranoid about the unlucky numbers). Somehow my OCD came back from all that substance abuse and now I can't stop on the 345678912131415161718192223242526272829th of the month because I think they are unlucky numbers. I can't stop smoking on the 3th because when I do that my first smoke free day is on the 4th which is an unlucky number in China. I can't stop smoking on the 17th because it's an unlucky number in Italy. For each of the numbers/dates I typed out I have a reason I can give you why they would be unlucky to "stop smoking"..I feel like I'm crazy and it's holding me back. ..I'm dropping out of college because I hang out with friends who only chill with me because they know they can laugh at me. I sleep all day and smoke weed. My obsession is also stopping everything on the same day (weed cigs alcohol). If I relapse with smoking I relapse the same day with everything. My addictions have become chained/linked to each other over these years of extreme obsession...My dad wants to kick me out because he thinks I'm a worthless piece of shit. I don't do anything the whole days have no pleasure in life anymore. I even stole money once to pay for weed so I hadn't had to stop "on the 13th". It's madness. I don't know how to cope with this anymore. I'm being supported by a psychologist right now but I still feel lost. When I stopped smoking weed and cigs for a month a year ago I felt like a different person. Now for the last year I broke my bank account on all sort of drugs have no godd relations left only drug or abusive related and feel lost. I have lost all my confidence...I have tried to quit once again on the 20th of February succeeding 3 days but today I relapsed. I will try once again today on the 24th although it makes me go mad "because 24 is an unlucky date because 24 is unlucky in China (because 2+4) and because of this I will never succeed in life. This is how my OCD fucks me up..I don't expect miracles posting this just grasping for the last of support I could find.....The harder I try to change the harder I seem to fall...
----------immediate responses--------

TL;DR: I have been wanting to stop smoking weed and cigarettes and alcohol. They are wrecking my mental state and body. However over years and hundreds of failed attempts my OCD came back in a way that it connected with "quitting my addictions". ..I have lots of unlucky numbers (dates) that I can't quit on because "they will bring me bad luck" that will according to my OCD never make me succeed in life. (like 17th of February I can't quit because 17 is unlucky in Italy and that will ruin my life 16th I can't quit because 17th would be my first smokefree day and so on..) ..I know it sounds silly but that's how my brain behaves at the moment. As my OCD and addictions are connected it would be beneficial to get your advices.
I've also had OCD from a young age so I know how it feels &amp; how much damage it can do to your mental &amp; emotional well-being &amp; self-esteem &amp; how it tangles up with addictions anxiety depression etc. It can make even simple everyday tasks feel like climbing a sheer cliff-face with jagged rocks lying in wait below you so it's no surprise that it makes life incredibly difficult when you're trying to make such important changes.  It's not your fault your brain works this way &amp; it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's good that you're seeing a psychologist hopefully they can advise you on medication therapy like CBT or support groups? Also maybe help with sorting out some accommodation of your own?Quitting all your addictions at once is a hell of a lot of pressure so the fact that you managed 3 days is something to be proud of! I think the thing that's so hard to explain about OCD to people who've never experienced it is that ultimately you know that what the OCD is telling you is all lies &amp; nonsense but the neurological wiring in your brain just constantly overrides the rational response. So much kudos to you for tackling the 24th I hope today goes well for you.
