So I am in drug treatment at the hospital. I've been in it for over three years. I had a drug test by my psychiatrist last Friday. I failed for high amounts of hydromorphan morphine and codeine which came from poppy seed tea. I also had 300 ng/ml of cocaine in my system and 10 ng/ml of thc...I had relapsed and not told my relapse prevention group. I had done this because I am on felony probation and am afraid of getting revoked or going to jail...I have now admitted to my therapist that I have used the poppy seed tea and thc. I denied the cocaine. I denied the cocaine use. I am extremely afraid of going to jail. She said that I should think about what I will be sharing with the group on Monday...Should I come clean about everything and risk going to jail or should I just say I did the poppy seed tea and thc?..I'm not sure if they are going to tell my probation agent or not...I have stayed out of trouble on probation for over a year and a half. I am off probation in April...I just need advice on what I should do and what I should share on Monday. Please someone help me.

I'm going to agree with /u/SOmuch2learn on this one. If I didn't want to get well I'd have lied my way through my treatment like I saw a few others do. The consequence may suck but it's how we deal with the consequence that makes all the difference.
I agree with all of the above. Get it out if you truly wish to get better. To thine own self be true. It kinda doesn't matter what you say to them in the end it matters what you do to you.
