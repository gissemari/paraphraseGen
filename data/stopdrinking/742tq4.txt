And I'm not drinking with you - stay strong!!!
It's like driving down a dark country road and you have your high beams on. Another vehicle appears heading toward you. You turn off your high beams. The other vehicle doesn't. But you leave yours off because one blind driver is better than two blind drivers coming at each other head on.
There IS hope. Hubby and I shared 25 years of alcoholic misery. I'd stop he'd start then vice versa for YEARS! One day after a 4 day binge when we'd both called in sick we decided to not start again. That was over 5 years ago and we share the same sobriety date. It CAN be done! One day one moment at a time. I needed AA and Celebrate Recovery to stay stopped. Best wishes friends.
