Well third times the charm right? Been fighting this for a long time was in an outpatient program but they told me after this last relapse that I needed a higher level of care or they couldn't help me. Working to get my cat settled had to email my 2nd/side job and resign and tomorrow will be going in and letting my full time job know I need to take a month's leave. ..I don't think it's really sunk in yet. As my dad told me it's time to stop fucking around and do this. For real. Love and well wishes to everyone here alcoholism has kicked my ass over and over and over for 10 years now- it's time to fight back.
