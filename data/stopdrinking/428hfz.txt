As I try and get through my first sober Friday - something I have yet to accomplish in 3 attempts at sobriety since December - I thought I would share my story and how I got here. At the very least I think it might be therapeutic for me to put it all out there and have a record of the events that led to today. ..I never had any issues with drinking growing up. In fact I didn't have my first drink until 12th grade despite hanging out with people who starting drinking by the 6th or 7th grade. In University I went completely sober for my first two years and even in the latter two years I only really drank on the weekends. I would go hard when I drank but I didn't drink often and it wasn't a problem. I think the primary reason for this is because I have struggled with an extreme anxiety disorder since my early teens and I have always been afraid of losing control. Early in my life being drunk always felt like a form of losing control (though as my addiction developed it actually made me feel safer and numb to the world). ..I think my first bit of trouble with addiction came in third year of University when my anxiety became so bad I needed to be medicated. I had obsessive health anxiety fear of going crazy and derealization to the point where I was barely functioning. I was put on SSRIs and Benzodizapines. The SSRIs didn't help - they just made me fat and lazy - but Benzos provided me with instant relief. For about 1.5 years following this I was taking a small dose of benzos daily and then taking more to prevent panic and anxiety as necessary. My doctor started to try and wean me off Benzos after the first six months (her initial goal was for them to be a temporary fix while the SSRIs kicked in) but was I was able to talk her into continuing daily use for 1.5 years. After that point I was cut down to an 'as needed' only basis and essentially I get about 30 pills every six months and I need to figure out how to use them as I wish. While I did go through some withdrawal my dose was low and I managed to kick the benzo habit pretty quickly but I think my brain had begun to learn that anytime I came up against a difficult situation I could 'numb' myself with pills and this would be the start of a habit that would last for the next 3/4 of a decade. I do not in any way regret going on benzos - the internet is full of horror stories about these drugs and they have become harder and harder to get but they truly truly saved my life and they continue to help me to this day in the rare occurrence. ..That being said I began to look for other ways to numb my thoughts and feelings during the end of school and beginning of my working life. I would pop half a gravol/dramamine or I would take some valerian root. Until one day I discovered a family member who had been being prescribed percocet on a daily basis for the past two years but had taken a total of zero pills (in other words they were the exact opposite of me). They had an injury and as part of an insurance claim they needed to showcase the level of pain they were in and thus their doctor prescribed them the pills but they didn't want to get addicted so they didn't take them. They had these pills stashed in a particular area of their house and never cared to check on them. I managed to steal 100 pills and over the next couple months I would take 2 or 3 per day. This quickly grew into 4 or 5 a day and eventually into a 10-12 pill habit and i'm sure all that Tylenol not do my liver any favours. No one in the world knows i had this addiction. When the pills ran out I would cope for a few months and then go and steal some more. I managed to steal hundreds of pills over the next couple years and would go through phases of taking them and phases of not. The individual eventually was weaned off their prescription and my access to these drugs evaporated in 2013...At this point I had gotten another promotion at work and was extremely stressed and I began to take my usual 1-2 time per week drinking habit and began drinking a couple days a week. For the first year I legitimately don't think I had a problem but somewhere along the way things got worse. It's strange looking back because my addiction to booze feels like it started both so slowly and so quickly at the same time. Slowly in terms of the fact that I almost didn't notice the frequency of my drinking creeping up it was so gradual - it feels like it caught me off guard. Quickly in terms of the fact that I feel like I blinked and all of a sudden I had a severe drinking problem and it feels like some sort of strange dream. Like I have no idea how I got here or how I let this happen to myself. ..I would say I've been a problem drinker for two years but that the last 6 months are where things started getting out of control. I am highly functional as an alcoholic - besides probably smelling like booze half the time I doubt anyone would have known I had issues. I've had a handful of solid promotions at work I have a great career I got married I've travelled to 20 countries in the last 3 years etc. But somehow I got to a point where I was drinking a minimum of 6 nights a week and often 7. I was drinking "two drinks" per night during the week as I used to like to tell myself but really these were 4 ounces of booze per drink and It wasn't unusual for me to get into a 3rd or 4th drink. Then I started drinking during the day. 3 out of the 5 business days I would leave my office and go get lunch and down 3 or so beers then. I would be buzzed for half the afternoon then I would race home and start drinking more. Saturday and Sunday morning i'd hide booze in my coffee and start the day the same way i'd end it - drunk. I had a secret stash of booze under my bathroom sink so i'd sneak away and my wife would never know exactly how much I was actually drinking. For the first time in my life I was beginning to black out from time to time too - remembering very few details of the previous night. I was also becoming more of an irritating drunk - I spend this past Christmas crying my eyes out for a half hour in the bathroom while all my relatives sat upstairs saying that everyone hated me because someone had the nerve to tell me I was being annoying when I was legitimately being annoying. I am a grown 29 year old man and I was crying like an 8th grade girl after one too many vodka coolers. ..I've also spent the last 3-4 months trying to 'cut back' without success. My attempt at cutting back was so half assed and was almost more of a way to allow myself to keep drinking and keep my wife off my back about it. I literally came up with a 'plan' where for the first two weeks I would ONLY drink 6 times per week then 5 days for 2 weeks then 4 then 3 etc. As if any serious plan allows a person to continue to drink 6 days per week for two weeks. And of course every time I hit 4 times per week I would stop trying saying I had a bad week and now wasn't the right time to quit so I was going to start over at 5. My health feels like it's finally taking a hit too - I went to the doctor with BP of 195/120 in September. While part of that is no doubt genetic (my father has been on BP medication since he was 23 and he's not a drinker and my mother has high BP too) this was also obviously being fuelled by my drinking. I had a bunch of tests done on my heart and kidneys as a result and thank god they came back healthy. I'm also on BP medication which keeps it under control. I'm too scared right now to ask them to test my liver...After the Christmas crying incident I decided I needed to make changes. I've told the story of the past month here before but at first i decided to just cut back my drinking. I very quickly changed my mind after reading a fair amount of stories online (both here and a few other places) and realized I need to quit. I've already reset my badge 3 times. However what I am most proud of is that I keep getting RIGHT back up after I slip up and starting fresh. Old me would have said "well i'm resetting my badge anyways so might as well have another week of drinking before trying this again". Overall i've drank a small handful of days in the past month vs. nearly every day and I'm proud. But i'm determined to keep building on this accomplishment. Starting with tonight. I've gotten through Monday-Thursday without drinking before but Friday is where I keep getting tripped up. Not tonight. It's already 7:30 - normally I would be at least two drinks deep by now. Instead I went for an hour walk with my dogs made some dinner and am going to watch a movie. Progress.

Progress!
I could not imagine getting sober without all the support possible. Rehab a therapist and AA saved my life. No relapses and that's only because of having no doubt that if I started drinking again I would eventually die of alcoholism.  My respect and fear of alcohol is profound. ..When you start drinking do you always assume that you will eventually get the chance to be sober again? I don't have that belief. I've seen too many people who don't make it back. ..Kudos for the progress you've made! Weekends were difficult in early sobriety and I went to AA meetings to fill empty time and to be with understanding people. The fellowship is golden. I hope your weekend is safe.
