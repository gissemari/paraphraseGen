The holidays are emotional hurricane season. I just weathered a category 5 yesterday. Lots of opportunities to go  so I drank to escape feelings like *this*.  Then a couple minutes later it would be  damn this is the kind of thing I used to drown out.  But I got through it without cravings or struggling....This isn't to brag. This isn't to say that it was a fun day. It IS to say that things get better. The tools and skills we learn in early sobriety become the tools and skills we can use to build a better life. The cravings and desire we struggle against can be subdued and changed fade and life continue....I clung to that message-that things would get better. That the pain and struggle I felt in the early months of sobriety would not be the rest of my life. There is still struggle still pain still anger. Those emotions aren't focused on alcohol anymore aren't focused exclusively on myself. I'm using those emotions to grow and change.

Such a good message thanks! 
&gt; The holidays are emotional hurricane season. I just weathered a category 5 yesterday...Yup.  But I agree it's the difference between trying to weather it in a brick house or in a straw hut for me.  Still sorry that happened.
