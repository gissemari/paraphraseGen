Hi SD..Just checking in to say that my weekend was fine. Friday I went to a bar with a friend and I did not feel the urge to drink. Instead of drinking a lot and being hungover the whole weekend I ordered non alcoholic beer and went home early so I could spent my saturday enjoying a nice hike. Saturday night was even more of a challenge. My girlfriend went out with some friends so I had the house to myself. Normally this would mean that I would drink myself to sleep by the television. It was hard at first but then I decided that I would break the habit and enjoy television without a drink. I went to bed early again and now I am still sober and fresh so I can enjoy my day to the fullest. ..I guess I would just like to say: thank you everybody here for your posts/support/inspiration. Without it I might have relapsed again...Have a nice Sunday and IWNDWYT!!!

Yeah I did something similar I had the perfect opp to drink last night but didn't.  Today I got up early and got loads done.  I am so happy but part of me is asking why I didn't do it earlier.  We lost an hour last night due to daylight savings and it made no difference to me!
Hell yeah! That's awesome. Thank you for checking in. You're inspiring me to continue not drinking this weekend!
