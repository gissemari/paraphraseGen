Happy Thursday sobernauts..I'd like to host a weekly thread here where we can focus and reflect on what we are grateful for. Alliteration is as good a reason as any to choose Thankful Thursdays! ..I'll include something (likely a quote maybe an image cat pic podcast video research topic etc.) on thankfulness and invite SDers to take a few moments to reflect on what they are grateful for **today**...Writing down 5 gratitudes and 5 acknowledgements daily has supported my sobriety it's been transformational helping recognise the good in the world around me and within my own actions and thus raising my mood and motivation. ..The gratitudes in particular have helped how I experience the world I live in opened my eyes to recognise the beauty and wonder of the world around me. They've been my go-to tool when I'm experiencing fear or attitude. It shifts my focus from lack and regret to recognise the abundance and opportunity around me. It is literally counting my blessings...I frame my gratitudes in the positive make them about TODAY make them specific and they aren't necessary big things they can be really small. ..---..**My gratitudes**..1. Today I am thankful for my health and the opportunity to go on a cycle in glorious weather in the countryside...2. Today I am thankful for a few extra minutes just hugging and being present with my husband. What a lovely way to start the day. ..3. Today I am thankful for the shared experiences of the r/stopdrinking community it helps me to map out new thought patterns and values and know that I'm not alone..4. Today I am thankful for my cat who waked me up in the nicest gentlest ways possible she teaches me a lot about serenity. And yoga...5. Today I am thankful for the opportunity to complete my studies...---..**Thankful quote:**.. *Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have you will never ever have enough*  ..  Oprah Winfrey..---..**So r/stopdrinking**..**What are you grateful for today?** *If you're struggling to find something is there one are of your life you can start on   health family friends work education environment etc.* ..**Are you willing to share at least one gratitude here?** ..**Is there anything else you'd like to see in the weekly Thankful Thursday thread?**

I'm thankful for being in good treatment(because of my mental illness). Otherwise no-one would have known I drink too much and I could still be drinking. Now they noticed it early on and encouraged me to seek help before I did that much damage to myself and others.
I really like this idea! I left a comment earlier but it got lost in cyberspace apparently. Today I'm thankful for my husband! We've been through much and don't always see eye to eye but still we're here. And I like it that way :)
I am thankful for a supportive boyfriend who is always there for me and loves me passionately even with my flaws; two sweet soft kittens who wake me up by purring in a pile in my arms every morning; two intelligent loving parents who are also my neighbors; and for my stubborn personality that has helped me tackle this sobriety project with gusto and fevered tenacity. 
I am grateful for waking up sober and being able to tackle some banking issues to before they could get worse. I am grateful for my SO who supports me as I get my shit together. I am grateful for my kid who keeps me motivated to better myself and not fuck up. I am grateful for the opportunity to go back to school and being only a few classes shy of transferring to a university. I am grateful for SD and everyone who is a part of it =)
1. You finallywoken have set up this thread. I had this idea a few weeks ago but didn't think I could commit to keeping it up. So thank you and I will be the first volunteer if you need a break/rotation...2. I had to miss my meeting and getting my 60-day chip this morning because I was getting a donation of food from the local Trader Joes that will feed me for a week...3. I have a phone to receive collection calls on and hopefully some job offers soon...4. I have friends and sober siblings in the program to lean on when I have bad days and just want to lie in bed crying...5. I have access to a beach a few minutes away and the best and most soothing meditation of ocean waves for previously mentioned bad days :)..Alive and sober!
