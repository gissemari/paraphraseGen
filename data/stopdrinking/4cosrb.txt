Requisite spoiler alert for those that care about that sort of thing.  ..I've been slowly watching *Love* on Netflix and have been thinking about episode six a lot this week. I do believe that co-creator Lesley Arfin is in recovery from addiction and it shows. One of the shows main characters Mickey has been in and out of AA and sobriety and she is portrayed as an actual human being rather than as a caricature of addiction. What I like about the portrayal of Mickey's addiction so far is that it shows how draining and suffocating the cycle of knowing you need to stop and yet still finding yourself repeatedly drinking or using is. That really showed to me in the 'Andy' episode of the show..  .In episode six she is introduced to a friend of a friend at a bar (played by Andy Dick) and the two outlast everyone else and keep the night going with some unknown drug. They end up on the subway for a few hours and end up talking about their struggles with addiction. In a scene that struck me Gillian Jacobs gives a killer performance and I could really see myself in her body language and delivery. At one point she says "[I don't want to do this anymore](http://i.imgur.com/ileI9YB.png)" and it made me both deeply uncomfortable and so grateful. I've said that same sentence about drinking about recovery about living and a thousand other things and Gillian seemed to convey the sentiment behind it all as she delivered the line.  ..All of that is to say if you feel up to it I could see it being hard to watch for some I would recommend checking the show out. It might not be for everyone but I've enjoyed it so far.

Hm you've made me curious about this show now. I will check it out!

I just watched this episode last night! I really really like it. When Mickey joked that the worst part about relapsing is resetting your sobriety counter app I related it reminded me of the badges here on SD; having to reset my badge last weekend absolutely sucked...The "I don't want to do this anymore" line killed me though. Gillian Jacobs did an incredible job.
Have you seen "flaked"?  That has an AA theme.  I've only watched two episodes so I'm not sure how that works out though.
