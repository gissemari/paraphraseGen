Excessive drinking affects your brain physically as well as functionally. The physical effects include shrinkage of the prefrontal cortex and the brain stem. So what if I have been sober for a while and then relapse? From one study:..*In the relapsers lifetime consumption of alcohol predicted later vulnerability to white matter volume decline and third ventricular enlargement with resumption of drinking. Resumption of drinking after a short period of abstinence arrests third ventricular volume improvement and produces white matter volume loss (Pfefferbaum 1995).*..Not only will your brain start to lose volume improvements but very importantly lifetime consumption of alcohol maintains a heightened level of vulnerability to this negative impact even after one quits drinking...Just something to think about...

Love this. Thanks so much.
Yep - you go right back to where you were.  Thanks and congrats on the 65 days! I will not drink with you today!
Well there goes my Ph.D.
Huh? I think I am a lost cause!  Have a great day and thanks for the post.  I wish you the best.
For a bit more in depth talk on science aspects of addiction as a brain disease [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/aOSD9rTVuWc) covers it in pretty good detail.
