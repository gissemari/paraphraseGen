I'm glad you're feeling so awesome this morning! I just got back from my morning walk and I'm feeling pretty fabulous. Living life is awesome! 
Day 17 here and I hear everyone talking about this pink cloud what am I missing I'm depressed and want each day to just be over with to put another day between me and my quit date it's better than when I was drinking I guess they keep saying it gets better stick with it and I'm giving it a chance I'm happy your feeling great and hope to be there too. Is it tomorrow yet? Lol
