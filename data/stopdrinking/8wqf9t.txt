Every single post here brings something into my life. Whether it's a success story rant or a vile recanting of relapse into the abyss it all reminds me of why I sought sobriety and how I found myself here. ..I've been craving a drink all day since I came home after a week away at my folks place. I remember why I left (asshole neighbors) and I definitely remember why I drank so much here. ..But then I tuned into stopdrinking and saw a post about new bedsheets and remember that I haven't changed my sheets since the last binge I had. Gross. The post gave me the motivation I needed to get the job done. Simple yet effective. ..I'm off to shower then probably finish watching bladerunner 2049. It's nice not being plastered and having the attention span to sit and watch a movie (and actually enjoy the small details). ..Thank you for your stories. Keep it up you beautiful people. ..Let's not let alcohol rob us of our precious bodily fluids. I will not drink with you today!

Welcome home vanhalen!  I got Bluetooth headphones myself that helped on the days I especially didn't want to listen to the neighbours.  IWNDWYT
