I feel better than I did for sure.  My physical energy hasn't come back yet I could nap every day no problem but I work 6 days and I have a 3 year old and do extra work 5 nights a week to bring in a little more...I went to get an account balance and our account went into minus for the first time just a few days ago (I had hoped we'd clear the month but alas...).  We are no longer making enough money to cover our rent and expenses and I can't magically make more money appear.  My beautiful wife is pregnant and hasn't worked since a miscarriage last year.  Things are gonna be a little tight and I actually have no idea what to do...HOWEVER We've been in some pretty sticky situations before (haha alcoholic crazy person here) and we always seem to get through so I'm going to leave this to both providence and hard work i.e. doing what I need to do one step at a time and we'll figure it out along the way...I'm really happy to be sober in all truth and I am very much enjoying being just me for the first time in a long time.  I've been practicing mindfulness and reminding myself of all of that wisdom we store in our heads and seem to forget just when we need it the most and it's all useful stuff...Another post this morning was about stupid adulting and I agree sometimes it just sucks... but my boy comes home from kindergarten any minute now I've got 45 minutes with him before I'm back at the next job and I do have a very purty star next to my name which is well it's nice.  I'm proud o a month sober I really am.  My wife is over the moon which I'm more proud of and more scared of losing...Not drinking with any of you today I'll come home tonight and chill with my SO for a very quiet Valentine's.  Hope you're all ok out there I know it can be a tough time.  Let's all be as kind as we can to ourselves and those around us...Onwards...

For me life didn't magically change much when I got sober.  My responsibilities were real my worries still happened.  But I was different so it felt different.  My reaction wasn't so much 'oh God hide me I can't face this shit I'm going to run away' to 'OK I have to fix this so it's time to get to work'.  It's amazing what a difference that has made to me.
