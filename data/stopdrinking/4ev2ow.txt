Looking to add more to this acronym and any more insight that can be gained. This is how i currently understand HALT but would like to gain more perspective :D..Potential warning signs can be but not limited to this handy acronym HALT - Hungry angry lonely tired. .Those are the big 4..Early sobriety its a good idea to be able to take notice of any of those triggers and try to proactively deal with them for example:..Hungry- Plan your meals to address your nutritional needs versus allowing yourself to get too hungry or forcing yourself to succumb to fast food etc.....Anger-  Take note of any active resentments you may have and make peace with them whether its accepting the present or taking reasonable steps to rectify the situation versus allowing your emotions to get the better of you and seeking that instant gratification of lashing out..Loneliness- Try to set up social engagements/events a few days or weeks in advance so you have less chance of being bored. Versus isolating and looking for cheap fun at a barclub house party etc....Tired - Go to bed early if you can there isn't much good going on past 10pm!..Obviously a quick list but hopefully you get the gist of it. Cultivating a sober lifestyle and pursuing new interests can take a lot of time and effort but can be very rewarding in its own right - not even counting the abstinence of alcohol.

I like the description you have given for each point. I have heard this acronym many times but never broken it down in such a way and given it enough serious consideration. Thank you. 
Good stuff. If also add: bored anxious/nervous and sad. 
Thank you for the reminder and detailed overview. Its one I come across many times but when I start feeling shit need to learn to activate this strategic thinking.
Some people add and S at the end for stress.
