Hello first time posting in this subreddit and really talking about my drinking in general. I'm 21 and started drinking two years ago before that it was the occasional drink but after my first time getting black out drunk that's when I started using it as a coping mechanism. ..I've always struggled with my mental health for as long as I could remember and drinking seemed to help better than pills did. It quickly became the only time I felt stable was when I had a drink. I was going through a rough patch and in a really low spot when everything came to a head at my girlfriends birthday supper. Me and a friend ordered 120 oz of beer and self control went out the window and I drank probably 80-90 oz. I made a total ass of myself and had one of the worst nights of my life where suicide seemed like the best idea...After that night the only alcohol I had was a sip of a beer before my girlfriend reminded me I shouldn't be drinking. I'm starting to feel better now and have no temptations towards drinking but the guilt of how I coped with things and what happened that still stick with me. I don't plan on ever drinking again but when things get particularly difficult that urge is there. It's been hard to not drink when being in college means it's often brought up and offered as well as at family gatherings but it seems to be getting easier.

Congrats on your first post! I'm new too and I've found that just going through and reading as many posts as I find interesting has been a huge help. Just started reading about "playing the tape forward" - that's a good motivator for me....Welcome!
Congratulations on stopping. Hang in there.
