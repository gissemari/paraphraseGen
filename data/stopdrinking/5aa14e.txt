Last night I officially hit my bottom. I have been working my way towards this moment for the last five years. I am not a daily drinker but when I drink I make really bad choices. It caused me a lot of heart ache and regret when I look back. Just so out of control. I am an almost 40 year old woman and I have zero self control once I take that first sip. I would take breaks from time to time to slow down. Then I would hatch plans. Only beer nothing hard. But once I had one drink then all bets were off and I would drink anything I wanted...I hate how I am when I drink. I am loud obnoxious sexually aggressive and wildly inappropriate. I make myself the center of attention and act so selfishly. It adds zero value to my life. I am not scared about this when I verbalized to those close to me that I was officially walking away from alcohol I felt a great sense of relief. I didn't have to pretend it was an issue anymore. What I am struggling with right now is the overwhelming shame. My behavior has probably ruined a very important relationship in my life and I can't help but think if only I had quit sooner. I have so much regret. I know this doesn't serve me but these emotions surround me right now. Its really hard...I am excited for this new chapter. Thank you for reading!...

Whilst I wish I had stopped sooner (wish I had never bothered with alcohol from the outset) I'm very thankful that I didn't leave it until later to stop! I can't change my past but I have eventually woken up and made the decision that gives me my life back and I'm very grateful for this new opportunity at living. I lost a family member a year ago they didn't get the opportunity I have now I am determined to make the most of it...I find peace from accepting the things I can't change (including my past) and just working on the things I can such as living my sober life. Best wishes for your day 1!
