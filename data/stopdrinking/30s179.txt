For those of you who may have had traumatic experiences causing you to feel isolated/lonely....what have you done to overcome that? I see a trauma therapist which is really helpful but I still struggle a lot to feel connected to others. ..Was AA helpful for that? I'm scared to go to AA and then end up feeling lonely there as well.  I try to notice when people are trying to connect with me also and attempt to mirror their connective ways. Which probably sounds nuts to someone who doesn't struggle with this particular issue.  I've always been on my own though so I'm kind of learning all this stuff late in the game. Thanks in advance for any suggestions/ideas.
