I have been struggling with staying sober for a while now. I have asked for help on many occasions and I have always received it. About a week ago I relapsed again and that relapsed lasted 4 days. I did not see myself stopping I had no plan to. I couldn't handled how I felt after that relapse. I did not see a way out of how I was feeling. I wanted to try to kill myself again because of how miserable I felt...I was left with three options I self harmed I overdosed or I checked into the hospital. It took me about 6 hours to make my decision. I talked to lifeline for a couple of hours and I took myself to a meeting. I decided that I needed to check into the hospital because all I still wanted to do was get drunk and hurt myself. I needed to do one thing to prove that I still loved myself so I went to the hospital...They released me yesterday. I was there for almost 72 hours. It sucked being there but it was right where I belonged. It got me out of my relapse that I was stuck in and I was safe. I am now set back up on my meds and with more CD help. I will being going to many more  AA meetings but on top of that I will also be getting more medical help with my drinking and using. Overall staying in the hospital was a success and the best thing for me.
