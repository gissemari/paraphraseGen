Hi everyone! Sixty days today (although my sobriety date is 7/26 so I'm not counting it as two months until I hit the 26th because I'm neurotic like that.) Still it's nice to see quantifiable progress. And I'm at 64 AA meetings so I'm on target for my 90 in 90 goal. Not that going to meetings in itself will keep me sober but it's a good place to start. ..In general I'm finding that it's helpful to have my little things that I do to support my sobriety already established because I'm human and I have bad days as well as good and sometimes I don't *feel* like working on my sobriety. So it's helpful to just say to myself I'm gonna check in on SD anyway because that's what I do. I'm gonna go to a meeting *anyway*. I'm gonna do my sobriety readings *anyway*. (Although the readings haven't always been happening in the mornings which I'm gonna work on getting back in the habit of.) I'm reading Daily Reflections 24 Hours A Day and The Language Of Letting Go which can all be found [here.](http://recoveryreadings.com) Three readings may seem like a bit much but they're all fairly short and this way at least one of them is guaranteed to be relevant to where I'm at...The one thing that I'm struggling with keeping up with is my daily gratitude journal. I'm gonna recommit to doing that though because a five minute [internet search](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal#data-tab-evidence) pulled up [a ton of links](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/what-mentally-strong-people-dont-do/201504/7-scientifically-proven-benefits-gratitude) to [research that indicates gratitude journals work.](http://time.com/5026174/health-benefits-of-gratitude/) They improve mood sleep health - all sorts of things...Part of what I'm struggling with in doing my gratitude journal is that I feel like I'm starting to repeat myself. However it turns out that there's like [a million websites](https://www.nerdycreator.com/blog/gratitude-journal-prompts/) with [gratitude journal prompts](https://www.radicaltransformationproject.com/gratitude-journal-prompts/) so I'm gonna avail myself of [some of those](http://textmyjournal.com/gratitude-journal-prompts/) for a while...In other news I did talk with my sponsor and she agreed that it sounds like it's not a good fit for me. It was uncomfortable to address it but it's a relief to have it over with. So I'm sponsorless for the time being. I'm thinking of asking another woman who I know to be my temporary sponsor while I figure out who to work with. It seems like a good idea to just keep in the habit of touching base with someone regularly. ..I'm still thinking about smoking cigarettes every once in a while which is a bit worrisome and another reason that I want to work with a temporary sponsor. I started smoking again (after nearly a decade off of cigarettes!) before my last relapse so I'm paying attention to that craving. It's telling me that there's a part of me that is looking for a way to  fix  how I'm feeling with a chemical. I don't think that smoking necessarily leads to alcohol and/or drug use and plenty of sober people smoke but I think that for me it's a big red flag that's telling me I need more support. I know that I can soldier on without support for quite a while but ultimately I can't do this alone. Whenever I try I ultimately crack. So I am going to learn my lesson &amp; do things differently this time around...Anyway this is long enough. I hope that you all are well and I will see you tomorrow!..Ginger_Sprout Out.

Congratulations on 60 days Ginger_Sprout! A gratitude journal is such a good idea.  Wishing you the very best! IWNDWYT 
Good stuff Sprout   congratulations on 60 days!      
Way to go! Thanks for the different links. I am going to look into some of those. Iwndwyt
Congratulations on your 60!! And for having that brave conversation with your (former?) sponsor. ..A temporary sponsor is a great plan from experience to keep the routine going particularly when you don't feel like it. Plus it's an opportunity to hear someone else's perspective on what they found helpful and see if anything is applicable. ..It would be awesome if you kept posting I really enjoy your writing and learn so much from your experience and perspective. ..Go get that chip and catch you tomorrow!!

Way to go! 60 days! I'm happy to hear that you had 'the talk' with your sponsor - it must be a relief to get that out of the way.
