Yesterday I commented in the vent thread about how depressed I am and how I've been thinking about relapsing (and thank you everyone for the support I received it helps more than you know to see that I am not alone). Last night I had a relapse dream. In my dream I said fuck it and had a glass of wine...which turned into many glasses. In my dream I then realized how miserable being drunk felt and I felt so so sad that I had to reset my badge counter here. I remember dream me thinking "I'll never get back up to 80 days again" and then being miserable. ..It was a true relief to wake up and realize that I am still in fact sober. And I'm going to use that relief to remember why I stopped drinking in the first place. .So anyways that dream was useful to me in reminding myself why I am doing this and how awful I'd feel were I to pick up the alcohol again. ..Still depressed still feeling alone but feeling more secure in my sobriety for at least a little while.

You got the dream you needed to prevent you from drinking I think that is awesome. I am working on my mental health. I realize that is a big part of my journey. I adopted a dog and he is amazing. He is my best friend always by my side and really helps me when I am feeling lonely. IWNDWYT. Hugs.
