Every time I have a weak moment or relapse I am comforted by this group.  You all give me strength to continue on or try again but never give up.  I do learn more from each new day and from reading your posts.  I just wanted to say thank you.  This group means a lot to me.

Thank you for being here too.  The magic on SD comes from everyone at whatever stage or date or experience they are going through--when they share it.
Ditto!!   
Ditto again ;)
