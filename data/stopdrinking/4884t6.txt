Hey everyone this is my first post on r/stopdrinking but I wanted to say that I've been here every day reading your stories and they've been immensely helpful. Thanks for that!...So I've been sober for almost a week now and I'm struggling with maintaining my focus particularly on school. I've been eating better and working out. I caught up on a lot of lost sleep this weekend as well. However when it comes to school I simply can't find the will. I'm going through a rough break up and all my thoughts are on the "coulda/shoulda/wouldas" in that area. Typically I would have a couple beers feel relaxed and carry on with my work. Without any alcohol though I'm finding it very difficult to rest my mind and focus. Any transferable advice/skills from anyone else's lives that may provide me with some insight?

I couldn't focus at all in the first week and wondered if it would ever be different - Now I feel more focused than I can ever remember being - it is amazing.  Hang in there!
If you drink now you'll lose your sweet brain gainz!..Https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/ ...I'm going through a devastating breakup too. But I'm not gonna let grief and booze ravage my brain. My heart is broken but my mind is healing. 
I've kept a journal for most of my life and have found it to be especially helpful during breakups. In a breakup it can be easy to over analyze and get stuck in patterns of circular thinking and just dwell. Writing it out and then putting it away helped me signal to my brain "Ok done with this particular train of thought for the day". You don't have to even commit to keeping a journal sometimes I just open a Word document and start writing and it's that much easier to delete later if you don't want to keep it. 
Your focus will return on it's own but it takes time and that time is different for everyone.  When I first sobered up way back at 26 I had been drinking heavily for years and it took awhile before I felt clear headed...A breakup only complicates things.  Have you thought about going to AA?  Sometimes the support of a group can really help when nothing else can.
