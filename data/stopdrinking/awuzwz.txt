So hey everyone. As the title says I have lurked here on and off for a while and idk if I'd say I'm addicted but I know from my history and my family history that I am prone to addiction. ..I am only 17yo have been drinking for about 3 years. The first wasnt so bad and even recently I dont drink daily but its getting worse. I dont remember a time when I've gone a week without drinking or using other substances and it is affecting my education and my friendsships. My father is an alcoholic and my sister is too. I live with her and its very easy to end up drinking. I have started to spent time with some people how are always drinking or smoking pot and when ever I try to have a break I cant I end up going with them...I struggle with depression childhood trauma bad family structure I'm dealing with my friend forcing me to have sex with her my sister tried to kill herself on christmas etc..I realize that this is something I can try to deal with so that I wont keep getting more troubles. I've tried to stop drinking etc for abt 6months but I end up breaking...I am rambling and sorry abt that (also on phone so the text is shit). ..TL:DR: IWNDWYT day 1.

Good luck!
You can do this. Much better to quit now than to wait until you're older. Do you have anyone in person that you can reach out to for support?
