...used to drink a lot on Friday afternoons. And Friday nights. Pretty much as long as it was called "today" I would find a reason to be drinking...I'm about eight weeks away from *two years sober*. Sobriety is absolutely and undoubtedly the right choice for me...I have found great help and support among the "friends of Bill" at AA though I know some folks don't jive with AA...I am not having any particular struggle right now but..I wanted to encourage you fine folks of r/stopdrinking to keep it up and to have a great weekend that does not require you to reset your badge...Be good to you! I will not drink with you this weekend!

I will not drink with you this weekend!
Two years!!! That's amazing! Thank you so much for the encouragement! 
Monday's and Friday's I start work early and get home early.  Perfect time to drink w/o the wife knowing.  I am now making dinner for my wife on Monday's and Friday's to keep myself busy.  It is working and she appreciates.
