Onto day 8 without a drink. Struggled a bit over the weekend with cravings but stuck to my guns and never had one. Went back to the gym today and I'm feeling good at the moment. Thanks everyone for the support and encouragement I've been given on here so far  it's much appreciated.... I will not drink with you today

Awesome. I am moving in on my 3 month mark of sobriety; however I remember my 1st 2 weeks very well. Same experience as you. Struggling with the cravings ... I hit  the gym hard the 1st few weeks and slowly gained the energy and focus back that I had lost while I was drinking... It felt really good to be strong again. The feelings  have only gotten stronger!!! Keep up the good work. IWNDWYT!
Congrats on getting through the weekend. I also struggled (day 6 here) but with the help of this sub and playing it forward I was able to ride it out. Have a great day- I will not drink with you today! 
Good going! It definitely gets easier as time goes by although in he beginning it seems pretty depressing to imagine a life without alcohol. You will see a rainbow after the rain!
