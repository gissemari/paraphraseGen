Welcome back!
I agree. I don't think a relapse means you're mentally or spiritually at day one again. 
I feel the same. I recently got through all the crap only to relapse. But this time I feel like I came back stronger and more prepared. Iwndwyt :) 
How many face plant do you experience when learning to walk ? Still you keep going and keep getting netter at it. Before you know you will be able to walk and maybe one day you will run. IWNDWYT..
