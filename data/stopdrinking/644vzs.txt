I am in my late 20s and was always able to back bounce from my bottoms. Took a while to really acknowledge what that behavior was costing me and managed to give up drinking for good for a full year.  ..But then convinced myself reasons why it was ok to go back to it and everything fell apart and not in a way that was so easy to put back together like before (and before wasn't easy really either).  ..So now I finally went to an AA meeting. Then another. And I'll probably go to another. I'm not a fan of some aspects of it and certainly not into the religious angle but I figure if I can remind myself I'm the sort of person whose drinking was so bad I felt the need to go to an AA meeting that's a really sobering reminder of the fact that I ought not drink.  ..Thanks for letting me vent. I'll try to come back and post on this account a few times a week as my own sort of therapy. If anyone else is struggling try and distract yourself with some endorphins from exercising. It's the only thing that got me through my first few days.  ..And for anyone who has had long chunks of time not drinking but fell back into it. Don't let shame or habit stop you from going for an even longer stretch. Thanks guys.

Congrats on the week and getting to the meetings. I'm a week in as well but I've been too nervous to visit a meeting.
