So I last slipped up on Saturday and there were a few beers left in my closet. Knowing full well that someday the temptation to drink would be extremely strong I made it easier for me and poured them away today...It felt like saying goodbye to a friend yet I also know alcohol was never my true friend; it acted as one. I played with fire and took a sniff of the beer inside it just made the craving to drink worse. ..After 5 minutes though I was back in the sober mindset. I also remembered that probably a person who can "handle their drink" or isn't an alcoholic don't get so strong cravings so that made my resolve to not drink stronger...Cravings do pass after all. I know that if I don't have to drink now I never have to drink. This was a big victory...F*** day zero f*** all the bullshit the addiction voice keeps telling us we are worth so much more than to slowly poison us.

The memories I've got of pouring drinks down the drain and going forward to take my recovery back are fonder and have lasted longer than any buzz alcohol ever gave me. I think you made an incredibly wise decision keep sticking to that!.."I know that if I don't have to drink now I never have to drink. This was a big victory." Amen that!..Let's none of us drink today!
Pouring booze down the sink takes guts.  I've been there before.  I'm glad you made that decision.  Good luck to you!
*awesome*
