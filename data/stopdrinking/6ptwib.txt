On Sunday I completed what I can only describe as a four month bender. My father died in April then my siblings and I started squabbling and I drank it away. I got drunk - easily and unintentionally - when I had a new class to be at Monday morning. ..I stayed up till 1AM crying and yelling at my boyfriend about ancient history that I am (now far too little too late) certain I only still bring up in a feeble attempt to hide my own shame of addiction. I couldn't even fall asleep it appears I was already in alcohol withdrawal by 3AM...I know I lost him for good this time. I love him too much to even consider begging him not to leave me. I know my father's death while a discernable trigger to this binge was no excuse but I sure did use it as one...So that's that. I lost everyone. Game over. ..I made it to that class anti-heroically and sick as a dog. I made it through day 1 of a 5 week apprenticeship training to (hopefully) get hired as an apprentice in software development. I'm an excellent candidate. This can literally save me from actually having to watch myself hit the depths of depravity that would constitute whatever my version of rock bottom really is - and I don't want to know. My siblings are both heroin addicts one was homeless from age 22-36. I was that little girl with her finger in the dam trying to keep the town from flooding for so long.....And here I am. Day 3 of that class was great other than the fact that I am still sick. A key in my computer was malfunctioning and I have to send it in for repairs but I don't have any capacity to even feel worried about it. ..I googled alcohol withdrawal for the first time in my life today in vain because I was already coming to grips with reality. I thought about it - how much did I really drink Sunday? Well what about Saturday? Wednesday? ..It wasn't daily but it was weekly. Mostly 2 I am a small woman. I physically can't drink much but after months of (now that I actually swallowed my pride and counted) having 2-6 drinks per week with a couple of real binged in-between this past Sunday was the edge and I channeled The Flash to leap over that edge with a sprinting start...I could write a book on opiate withdrawal - something I've never personally experienced. I studied it up and down left and right because it gripped so many around me. I can enumerate in great detail all of the behaviors mental games and bullshit a loved one on heroin (or any opiate) will put you through...And for all these years I pretended like I was somehow above it. Like I was somehow under control...I am an obnoxious terrible drunk too. I'm a fun drunk maybe 1/5 of the time. Other times I'm an abrasive argumentative know it all whom no one wants to be around. I project all my insecurities on everyone around me boasting about accomplishments or even capers I've pulled the wars I took part in - real world ones. On paper I sound awesome but for some reason if I open my mouth and say anything about me out loud it's like an atomic bomb just detonated from my mouth and I killed baby Jesus with my own knitting needles. I never see this for myself I've pieced it together over time as I have the added bonus of being prone to blackouts. Isn't that fun? I get to be blissfully unaware of my own atrocities. Then there's the ever present threat that this will be one of the times I go completely nuclear on my boyfriend. This has now happened at least twice. I say at least because blackouts...  A real good time.....The tragedy is usually people won't even tell you what you did that was so horrible. Then when they do you do not want to know...I actually have to give it up. If I don't my next stop is becoming that crazy old homeless woman downtown. Like my sister used to be. But I'm supposed to already know better...I'm calling this day 3. If I stay active in this sub I'll know I'm sober. I can't do this anymore. I know where it comes from I just don't know quite where to put it and meanwhile I'm just putting out fires with gasoline and not in a badass David Bowie playing while Quentin Tarantino rewrites the end of WWII way either. ..I know I can choose to not drink. I did it for a year all during 2015. I didn't take it seriously I was being cocky and sanctimonious. I still thought I had control and I was just doing some experiment - what a genius. I went back by telling myself I had to drink to be able to be accepted in certain circles. Im right about that but wrong to want to even be in those circles. Adding insult to injury I don't even like those people...I hope I'll get to sleep before 2 to tonight. It turns out insomnia is a symptom. I never knew. I don't want to find out again...There's too much I really want to do. The year I spent sober is my one trump card on myself though. I know how productive I was. I know how happy I was. I was proud while it lasted. ..And I have all the years of my voice coming out of my mouth to my sister about the cycle. Maybe that will help?..I cannot do this again.
