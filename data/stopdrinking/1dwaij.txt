I've been drinking at least 4 days out of the week for almost 4 years now. And not light drinking anywhere from a 12 pack to a fuck bottle of jack in one night. I've lost 4 friends to alcohol and I don't want to add to the death toll. I know I'm hurting my family. Every time I try to stop I relapse within a week. I just really need some help.

Edit: Full bottle*
Do you have a way into detox? Even outpatient? ..Maybe contact your local AA?
Where do you live? 
Yes you can do it you are no different from thousands of us.  Not easy probably best to have some medical supervision/consultation when you quit..AA worked for me - there are other groups if you find one that works - doing it alone is much harder.
Hate to break it to you but r/stopdrinking is probably not your answer. r/stopdrinking should be an assistant or a website that will help compliment your change. However random strangers on reddit can't help as much as you want. If we could we certainly would. ..Hopefully someone can back me up and supply you with some great sites to help you find a good sobriety program. Links would be preferable. ..While it may seem impossible you have the ability to alter your life around. It will be a painful and difficult road but since you are brave enough to post onto this thread you understand what should be done. This thread will support you but you need to take the first step. ..Best of luck to you
