I am middle aged man and a father of two..I used to drink since I was 16...When I worked as a barman - I realized what a devils job it was - selling poison to people. And I was enjoying it I was good at it. Won so many booze selling challenges back in the days. I never thought about long-term effects of alcohol...When the craft beer revolution started here in eastern Europe I was one of the first bloggers and an avid craft beer enthusiast - home brewing sampling sessions blogging reviewing and so on. I managed to get to 1100 reviews. Sampled all the beer styles there are.....I realized that I reached the point where I only drink imperial stouts.  After some time I lost interest for craft - it is a pricey hobby. I switched to cheap fortified lagers. And after filtering litters of cheapest shit through my body I found that whisky is not so bad at all. A fast paced journey of 1 year began - sampling fancy whiskeys. Sampling meant going through 0.5l *(17oz) bottle in tow days and in the last days of drinking in just one...In October I reached my lowest point: for some days I was going through 0.5l+ whiskey. Went to my best friends birthday party and made an ass off myself for the last time. Nothing extremely outrageous happened but the morning after I realized that I have 0 respect left for myself...I check what reddit has to offer on stopping drinking. I ended up here. Never seen this sub before in my 5 years of redditing - I was never looking for it...I realized that I was struggling with alcohol for the last 5 years but I could not find strength to just stop or stay sober for longer than a week. There were always "good" reasons to drink. ..Getting a badge and counting days helped me stay sober for one day at a time. That was the first thing I got from the sub: "One task at a time one day at a time"..Taking one day at a time and support and posts in this sub made a huge contribution to those 100 days. And at the moment I have not plans going back to alcohol. I do not miss it anymore. Almost...Some other notes I made from the sub:..**Zero is easy one is impossible**. - on drinks..**Play the whole tape!** - on being drunk..**Prior planing prevents poor performance.** - I plan not to drink and plan it well...I got scared of carousel - I do not want head spinning anymore...**I don't drink not that I am not drinking..**.**Pay now or pay later with interest.** - on drinking in general..**Deeds define people** - I am sober and that is who I am...**It reminds me how close to the edge I am.** - on alcohol in general..**If you have a problem and you completely lose your head over it you now have two problems.**..--------..Not drinking did not solve all my problems in one day. But this journey of 100 days solved a lot of them. I am calmer my anxiety is not showing itself every day I exercise I saved a lot of money *(got an SSD and smart watch) I feel much much better my mind is clear and I can look people in the eyes again...Every now and then I wake up thinking that I was drinking the night before but I realize in a minute that I was not. And this is an amazing feeling. Feeling of drunken guilt is not what I miss....If you are first day here - stick to it. And take one day at a time. It will get easier...I will not drink with you nor I will drink with myself...Stay strong and all the best on your journeys...

Thanks for sharing your experience...&gt; Play the whole tape! - on being drunk..I've been using this quite successfully this last month. When I think I want to drink I think it through play the whole tape and realise there is no point poisoning myself...If any newbies reading "This Naked Mind" may help you turn your thinking around. Instead of viewing alcohol as 'good' you realise you've been brainwashed all these years because alcohol is a poison. No ifs or buts.....Last year I got over 100 dry days but became too cocky too complacent and haha into the doomed 'moderation-trap' I went..
Well said. Thank you. I had home-brewing and Imperial Stout phases too; I wonder if that's just part of the standard progression. :-) 
&gt; Every now and then I wake up thinking that I was drinking the night before but I realize in a minute that I was not. And this is an amazing feeling. Feeling of drunken guilt is not what I miss...This! This happens to me!!.
Thank you so much for sharing. This is a wonderful and supportive post. Congratulations
