I'm on day 8 and actually got a little weepy over how fucking happy and relieved I am to be here now. ..Today I did a handful of chores around the house that I had been planning on doing for ages but 'never got around to'. I was always too tired -- too tired to clean too tired to hang out with friends too tired to accomplish my own personal hobbies/goals -- but never too tired to drink bourbon and pass out...Now here I am! Accomplishing everything I wanted to get done for months in the span of a few hours. Everything has improved. I'm sleeping again my anxiety is gone my relationships are already feeling so much more fulfilling because I am finally able to be fully present for them.....Just feeling very grateful for the strength I needed to find to finally be honest with myself and my loved ones that I was struggling and needed help. I got weepy feeling happy over all of the options I have in the future that is ahead of me. I'm grateful to be living my life again. I'm also grateful for the boxes of La Croix I'm burning through haha. I want to document this joy for the not-so-easy days I know are in my future...Thanks SD! I don't know if I would have had the clarity to make this decision if I hadn't found this subreddit. I will not drink with you today!
