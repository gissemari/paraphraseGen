91 days ago I had my last drink. A beer to try to silence a debilitating hangover from a bottle of tequila the night before. ..I have learned one main lesson in 90 days: it **is possible** to change. ..I often read posts on here explaining how someone's own situation is unique and how they want to quit the slow death by drinking but have so many situations in their daily life which make it impossible. .."All I do is drink"."Drinking is my only hobby"."All of my friends drink all the time it is the thing we do together"."I cannot function socially without drinking"..Alcohol withdrawal issues aside all of the above pressures can be beaten. I have done most of them in the last 90 days. I struggled with the idea of quitting alcohol because I thought it would be impossible. My lifestyle doesn't allow it I thought. I thought life without booze would be unlivable. I thought a sober me could never function socially...The reality is if you give yourself the chance to try sobriety you'll be surprised how capable you are without booze. ..I've gone on dates sober met girls sober kissed girls sober gone to parties sober declined offers of free booze been around people drinking and not had a drop myself. ..I didn't think these things were possible. They are...Thanks for your help /r/stopdrinking

Amen to this. My dad died thinking he was different from every other drunk. I feel that we are all startlingly similar. I'm a 49 year old mom wife and banker in the US I read a story on here by a young british guy that circumstances of where we were born aside could've been MY story. Nice post. 
Congrats 91 fellow!
