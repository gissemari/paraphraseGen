After being sober for around a year I recently had a relapse where I got drunk one night and stayed drunk until the next night.   Luckily when I woke up the next morning I came to my senses and decided I'd had enough.   It feels very humbling and generally shitty that I let it happen.   But hopefully I learned not to get complacent and for me personally if I stop going to AA meetings and following the program there's a good chance I'll slip up..Thanks for listening.  I love reading the posts here..I won't drink with you guys today.

Great job coming back and sharing with us.  
At least you kept your relapse to 48 hours.  That means your strong and stronger for getting right back to it!  Good job!
Think about it this way if you had a test that had 367 questions and you got two wrong would you beat yourself up? You had a year and a two day slip. That doesn't erase the year. Don't beat yourself up. You know how to be sober as you did it for a year. Don't overthink it. Do you expect yourself to be perfect in everything you do? I doubt it so same with this. It happens and move on. Beating yourself up in my experience will make another relapse or this slip more likely. 
That tenacity tho!  It's great you came back and shared that admirable     .I am beyond pleased to not drink with you today!
