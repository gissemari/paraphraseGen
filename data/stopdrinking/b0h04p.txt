..after many slips I decided to let it go for a few days. And then a few days later I found you guys and the lovely badge; something to cherish every morning after a hard day's struggle to be sober. ..You embraced me with kind words I was not alone now. The daily pledge transformed from a just a few typed words to a commandment. Further supported by spirituality I set out to define my own little world - *whatever works* world; reading selected excerpts from different religions motivational gurus guided me to control anxiety of happiness and sorrow alike...A significant lot had been lost before day 1 of sobriety and will forever be lost but I take solace in the fact that not an inch more has been lost since the last 3 years. I can humbly say that a lot has been gained on the path of recovery - life itself family work money health and some optimism...I could go on and on but let's just cut it short as each of us know how every day passes haunted by losses and anxiety of future and the struggle to fight these out.  I must move on one day at a time...Oh..Things that really worked for me in social places: "i don't drink" or "i can't drink due to &lt;put scary medical condition here&gt;" or "I can't make it". Warning: The last option spoken every week to close friends will make them shun you after a while :D..thank you.
