Now I know you are supposed to sacrifice for Lent. I'm doing it wrong. I'm rewarding myself by not drinking. I'm going to treat my body right. I will have a clearer head. I will get better sleep eventually. I will lose weight. I will get shit done. I will remember conversations I had and texts I sent. I will be a better mother. I will be supportive of others going through the same struggle..I will not bite the heads off my "friends" who are already finding Lent loopholes for me and trying to revise my "no alcohol" policy...40 days. One day at a time. I've asked for a badge reset. Who is with me in this Lenten reward?

I am I am!    congratulations! 
I always viewed giving something up for Lent as a great way to make an addition by subtraction.  Like not just a sacrifice for its own sake but one that makes me better.  So I don't think you're doing it wrong I think you couldn't have made a better choice.  Congratulations on your decision and I won't drink with you today!
I'm in. Just went to mass and received ashes lent has begun and we're sober!
From what I was taught Lent doesn't necessarily have to mean sacrifice.  It can be improvement.  Happy Lent!.
I'm in.  Just asked for a badge reset so pay no attention to that number beside my name.  Day 1 for me too!
Just asked for a badge reset so I'm in!    I've been struggling and have not been fully committing to being sober as I should be but having a tangible goal seems the perfect way to jumpstart this.  After the 40 days are up I know I won't want to throw my progress away.   I've done it before I can do it again.
