It was a hot night with thunderstorms the count got messed up and delayed things so it was a small meeting with four men and my partner and myself (volunteers.)..I really like small meetings they can be less formal a certain degree of structure can be dispensed with - friendly cross talk allowed longer shares etc.  One of the lifers who has been in 30+ years was talking about not knowing if he was ever going to get out - he was arrested at 17 - he has come a long way and was talking about how he was working to reduce his level of anger - which is not easy as prison can be a very negative place.  But he realizes he has to if he is ever to be given parole AND to give him a better quality of life inside to make the time easier.  ..We went with that topic for a while talking about recovery as a way of life one that avoids drama and needless struggle.  I explained that for me there is no temptation to drink - in some part because I stay out of drinking situations.  I described the sober 4Th of july BBQ I am going to how there are alternatives to the way we always did things **a cooler of bottled water soda iced tea - instead of beer.  It can be that simple.**..Another thing that struck me was that these men were using the tools of the program to make their lives as positive as they can be.  That it can help in their situation reminds me that it helps in mine too where my daily issues are very pale by comparison..........

"daily issues are very pale by comparison...."..So true. I know a guy who did 37 years and is out now clean from heroin and is an inspiration to me. I can't imagine being arrested at 17 and getting out now at 25 let alone serving life from 17. 
Another wonderful Thursday morning post. I was reading other posts this morning I was reflecting on my reasons for quitting in the past and why I wasn't able to as a result of poor reasoning from the start. I read your post and think wow if people fight for sobriety in prison why couldn't I find a reason? Facing my insanity is quite humbling.
