So today is day 50 for me sober. As stated previously I had three years before so this might not seem like a lot. I don't remember it being this hard last time. That alone should be enough motivation but God this last week did I struggle. But I didn't give in. I have no idea how much weight I have lost as I refuse to get on a scale LOL But I do know my clothes fit better I have lost weight out of my face and I love knowing I did nothing stupid the night before well at least not related to alcohol. I am more motivated after this horribly stressful week to stay sober. Alcohol is not going to relieve my stress or make anything better. The only things I have used to stay sober are my friends and this sub. And someone wrote the other day about their motivation for staying sober not going through that first week of hell again. I agree. Message to all of you other sober folks you can do it! Read the sub stay busy talk to people. That's what worked for me!.PS I was afraid to talk to my drinking friends about quitting. Turns out for me anyway they have been extremely supportive. I no longer stay silent when I am struggling.
