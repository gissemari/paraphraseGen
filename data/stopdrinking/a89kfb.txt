I'm still here. I know that all of this sadness and stress will pass and I will be okay but right now I'm struggling. I luckily don't really have any desire to drink. I've been reading *A Million Little Pieces* by James Frey and it's helping me a lot. For those of you who don't know it's a story about a man and his journey in a treatment center. It's a very heavy intense read but for some reason it's bringing me calm. Anyway just checking in. Thank you all I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend. IWNDWYT.

Sheesh...I get that long distance relationships are hard.  Like really hard.  And maybe he's not ready for that...But it still sucks....Glad that you're not turning to drink to cope!..And good luck wherever it is you're going.  Sounds like a brand new start in a lot of ways...Just think about how awesome it'll be to meet people that never knew you as a drinker.  They're perception of you will be vastly different than the people you knew before...
Take care of yourself sweetie. You are an inspiration to me. I will not be drinking with you today
