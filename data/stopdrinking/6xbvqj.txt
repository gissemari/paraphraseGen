Life is moving along with as many ups as downs although the ups are getting bigger and the downs aren't lasting as long as they used to...Who knew that it was easier to deal with your shit when you weren't just trying to drink it away? Not me!..I'm enjoying dealing with my shit. Each few weeks I have less to feel bad about or have to deal with with my counselor. I saw her just yesterday and had to confess that things were going pretty darn well and that surprised me...I did struggle with Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) for a long while...about 3 months....but just knowing that that is what was happening to me made it easier to deal with that and taking high doses of Multi B vitamins eating well hydrating and getting some exercise...It took some time but I am now able to go out with friends and family and not have drinking be an issue for me. I am lucky that everyone is so supportive and I feel no pressure from them. I have been to exhibition openings stand up comedy shows and going away parties. But I didn't go anywhere for about the first month. Just stayed home sleeping eating chocolate and feeling empty/bored/tired/blah etc.....Then I felt really good for a few days got to gym out and about and gave myself a back injury. I was bed ridden for a few weeks and that really got me down...It's funny once you have been through something how it fades out of your memory so quickly but at the time it's everything the whole world. That's how I feel about my back injury and also about my stopping drinking. At the time it took up every moment of my day it was all I could think about. I was here all day everyday. Now that first week is a faded memory which is both good and bad. Good because I am not still struggling like I was I can get on with my life and NOT drinking isn't my only thought. And bad because I really HAVE forgotten just how bad I felt and that means I have to be careful...I look around at my life now even this short amount of time later and I see how great it can be how much happier I am and those around me are I see the possibilities and I have to remind myself that none of those possibilities can manifest if I drink. It's as simple as that...I don't have to feel like physical shit or remember what that feels like to know that my life will be infinitely better lived sober because that is just the truth. ..Take care of yourselves SDers so glad you are all here.

"I'm enjoying dealing with my shit." That's a really good place to be: where you acknowledge the ups and downs that life brings and actually enjoy dealing with them sober. Congrats on four whole months sober!
