I am 6 years sober from alcohol and drugs.  I have been married to the same woman for 25 years and have three wonderful healthy children. I hit a meeting a day.  I am firing on all cylinders and the promises have come true for me.  Yet I still want to set fire to my gratitude list.  I recently went looking to fill some perceived holes in myself with another woman.  It was completely an emotional affair and made me feel better than any drug or alcohol.  I got caught by my wife and I am struggling to understand my behavior.  I know I am an addict but I thought I was doing well.  Desire was beating reason and that scared the shit out of me.  So now I am feasting at a banquet of my own consequences.  I am in full withdrawal from this other woman and I have to behave like I'm fine.  I'm crawling out of my skin.  My wife and I are working on our relationship and we will see where that goes.  Ive grown exponentially in sobriety and now find my self in full emotional relapse.  I really did come for my drinking but I am staying for my thinking.

&gt; I really did come for my drinking but I am staying for my thinking...Best line I've heard in a long time!  Thanks for that...Try this on for size:  An active alcoholic doesn't know when to stop.  A recovering alcoholic does.  When I finally stopped drinking the craving didn't go away.  Alcohol filled a need with destructive consequences.  I've learned that I did what I did but that even though I miss it I'd like to do better now...Does any of that apply to your situation?
