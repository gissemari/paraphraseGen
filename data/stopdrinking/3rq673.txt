Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Inspirational..**"One day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful." - [Sigmund Freud](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/33232-one-day-in-retrospect-the-years-of-struggle-will-strike)**..*What I get from it:*  [Without struggle](http://www.playgroundprofessionals.com/sites/default/files/news-photos/Rita%20Watts/14-12/frederick-douglasss-quotes-.jpg) there can not be growth - I know this is true for me.  When I was a kid my mom always told her friends and family that I was the kid that had to actually put her hand in the hot pan in order to really know and believe that it was hot.  I just have to really [face challenges](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/54/4b/b0/544bb049c3f357736624acdb2ce49f0c.jpg) head on in order to take them seriously I guess...And honestly?  That's OK.  I appreciate the successes so much more because I know how hard things have been at times.  The [struggle and the challenges](http://img.picturequotes.com/2/6/5706/i-love-the-struggle-after-all-were-going-to-need-something-to-talk-about-at-the-top-quote-1.jpg) open my mind and heart up to an extraordinary amount of gratitude and perspective.  It's amazing growth and a terrific learning experience.  And although I never thought I would say this I am thankful for this opportunity to [grow and change.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdNdjF-htY)..Have an awesome day all!

Love this one.
This is so true.  In AA the famous passage on p.124 advises us:..&gt; [The] painful past may be of infinite value to other families still struggling with their problem. We think each family which has been relieved owes something to those who have not and when the occasion requires each member of it should be only too willing to bring former mistakes no matter how grievous out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given help is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling to the thought that in God's hands the dark past is the greatest possession you have-the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and misery for them...The greatest possession you have!

Sobriety can be painful. Feeling things I haven't felt not being able to manage sleep anxiety fear restlessness etc. A lot of "firsts" in that first year... First x-mas sober first Father's Day sober birthday shit.. First Friday :) each challenge each first can be a struggle. Each time I made it through without drinking I grew and proved I could do it and the next time something came up I was prepared to do it again. Getting and staying sober is not easy but each day I do it I learn and grow. The struggles I had while drinking seemed to pile up and I had no idea how to conquer them. Today I realize that they were mostly of my own making and that no problem will be solved by taking a drink. Take care out there! Happy Friday!
