Hi I've been lurking here and occasionally posting for about a year and a half. I just recently had two weeks but then had an event in my life that I couldn't handle without getting wasted. I have lifelong treatment resistant depression. I constantly feel lonely and isolate myself from people. I was dating someone for awhile and they constantly acted annoyed and bored with me and then broke things off saying they couldn't find things to talk about with me. I'm worried I am boring and annoying. I am feeling like I don't fit in anywhere or with anyone. I feel like I am wrong or bad or something. It's very dark n hard to shake this feeling. April 1st was my day 1 again and I think it'd be really cool for April Fools to be my sober anniversary. Anybody out there struggling with depression shame loneliness anxiety have any words for me that'd be great. I'm just struggling today with feeling like I'm ok. I'm depressed when I'm sober so I am looking for some hope that maybe I'll feel better eventually. I'm trying to do a meeting today talking to friends have a therapist....it helps a little but I don't feel much hope today. Any support is appreciated!

I have had depression for most of my life - take meds and am in therapy. There is nothing that alcohol has made better - it has made all of my depression anxiety and loneliness much worse. I'm very early days still (Day 24) but I'm hardly feeling anxious - have been able to come off those meds. .The meetings help tremendously - talking to lots of people there helps me too. I believe in having a support system - I think it would be very difficult to achieve long-term sobriety on my own. This is some of my short experience- I hope that helps. Otherwise well done for making a change and wanting a better way for yourself. Take care friend.
