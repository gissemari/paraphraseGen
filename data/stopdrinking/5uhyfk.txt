My last sober time was 5 days and then i said maybe a couple of beers and a walk will be cool it wasn't. I end up spending all my money on booze and cocaine..Today I feel like what is the point i'm gonna relapse again anytime soon. I feel lonley sad worthless bored. I want to be sober but i don't know if i'm going to make it. But i have to try if i fall i get up. I need this to work because i want to do something with my life. I need this to work beacuse deep down i want to live. It's hard but i have to make i have no choice. ..I will not driking with you today.
