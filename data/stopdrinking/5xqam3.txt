I relapsed last Friday and Saturday and was hungover and hating myself Sunday...I went back to AA Monday and went to my noon meetings everyday including Saturday.  I was welcomed back with encouragement and understanding...The difference in how I feel today versus how I felt last Sunday is amazing.  I'm sober and had a weekend full of activities that I could not have done had I decided to drink...I'm going to continue my meetings and visiting SD.  I'm not aiming for any chips or am I going to get a badge.  I'm going to take it one day at a time and not look into the future because it's just so scary to try and think a week a month or a year into the future...I hope everyone is safe and had a good weekend.
