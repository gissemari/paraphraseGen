I was about to hit the two week mark but all of a sudden it was either complete two weeks or go to that Halloween party. And there was no way in hell I was going to go to a Halloween party dressed up in costume sober so I caved. ..This Saturday is a birthday party of someone very close to me. It has relapse written in big shiny letters all over it. There is no way I can stay sober or moderate in that atmosphere. ..I have chosen not to attend even though I will be greatly disappointing this person. ..After being sober for 1 month with the exception of a Halloween party I feel better then I can ever remember. I sleep well eat well exercise wake up early and My brain is functioning at a high capacity. ..This Saturday I will finally reach 14 days. It will not have to be a gamble because if I do show up I Gamble losing my health my mental health my well being and potentially spiralling into a bender...I am looking forward to not waking up with a horrible hangover scrounging around looking for another drink to cure the hangover that will lead to week long binge of laying in my filth being depressed suicidial and spending a shit load of money on curing the hangover.
