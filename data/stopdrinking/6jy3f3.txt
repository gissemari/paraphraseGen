I saw my therapist yesterday and told her exactly how I've been doing (with my relapsing and just emotionally ) she pretty bluntly told me that she would keep seeing me as long as I want but that generally people see more success when they go to the meetings or intake I struggle with the religious aspect of it but I'm going to my first meeting on Friday ..I will not drink with you tonight thank you for listening

Some meetings are more "religious" than others. Smart Recovery is not religious and has online and in person meetings. I believe there are some other non-faith groups too. I'd say try out several meetings if you have that option and see what you think. I like NA meetings though my only drug is alcohol.
We stood at the crossroads.  There are many non religious recovery programs.  There are many AA meetings for atheists agnostics and freethinkers.  The historical "God thing" objection or excuse is really no longer valid with so many alternatives available today.
Agnostic AA is awesome. Look up alternative 12 steps for some insight. 
Smart Recovery online has meetings.  Lots of styles and tools covered.  They have in person meetings in big cities too.  It's based on science.  Cognitive behavior therapy.  I won't drink with you today.
