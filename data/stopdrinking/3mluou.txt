I find myself thinking about a year or so from now that I might want to drink at some point. I keep having these moments thinking about how I could.. drink and clean. Or drink and cook. Or drink and be online...I don't know what it is. If it's just being bored of sobriety? The shine has worn off maybe? Feeling like I'm still pretty inadequate at life while sober so what am I really gaining...I'm not planning a relapse or anything at least not consciously but I definitely know I've had to do a lot more telling myself 'no' in the last couple weeks than I'd like. :/ ..Bummer post. ..It is a BEAUTIFUL sunday though here ! In positive news. :)

Once in awhile my alcoholism comes into the picture to remind myself that she's still there. Kind of like that one really annoying neighbour that pokes their head into your backyard once in awhile and your roll your eyes like "...fuck"..I say "Oh hi there alcoholism. Thanks for reminding me that you're here. Now kindly go FUCK YOURSELF"
For me one of the best reasons for going to AA is to stop the exact thoughts you just mentioned.  It seems to work a treat especially when you meet a newcomer. The misery is there if I choose not today though \o/
I found there was a huge cognitive dissonance between what I imagined it would feel like to drink and what it ended up being like. I imagined all the benefits of sobriety plus happy and drunk. But it was not that. I felt like sobriety my new great relationship had dumped me and I was right back to where I was when I decided I would quit last time. It was maddening...My alcohol brain told me life is too short to be sober. Reality told me life is too short to keep going thru the same painful cycle. "To do the same thing and expect different results is the definition of insanity"
