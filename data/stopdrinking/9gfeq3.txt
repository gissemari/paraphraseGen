Just curious how it feels to others!! Time went so slow when I drank &amp; now I struggle a bit with keeping up!..Do things feel faster or slower to you?
----------immediate responses--------

I quit for nine months last year and I thought I had all the time in the world. No nights lost to the bars and no mornings lost to hangovers. Perhaps you're overbooking yourself? Take a step back and see if there's anything you can cut for a bit.
Sober time feels correct! Time went by pretty slow sometimes with alcohol (as it's a depressant) but sometimes pretty fast when I was in a stimulating place doing impulsive things. Now I feel like there isn't enough time in the day and that 8 PM is late.
Depends on how busy your day is
I would say that the days go by fast... probably because everything is infinitely easier to do and manage and I'm super busy. But I'm hoping the years will go by slower because several of the past decade or so are a blur. ..I will say being only a couple months sober I feel like my drinking days were a lifetime ago.  It seems like I've experienced several years worth of living in this short time. Every day is so packed with lucidity it's like going from black and white to color tv... I notice every detail and I think that makes time seem to slow down a bit. There's so much to take in. ..I realize that was a very ambiguous answer lol. But I wanted to share because I have been reflecting on that very question myself lately. ..IWNDWYT 
I've pondered this myself since time has seemed strange to me lately. But I cant really put it in terms of faster or slower. Maybe more along the lines of time going by correctly  
Honestly I think it just depends on the day/week for me. I had a "holyfk its Sepemteber (and almost half through)" moment earlier. Like where did the year go? Today has felt like it wouldn't end but now looking at the kitchen and the time I am debating coffee lol. Either way better drinking IMO...[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg)
