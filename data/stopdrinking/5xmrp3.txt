Well...68 days today! So far it's been a hell of a ride. Those first 10 days kinda foggy. I was at risk of relapse during those 10 days. I knew I needed to push forward not cave to alcohol. I didn't with your help!..Now I'm doing a tremendous amount of meditation. I need to learn the "truth" about myself about life. I used alcohol like anesthesia. Now I'm awake!!! Some days are easier than others. I embrace the moments of clarity. I ride the waves of emotion. ..I had to work very hard on smashing the part of my EGO that was killing me. The EGO that said I was better than you. The EGO that said I could do this alone. The EGO that made it so nothing was good enough. Chasing my tail around in circles. Never satisfied with myself nor you. ..That's all changing.....The primary feelings I have today are LOVE COMPASSION and GRATITUDE! .I want to be useful to others today. I've been given a gift called sobriety. I want to return the GRACE shown to me. ..Thank you SD for helping me live. .Thank you for helping me see the "truth"...Forever in debt to you!    .I will not drink with you today.
