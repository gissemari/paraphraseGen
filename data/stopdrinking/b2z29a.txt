I quit on St. Paddy's day didn't have any issues day two was also easy no cravings and today l feel like a loser as I walked in and had three drinks ......I almost left before the first drink made its way to my table I felt and still feel horrible about it it wasn't even a strong craving too...As if I was on autopilot mode. ..I will have to hit the reset button it seems.... very horrible and stupid ..

The "autopilot" aka the lizard brain is a tricky little bastard. It's a strong force in early recovery but is very easily overcome after you deny it what it wants a few times. Don't feel bad Day 3 is usually the worst for most people.    .    .Get back up on that horse soldier. 
I found days 3 to 5 to be the hardest. I was still being controlled by habit and that deeply subtle brain mechanism that seeks reward. After that it became a lot easier over time. Don't beat yourself up. Instead use the experience learn from it maybe try to associate this awful feeling with drinking instead of the transitory  pleasure' we are brainwashed into associating with it by advertising and culture. ..Drinking is prioritising short-term pleasure in the now over a better future. It's like a credit card with a 10000% interest rate.  ..I hope you make it to  debt-free  soon. It sounds like you've got the right attitude to make it a success. ..Good luck!..P
