I'm sober.  Will be for the rest of my life but now I have to deal with the repercussions of the last days of my drinking...I have no car money will be losing my license going to jail for at least a couple weeks and my current job is only seasonal (work at ski resort). ..I live in the middle of nowhere.  I'm trying to figure out a way to get into the city for the upcoming seasons/time with no license but am struggling to make it work logistically.  ..All this is becoming extremely stressful.  I'm taking it one day at a time and feel great being sober but am at a loss for what I'm going to do now.  ..Living in such a rural area without a car license job or support system is damn near impossible.  I have very few supports in the area and am beginning to feel the weight of all this.  Don't really know where else to turn for advice...So yeah...any and all advice is welcome.

I would immerse myself in recovery programs locally.  I'd call the local AA office and get to meetings and I would get a sponsor.  I'd see what resources are available via recovery programming if any via local social services.  Finally I'd see if there are any options for treatment in lieu of jail including a sober house.  ..One thing I'd caution you against: don't represent to those who might help you that you are sober "for the rest of [your] life."  They won't believe you and they might not take you seriously.  You may well be sober for the rest of your life but at least initially I found it helpful to take it one day at a time...Good luck.
