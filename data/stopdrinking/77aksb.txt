Today is my Day One. I've been struggling for 3 years now. Moved to a new city 1 year and some months ago for a job. It's got to be even worse. I'm not happy. I'm the worst version of myself I've ever known. Today I had to fake sick at work because I stayed up all night doing drugs (rare but not rare enough) and the only reason that happened was because of the bottle telling me to use. ..3 years ago I started drinking again after being sober for a Year. I scared myself into sobriety  for that year because of a nervous breakdown...I know if today isn't my first day of sobriety I'm going to end back up in a mental institution. This time for longer. ..I was hoping some of you had some advice. Tomorrow I have to travel for a work conference. I'm going to a city I used to live in. I was always a heavy drinker there. The friends I will be staying with are also drinkers. Not as bad as myself though. ..The first thing I will want to do there is of course hit the bottle and my mind will try and give me every excuse and reason too. "Hey your own vacation!" "Come on you never get to get fucked up with these friends anymore" those kind of things...What the hell can I do r/StopDrinking. I need some serious advice if any one can help.

If I were in your shoes and I really did want to stay sober I might book a hotel instead of staying with friends who drink. That and devise a plan to stay busy and stay sober.
