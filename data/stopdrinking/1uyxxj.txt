 Had 9 days sober. Screwed that up yesterday. I'm glad I did the 9 though. Got some beer leftover so I'll probably drink today too. Tomorrow is another day... I don't post here often. But I just want to say thank you to everyone here. Reading your stories knowing others are looking at the same demon I am looking at and dealing with the same struggles I am makes me feel a little better makes it a little easier. Good luck. And thanks guys. .

Just because you have some left doesn't mean you have to drink it... but if you choose to we'll be here tomorrow (knock wood!)
Pour the beer out.
Congratulations on the 9 days.  Glad you got something out of this subreddit.  Make a list of pros and cons.  Make a list of reasons 9 days didn't turn into 10 days.  Make a list of things you can do differently this time and a list of additional tools that might be helpful in your efforts ongoing.  And just for shits make a list of things you have ruled out books you could read support groups therapy Aa etc.  If you really want to climb out from under your pile of reasons to drink you might need help.
