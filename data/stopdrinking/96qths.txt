Hello. I used to be a more regular visitor to this site but went on a self-imposed facebook/reddit/other social media hiatus over a year ago. My counter is not accurate I've been sober since February 2nd 2018 which is the longest continuous sobriety stretch I've had since a relapse in fall 2015. Still going to SMART Recovery meetings couple times per week which I find helpful because I can sit in a room with people who get it and socialize in ways not involving happy hours (I've worked in DC for little over a year now where it seems social life revolves around happy hours so making friends can be a challenge). Hoping to check into this thread more regularly--now that I have my reddit habit down to a more reasonable level--to offer support where I can. I will not drink with you all today. I will however see the new Spike Lee movie and eat Sour Patch Kids at the theater. :)
