Congrats on the decision to try rehab and good luck..
I'm sorry to hear that. I've never been to rehab but if it's what you need to get sober then I think it's a fantastic idea. The trick is to find what will stick for *you* and we're all different.
What do u mean outpatient? Is that intensive outpatient program?
outpatient was really great in my experience. .You have to tune out some of the people who are there for illegal drugs because they were ordered to be but I had a great therapist there..Outpatient + AA + sponsor= Im still sober!!    
I'm in an intensive outpatient program (IOP) and really like it. It took me a while to come to the conclusion that it would be right for me but it's a great support network and working for me so far. Lots of time after work but it's sort of like real-life SD. First hour is a check-in where you talk about what's happened since you were last there. Second hour is group therapy where you kind of coach each other through stuff. Third hour is "psychosocial development": lectures on how the brain works how to work through feelings self-esteem issues and "alumni" speakers from people who have graduated the program. Most of us are also on Antebuse which helps. It's good because you're not just sequestered away in some hospital--you go about your (mostly) normal life and learn how to cope with things that way instead of getting sober away and then trying to deal with the real world when you come back.
