Wow I can't believe I made it this far. This is the longest I've been sober since I started drinking 11 years ago. ..I remember my last day 1. The agony uncertainty and depression that was consuming me. It was awful and I never want to feel that way again. I remember I wanted to forget that day and never look back on it because of all the pain I endured. Now that day is what keeps me going and staying sober. ..If you're still struggling to stay sober don't give up on yourself or sobriety. I promise it's so worth it. ..Here's to many more sober days.
