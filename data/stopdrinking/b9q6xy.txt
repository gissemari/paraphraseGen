Brothers and Sisters you are amazing!  ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm really happy to have achieved a full year. But I realized that if I count the days it's like counting how long I can hold my breath underwater. Sobriety is like coming up into the air and breathing new life with each inhalation. Sobriety is living life uninterrupted.  ..&amp;#x200B;..**First the Awesome Good List of Results Year 1.** ..&amp;#x200B;..I look younger feel more alive got in shape dated some cute girls saved a ton of money became unafraid to explore new hobbies like drawing classes and local politics (ie talking and listening to my neighbors) and savoring life beginning with a morning tea and ending with a great night's sleep. Quitting drinking is the ultimate life hack.  Reading This Naked Mind helped put on the awareness glasses like in the movie They Live. ..&amp;#x200B;..**Resources I use to live each day more fully and without booze:**..&amp;#x200B;..* The first few weeks were hard. There were triggers and associations all over the place. It really helped to write down my thoughts to trace back what drew me to want to drink. It was often rooted in some fear or anxiety. It really helped to write down a list of my fears and to write down any and all thoughts every morning.  ..* It helped to meditate daily even for 10 minutes to focus on the breath and notice and allow thoughts to float through my head. Here is a resource to get started: [https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations)  ..* Therapy laid a foundation to understand myself. Talking to someone completely freely is amazing much more liberating than talking to a bartender or a bar regular. Here is a resource for low cost therapy: [https://openpathcollective.org/](https://openpathcollective.org/)  ..* Yoga allowed me to be ok with with really FEELING uncomfortable. To notice my edge and not be scared of (actually) falling. It's good to start with a class/teacher and this is one of the best online classes I've found: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUWdc\_B05LUDmif1rypohw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUWdc_B05LUDmif1rypohw)  ..* And of course participating in this subreddit. Reading and sharing our struggles and successes reminds me that we are are in the same boat. ..&amp;#x200B;..We are embarking on an incredible journey. Like a ship leaving a safe harbor we're floating on unchartered waters; but since we've built this ship knowingly laid every plank with integrity the winds and the water may be our friends our life guides and we can enjoy the exhilaration of a full sail and appreciate and respect the storms and doldrums as equally important and complementary forces; life would be incomplete without both. It's best to navigate with a clear head and with strength. ..&amp;#x200B;..We're here on this planet to support each other. Don't forget to do one nice thing for someone today. IWNDWYT...
