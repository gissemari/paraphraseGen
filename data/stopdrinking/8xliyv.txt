It makes me sad...I just moved and a friend and his wife were in the city I moved to for the weekend. It was literally my first night (alone a major trigger) and I talked to him and literally the first thing he said to me was we are at ... and drinking some good beer (my DoC). ..This is someone who has talked to me about how he wants what I have now...bla bla bla and he knows the struggles I endured. He has witnessed me at my lowest. He has told me he's an alcoholic even that has a desire to stop...I didn't call him the rest of the weekend and neither did he call me. I did however go to meetings I had never been to. Got numbers made connections. I felt great come Sunday night...Takeaway: I need the reminder occasionally of why I ditched my old friends. No matter how much they sympathize or empathize what I've gone through or am going through they still don't really understand. Perhaps one day he will make a decision to stop drinking too. It is not up for me to decide that for him. God knows no one could decide that for me. ..Peace you sobernauts.

I hope that one day they might understand. What really matters is that you're sober and you're here posting about it and showing a great deal of insight and self-awareness...Shanti shanti shanti :)
