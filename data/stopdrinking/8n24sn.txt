Hey all.  .I was arrested Sunday for driving under the influence. First time offender and no previous criminal record.  .Needless to say it's been a shit weekend. Got out on bail today and my family drove 7 hours to spend the next two days with me.  ..I'm blessed to have friends and family to lean on and now a kick-ass community of people who know the struggle.  ..Everyone stay strong. You'll see me around &lt;3

Same thing happened to me in November.... Except I rolled my car multiple times and while it was my first drinking driving charge was not my first offence. Jail sucks. Sobriety is alot better. You will get through all this and come out better and stronger in the end. IWNDWYT
I got caught by my job...I had a 28 day rehab followed by after care.  Everyone pushed AA...I have been using the rooms of AA for a while and except for one slip in week one never looked back.
