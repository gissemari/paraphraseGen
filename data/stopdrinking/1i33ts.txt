Well I made it to triple digits. I didn't do it alone. I went into AA NA (different atmosphere) and this place.  My recommendation to stay sober is:.* Decide you want to stop .* Set up you support team (AANA recovering individuals etc).* Set up a recovery plan (what meeting you will go to how often you will talk to your people).* If you don't know ask somebody .* Be open minded  .* Read and comment at least once a dayor create your own post     I'm going to ramble about what has changed. My life is still difficult but I noticed when problems come up I immediately start developing possible solutions. Its not a coincidence I stopped doing bonehead things now that I am sober. Life is a beautiful struggle right now but I can handle it. Thank You all for your support.
