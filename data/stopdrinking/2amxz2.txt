I relapsed recently after two long stints of sobriety (9 months and 7 months).  It was extremely tough to stay sober after the binge drinking episodes I had in June.  My cravings for alcohol were the strongest I've felt in well over a year.  And I really felt like my life was close to spinning out of control which it almost certainly would have had I continued to drink.  ..But I've managed to stay sober for the past 15 days by getting back to the basics and taking it one day at a time.  I hope to reach 365 consecutive days without drinking but for now I'm not even thinking about that goal.  I'm just thinking about staying sober today.  Day by day I will keep pressing forward.  Thanks for reading.  Stay strong.

Think about it in manageable chunks absolutely the way to go. It took me 10 years to break past 90 days needless to say thinking about a year was out of the question. I started to get excited when I could actually make an appointment or commitment a month in advance and feel fairly certain I would come through. Stay close to us here and we will conquer one day at a time!
Good job on 15 days /u/dbtwizard. I am taking it a day at a time as well and slowly the days pile up. Good luck!
You sound like me when I started out on my journey.  I had 7 mths and then 6 mths before I finally admitted I was no match for the bottle.  I am glad I finally admitted it and i also grasped the concept of "Just don't drink today" and who knows.  It is working till today.  I  go to AA on a regular basis just so I don't forget why I am sober.  Give it a go if you don't.  Good luck.
Thanks for the support everyone!  You folks are awesome
