Hi Guys..Long story short I relapsed after 7 1/2 years. Stopped doing anything for my recovery after 5 years. Started drinking non alcoholic beers which lead to non alcoholic wine which lead to real wine which lead to vodka which lead to here. I'm tired all the time. I'm isolating again. My phone hardly ever rings. I want my old sober life back.

Welcome back .
I'm glad you're coming back.  
Thanks I appreciate it.
Welcome back.  
Hi welcome back.  7 1/2 years is such a long time and something to be really proud of.  Maybe drinking again is a reminder you needed about what you DON'T want?  I hope you are doing okay take care of yourself. 
Thanks for sharing.  It's good to be reminded that whether its 7 days  weeks or years all it takes is one to go down the slippery slope.  IWDWYT
I am doing ok. I guess. Just disappointed in myself.
