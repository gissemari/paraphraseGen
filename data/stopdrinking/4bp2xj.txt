I originally posted this on another website but would love to get as much feedback as possible thanks...Hi I'm a 30 year old male and I have been sober for about a week and a half. Prior to that I was able to go nearly 4 months. I've always been a problem drinker and a binge'r but over the last few years it's become more frequent (like drinking 12oz of vodka on a weeknight - multiple times a week) on top of 1 sometimes 2 26oz bottles on the weekend. It has become a chore and expensive but more importantly a big concern of my girlfriend whom I have lived with for nearly 10 years and been with for 12 years. The frequency in which I would do or say something stupid in public or embarrass myself has declined probably due to the fact that the majority of my drinking is at home - even still last November when my partner came home from work she found me  fall down' drunk as I had drank an entire 26oz while playing video games and generally being unproductive. How pathetic. This time around I knew my apologies wouldn't be enough and I had to do something if I was going to save our relationship. For context I should also add that I currently get laid-off during the winter months and start back up in April. ..I began attending AA meetings got a couple phone numbers from members and met them over coffee to discuss where I was at what they went through and what AA was all about. I felt this really motivated me on my quest to stop drinking but I had a hard time getting over the fact that I would never be able to drink again (even more so I didn't want to have to attend AA meetings for the rest of my life and commit to doing the 12 steps). By this time I had gone about a month without drinking and realized I didn't need to start the recovery process. Over the next couple of months there were many times where I wanted "just a beer or two" but my partner was adamant that I shouldn't. I knew she was right and the urge temporarily passed. On more than one occasion though I would sneak a shot from a bottle she left in the freezer. I knew if I took more than that she would notice. Of course the one shot did nothing for me except perhaps to feed my disillusionment that I wasn't addicted to alcohol and that one day I might be able to drink like a normal person. ..My 'big relapse' that only happened about a week and a half ago happened when I was visiting my parents who live in another city. My dad is an alcoholic and has been an exceptionally heavy drinker over the last several years. My partner was no doubt worried for my sobriety but I assured her that I would be fine. My dad didn't pressure me to drink or anything but with him being drunk and so much alcohol in the house my 'just one drink' turned into I don't know how many. Looking back on it now convincing myself I could  just have one' then was easier because I had snuck a drink now and then over the last few months so my 3+ months of  sobriety' meant less to me than if I had been true to myself and never even had a sip over that time. I don't remember much during that evening; except for that my partner found out (I believe she phoned me). What followed was a barrage of texts messages saying how I screwed up how could I just throw away almost 4 months of sobriety that it was over between us and so on. She has since cooled down but she has taken a big step back. She asked me to move out at least temporarily while I figure my shit out. She has recently made a lifestyle change of eating healthier and exercising. She has lost 80lbs and has become a more disciplined and productive person so I can understand her frustration when I have done very little to better myself. I knew I had to go back to AA and commit to the recovery process this time. Fortunately some mutual friends of ours own a home with a basement suite so I am able to stay with them for as long as I need. I went back to AA determined this time. I was eager to start on a new path of self-discovery and improvement. I signed up to a local group and began reading for the first time some of their literature. Unlike months ago when I first attended AA I finally admitted to myself that I am an alcoholic and need to abstain from it for the rest of my life...The prospect of never drinking again doesn't bother me now - step 1 complete! Over the last few days I've now been struggling with step 2 and especially step 3: believing in a higher power and turning my life over to God. I've never called myself an atheist I'd say I'm more of an agnostic but I've honestly never put much thought into it. I feel we can never know so why bother. At first I thought all the references to God Him and Power in AA could be overlooked but I found the chapter on agnostics in the AA book (which is supposed to persuade non-believers) entirely unhelpful and even insulting. I determined the literature is too outdated (1930's) and has too much of a religious vibe. How am I supposed to be honest with myself if I have to fake believing in God? So it was when I started looking into AA for atheists and their alternative 12 steps that I discovered Smart Recovery. The 4 key points sound so much more productive to me than the AA steps. With AA you need to admit you can't help yourself and give yourself over to God whereas with Smart Recovery it gives you to tools to become self-reliant and how to institute self-directed change (or so I've read in the brief time since I discovered SR). There is a weekly meeting in my city but that isn't for a few more days so I thought I would sign up online and here I am! Thanks for reading...Edit: I'm sorry if I came off anti-AA if it works for you then stick with it. I do plan on attending meetings in the future and using it as a compliment to other approaches. I just thought my experience might help others especially those who don't feel AA is for them and then giving up on seeking tools to help them achieve sobriety like I originally did. .

Welcome /u/mokronnabis to /r/stopdrinking -- I am a sober atheist who is active in AA here in Cleveland one of the founding cities for Alcoholics Anonymous and I can quite assure you that you can get sober and stay sober (even in traditional meetings) without giving yourself over to the care of "God."  So how did I get sober and stay sober?  [The Baby Steps post at this link lays out all the simple actions I took.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.
Congrats!  I'm in AA like it but am curious about Smart Recovery.  I might take a look.
