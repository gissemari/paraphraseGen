Just wanted to share my good news as I don't really talk about my struggle to stop drinking with all that many people in my life. I don't think most people knew I had such a problem and weirdly enough I seem to have found myself surrounded by so many new people none of which know me as a drinker and certainly not as a someone who has struggled with my drinking. ..It's strange in some ways to think it's only been 300 days. My life is so completely different in such a short space of time what came before seems like someone's else's life. Definitely not mine. And I don't want to go back.  ..I'm looking forward to seeing what else a sober life brings me as time goes on. So far it's been nothing but good to me even when things are difficult. ..Thanks for being there /r/stopdrinking. You're such a supportive inspiring bunch. Even to a lurker like me!..

congrats! On one hand time flies and it really doesn't take that long to get a little sobriety under your belt.  On the other hand they changes that happen in that short time are incredible!  Good work keep it up!
You are awesome. Keep going!
