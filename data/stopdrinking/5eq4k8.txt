I'm sorry you're going through this. In my experience I found that getting rid of all alcohol in the house and then going for a walk or to a meeting or hanging out in our chat room here helped me significantly. I know that having two bottles of wine in my house alone would not end well - so I'd get it out ASAP...Hope you're feeling better soon you can do this!
You're not alone we're with you in spirit and resolve
Like they said you can do this! 
Don't drink. It's not worth it. .I'm definitely not drinking with you tonight. 
I'm sorry for your crummy day.  Like they say there is no problem that drinking won't make worse. Hang in there. Avoid the bottles.  Better yet take control and throw them out.  I highly doubt that loneliness is cured by wine or a hangover. Keep reaching out. We are all here for you. 
Do you have anyone you can give the bottles to even if it's temporary?..I didn't have any alcohol in the house and it kept me from having to wage a mental battle. I couldn't drink what wasn't there
Hang in there! The holidays are tough and make us feel like we have to be surrounded by people having the best time ever. Just see it as a break. Do something you enjoy. Or cry. Or sleep. Drinking won't help. We will.
