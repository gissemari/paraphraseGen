So I am approaching 60 days sober. I don't know if I could have done it without this sub and also the support of AA meetings that I go to about 3 times a week. What I like about AA is that I know for a couple hours a week I get to be around *only* sober people in one big room. I thought about getting a sponsor and feel like people are constantly urging me to. Maybe in the next couple of months I will think about that more but for now it doesn't sound too appealing. ...I'm struggling with a couple of things. The following is how I've felt about several different meetings. It's probably my own exaggerated interpretation of reality I'm just frustrated I guess. ...I'm finding that the steps don't really resonate with me. At first I found that stating that I am powerless over alcohol helped me a lot. But after awhile it turned into visualizing alcohol as this big scary monster that was in complete control of me. Which like I said helped me immensely at first. But now? I feel as if I want to do the opposite. I WANT to feel empowered.... Honestly reading "This naked  mind" did that for me. I realized I would much rather be turned off from alcohol completely than feel like I am resisting temptation for the rest of my life. These are the types of thoughts I want to share in a meeting. I want to say these words out loud but I feel like it goes against everything they stand for. ...At one meeting I shared my thoughts and I talked to someone after the meeting. The person said something along the lines of "good for you for sharing usually we are told that we are only supposed to listen until having atleast four months sober." My first thought hearing this was that my experience wasn't valid because I didn't have enough sobriety. ... The suggestion to just "pray" is thrown around a lot. "Pray to god and he will find the answer." There seems to be this belief that we as individuals don't know anything or else we wouldn't be alcoholics. We have no control of our lives only God knows all and we are basically just mindless monkeys that have absolutely no control of ourselves at all. Again this is probably an extreme interpretation. When I get a year sober I want to say I DID THIS. I decided to be sober and I took on this journey and I am so happy because I DID IT. ...One more thing I feel like I receive a lot of mindless default answers to things I'm going through such as. ..1. Pray..2. Make that phone call! ..3. Keep coming back...Sometimes I get a personalized answer to my question but it feels like the majority of the time I will hear something like that. ...I absolutely love the overwhelming love and support I get from AA. It's just all of the other stuff. ....Rant over thank you for listening.

I felt very similar. I loved the warm atmosphere and especially meeting and being around sober people. But the messages did not resonate with why I wanted to quit or what was working for me in thinking about quitting. I feel like the AA model assumes so much about what has brought you to want to stop and how your life looks in that moment. I have tried SMART online which was a slightly better fit but I wish there was Refuge Recovery meeting near me--there are none in my country at the moment. 
I really like AA as well.  I get pretty personalized answers/messages from my sponsor which helps. He struggled with alcohol/drug abuse for 40 years and can relate strongly to feelings/thoughts I have.  Besides that most people in my meeting are pretty personable.  I also feel that if sharing helps you you do t have to wait.  I've shared everyday since day 1 and it helps me.  As for powerless I know I am once I take that first drink but if I'm on drink 0 I do feel powerful.  Praying helps me but I was a fairly strong Christian coming in to this so I understand it's not for everyone.  Keep coming back works for me because of the support as you mentioned is tremendous and I know I'd still be drinking if I didn't go almost every day.  Best of luck not drinking with you today!
AA is certainly a mixed bag for me too. I mostly just like being around people who are sober and going through all the stuff that can entail...I have never heard the don't-talk-until-you're-x-amount-sober thing. Must be a local peculiarity. I always like to hear what newcomers have to say partly because it reminds me of where I've been and partly because there's usually some enthusiasm there that rubs off on me.
Love this post...The AA program doesn't appeal to me either but for so long and for so many people it's been the option that is the best known. It is not I repeat NOT the only way...As far as enjoying the fellowship I completely understand keep in mind that "the only requirement for membership is the desire to stop drinking". It doesn't say "the only requirement for membership is to WORK THE STEPS GET A SPONSOR PRAY"...If you find a group that make you feel uncomfortable with just meeting attendance and fellowship then try a different group. 
I thought for sometime about what to write here.  I suspect there will be additional posts from folks with lots of time that will better explain things than I will here but I will give it a try.  Earlier in my sobriety I felt exactly as you describe above.  I railed against AA being a religious program.  I wasn't religious therefore it frustrated me and bothered me.  The more I learn and begin to understand the meaning and purpose of the program the more I realize that my opinions don't really matter.  I am like an onion and one thing I steadfastly believe one day changes once an inner layer of the onion is revealed after further sobriety.  The fact is that the program works.  It isn't really important that I understand and can rationalize why and how the program works.  If I knew that I probably wouldn't be an alcoholic in the first place.  In the program and in my life I am much more likely to accept the things I cannot change and move on.  AA works for many many people.  The fact that I can't find a way to make it work for me might just indicate a problem with me instead of the program.  Or in the very least perhaps I have been unable to see something.  Perhaps that something is also the thing that lead me to be an alcoholic in the first place...I used to think that "keep coming back" was a mindless default answer.  Now I realize it is quite profound.  What is learned in the rooms of AA and in the process of doing the steps is that the Promises of AA will come true.  You cannot be simply taught these things.  You must arrive at these conclusions on your own time at your own schedule.  Some may never get there.  But if you keep coming back to the meetings with time most likely you will.  When someone says "keep coming back" they mean if you keep coming back you will begin to understand something that you are currently not capable of understanding...It is very hard to explain and I apologize for sounding like an AA bible thumper.  I am nothing of the sort.  I am an agnostic and the program works for me.
I don't go to AA meetings anymore but I still like it.  I have definitely had some of the same misgivings that you list.  But I also think that it's a valuable resource for people who need it.  I would describe myself as agnostic but I find that the concept of praying can take me out of my own thoughts and make me realize that I don't have control over everything.  It's basically the serenity prayer applied to my life then and there.  The "letting go of outcomes" is what I get from it; the actual presence of a higher power is irrelevant to me most of the time.  
I think you'll find more of a personalized experience with a sponsor or by finding a smaller group of friends within the program to share with. One hour isn't really enough time to delve into the nuances of a particular person's situation and the meeting format isn't set up to have a conversation...I also go mostly for the social aspect and to hear newcomers speak. My sobriety thrives like a vampire of the newer sobriety of others. Thank you for having the courage to speak. 
I am on my way right now to an Agnostic AA Meeting to see a guy that couldn't stand the pray and let God guide you stuff. He had 1 year yesterday. I was 6 years sober before I honestly worked the steps. It's not a race. If it was they'd serve Gatorade instead of coffee
There is a lot of variability in participants at meetings of course...Some parrot what they've heard...Some responses reflect greater thought...I can share that the way I "heard" and "understood" concepts of recovery changed significantly as I continued with the work.  Just like everything else in life!..I learned that "Logic" and "Willpower" weren't sufficient for me to stop.  ..They are *necessary* but not sufficient.  I need others and tools and resources...Control and Willpower **are** important to my success.  I **have** *Control* over ALL the alcohol outside my body.  That's my responsibility.  That's my Decision.  ..The Steps provide me structure and tools to process "my stuff".  The more I work on my stuff the stronger Living Sober becomes in my life. ..In AA I take the best and leave the rest!..Congratulations on your Successes!!
I agree with everything you wrote.  I try and look past it.  I go to meetings to hear what I need to hear.  I do not want to get caught up in the drama.  I show up listen and leave.  
Great post. I went to AA for 3 years and couldn't stop drinking. I felt shameful every time I would go back out and drink then come back to my home group. I made great friends at that group. I couldn't handle the emotional rollercoaster so I quit going all together and went on a 2 year binge. Drinking daily. Not 1 of those people called me to see how I was doing. It felt like a cult. You're in or you're out. I do have resentments about that. This time I knew I had to try something different. I wouldn't rule out AA and never will because I'll do anything now to keep my sobriety. I read This Naked Mind and it totally changed my way of thinking. The thinking that never changed when I only did AA. I don't like how I have to focus and be reminded every day in AA that I'm alcoholic. I want drinking to be a thought that doesn't come up anymore in my mind. This Naked Mind did that for me. It's still early but it's night and day compared to a few years ago. My thinking has changed. That's the real key I believe for lasting sobriety. Change in how you look at alcohol. I won't drink with you today. Thanks for the post and good luck in your journey!
I've been sober awhile through getting a sponsor and working steps. I also don't view alcohol as a big scary monster or feel like I'm resisting temptation...I'm not sure if you've actually read the book Alcoholics Anonymous but for me it certainly helped me set aside a lot of misconceptions I had about the program and the steps. And if you find you don't jive with AA that's fine.
Alcohol only has power over me if I drink it. So long as I don't I'm empowered. The tone of meetings will change over time as people come and go. Good luck its been quite a help for me.
