Yup! Pretty crazy how vivid they are. Feeling that regret and shame just from a dream helps me stay away from booze. I lived that regret almost every weekend for almost 20 years. Now they only dreams 
Happens to me.    I just try to listen to that shame...I still dream of showing up to the Algebra final naked without without having studied.   Doesn't mean I want to do it.
Yep. I have them for alcohol cigarettes marijuana and cocaine. I am always sooo relieved when I realize it was just a dream.  What's funny is that I have not had a cigarette in 18 years.
