I wanted to relapse yesterday but I didn't...Here I am world. This is after a big effort back in February that only resulted in 70 days and then a huge relapse...I also quit smoking finally and it's been over 4 months for that so here's for a big celebration! Caffeine / stimulants are going next!..Wooowoooooo sobriety
