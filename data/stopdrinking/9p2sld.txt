What's up everyone?  How are you doing?..&amp;#x200B;..50 days sober for me today.  Feeling great!!  Doing some stuff around the house at the moment (laundry re-seasoning my cast iron organizing etc.).  Might hit a show later with some of my new friends I met in AA or I might just chill in.  Drinking an amazing cup of coffee right now too!  Man do I love me some coffee these days!  Developed quite the habit to it as of late (which I'm totally cool with!).  With all the money I've been saving via sobriety I splurge on really nice beans.  Next up is a new coffee machine for this guy!  Waiting for some crap I bought when I was a drunk to sell on craiglist and/or eBay first though in order to justify it.  Ha!..&amp;#x200B;..Anyway not much else to add.  Oh yeah for those in earlier stages struggling just hang in there IT ALWAYS GETS BETTER!  That's how this whole sobriety thing works!  If you were an alcoholic and you stop drinking your life improves in ways you can't even fathom!  My healing really started to take place after day 30 FWIW.  A lot of struggle prior to things starting to click for me around then.. Everyone is different though.  For many it's much earlier for others much later just hang in there and absorb yourself in your own personal program of recovery...&amp;#x200B;..Let me know how you are doing please.  General thoughts/feeling how your days going etc.  All posts are welcome!..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT

I love these encouraging posts thanks for sharing and congrats on 50!
I'm only 10 days in.  But I have to say... the people in AA have been wonderful.  I've seen so many horrible posts on here that it nearly put me off going.  It's great to have new sober friends and I couldn't imagine doing this by myself.
Congratulations on 50! It keeps getting better for me too! IWNDWYT
