I'm overwhelmed by irritability and anxiety today. Last night I had a dream where I drank wine without realizing it was a relapse got drunk then sobered up and realized I had slipped. All the drinking dreams I've had before this have been me decidedly turning down alcohol. So this one kind of came out of left field and I'm wondering what my subconscious is working out. ..This weekend *has* been full of uncertainty in many areas and my sponsor shooting down my 90 day plan which is the only thing giving me real direction right now really sucks. I get where he's coming from; it's reasonable to assume that if I have a daily list of goals then I will tie my self-worth to the completion of those goals when really self-acceptance no matter what is the key. I'm just not sure I believe this yet! I want to be different I want to have found the hack that makes me a productive member of society I want to have hard work pay off. My head is spinning and I've given myself a migraine from all the worrying coupled with klonipin withdrawal (doctor supervised.)..Today I went to a meeting and left a voicemail for my sponsor. I didn't call an alcoholic do my physical therapy do a language  lesson  or clean for twenty minutes...I think this is the time where I have to trust that I'm doing the right thing by having these daily guidelines goals whatever. It feels more right to trust myself and fail than to second guess myself and be a ball of anxiety and have using dreams. Time will tell I suppose.

&gt;This weekend has been full of uncertainty in many areas and my sponsor shooting down my 90 day plan which is the only thing giving me real direction right now really sucks...I say keep your plan. Only YOU can really know and experience how you really feel about it..This is the downside to sponsors. Despite their best intentions they simply can't be right all the time..If this plan is working for you don't let anyone pull that rug out from under you..That is my opinion anyway...
Maybe it would be good to survey the Dino's about this. I know you can't just go freaking out every time your sponsor doesn't agree with your actions but I can't help thinking that it would have been better to explore the potential impact of your 90 day challenge rather than nix it outright. I know we don't know each other and I could be missing out on some of the nuances but it really seems like the 90 day project is helping you and my impression is that the activity is being supported by others here.
