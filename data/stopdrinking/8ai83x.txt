I'm 33 been struggling with alcohol since I was in my teens.  Got a dui when I was 17 and I did actually go to a couple meetings then but it was court ordered.  I haven't been to AA since.  I've been trying to stay sober on my own just went 44 days but I always relapse hard and I can't take it anymore!  Everyone I'm surrounded with drinks and I just can't get away.  Any advice is really appreciated and needed.  Thank you SD.  IWNDWYT.

Just tak it easy you don't have to do anything else than sit and listen. If you feel like it you can chat with people get your newcomer badge take some phone numbers etc. But the beauty of AA is that you are not forced to do anything (other than being willing to stop drinking). If you take the pressure off you'll quickly get comfortable and meet inspiring people. You'll feel great afteward!
I find them very helpful. Even in groups where there are vastly different people I find at least one common story there. I have found them to be very supportive and nonjudgmental. The spirituality concept is a higher power of your choice. Going to a meeting some days is what keeps me from grabbing a drink. Just give it a chance and be open and listen. The messages are there if you are willing to hear them. I will not drink with you today  
I was very nervous and in tears the first time I went to an AA meeting ............ honestly with no idea what to expect at all . I found such understanding and comfort from people and hugs from strangers which made me cry more .But I keep going back and while I'm not very religious I actually enjoy the support and understanding from people .
