Hey everyone unfortunately my badge is not correct. I am back in recovery. I am trying very hard. I am sitting at 39 days sober!!!..But I am struggling really badly. I am going through something I never had to struggle with in addiction. If anyone has ever had to start over from nothing please tell me how you did it...My last run was a bad one. I threw away everything I had. I hit about 90 days sober and jumped back in the bottle like I never left. I did not take the suggestions and one of the common themes in early recovery I thought I had it. So I quit going to meetings and did not keep doing AA.....This time I relapsed worse than ever. I literally lost everything. My great job... My beautiful place. But most importantly I lost my sobriety...I am now 39 days clean sitting in a Sober Living house with nothing. I have not known what this is like in life. I have not a single penny for food or anything. I do have a sponsor but I just met him and I do not know where to start with this. I did apply for food stamps but they are about a week out...If anyone has any advice for me please let me know. I am feeling very down and out right now. ..I have a place to stay water from the facet and clothes to wear but I do not know where to go from here...I am in Pompano Beach Florida if it helps...Thanks for reading.

AA meetings and the AA service office may have resources or know where resources can be obtained.  Good luck.  From darker places I've seen people change their entire lives arouncl
