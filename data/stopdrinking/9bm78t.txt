8 days sober I'm so much happier. I don't know why I didn't try to quit sooner. Sometimes it's hard not to drink. But waking up feeling normal accomplishing things I've wanted to do forever and just feeling better in general is so worth all of the craving struggles I have.

Congratulations on day 8! The cravings will continue but fade over time (so I'm told). My cravings have gone down in frequency a lot but there's still some strong ones that do pop up. ..But like you said being happy and motivated to be better is much more important. Good luck with continuing on your journey!
Way to go! I'm right here with you. Actually excited about being sober. I've known chemically induced me for the last 20 years and I am 33 now. Time to figure out who I really am. That's truly exciting and I'm ready to do all the great things intoxicated me promised! Hope you have an amazing day and truly thank you for the break of doom and gloom. I'm feeling better than I have in a long time and it's very nice to hear someone state the same.
