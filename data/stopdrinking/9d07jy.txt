Background - 23M drank everyday for as long as I can remember...I have just come back from a holiday to France 6+ 7.5% beers every day... time for a right? But all I could think about on my first day back was my next drink how it would never be as good as having the strong stuff! That's when it dawned on me it will never be enough... I sat at the top of the stairs damn near pulling my hair out just trying to stop myself going to the fridge and pulling a beer out...I sat there almost all night but I didn't drink! and then... it just seemed to be getting easier the longer I go without a drink the less I seem to crave it. I've had a craving or two particularly when I get home from work or when my gf has a glass of wine. I cant tell anyone how proud I am because I've never told anyone about my struggles but its a massive achievement for me and I wanted to let someone know :)..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks for listening :)
