Long time lurker and even longer relapser.  Getting back to it because I'm tired of the vicious circle.   Even now two days in and feeling great my lying brain is telling me it's ok to drink today ("see how good you feel wouldn't you feel better with a drink or ten?).  ..I have to say how much this forum helps.

From the last time I quit i remember the way i would try and rationalize having a few beers. the first two weeks were tough. After a year i celebrated with a 4-pack. That was that game over. ..You can do it stay strong! 
If you're a long time lurker I'm sure you're familiar with lots of the common advice thrown around here. What's your plan of action?
The first weeks are rough are you doing anything other than SD to help you stay sober?  I found that putting a gameplan in place for every little thing I did was very helpful. For example driving home from work I would consciously think of what it was like to not stop at a gas station or liquor store and then I'd go into mission mode and stick to the gameplan. I would also text a friend and tell them what I was going to do to make myself be more accountable. Good luck on your first few days!
same here. It's scary how I can stop drinking so well. and then one day just not care about any argument or reason or plan or phone call and just  make a 180 degree turn and drink.

I get those same whispers and schemes from my brain. "You're doing great celebrate with a drink you can control it this time"...One day at a time. And today I won't drink.
