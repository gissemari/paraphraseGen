Hey SD! I'm posting this early as I'll be tucked away in a cozy little place (upstate NY brrrrrr!!) celebrating New Year's with family; a lovely early dinner and a peaceful nights' sleep :). Oh and a fireplace! If you're affected by the arctic blast in the States please stay warm and safe...As we enter 2018 I've been thinking of how grateful I am for sobriety and how excited I am to stay sober in '18. Are you on the fence about *getting sober* or experiencing challenges *staying sober*? Hang out here more often - you'll see how lives have not only been *saved* but how much lives have changed for the better. Yes you will also hear of rockbottoms slip up's research in moderation etc.. For me comments such as these help to *keep me sober*. I'm thankful for our members who hold themselves accountable and come back to our lifeboat :)...I'm also thinking of **KINDNESS**. How have we been kind to people in 2017? What can we do to be **KINDER IN 2018**? How can we be kind to *ourselves* in 2018?..I saw this clip https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/the-power-of-acts-of-kindness/ and got several ideas. How cool is it that Oxytocin can be raised in our bodies our arteries can actually be softened and we can *reduce stress* by being kind?! Not only are we doing AoK's for others but we're being kind to ourselves as well. Very interesting clip I hope you check it out!..If you're struggling on this NYE perhaps you can hit a recovery group meeting hang out here at SD visit supportive NYE threads or chill out in our IRC? Remember you're *never* alone here - we've always got your back ;)...Warmest wishes for a very happy healthy peaceful blessed and **sober** New Year to you and yours. Thank you for being part of our family and for all of your contributions. Every little bit makes a big difference!..Lee &lt;3

Here's to Kindness in 2018!..Let it flow from the mountain tops and from each of our Hearts for all!  Especially the Intrepid SoberNauts on this Journey!
Hear Hear!  The best part is kindness once practiced for a bit becomes habit.  Happy Kindness 2018 /r/stopdrinking !
Checking on from Upstate NY! ..I love random AoKs. I feel a little shy doing them sometimes but I always seek to do them. Mostly I just try to make people around me laugh though.
