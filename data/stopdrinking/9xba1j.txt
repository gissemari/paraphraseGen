Still sober!  ...I just got back from a boat trip with my work team. Most of them were staggering and not because of the waves. 5 years ago it would have been me. Or I would have fallen overboard ... vomited told my boss what a dump the office was. Who knows. Instead it was great fun and I was home in time to tuck my kids in and read them a story. ..I come back here every year just to read back some of my earlier posts and remind me of where I was before I committed to being a non-drinker. I have changed so much for the better I struggle to remember who I was back then. ..&amp;#x200B;..I am forever grateful to the community and look forward to many more check-ins over the years!..&amp;#x200B;

*i struggle to remember who I was back then*.  \o/!  This is what I'm looking forward to.  This forwards momentum I have in sobriety is so much more fun than the inertia and slow decline of drinking days.. isn't it deeply gratifying?  Congratulations on one more year of freedom!!!     May the sober winds always be at your back 
That's awesome I hope to have that same feeling one day.  I believe I can do it.
This honestly made me cry a little. So happy for you and thank you for sharing.
I have to join this yearly club! Well done! 
See you next year!
Congrats! Thank you for being an inspiration. I am facing a whole ball of garbage right now because of my drinking. I cannot wait until I am able to be like you and look back at who I  used  to be. 
Well done
Great job! It's great to see old timers pop back in...I will attempt to not drink with you this year.
Love it! Thanks for sharing.
Nice work! This is a great post. Congrats.
