*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---..No quote today but rather - an opportunity.  I'm looking for someone to step in and host the daily check-in for one week starting tomorrow.  Its a very easy but super-satisfying opportunity to be a large part of the /r/stopdrinking community.  The hope love struggles and successes posted each day in the check-in are incredible to read...All you need is 30 days sobriety and a desire to give back.  Message me if interested!

Survived a wedding sober which turned out to be a lovely night!..I didn't also didn't drink in Aus with you today and won't be drinking with you tonight. 
Midnight here. I won't drink with you today.
I will not drink today no matter what happens.
It just hit me that I'll be away from my husband for a while starting tomorrow to work my new job. It's got me down but our time together on my days off will be that much more special. I will not drink with you today.
Early Sunday morning fresh and fine! I raise my cup of coffee to all you fighters out there. I will not drink with you today!
Got a lovely friend coming over Sunday. We'll hang out talk maybe go for a walk and something to eat. It's so great I no longer have to make my plans around potential hangovers :/..IWNDWYT!
Sober Sunday's are my favorite. I will not drink today! 
Its morning here and I will not drink today. Thank you for doing this. This is the first time I come to the forum. 
Ugh that was tough. I was out with my colleagues. First we spent a few hours in the bowling club and after that visited a new bar in the downtown. I ordered an alco-free Heineken and watched how my coworkers who are very serious during our working hours were slowly getting drunk. Ones became very friendly and outgoing others wanted to vent and get hugs/support. After everything almost in the morning I stood with one coworker who was drunk like devil trying to hold him due to he was not able to stand still and catch a taxi. Then he stared to complain how lonely he is in his 28 and sometimes thinking about a suicide. So I had to make it sure he safely reached his home and bed and came back home on my feet. Luckily we live in the same street...You know what? That was a scary evening but I am pretty proud of myself. 
Moving sucks. Moving 3rd floor Apartments sucks. Moving without a moving company sucks. Moving without a hangover and actually being hydrated is kind of okay...I will not drink with y'all today!!..
Sunday will be the first day I'll be alone since the holiday. I generally drink alone so this pledge is very important. I will not drink today!
Not drinking today!  
I will not drink today. It is my job. 
4 weeks today! Lovely waking up hangover free! I will most definitely not drink with you today :)  
I will not drink today! Xx
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.
My second Sober Sunday in a row! My second sober weekend. I went out last night and watched a film and had dinner with my friends laughed LOADS and smashed an entire large (8 slice) pizza alone. Woke up feeling fresh and happy and now off for some Zumba yoga and swimming with my boss. This is starting to feel really really really fucking good. IWNDWYT &lt;3
Not drinking today!
I will not drink today.
I'll not drink with all you fine people today.
I will not drink with you today.
No booze for me today
This is day 10 for me which is a first in a great number of years. Must say that this wasn't planned and has just happened so I'm just seeing where it takes me but it's getting better by the day. I will not drink with you today
Not drinking today!
Day 11 and also my first real challenge I'm alone today because the boyfriend has a 24 hour shift. But I'm not giving up on all the hard work so far I will not drink today!
Day 185. ..I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today! 
I haven't checked in in a very long time. I have been drinking lately although not daily I still got heavily drunk on several occasions. I'm still unemployed but I have an important exam for a certification in the beginning of December and I really need to pass it...I've been lurking around this sub and the chat as a form to remind myself that I need to recover...For what it's worth I am not drinking today.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today
I was over at a friend's wealthy parents house and went to get a diet Coke from mini fridge none in there so my buddy said check under the counter. There were like 50 fully stocked big ass liqour bottles of everything imaginable! It stopped me in my tracks. Stared at it for 10 seconds . First thought was nobody would know if I drank any. Then I thought about how I could get drunk and eat the pizza I had just refused ( since I'm committed to losing the disgusting fat alcohol gave me). Then I placed the diet Cokes in the fridge and grabbed a ginger ale. It all happened in about 20 seconds. Thought about that moment so much I had to write it here. Didn't drink yesterday f*ck the zero today. 
Day two sad and contemplative as my ex fiance is packing to move out next weekend. All my fault but I guess I have to move on for me and my girl. I won't be drinking with you today 
I'm hoping today will be less frazzlimg than yesterday. It is 4:38 AM &amp; I am up so early just for the peace &amp; quiet.  I won't drink with you all today my SD family. 
I was looking forward to an event all month and guess what? it was YESTERDAY. I feel like such a fool right now! however while i'd have been exhausted after the train ride i ended up talking to a friend about aspects of my psychology i didn't know and feel i have something to work on to become a better person..I think it evens out!.I will not drink with you today friends.
Not drinking with you all today
made it through thanksgiving someone literally spilled bourbon all over my shirt and jeans but I did not give in. .IWNDT
I didn't drink today and I won't be drinking tonight :)
I will not drink with you today.  
I will not drink with you today..
Holiday was fine but I'm feeling a great deal of dread already for the week ahead.  Sad way to think honestly.  But I will not drink today.
So glad I stopped drinking. The longer I go the stronger the reserve. And I actively don't want to go to bars or any place alc is being served. Just being around drunks annoys me. Even if all my friends were going to a bar I wouldn't go. ..I will not drink today or the days after because drinking fucking sucks. The #1 fastest way to make a person stupid (also the fastest way to get unattractive). Something in me changed this last 6 months from "I hope I'll never drink again but I could maybe see it happening here and there" to "fuck that shit forever I never even want to consume one DROP again." Shit is poison for the mind and spirit. Poison for spirituality. I love marching to the beat of my own drum and I hate doing what everyone else is doing. I don't WANT to fit in. And that is why I will not drink with you today *raises glass of water*
I will not drink today.
 
I will not drink today
I will not drink today no matter what
I will not be drinking with you today on this lovely autumn  Sunday.  Last of the leftovers getting the toss before kickoff.  Turkey dinner was great .... the first time ....  leftovers seem to last an eternity. But I am still thankful . Stay strong SD  and stay busy. Boredom is a choice. 
Count me in:)
Day off today. Often work Sundays. Lounging about drinking hot Ribena with baked potatoes in the oven. I know how to live! No post alcohol hangover anxiety and sweating today. Praise be to me. Johnny.
I will not drink today!!
I will not drink today. 
Had a GREAT productive Saturday. Lots of little things done that had been pushed from day to day during the week...Working on something nice for my wife :)..I'm not drinking with you today!
I will not drink with you today grateful to be enjoying a warm cup of coffee and a great night of sleep.
I will not drink today!
97 days clean and sober- I will not drink or drug with you today!
Hey SD!..I will not drink with you today...Take care..
Another day of waking up feeling awful almost hungover but no drinking. Might go to the doc soon...Still won't be drinking with you all today :)
I will not drink with all of you today. Once I put my head on the pillow tonight it will mark the first weekend!
Joining you lovely people for a sober Sunday!
I will not drink today
Hey SD I will not drink today. Yesterday I had to fight off a massive urge for a good chunk of the day. I made it and beyond grateful to wake up this morning sober! Hope everyone has a great day.

I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking today planning on making carnitas and having friends over. Right now up a 6 am with my daughter sleeping in my arms. Just have to find a way to get coffee!
Checking in.  Random thoughts- thinking about faith.  For me that just means a strong conviction that if you're doing good work and the right things then you're on the right path and things will change and get better- even if you can't see any evidence in front of your eyes. So even when I can't find the hope I can find faith.  
Back to day 1 :/ I  can't believe I've done this to myself again... feeling like crap. I will not drink today.
Woo! I will not drink today. 
Not drinking with you all today.
Not drinking today!

I will not drink today!
Double digits!  I will not drink with you today!
I'm not drinking today.
Sunday morning and bless him but my partner's dad has left so it's back to trying to put my routine together. I was just starting a nice groove before everything got shaken up a bit so I was a little thrown off so it's "back on the saddle"---but in the single most important change of my life I stayed strong and sober! Things are possible. Best wishes to you all today. IWNDWY
I will not drink today.
Good morning! I will not drink today! &lt;3

Hello! Just checking in. I will not drink today or tonight. 
Sunday! Grand daughter day! We are taking her to a local Aquarium to see Scuba Santa! I will not drink today. /u/Fat_46 I can take over the check in tomorrow. I was fired earlier this month &amp; the extra time on my hands worries me. I would appreciate it but if you get someone who has never done it before you should give it to them! Please let me know!
We get home today get back to the normality and work. Its been great but the hotel bar was calling me last night. I won. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today no matter what.  I had some strong craving yesterday but fought them off.  I ate lots of food and junk food instead and went to a couple of AA meetings.  Drinking brings me nothing but pain and misery.  Every.single.time.
Will not drink today and will start the next week off right.
I will not drink today.

Loving my sober Sunday's I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today.
Not drinking today 
The first time I stopped drinking it was so easy it's  like a switch turned on. And I didn't drink for 45 days. I felt amazing and even lost some weight. Until Halloween and my little devil gave me permission to enjoy myself it's ONLY one night!   Well since then this  damn little devil won't leave and keeps making excuses! UGH I need 'ah-ha' moment again!  Need my switch to flip! ..I will not drink with you today! Again!  
I will not drink today. Peace.
Day two for me. Although it's early days the idea of being sober forever makes the future seem so much brighter. I'm heading out to Pizza Hut with a few work colleagues this evening - wish me luck. I will not drink today. 
I will not drink today.  
I will not drink today.
I've got a lot to tackle today and in the conning week. I'm a little stressed about it but alcohol would only hinder my productivity and ultimately stress me out even more! Instead of drinking I'll take hot baths eat my favorite foods take it easy around the house watch fun tv meditate and exercise. I'll not be drinking today!
Will not drink today.  
I will not drink today.
No drinking today.
I'm back. I spent a month or two mostly keeping it together. No booze on work nights stopping after a few etc. The last week or two I've fallen back into nightly benders. ..Honestly trying to moderate is harder than abstaining. It's not the first time I've learned this lesson but I keep tricking myself into thinking I can make it work this time. ..I'm not sure how to do this. Right now my goal is just to make it to next year without having a drink. ..I am not going to drink today.
I will not drink with you today. Happy Sober Sunday!  
REALLY proud of my 50 days! I will not drink with you today. Sipping on my delicious coffee with a splash of heavy whipping cream.
I will not drink with you today!
I'm in.  
Checking IN! 
I won't be drinking today!
I will not drink with you today. 
Greetings all!..I'm celebrating 150 days (5 months) of sobriety today hurrah!..Am currently back in Blighty visiting my family and maintaining an unassailable zen-like state of calm (although I could bloody murder a cigarette oh well...).....Only another couple of days before I can return to the sanctuary of my own place.... my families' houses are far too tidy and clean it has me on edge in case I spill anything!!!..Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend I won't be drinking with you all!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.  Friends are coming over to my new house - first guests - to help me hang art.  Making it my own space.

Just had a relapse dream last night that was basically reality. I still woke up confused and it still feels like it happened even though I know it didn't. I will not drink with you all today
Well crap. Had a rough Thanksgiving. Drank. My husband was mad at me. Wasn't able to go to a party last night we had been very much looking forward to (though there were other factors in that besides me being hungover.)..Why do I like drinking again? Ugh. I will not drink with y'all today. 
Saying NO in NO-Vember. I will not drink with you guys today
Up early and off to work. Hoping like hell I can enjoy work and not be focused on the sciatica that has been plaguing me sigh...No matter what I will not drink today!
Not much motivation and a feeling depressed these days in early sobriety. Not drinking today excited about the future.
I'm not drinking today.  I'm going to do some positive stuff instead.
I will not drink today!
I will not drink with you all today!
Second sober Sunday last week was spent in a hospital due to a mental breakdown that was not being aided by alcohol. I will not stop by the liquor store after going to the grocery store like I normally do and I will not drink with you today.
I will not be drinking with you all today! 
Drinking - not gonna do it today. Hang tough everybody
Hosting a huge bday party for my 4 yr old son later today...Feeling pretty organized about set up/food. Feeling some anxiety about party there will be a lot of parents from his Pre-K class I don't know very well but I know it will be fine because I am sober. I will not be drinking today!
Have made through a holiday weekend with family unscathed and sober. Whew! I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT!!!  
I will not drink with you today. 
Not drinking with you all today!
I will not drink today. 
And there you really see what it means to succumb to this disease.  .Well done you.  An eye-opener to remember and learn.  Thank you for sharing. I will try and remember this one..I hope your colleague is okay.  ..BooksCatsandCoffee?  I LOVE that.  Perfection. 
Today is my first day posting here and it's going to be a really difficult day. I feel in danger of going back to Day 1. I need help and this is where I'm going first to try to keep my 6+ months going.
Hmmm.  Was too busy to pledge this morning.  But I will not drink with any of you today.  Sparkling water coffee and tea that I'm making for my son's football team. That is all..Had to open a bottle of wine for the lunch with parents... First bottle I've touched (from the outside only) for 9 days.  NOT for me.  Or for any of you!
Happy sober Sunday   looking forward to a productive day! Iwndwyt   
I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night but I'm waking up without a hangover! I will not drink with you lovely people today

Not drinking on this sunny chilly Sunday morning.
Good morning. Not drinking today.
Not drinking today!
Not drinking today!
Good morning from North Carolina. Had a badge reset yesterday and made it through the day w/o drinking. Actually crushed the day. I got the floors cleaned at home and I volunteer on Saturdays and made it in on time and stayed the whole time. .A friend I was working with invited me to go to a shooting range w/ her in the afternoon. I know nothing about guns and don't really care for them but I went anyway to stay busy and be around people. Turns out I'm pretty accurate with a hand gun...who knew. I then made it to the gym and did a short workout but I'm giving myself  credit for it. .It was a pretty fulfilling Saturday..If I chose to drink on Saturday none of this would have happened. Thanks for all the support yesterday. I will not drink today
I will not drink with you today! I was surrounded by old drinking buddies over Thanksgiving but stayed sober. It helped that I've been very sick this week and had that built-in excuse. Onward :)
I'm not drinking today.

Hello Good Morning and Good Day! I will not drink with you today!
Hate that I had to reset the other day. But I'm never going to stop trying to stop..I will not drink with you today.
Almost drank last night because I hate myself and self sabotage. Trying to stop. I will not drink today.
Cravings almost got the best of me but I'm still here
I will not drink with you today.        
Everything feels overwhelming and I feel the blue dog of depression at my heels but I know that having a drink will only hurt in the long run. So today despite how much I want to I will not drink with you today.
Not drinking with you all today!  Going for that little star badge  .

Yesterday was my daughter's 13th birthday. We had a party at my sister's house and it was nice but man every event I go to there's booze. Good booze too not boxed wine and hooch. I was sorely tempted to have a Manhattan with the gorgeous bourbon my sister had but I didn't. I drank water and ate too much and came home when the 13 year old had had enough. Slammed a few cups of tea when I got home and had seltzer for the fizz. 
Not drinking today. 
Not gonna drink today.

I will not drink today. 
Not today. Not today. Not today!
I will not drink today. 
Wow what a great weekend.  Feel like this time I really want this and while I'm vigilantly avoiding stress it feels much more natural not drinking this time.  Staying the course and not drinking with all of you today.
I will not drink today! 
I almost always drink after getting out of my evening shift to "relieve stress". NOT TONIGHT! I will not drink with you all tonight :)
Hey everyone!  I just wanted to check in.  Keeping busy and doing well. I hope that everyone is doing great!  I will not drink with you today!
hi im new here this is day 28 without alcohol for me and i feel alot better for it 
I won't drink today no matter what happens good or bad. Thank you for the check-in!
New here. I will not drink today. That's all I can muster at this moment. 
not drinking today :)
won't drink today
Not drinking today!
Not drinking today
I will not drink today. Nope. No sir. 
Lessons learned this weekend (that I already knew but ignored because I thought something had changed as usual...):.*I can never be in an alcohol focused environment like bars or parties ever again..*Sobriety will force me to stop hanging out with 90% of my friends..*Weekends is the toughest part by far boredom is the biggest enemy. I have to find a new hobby that can keep my occupied on friday/saturday night..Badge reset. I will not drink with you today.
Jaw infection. Horrible pain. Surgery tomorrow or Tuesday with tooth extraction. Normally would be stressed about this but I'm not. It's alllll good. Floss motherfuckers. Floss. IWNDWYT!
Little late checking in. Today whatever happens alcohol will not be an option. Rock it!
Dealing with loneliness and anxiety .. but I will not drink today.
I will not drink today.

Just here to remind myself how good it feels to be sober. Three weeks has blown past and I feel great. I'm sleeping like a baby too. It's easy to think that I'm missing something as I'm not drinking but really I'm not missing the hangovers blackouts and awkward chats with my drinking buddies and hearing about my drunken antics...My past will never change but my future already has. I feel like a kid waiting for Christmas watching that number get higher: the biggest problem is boredom so I still have to find more new things to do and enjoy the ride.
I will not drink alcohol today.
I went to Iceland!  It was amazing and I can't wait to plan my next trip.   I have a sobriety tracker that tells me how much money I've not spent on alcohol and I plan to spend every penny on life experiences. As a newish sober person I feel I have a lot of catching up to do. .How's your Sunday going?  If you're practically banging your head against a wall to get your brain to shut up about drinking then you're doing it right.  For me day 4 was when it started to get seriously hard and lasted about two weeks but everyday got a little better.  Just a smidge. Sugar helps. You got this!
I will NOT drink today. I've been having some bad mental health issues paranoia and anxiety this past week and I know drinking will worse them in the long run. Just picked up This Naked Mind from the library and read the first chapter. It's hard to feel hopeful but I don't feel hopeless.
I will not drink today. 
I started just 18 days ago and I'm looking forward to week 3. I successfully survived a weekend in Mexico with friends who start their first drink just after breakfast with me normally right there with them. It was hard to tell them I wasn't drinking. ....It really tested my resolve when our car broke down in the middle of the USA/Mexico border line and we had to push it the 1 km to cross into the US. Normally I would have decompressed with a glass or several. Now I'm taking a nap and some extra fancy tea to celebrate the weekend resolve. I'm still not going to drink it does nothing for me and I want a healthier way to manage my stress.....Thanks for being here this sub has really helped me in so many ways. 
I think I'm the last person on the planet to discover the wonders of spaghetti squash. So so good. And you're almost there! You have practically completed day 3 woohoo!  Hmm what has helped me ... well Halo Top for sure. Gallons of peppermint tea. Any flavored fizzy water - I don't know why it has to be fizzy but it does. Congratulations on getting through day 3 seriously you should be really proud of yourself. 
  FTZ!
I will not drink today no matter what!!  Day 8!!!  IWNDWYT!!
Didn't drink today
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today!
I won't be drinking today!
Late in the day to check in but I won't be drinking this evening either!
Made dinner on the grill and walked my dog. No Rum no wine no beer. I had a brief but nice conversation with my teenage son about his new girlfriend. Made it to day 2 sober (again). I will not drink with you today.
My second sober Thanksgiving is in the books. I will not drink today!
Today was a tricky day for me and I chose to stay strong. There is much work ahead and that's okay. But today was a step on the right path. 
 
What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread... ....  ..

I will not drink today.
I should add I won't drink with you the rest of the day
Finally made it one week without alcohol. I couldn't have done it without AA and some recovery books I've been reading. I still need a sponsor... .I shouldn't be needing help like this as young as I am :(
