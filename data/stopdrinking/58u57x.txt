Been ill and it's just wore off my housemate is going to a party later so the fridge is full of ice cold beer and wine...Got a right feeling in my throat and I keep thinking how I could instantly loosen that tightness up with a vodka or a scotch and have that warm fuzzy feeling...Just need to get through today got a load of fancy food and gonna get stuck in a book...Ugh fuck.

You can do it I will not drink with you today
Sounds like you've got some good distractions! You got this. I have struggled many times but a good plan has got me through. And it feels so good to wake up in the morning and feel proud of my choices the night before. ..I'm not drinking with you today!
Gonna eat some cheese cake and watch south park
