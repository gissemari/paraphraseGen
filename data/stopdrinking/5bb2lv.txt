Today is day 75 for me. So far I've managed to get a new job and lost about 24 lbs in total. A woman I used to see (and who I still love) reconnected during this time. I'm letting go of things not meant for me with much less stress than I used to. And my outlook on life is focused on building a future worth living and not dwelling in my past mistakes and transgressions. This is the way I want to live life from now on. Alcohol has taken away many good years of my life and gives back only temporary pleasure. If you are struggling ask yourself "what is alcohol GIVING me?" If you cannot find an answer then maybe sobriety would look good on  you too.
