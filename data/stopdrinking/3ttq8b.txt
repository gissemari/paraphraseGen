I've been reading through this sub reddit on and off all day and although I'll likely never know any of you I've felt less alone in this space than I can remember. ..It's almost tacky one could argue to see an Internet thread asking for pledges to stop drinking followed by a stream of one-line "I will not drink today" follow up comments. But I've been reading through many of your stories and your words of support for each other and extrapolating from what I know about my life into yours... I've been getting a sense of the depth of real lives and real struggles hidden away in those little comments and it's been moving to observe not tacky. ..I guess this part of me the part that likes to get wasted to close the door on everyday life in trade of a fantasy world that is temporarily convincing is something I've fought desperately to deny and keep hidden - so much so that it feels like that this me the hidden me has become the real me and this me is always alone.  Except today in a way. ..I just deleted a whole lot of irrelevant rambling but the gist of it is that I feel a certain kind of dark affinity with those who struggle with ordinary life and yearn for something a little more transcendent. I even feel that dark affinity with those radicalised into committing terrorist acts. The externals are very different but the form of what underlies it seem to bear a family resemblance I feel to something I have. ..I've always been aggressively resistant to the whole idea of professional help for this sort of thing. I don't want to see it as a chemical addiction. I don't want to see it as a problem with the substance. It's to me a problem with how to be in the world and I won't submit to being labelled sick or broken by someone who I can't feel any affinity for. ..The most consoling thing has been to read through your accounts lost like I feel not knowing how to be but resolving to face life whilst sober and facing life as head-on as you can bear.   I feel a connection with you in your struggles and I've found inspiration in your resolve. Thank you for your stories.   Today is my day one.

WELCOME! When I finally realized that I was not alone and that the (what I thought to be) insurmountable problems in my life were not unique I saw a light at the end of the tunnel and it was SUCH a relief. Now I'm through that tunnel and living in the light and I am so grateful to other alcoholics that have shared their stories with me. I could not do it alone...Check out the Saturday Shares if you haven't already (link on the side bar). They're great to read cause they're a full summary of what it was like what happened and what it's like now...Glad you found us.
Let me tell you about how the Daily Check-in came about.  [This link goes to the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/)  The first idea that I describe is this notion that my AA sponsor shared with me in May of 1986: make a daily decision not to drink TODAY only--no matter what happens good or bad.  He told me it's great to build a physical ritual around the decision and commitment to yourself on this point.    Over the years I've met all kinds of people in recovery who pray or meditate or stand in front of the mirror and recite some version of this or a similar mantra for the same purpose.  In fact most of the ideas in the baby steps are conventional recovery wisdom handed down from drunks who got sober from the beginning of the modern recovery movement (about 1935-36).  The idea behind the "ritual" is to create a little physical action to make [a Ulysses Bargain with our rational selves](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3il4y0/the_ulysses_bargain_how_i_get_past_cravings_and/?ref=search_posts) at the beginning of each day before the stressors and temptations of our hurly burly lives interferes with our resolve.  So I started doing a daily ritual of making a daily post of my decision not to drink TODAY--then someone named /u/humaneresource adapted the idea into what formally became the community Daily Check-in.  This morning post allows the community a day-to-day place to be accountable and in itself is an online "ritual" and as you can see that idea became a tradition that unites a large segment of our community.  Lots of newcomers credit the practice with creating something solid for them in the early days.  Notice too that the person who posts the Daily Check-in is doing this for one week from Sunday to Sunday and that service work is reserved to someone who has 30 days or more sober time--and it usually results in coming to recognize someone who is getting active in the community itself.  I hope you will come to participate and maybe take a turn at being the weekly Check-in post-er.
