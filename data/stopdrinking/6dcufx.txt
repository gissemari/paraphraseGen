Well i made it to day 10  wasnt sure that id make it here. Anger is one of my triggers that makes me tempted to go and say fk the world and to go get fked up. I was so tempted to go do that yesterday but i went online to the IRC room and stayed there till i calmed down with the help of some of the IRC users. ..Id like to thank everyone in the IRC room and in this community for helping me get to day 10!!  ..Getting to day 10 hasnt been without struggles but i plan to keep at it.  ..i hope that u all have a good day/night...All keep up the good work!..Thanks for reading..MrIvanov

CONGRATS FRIEND!
It makes me very happy to see your progress you are much stronger than you realise..Keep at it friend.
Very very proud of your 10 days. Once I got to 10 days I remember thinking "now I know I can do this. If I can get to 10 I can get to 100 etc" and it gave me strength. ..One day at a time. &lt;3
