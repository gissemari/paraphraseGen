I've been struggling with my drinking for what seems like a decade now. I was able to quit for 45 days earlier this year. I lost weight became productive and started feeling really good about myself. I started dating again and gave into the pressures of alcohol. A drink here and there wouldn't hurt I thought to myself. Well its been a few months since I started drinking again and I find myself returning to old habits. I can't remember the last day I didn't have a drink. I've reset my badge so many times only to break it again and again. I can't keep this up anymore...Here I am again. Ready to fight. Ready for change. ..Today I will not drink.

No matter every day is a new day and a new hope! ..We'll stay with you as long as there's life left in you (and I mean that in a warning sort of way hoping you'll gather the strenght this time to keep going!)...Today - I will drink only TEA with you..
It's frustrating that we can't just enjoy a drink or two like so many other people I understand the temptation to keep trying it.  But all those "experiments" to retry moderating have taught you that you are probably not one of them I'm not either.  Now we know and don't have to make that mistake again.  I will not drink with you today.
This sounds like me. I feel so ashamed. I had quit for 40 days. I went on my first sober date but then he made me feel rejected so I relapsed. I will do my best to not drink with you today.
58 days sober for me. Drank like a dumbass for about 10 days. Just good enough time to cry waste money cause stomach pains and go to work hungover. Oh good times. DAY 2 AGAIN!! WE GOT THIS!!!! No more dumbass shit
