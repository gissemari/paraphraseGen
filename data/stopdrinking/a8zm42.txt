I do not drink hate the taste and everything about it. With that being said those of you who struggle with the addiction are not foreign to those who take sobriety for granted. We understand there's extreme war going on in you and don't judge you for it. We are imperfect humans however we all do want the best for you and are cheering you on to overcome the drink. The beauty is as real as the craving gets and as much as you DESPERATELY may want it you do NOT need it EVER. You WILL be okay even BETTER if you can just overcome the temporary moments of desire.

One of the things I am most thankful for is that the craving to drink passed after a few months. I don't have much desire to drink anymore but I think that goes hand in hand with looking after myself and making a new life based around recovery and self-care.
