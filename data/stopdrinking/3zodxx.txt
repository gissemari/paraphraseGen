I've been a long time lurker under a different username. I created this one so I could feel 100% safe sharing (several of my friends know my reddit username). I looked back at my badge from when I first resolved to stop drinking under my other name... 338 days. Alas... I've had many relapses since then. But I made it an entire day!..I also took a HUGE step today -- I told my therapist that I'm an alcoholic. I've been seeing her for several years and I've never hinted that I have an alcohol problem so she was pretty surprised. It was such a relief to tell her. And tomorrow I'll be checking out an agnostic AA meeting. I just... I need to take control of this. I have a 3.5 year old daughter and I don't want her to grow up with a drunk mom. I don't want to be too hung over to play with her (which has happened many times unfortunately) or too drunk to take her to the park. ..My tipping point was on Sunday. I had just started to feel better after binge drinking New Year's Eve and had resolved to take sobriety seriously. Then I went grocery shopping and I thought... maybe I can just get a six-pack and just drink one beer a day. Yeah I can do that! I've got this!..I drank the entire six pack that night. I woke up with one of the worst hangovers of my life. See I'm on Prozac right now too... and that has lowered my tolerance I think. So it hit me and it hit me HARD. It was terrible. I barely functioned that day. I almost wasn't able to get my daughter to her first day of school after break...So I need to change. I've tried to do this on my own for too long. I've kicked so many other things on my own but alcohol... this ones too big for me.

Welcome and congrats on taking big steps today. I think I read every word on here in the first few weeks and I've been doing the same recently and it's really helping me to stay strong. 
It's too big for me as well. Glad you're here let's do this!!!!
Good move. You have proven that it is better to just remove alcohol completely. That is what I've come to as well and why I decided to stop. ..It has been a week for me and things are really getting better already. It is a great feeling knowing that I don't have to worry about meeting with people the next morning hung over anymore! In fact I can count on it.
Good work on two days sober.  I'm sure while you were lurking you saw my various [Baby Steps posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) now you have your own link.  ; )
