Long time lurker first time poster. My alcoholism has been a fairly constant theme throughout the last fifteen years of my life. The hangovers anxiety embarrassment bathroom issues impotency and focus have become exponentially worse in recent years. I'm very grateful to have found this sub for the support and understanding that so many others struggle with the same problems..In an effort to keep myself entertained and avoid alcohol I decided yesterday to attend a local minor league baseball game by myself. Upon reflection I can't recall ever attending a sports game without having a beer. The people sitting next to me were drinking and besides missing the most exciting plays of the game being in the bathroom or in line for drinks I estimated they each spent $45+ just on stupid old booze. Buying myself a disappointing hotdog for $6.50 was even a big deal considering how much I saved not drinking. Today has been hard with a variety of mood swings but IWNDWYT..(Thanks for reading and the support!)
