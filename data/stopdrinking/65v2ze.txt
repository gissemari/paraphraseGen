Thank you first of all to all of you who encouraged me after my last thread. (Here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/63scg6/ive_relapsed_ive_been_drunk_several_times_over/) I was honestly overwhelmed by the support I received over 24 hours after I posted here. Thank you. ..It's taken 11 days and some more work (and I did drink a few more nights) but I am finally ready to officially get back on the wagon. I did not drink yesterday and today I sent in my request to have my badge reset to yesterday (4/16/2017) Easter Sunday. I'm not particularly religious but it seems appropriate anyway. :) I am starting over.  ..I still have 7 weeks of school left and The Parent From Hell continues to be from hell. On top of that I'm preparing to move to a new state soon and there are lots of emotions involved with the moving process. But I MUST and will find a way to cope without drinking/escaping my feelings. It was relatively easy the first few months of the year... I had lots and lots of activities in the evenings to distract me. Now I'm much less busy so I expect it to be more challenging. ..Expect me to be posting here a lot more often. :) ..At any rate thank you again to everyone for your support. ..I will not drink with you today. Thank you thank you.

Welcome back! Coming back here and posting and reading posts such as yours helps me more than I can say...
We look forward to seeing you - a lot more often.
Moving to a new state is a wonderful opportunity for sobriety.  I did it too when I first got sober.  I went from the guy who used to drink to much and now doesn't to simply being a guy who doesn't drink.  No explanations required and no history of drinking behavior and habits among the new people.
Welcome back - life is always going to happen - we can either drink our way through the tough times or decide to face life full on sober. Personally I have been present for many bumps in the road on my sober journey and I couldn't be happier or more proud of myself. Wishing you strength and thank you for posting with such honesty.
My situation has similarities hang in there. 
One of the biggest supports I had to stop drinking was that I moved across the state to a very small community. I made a promise that I absolutely would not ever buy alcohol in this town. I did leave a loophole in that I only excluded this town. But when I drove 2 hrs away to buy some furniture well then that was permission to buy! The deeper problem is that I felt like a hypocrite lower than whale dung. I realized that I couldn't do this half-assed &amp; live w/myself. So it's been a tough couple of weeks but the benefits are already visible. I won't use today as well. 
I won't drink with you! Welcome back :)
