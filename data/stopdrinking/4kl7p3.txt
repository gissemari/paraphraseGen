Hey SD! My initial goal was to beat my previous record of not drinking which was 60 days. I've accomplished that and here are a few things I've learned and want to work on. Here is my 30-day post if anyone is curious: https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4blm0f/my_30_day_journey_thus_far/. This will be long but I wanted to share this with you....Firstly I discuss in my 30-day post about sober people; sober places. I mention that it's hard for me to socialize because all my "friends" are people I've met at the pub that I frequent. I was pretty adamant that I was not going to sacrifice that and I was fully capable of controlling my cravings. This has not changed at all however I realized that this situation (ie: this particular pub) I don't associate with drinking but that's not **all pubs**. My sister invited me out a few weeks ago and I thought: "No biggie I got this". I was wrong. I got there and I was anxious about being in a new place with new people who were all drinking. I felt the cravings of alcohol to calm my nerves. This was the first time I've ever felt like I truly wanted to drink on an emotional *and* intellectual level. I ultimately chose not to but when my sister asked me to go to a bonfire with her same friends I chose to stay home. What I'm saying is: Sober people sober places are a real thing. This isn't a shocker to anyone I'm sure but to me I always felt so in control and genuinely disinterested in consuming alcohol that I wouldn't be weary of it. I was wrong and I won't be putting myself in pubs at night with people's sole purpose is on drinking. I learned my lesson albeit not the hard way this time!..**Triggers:** ..* *New Job:* Starting a new job in a new place is never easy for anyone. But for me a person who struggles with making genuine connections and not overly good at being fake or small talk I felt the urge to drink. I did consume some NA beers nothing too egregious but enough for me to check it. I don't claim to be perfect but NA beers will eventually undermine my ability to stay sober. This is just how I feel obviously not an absolute truth for everyone....* *Isolation:* This was a problem at 30-days for me too. It hasn't improved much **but** my outlook on it has. I've come to terms with it (as best as I can) and I'm not beating myself up for it. I miss my ex terribly as well but it's time for me to focus on myself and if it's meant to be it will be...* *Daydreaming/Dreams:* I had my first drinking dream where I woke up panicked that I had relapsed. It felt like I blacked out and woke up but I realized it was only a dream and it kind of freaked me out. Also I am now romanticizing beer a lot more. Beers I'll miss out on. Not being able to have "just one". I think I'm in the process of coming to terms with this as a life long journey not beating a "previous best". ..* *Sleep:* It's still an issue. I have set up an appointment to help with my anxiety/sleep issues. It's no longer booze lack of exercise etc. There's a genuine problem there...**Positives:** I didn't talk about the positives in my 30-day post so I will here...* *Weight loss/Overall Health:* I'm down 30 pounds in 3 months! I realized I had ballooned up over the years but after losing 30 pounds and still being generally dissatisfied with my weight it hit me how *much* I've gained. I'm working out a lot and started a new fitness regime. I feel healthier and I know not having all those empty calories or binge eating gross food has helped with my weight loss. Feels good (wo)man!..* *New accomplishments:* So I never learned to drive and it made me feel trapped. My mother was nervous about me drinking and driving when I was drinking so much it's nice to have the freedom in terms of the physical ability to get around on my own accord now but also the mental freedom of not having to worry about hurting someone. I've also been working doing some summer courses and exploring this wonderful new province. To think I sacrificed all this for a feeling of a night of bliss along with the subsequent entrapment of guilt sadness and in general apathetic feelings towards myself and my life. A totally new perspective...Overall my life hasn't gotten *"easier"* like it has for some. I've never felt so much pain/anxiety/overwhelming feelings before. But it's great! I'm feeling it. I'm feeling life. I firmly believe nothing in life that's worth it is "easy" so I know I'm on the right track. Thanks for reading this and thanks for allowing me a safe place to learn and express myself. SD is a wonderful place for my sobriety. ..

Congratulations on 90!! Yes I also feel like it hasn't gotten "easier" but I know for sure it's gotten a hell of a lot better! Isn't the weight loss magnificent?! I had a similar situation with the sleep / anxiety / depression but I'm so glad that you're going to look into it. Feels so good to have a fog-free mind and even though some things don't feel good at least we are finally really feeling things. Please keep posting and happy 90 :)
Love Love Love! * I'm feeling it. I'm feeling life.* YES! this is what I'm going to say to myself from now on. Thank you for your post I truly enjoyed it.
Good job keep coming back
