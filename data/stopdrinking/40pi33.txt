I've just passed my 1000 days and have been feeling really solid in sobriety but tonight I had a reminder of how easy it could be for me to relapse...I got two bits of bad news today. The first doesn't affect me directly but a family member. Essentially they had been trusting and generous in managing a shared inheritance and they ended up losing out because of it. I was concerned for them and angry on their behalf but didn't for a  moment feel like I was really off-balance...Then this evening I was at a meeting of a local community group I do a lot of voluntary work for. I organise the meetings I minute the meetings I serve as a director I run their web site I oversee much of their activity. At the meeting it emerged that the group might remain neutral when a local initiative I have been leading for over two years - and into which I have poured an incredible amount of unpaid time effort credibility goodwill etc etc - comes to a vote. I took that in my stride at the meeting I said it was a concern but that we could revisit it at a future point...But by the time I got home I was in turmoil. I had an awful mixed sensation of rejection/anxiety/disappointment and on top of that an anger growing in intensity and self-righteous contempt. My mind raced: *"How can people betray me like this? Is it me? Why am I being rejected? What's the point in trying if people don't appreciate it? No it's them. They're spineless or corrupt or stupid. I tried. Why should I lift a finger for them now? All my good intentions have been ruined. All my efforts have been for nothing. Fuck them. Fuck it. Fuck everything."* And I felt the strongest impulse to drink I've had since my earliest days of sobriety to say *"Fuck everything"* and drown all this anger and disappointment in wine...I didn't of course. Because my first thought after recognising that impulse was *"Well I can't do that anymore so what's my next option?"* My next option was to HALT *(see below for explanation)*. I made a decaff coffee and had a snack. I knew I was angry but realised I was on my own without a sounding board so I reached out to a friend and had a long text chat about it. That made me realise I was probably just as angry about the first bit of bad news I'd had that day and we talked about that a bit. I started to feel better and I knew I wouldn't drink. But I was still angry. Then I saw the Serenity Prayer I have on my wall and realised I had put it there for times like this! And I read it and I realised that the two things I was angry and bitter about are precisely things I cannot change indeed I had been catastrophising them and that I just needed the wisdom to know the difference. Serenity came. I decided a few steps I could reasonably take on each problem and then accepted the rest was out of my hands and that that was almost certainly a good thing :-) I congratulated myself on not having booze in the house on feeling the impulse to drink and dealing with it in the right way and on having put in place the habits and tools to help me...Then I came here and posted this...Now I'm going to have a milkshake or a smoothie I haven't decided :-)..Stay strong sobernauts. We can do this!..---------.**HALT** means asking yourself if you are:..**H**ungry..**A**ngry..**L**onely..**T**ired

Thank you for this post. This is exactly why I have to PRACTICE the program and principles of AA. Having ingrained AA habits and tools at moments like this is a darn good reason to have all that practice. I too have a pretty quick default position of "Fuck it!" which is when I am in jeopardy of misbehaving in a variety of ways. Kudos on immediately using all the right tools!
Great post /u/McCackle and instructive for us all.  Best wishes on both fronts. 
Well done.
Well done! Enjoy the milkshake!
I am so glad that you were able to HALT (isn't that a great tool) and get back on the self-care train. These things do work!
Way to go! Very inspirational. Thank you for sharing. 
Thank you for posting this tonight this has helped me tonight. Thank you. I'm happy you didn't drink
This is helpful thank you for posting this.
Thank you for this very informative post. I haven't experienced days like these (yet) but I know I will. Good to have that friend on speed dail good to speak about your emotions. Saving for future use.
Great post...&gt;Because my first thought after recognising that impulse was "Well I can't do that anymore so what's my next option?" .. I see this all the time here the 'I'm so stressed how do I not drink?!?!?!' and having been there and *not* been there this time around my answer is usually that drinking doesn't necessarily have to be an option for you. Your life isn't constantly at a fork in the road of sober/drink that is a mental construct. It seems as though you recognize the same...&gt;My next option was to HALT..Little tools like this can be huge in coping. Real life can be difficult sometimes and for me being sober as an adult was completely new. In addition to HALT I relied heavily (and still do to a lesser extent) on SMART's ABC's of recovery. .
Well done. 
Right on! Just think: if you had given in those problems would still be here today **and** you'd be hungover on top of it.
