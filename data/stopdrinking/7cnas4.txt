Over the last week I have been cutting back a lot. I feel pretty good but I have been sleeping too much as well. That will probably get better I also struggle with BiPolar so I have been using alchohol as a crutch for energy too often. I decided to cut down as I was just generally feeling awful. The first week was quite good but this weekend I have been having extremely vivid dreams. Anyone else have this? Any way to deal with them? ..I'm not having nightmares but they're hitting some personal spots with me that usually end up with me waking up bawling lol. It's kind of taking its toll on me right now. Any ideas with coping? ..I know dreams are common just wondering if any of you have tips on how to snap out of it when I wake up. Sorry if I'm being a bother! Hope you are all doing well. I have been a long time lurker.

My dream theory:  you have lots of stuff that is bubbling under the surface in your subconscious.  When you stop drinking and pushing it down your brain says okay let's take a look at some of this stuff.  For me my dreams are messages and they are like pieces of art.  I used to do morning pages just stream of consciousness writing 3 solid pages write write write until I'm done.  It helps you get the surface of your thinking calmed down.  
The dreams are normal for me when I'm coming back from a bender. They're so vivid that it really starts to wear you down. I haven't found a way to snap out of it except to stop drinking long enough for them to stop happening...Its a tough road but when sanity is a stake its worth the walk.
