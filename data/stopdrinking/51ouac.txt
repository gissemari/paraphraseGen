Hi everyone. I'm wishing everyone good vibes in the daily fight. After going a year sober I had a terrible relapse 3 months ago and realized I really need a sponsor. I attend AA meetings but don't really have a home one and I'm nervous to ask someone just because I don't feel close with anyone in the program. Any advice? Thanks so much..Rico

I watched listened and learned...I found someone I respected because of their journey their honesty and their humility...There's a saying I think of.  However a sponsor is not a teacher or parent but the concept is similar:.."When the student is ready the teacher appears."..I didn't necessarily feel "close" to my sponsor when I approached him but it grew to that.
I had a couple of people offer when I said I was new.  Right now I just have a 'temp'. I check in with her everyday and I know I can call her if I have an issue. ..Don't be nervous about asking.  Maybe just ask a couple of people to exchange numbers?  Or go to the person who runs the meeting and ask for help?
