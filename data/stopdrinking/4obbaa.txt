I'm not on my 9th step yet but I had to make amends to my homegroup today. I have a service position in the group and have kept quiet about my recent relapse and even picked up a chip when I should not have. I did so at the time because everyone knew my supposed sobriety date and I was afraid they'd notice if I didn't pick it up when I was due. The shame of it was killing me but nobody made a big deal about it today and allowed me to continue my service position...It's going to be great to be able to pick up my chip in a couple of weeks and not be lying.

I bet that's a weight off your shoulders eh? Onwards and upwards :)
I can see how speaking up would put you in a safer place. Now your home group can support you and your not heading deeper into relapse. Thanks for this post. Very helpful.
That was very brave.
