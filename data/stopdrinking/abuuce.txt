Yep but you've posted here. You know what you've done and you know what caused it. Regret is part of the journey by posting you've realised what needs to change and so today is day one. Cliched as it is just look at today and where you're going from here. Stay sober today worry about tomorrow when it comes. IWNDWYT.
