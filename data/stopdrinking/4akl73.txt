Just found this today and made an account to be able to post. I'm 29 drinking problem for 8 years and attempting sobriety the last 4. I am happily married with a 1 year old. Any tips on dealing with family during recovery? My wife has been amazing and understanding and I am struggling with anxiety about how she is doing - seems happy and normal ish since relapse last week but I am having to fight the urge to go all out to make her happy and safe.

I would suggest Alanon for your wife. It is a support group for friends and family of alcoholics. See /r/Alanon. My guess is you wife can take pretty good care of herself. The best thing I did for my family was not drink one day at a time. I was also transparent meaning I did everything I could so my family wasn't afraid I was going to drink. 
Thanks for that - she's done some Alan on in the past and the big thing right now for us is time. We both work and have 12 month old to care for when not working so she wouldn't be interested. I guess I am looking more for specific gestures etc. 
Be sober and reliable to take over baby handling so she can have time to herself. Whether it's sleeping in orbgetting away that counts a lot for new moms. Certainly helped my wife with our two to let her have downtime.
