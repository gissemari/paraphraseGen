Just joined this subreddit and I can already tell you guys are an awesome community. I'm here to ask for advice. I want to stop drinking but I'm struggling because I cannot just cut alcohol out of my life completely. I manage a bar and at this point in my life I cannot change professions so I'm surrounded by alcohol and people drinking pretty much non-stop. Has anyone managed to quit drinking while in my position? Could you throw me some advice?

It can be done.  I know sober bartenders and in NYC there are I believe AA meetings they frequent instead of the after work drinking.....But it will be probably more difficult than if you were in a non drinking environment.    ..You may get some support if you announce your new status as well as some grief  you're not an alcoholic... just cut back  as if that has not been tried.   
My neighbor stopped drinking while she was a bartender. She's been sober 26 years.
