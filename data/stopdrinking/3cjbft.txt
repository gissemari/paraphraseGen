Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Guess what day it is? You [guessed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPxV8eRtxEE) it!..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph:** I've been thinking a lot lately about how much better sobriety feels to me now than it did 345 days ago. A few times this month I've walked right past some of my old liquor stores without even thinking about them. That would have been impossible months ago. My struggles feel more like "real person" struggles and they don't seem so insurmountable and scary. I remember what it was like to wake up sick and hungover and feel like it was totally impossible to face the day. I can't imagine feeling like that now. ..**Struggle:** I'm organizing a big event with friends all of whom know I don't drink. Someone suggested we all "go out for a drink" afterwards. I know the comment has nothing to do with me and they'll totally expect me to come and drink Diet Coke just like I always do but there's a part of me that's pissed off that it was even suggested and I know that's not fair. Will I ever get to a point when someone suggesting "a drink" doesn't kinda piss me off? I know it's my deal and not theirs and it's about being social and not about drinking but there's still a petulant child in me somewhere that resents how much of our social lives revolve around drinking. ..**General Chat:** Drinking dreams - do you have 'em? I had them A LOT in the first few months of sobriety but I don't think I've had one for over six months. I hated them but I did like waking up and realizing it wasn't real. If you have them do they upset with you? How do you deal with them?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

Congratulations /u/cake_or_radish on 345 days!!!..Triumph: My tax debt OfferInCompromise has been received and the IRS lifted their month long levy on my salary;..Struggle: Still struggling with debt and budgets but thankfully it's one day at a time;..General Chat: [What do drinking dreams mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)
a girl gave me her phone number finally(and I didn't even have to ask first!) that's what's up!..that counts as struggle triumph and general chat for me.  nervous about navigating my first sober crush but i will enjoy it and allow life to happen instead of trying to control it.  Maybe I learned something afterall!
**Triumph:** I went to my first big concert sober last night. A supplier for work gave me box seats to see U2. There was an open bar so there was a fair amount of drinking around me but it didn't phase me at all and I had a great time!..**Struggle:**  I'm feeling a little overwhelmed at work lots to do but I keep spinning my wheels and don't seem to get anything done...**General Chat:** I had a lot of drinking dreams early on and sometimes they would really disturb me. I don't have them that much anymore but when I do I just try to accept them for what they are be happy that it wasn't real and move on.
Here we go day 3. I'm not sure I have a lot to categorize yet but here goes. ..**Struggle**: Getting out of bed and moving. Communicating with the outside world. ..**Triumph**: An unexpected lack of extreme cravings although I fear today's long day of work might excite some. My poo is solid and less frequent...**General Chat**: I'm going to check in a few times today. Thank you all for your support. ..Edit: Some mid day thoughts of drinking but I'm committed. I will not drink.
Triumph: this is the first time I've quit drinking and really WANTED to be sober. I wake up excited to not be hung over and I don't make justifications for a possible future of moderated drinking...Struggle: Still feeling overtired and not yet motivated to make the incremental changes I want to as a sober person. But I remind myself that not drinking is the most important change at the moment...General Chat: went to my first alanon meeting last night with a friend. Interested to see where it will take me.
**Triumph:** Got myself a shiny new badge with a 9 in it this morning!..**Struggle:** I really like what you said about "real person" struggles /u/cake_or_radish. I'm struggling with building a new life after quitting my job and moving with my partner to a new city. It's just some real person shit that kind of has nothing to do with alcohol. I feel scared and unsure but also incredibly hopeful. I spent so long just aspiring to be *functional* but now I can actually dream a little bigger. People who say you can have alcohol or you can have everything else are not kidding!..**General chat:** I had a couple of drinking dreams that were completely silly (in one I had one glass of wine and then a baby fell into a fountain and my girlfriend told me she was getting married to a dude) and some that were quite realistic and horrifying. One morning I was near tears thinking about resetting my badge before I realized it was a dream. It's been several months since I had one I think...Hang in there everyone. Happy Wednesday!

Triumph-19 months sober today..Struggle- been done with the steps for about six months now still don't have a sponsee guess I just have to keep working the program and they shall appear...General chat- I've had to travel a lot for work so my workout schedule is all out of whack something else I just need to keep doing
Triumph: I've been drink free for almost 2 weeks now I think... besides the white wine I used to cook some chicken on Saturday. ..Edit: 8 days. Oi. These meds. ..Frustration: It doesn't even have to do with sobriety... but I live in a new state and it's exacerbating my asthma badly. I went in for 2 breathing treatments this week and I'm on a new 12 day round of ass kicking steroids. I guess it's good that they entirely kill my desire to drink because I already feel shitty enough. 
Cakes: 20!  BOOM!..**Triumph**: I kicked *ass* on the tennis court last night.  It was so awesome.  Life has been good generally too...Incidentally I said to friends the other day "Let's go out for a drink."  I knew it meant that they would be drinking alcohol and that I would not be.  Some of them were new friends and didn't know I was sober.  But not one person said anything about the fact that I ordered a pineapple juice.  Now I don't spend every evening in a bar but every once in a while it's no big deal to just hang out with friends.  I tried to reduce alcoholic drinks to "just beverages" and it's hard to get upset about a glass of lemonade right?  So if we want to gather at a coffee shop or a restaurant bar and have some lemonade no big deal...But I want to be clear that this is not something I did early on.  It took a long time of slowly putting myself in "normal situations" before I trusted myself enough to be around drinkers...**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: I have drinking dreams every once in a while (once a month?) now.  But I'm used to them... they don't knock me off my feet anymore.  I usually try to think about how I feel about the dream and maybe if there was anything going on that may have caused me to dream about it.  The last one I had was the night after my wife had been drinking and when we kissed I could really taste the Jim Beam.  It was gross.  And the next night I had a dream where I drank bottles and bottles of the stuff.  Related?  Absolutely.  So I decided that next time I'll ask her to brush her teeth or something...
**Triumph:** I finished a work assignment on time (no hungover last minute scrambling here!) and have successfully maintained my sobriety around a number of people drinking alcohol...**Struggle:** I've come to realize that I've started smoking more weed to compensate for the absence of booze. Starting today sobriety means no mind-altering substances....**General chat:** I'm still quite early on in my sobriety and have yet to have a drinking dream. 
**Triumph** IM SLEEPING!! For the first time since I was a kid I have slept for 3 solid hours without waking myself up. I've been seeing a therapist and she's helped me just unload shit I've never told anyone - as a result - the night terrors are subsiding in intensity and frequency. Alcohol was the way I was forcing myself to sleep before and since quitting I haven't gotten more than 1 hour of sleep at a time .... for ~100 days I've been utterly sleep deprived. TRIUMPH...**Struggle** :( :( :( I lost my fitbit. I'm pretty poor... so I may have to save for a month to get a new one. WHICH SUCKS. This is how I kept my calendar of awesome going. Now the only thing I can log on my calendar is hours of exercise and how many days I've been sober. Missing like 10 data points... ...**Gen Chat** I got to pet dolphins today. So that was awesome.

**Triumph:** I'm working on some recovery-related projects that are going really well...**Struggle:** Lots of feels since Friday. Lost several acquaintances and friends-of-friends to accidents or ODs. It's been unusually cold gray and rainy. My exercise schedule has been thrown off too. I've relied on lots of ice cream and legos to keep me going...**Chat:** After a few drinking dreams mine became abstinence dreams. In one my biggest challenge was finding a working computer so I could post to SD about the urges I was feeling...
**Triumph**: 5 days skin-picking free! I decided I needed to get serious and stop my skin picking 12 days ago it took 7 days before I managed a day without skin picking and now I've strung 5 along in a row! ..This is unprecedented I've picked since I was a teenager. My skin is looking the best I can remember that's not to say it's without blemishes and flaws but that it's intact no wounds or flaky skin. ..**Struggle**: Fighting the skin picking urges. Man they can be strong. ..**General Chat**: Rewiring the brain on thoughts about skin. Learning and sticking to a basic skincare regime. Picked up some tips from /r/CompulsiveSkinPicking and skincare routine tips from /r/SkincareAddiction/ - who knew a  1 tub of vaseline could be so effective. ..I pick when I'm feeling anxious and that's been bad in my sobriety working on CBT presently. Early days staying vigilant. Gloves hydrocolloid plasters face masks staying away from prolonged periods in front of the mirror are some of my defences. Don't touch the face. Skin care not skin attack. 
**Triumph:** today I awoke and accepted that to me my sobriety is mainly a self control challenge. It isn't a forever thing but it could easily end up being a forever thing as time goes on. My current goal will be 90 days but at that point I have a good feeling I will reassess and decide to not have a drink just to drink it on day 91 maybe if an appropriate occasion for a toast or something arises on day 180 or 365  I will have one but I will know my willpower and self control is so much stronger at that point and not have to hold any fear of who I may become after having that drink until then though it is day by day....**Struggle:** with the ability to smoke a bit of weed again (chest injury has resided somewhat) I will have to block out my ultimate and favorite thing about alcohol which is have a bowl with my few drinks and then scarfing down a deliciously unhealthy snack. With the weed in it will be difficult to avoid wanting to add the couple drinks when the hunger comes on for that unhealthy snack but I am empowered everyday more I manage not to add those drinks....**General Chat:** I just graduated with a BA in Economics from a university and have 2 years prior experience in digital marketing/SEO and forming my own department at an ad agency raking in 100k+ revenue from clients after less than 1 year from when I built the department. I currently work in guest services in hospitality though as I had to drop my job at the agency to finish my degree. The agency no longer needs me and I am looking for a salary job more in my field now. I've been considering trying to get on marketing teams for some companies that I enjoy myself and buy from in real life (see Swell Bottles). Any other thoughts on companies that would be a good fit for a person like me or good positions to apply to given my skills/experience?
Triumph: I've made it 15 days without a drink! My head is very clear but I am definitely feeling some deep emotions. ..Struggle: These emotions are tough to deal with. I have been burying a lot of sadness and grief with the death of my father 3.5 months ago. I also struggle with my mind. I am obsessing about drinking/not drinking about every 20 seconds. ..General Chat: Drinking dreams - I've had one so far about a week ago and I woke up feeling guilty. (I guess that's a good sign - I just read "Coolcrosby's" post at the bottom of this page. Cool stuff.
**Triumph:** I'm at the beginning stages of actually growing the f up. And I'm still relatively young so that's exciting. I've wanted to feel confident in myself and be the person who was mature and knew how to handle my shit and this sobering up process and working a program has got me learning how to be that. I don't struggle just to function at a low level I actually plan out my day and accomplish things. I have short term and long term goals. I know I'm on the right path...**Struggle:** I still have bad days and my mind gets covered in a dark cloud sometimes. I've done a good job of keeping that cloud from steering me back to a bottle but it still causes wreckage. I see that now. My coping mechanism is complete isolation and shutting people out or refusing to let go of whatever got me upset in the first place no matter how insignificant (often putting my emotions on display for those who had nothing to do with it in hopes of winning their sympathy). I'm working the steps with a sponsor so that I can get past this type of response/behavior...**General Chat:** I've had a lot of drinking dreams. A week or two ago I had a drinking dream every night for 5 days straight. They varied in nature but the theme was relapse. I haven't relapsed and this is my first attempt at sobriety so I think my mind was working out the idea. Personally I don't like them. They're more like nightmares than dreams and I wake up feeling like I really did relapse or at least wanted to. It's confusing. I've learned to not let them change my waking actions but recognize them as a sign of my mental state. Too many drinking dreams = no bueno.
Sober today as I drive to seattle and see a beautiful city  can't wait to eat stuff.
**Triumph:**  2.5 days working on day 3 without a drink....**Struggle:** I still have the urge.  I feel depressed constantly and have trouble focusing.  Also not sleeping well.  I made an appointment with a psychiatrist in a couple weeks to hopefully improve some of these....**General Chat:**  Since I have stopped drinking I have had some really messed up dreams that wake me up a lot.  No drinking dreams that I can remember.

Triumph: Well I made my way back here. ..Struggle: Divorce kicking my ass. It's hard enough without...the humiliating fact that I love him to pieces and he doesn't love me. ..General chat: I think lack of patience is at the root of all my problems. I am so impatient. Sobriety is hard because the only way to get days under your belt is to...get days under your belt. I want to have 100 days now and I know that 100 days from now I'll be glad I was patient but it's hard to do the waiting. 
Triumph: Today I am one month sober! Feels good man. I am just taking each day as it comes and telling myself that I won't be drinking today. I was also at a 4th of July party over the weekend along with friends I used to drink with and I only had non-alcoholic ginger beer. What a difference that made. I didn't have to worry about waking up in a strange location...Struggle: I am trying to regulate my sleeping schedule. It's been a challenge to fall asleep when I'm so used to just passing out. I've probably been drinking too much coffee as a result so I'm gonna have to keep an eye on that...
Sorry in advance for the essay. I haven't shared much lately so I'm getting it all out of my system. :P..Triumph: My dissertation is happening. I can make eye contact with my research advisors. Sometimes we have misunderstandings where they think I don't realize something that I do realize and it doesn't bother me because I am confident in my growing expertise and ability to finish the project. I don't really recognize my life in this respect. I look forward to the chance to discuss my research with people who can help me rather than being constantly afraid and bluffing and skipping meetings. I remember spending a long time in the bathroom just trying to physically look and smell not-hungover before engaging with anyone professionally and nevermind knowing what the hell to talk about. Making mistakes and having some ignorance as a student does not bother me nearly as much now because I know I'm trying my best. When I quit drinking I had to take a break to focus on recovery so there were 3-4 months during which I was not drinking but not "trying my best" either. I like this development...Struggle: There's someone who used to be a part of my life (on and off again and now ex romantic partner of my father's who I have known for about 20 years) who has been both a good influence on me and also a big source of pain. She is the type of person that no one can ever do quite enough for but this is expressed so subtly that you'd feel insane to be offended by it. I have a lot of resentment towards her about the way she's treated my dad and me in the last 10 years. She doesn't reach out to me very much yet I always feel guilt for not communicating with her. Can't really tell how much of this is my fault and how much I have been sincerely wronged (omitting details here on purpose) and I guess it doesn't matter which it is really. ..I got a text message from her about a week ago that I've been too afraid to even read. She has been complaining to my dad about me not sending her a birthday card two months ago and even asked him to ask me to send her a belated one (??). I feel like I want to give her a chance and talk to her but I'm afraid if I get into it with her now I will handle it poorly. We haven't been in touch since well before I quit drinking. Ugh. I guess I could start by reading her message...General: This week I had my first drinking dream in a few months. I've really only had a handful since I quit. It took me a while after waking up to remember the dream - I had bought a hollow glass "pencil" in a souvenir shop and filled it with liquor then drank it out of the pencil later. Maybe ~1 shot in the whole tube. I think it was some sort of clandestine drinking novelty item. Or maybe it was a decorative item and I just chose to use it for absurd booze rituals. We'll never know. ..Anyway I drank it got tipsy and just sat there in my dream crying. I hated the feeling. I never used to understand people who said they didn't like drugs because they hated losing control... but when I got tipsy in my dream I was terribly unsettled; I wanted to be in control of my body. Funny I never really felt that IRL. Maybe I got to where I didn't notice. Either way the dream drink sucked. I spent a lot of time rationalizing in my dream about why I didn't really need to tell anyone what had happened and feeling disappointed and afraid. I mentioned this at a meeting and someone told me "Your old life has become your nightmare." Yeah no kidding. O_O I'm even a lightweight in my dreams. Not complaining. ..I can relate /u/cake_or_radish to the resentment about a drinking invitation. A friend who knows I quit drinking just invited me for dinner "and beer if you are currently drinking." I don't believe the message is malicious (I accepted just the dinner part) and I can't really explain logically why it makes me feel terrible. I guess there is some jealousy and frustration. But this is why I isolated myself so cautiously for the first few months - so I could get back on my feet and navigate situations like this mindfully. Good luck with your outing.
Triumph: Two days sober and started making plans for a sober weekend!..Struggle: Just found out I have a minor eye infection. Doctor offered me a note to keep me out of work for the next 2 days because it's contagious. My scumbag brain was instantly deciding how much beer to buy for a 4 day weekend. Dammit brain; we have sober plans! Declined the note and asked if it was ok to go to work she said sure just wash your hands and don't touch the eye...General chat: Sleeping has been a struggle partly from itchy eye partly from racing mind. Haven't had a drinking dream yet not looking forward to that.
.Struggle &amp; triumph : I really feel like an afternoon glass of wine.... But I'm at the gym instead. 
Triumph:  For the last couple of months I've been busting my ass on a short term contract filling in as an employment counsellor. It was a pretty steep learning curve but it's paid off. My contract was extended for another month and I have a bunch of happy clients that were finally approved yesterday...Struggle:  So my ex-girlfriend &amp; I broke up the day after we both admitted that we were falling in love with each other. She broke up with me scared of falling in love. Well she posted an article about casual love the other day essentially if in a relationship and there's falling in love that it shouldn't automatically be assumed that now it's time to move in together or that there's going to be talk of marriage and kids. That the two people shouldn't assume that they're The One if love is mentioned. And there should be a mature conversation about what falling in love means with each other. ..Well why the hell couldn't she have read that article while we were still together? Why couldn't we have that conversation? Why did she have to run away immediately after the word love happened? It sucks. Today sucked. I'm still working through the break up...General Chat: I just had a drinking dream last night. I dreamt that I was drinking a Palm Bay and I didn't realize there was alcohol in it until half-way through the can. I was all apathetic about it in my dream and kept drinking. ..I know that's what would happen if I were to take one sip. Despite the break up struggles I am definitely not going to drink today...Have a good 24.
Triumph: I'm out of town on a business trip. Graciously turned down repeated offers of really nice scotch at a bar + at coworkers house...Struggle: Going back to the bar tonight (not my idea obviously :)) (and staying with said scotch-offering coworker). I'm in a good place though -- I had no pangs of regret last night. I've *got* this...General: I think I did have some the other night! I typically don't remember my dreams very long they fade soon after waking so I'm not sure :)
Triumph: At the start of the year I would have this feeling that every nice meal I had was incomplete because I couldn't have a drink with it.  I don't feel that way anymore...Struggle: I miss going to the bar after work on Friday...General Chat: I haven't had a drinking dream for a few weeks.  I never got any better at dealing with them.  I'd wake up think I was hungover and sometimes it would take hours for me to realise that I didn't drink the night before.  Not because I drank so regularly just because I'm an idiot in the mornings.  That was something that I thought was going to disappear when I stopped drinking.
**Triumph:** I have a ride *and* a babysitter set up so I can go to my **first meeting** tomorrow!! ..**Struggle:** I drank a beer last night. One of many slip-ups in the past month after about 5 months of sobriety. I feel just kicked to death and lost. I'm very depressed...**Chat:** My drug/drinking dreams are infrequent but awful and very upsetting. I *really feel high* and end up doing something really horrible. Sometimes it takes awhile to calm down from them but it's a relief beyond words that it isn't real. ..And I'm so nervous about the meeting that I'm going to puke my pants but I'm going anyway no matter what. It is TIME to get serious. Love to you all.
Triumph: I host an open-bar reception each week (as part of my job). I drank club soda this week. Usually I kill 2-3 glasses of wine then keep drinking when I get home...Struggle: Keeping this for the long haul...General Chat: No drinking dreams yet.
Triumph: The scale hesitated below 230 pounds this morning I was at 280 when I quit a little over a year ago...Struggle: I had a difficult start to the week.  Going to call a counselor tomorrow researched them today...General Chat: I'm not very good with reddit formatting and I don't really care yet. =P  Y'all with the bling and the style are pretty cool though.
