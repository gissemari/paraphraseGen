Hey guys!! Hey guys!! Guess what day it is? [You know it!](http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/94098-Hump-Day-Camel-Meme.png)..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: Difficult conversations: I'm having 'em! A lot of my drinking centered around isolation conflict avoidance and passive acceptance. I'm finding that those types of behaviors don't really work with trying to live an outward-facing life when one of my goals is to build connections with others natch. I'm slowly getting better at bringing up issues when they happen as opposed to spinning in my heads for days or weeks (or forever). I'd been procrastinating a difficult conversation because I was projecting all kinds of horrible outcomes but it turned out better than I could have hoped. Triumph!..**Struggle**: I'm mad at myself for waiting so long to have the above conversation. I am beginning to suspect that I will *always* be the kind of person who spins about things in their head. Maybe I thought that quitting drinking would chill out my brain. There's a chance it has a little but I still feel like I spend waaayy too much time parsing situations conversations and actions trying to find some kind of resolution or grand unified theory of my life. My therapist keeps telling me I could do a better job of just "putting a pin" on certain things and letting them sit without overthinking them to death but I'm finding it hard. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of "[unique snowflake](http://trollcats.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/why_so_mean_trollcat.jpg)" that has more struggles than most and I know that can be a dangerous thought road to explore. ..**General Chat**: July! Do you guys have any routines or habits to mark the beginning of the month? I try to say "[Rabbit Rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_rabbit_rabbit)" before I even get out of bed. Oh how did you spend [yesterday's leap second](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33313347)?..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!

Hiya  cake_or_radish..Triumph: wife told me our favorite brew pub is having a special on 65 oz growlers (she doesn't yet know i'm on a stop drinking quest).  i calmly told her that i think we should skip it 'cause i'm trying to cut out alcohol to lose weight.  let's stay home and hump instead...Struggle: my favorite brew pub is having a special on 65 oz growlers of my favorite beer! oh well fckit. small price to pay for no hangover and feeling this good...General Chat:  anyone here into mmorpg's?  i'm building one and may go to kickstarter to fund it sometime next year. ..Have a great hump day.  Join me in staying sober for the next 24 hrs.

I'll bite!..**Triumph:** I met a buddy for lunch today who I have been really really nervous to be around. We've been buddies for years but our entire friendship has been drinking. Honestly the closest we ever have been to hanging out sober is when we were at his beach house and we woke up had coffee and were drinking beers by 11am. Anyway I was worried he'd be in the "drinking buddy" category and I was worried about losing him. Anyway I told him the entire story and he was super cool. We've made plans for a couple weekends from now and I honestly think we'll be able to have a friendship that doesn't revolve around drinking...**Struggle:** Qantas had a crazy insane sale where a return trip from Melbourne - LA was $600AUD. 1/3 of what it normally is and even less than 1/2 of the best price I've ever gotten.  I was able to coordinate dates with parents who will be in Palm Springs at that time my friends who live in LA and even got confirmation via Facebook that my [favourite musical](http://www.experiencecarrie.com) is back for a limited engagement and would be playing when I was booking.  Booked didn't get a confirmed ticket. Waited on live chat with the booking agency for two hours only to get an email saying it was a pricing error and Qantas wouldn't honour the fares. My parents were really really upset they wouldn't be seeing me. I was really really upset BUT I didn't drink!..**Struggle 2 (I initially had this as General Chat and it's way more a struggle):** My work is going through a massive re-structure and I found out today that my team is moving to a new division and reporting to a new director. Now I'm not one of those people who love (or hate) their job it pays well and the people are nice but I don't get much out of the actual work. Anyway through all this change over these past 50 days my job has been the one constant. I've actually enjoyed going to work because I can go just do something I'm good at and not deal with all my shit! It's kind of crazy that this has to change too... But I guess that's just what the universe wants for me. Also I could be losing it so I guess this is a triumph even though it doesn't feel like one...**General Chat:** I just got a WiiU because I have a lot of time on my hands. I'm loving Mario Kart 8 and liking Splatoon. Can anyone suggest some fun games? I like Mario type games the most hence why getting the WiiU..Happy Wednesday Friends!..Edit: Obvious grammar errors probably still not perfect.
**Triumph**: I'm just starting my journey to a happier and healthier (alcohol-free) life and I'm at a place where I can make some big changes. I've always said that I wanted to earn my PhD so why not now? Yesterday I made the decision that I'm going to do it. I'm scared but also excited. .**Struggle**: Because my undergrad degree is over 10 years old and my grad degree is almost 5 years old I'm going to have to re-take some prerequisite classes as well as the GRE. It'll probably add at least a year to my plan. It made me want to say "fuck it forget it I'm too old" and honestly I'm still struggling with this feeling. But if I don't do it now then I probably never will. Maybe this will be a good opportunity to continue to work my job (which I love but the pay is only OK) and save money? I've almost paid off all my student loans and the thought of taking on more is painful. Additionally I'm currently staying at a friend's place and the thought of having to get a roommate is unnerving and a potential detriment to my sobriety and anger issues. .**General Chat**: I grew up relatively religious but as I progressed in my science degrees I found myself questioning things more and more. For the past two years I've identified as "very atheist" (which I only admitted to a handful of people) but lately some weird shit has been going on that makes me want to re-evaluate my take on things. Is this a just newly-sober euphoria? Is someone trying to tell me something? Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this? 
Hello Friends    .**Triumph:** Life...I've positioned myself at my job for comfortable living. My GF and I are getting a place together in Aug. My two kids are going to come "live" with me for the rest of the summer (opposed to a couple of weeks at a time). Life is generally good.    .**Struggles:** Still paying the cost of my previous DUIs. Its affecting getting a better job and even the place I get approved to live. I will keep moving forward and focus on my blessings. I'll be alright though its just annoying.    .**general chat:** Sorry I've been away. It's been a while since I have had a free morning. As I know and have to relearn you have to make time or life will swallow you in events. I'll be around more. Life is still good but have to say I missed you all.     ..
Triumph: Day 3 of no drinking! Also haven't had coffee in 5 days. ..Struggle: Access to the Vie De France restaurant in my building makes it too easy to get a drink. Also I like using booze to fill my boredom loneliness pass time have the warm and fuzzies not care about feeling like a failure...General Chat: My weight loss was slightly derailed yesterday as I ate everything in site. But back to 1200 today. Cant wait to get back to 130s so I can attract the type of guy I want to again feel lighter on my feet and wear all my lovely clothes without looking like a stuffed sausage...I'm okay today but work is getting on my nerves. Wish I could win the lottery or otherwise make heaps of money so I could say to hell with some of these crazy peeps I work with. 
**Triumph:** I never thought I could enjoy a weekend sober but I did it!..**Struggle:** People in my life have kind of hinted at the fact that maybe I'm less fun when I'm sober- I'm more in my head and less present. However they feel they still support my decision to be healthy. I just need to work on getting out of my head naturally...**General Chat:** I am on vacation for two weeks so I am super excited! I am reading and working through a book to help me figure out why I had/have the drinking habits I do and how to change my way of thinking. I'm excited for this sober vacation! Maybe I'll actually get things done!
**Triumph**: Life is great.  Great tennis.  Great relationships.  Work is busy.  Feeling pretty good about life in general...**Struggle**: I've got nothing...**General Chat**: Wow!  July already?  Something big is happening later this month but I can't quite put my finger on it.  365-338!  BOOM!
Triumph: In less than 24 hours I will be in Atlanta with 60000 fellow sober alcoholics loving life!!!!! Will I see you there?!..Struggle: I wanna say nothing comes to mind but to be total honest family and boys per usual...General chat: attending the international conference is totally new but I am excited to start July this way!
**Triumph** SO MANY THIS WEEK! I GOT PROMOTED! I GOT A RAISE! I WENT OUT TO MY OLD FAVORITE BAR FOR TRIVIA NIGHT AND HAD A BLAST SOBER!!! MY HUSBAND SAID HES PROUD OF ME AND APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY FOR HIS REACTION WHEN I CAME OUT TO HIM. So so much awesome this week. ..**Struggle** Honestly I feel peaceful. ..**General Chat** Damnit my ankle is STILL messed up. I went to the doctor and he said it would be a few weeks until I feel better. I've been relying on reading and knitting to keep  me busy -- MAN do I miss running!!!!! 
**Triumph:** Things are good. I've been searching for a new yoga class and may have found a good one. Making progress on house projects work projects life projects...**Struggle:** Not much. I could whine but that's all it would be.....**Chat:** July?! Time goes too fast! Realizing that another month is gone and all the things I wanted to do are still undone is how I mark the beginning of the month.
**Triumph:** Happy Canada day to my fellow canucks!! I started the day with an early morning 75k bike ride and this afternoon we have a BBQ with family. It's going to be a good day...**Struggle:** Nothing life is good right now...**General Chat:** I'm a sysadmin so luckily the leap second was a non-event for me. Habits or routines? I like to wake up every day and be awesome :)
**Triumph**: I'm on day 2 and I haven't relapsed yet...**Struggle**: I'm realizing how screwed up my life is right now...**General Chat**: Do you guys have any success stories? I really need some encouragement right now. 
**Triumph**: Made it through another cottage trip with no drinking. It feels great to wake up at 7am at the cottage and go for a run ending it off with a dive into the lake. Having a coffee and watching your hungover friends wake up and struggle makes me really happy I don't feel like that in the mornings any more...**Struggle**: I quit smoking 10 months ago yesterday. But the people I go to the cottage with ALL smoke. I get really tempted to smoke there so that was a bit of a struggle but its all good. ..**General Chat**: Its Canada Day! No work! I'm heading out to a BBQ and the sun is shining when it was supposed to be raining. 
Triumph: I too am having those difficult conversations; I'm only half way into my 10th day sober though so I guess that's to be expected. So far my wife and most of my family know and I have a list of my close friends that I've been checking off one by one. I try to make at least one call per day. So far every one of the conversations has ended up being a huge positive move forward lots of air clearing and such. Good stuff though awkward and sometimes a bit painful...Struggle: Honestly far less than I expected. Sure I'm had some cravings but they were relatively easy to get through. One struggle I guess has been an increase in my appetite since I stopped and since one of my main goals is losing the weight that alcohol put on me in the first place this is troubling...General chat: I have literally never felt like I do now in terms of such a complete mindset change in such a short time. I'm focused energized motivated my musical writer's block is going away... it's been amazing so far. ..Day 10 is going great and I look forward to a sober day 11. Happy hump day everyone!
Preface: Every Wednesday since I came back to my hometown about 2 months ago Wednesday has always been my "Public Drinking Day" i.e. My parents knew I had a "few" drinks Wednesday evening. In reality it was going to collect Social Welfare and go into the off licence in the morning have a few drinks when parents are at work and usually Mum would pick me up an 8 big cans on her way home from work. I tell her it lasts till Friday but it would be gone in 2 hours! Drinking alone in my room...**Triumph**..* Went for Social Welfare and walked straight past the off licence I would have went into at 11 o'clock every other Wednesday morning. The guy who works there even called out to me to say "Hi!" to his favourite regular! *Extremely difficult to keep walking*. .* Had the most productive graduate job hunt since leaving college to distract me from morning pints. .* Have all my money!.* Acne breakouts have calmed down. May or may not be related to alcohol.....**Struggle**..* It is only my third day sober and I am craving alcohol really bad now especially as this day and time every other week I would have 6 or 7 drinks finished..* Cousin/Best friends party this weekend. It is going to be a "Lads Night Out". .* **THIS IS NOT EASY**..**General Chat**..* Made Cold Brew Coffee last night for breakfast this morning. Jesus everybody needs to get on this cold brew hype! Better than beer for breakfast.
#Triumph:.I pulled four american plates today. Conventional stance because sumo is cheating tights and illegal undies and socks because rules are meant to be broken. ..#Struggle:.Unbillable at work which is stressful. I need to extricate myself from a sick meeting that's been circling the drain. I need to have a hard convo with the chair. I need to not swoop in like fuckin' Batman and save it when I have other responsibilities...#General:.I went to The Big Meeting in NYC on Sunday. It was a hell of a meeting truly. Good stuff all around. Should have also checked out Pride. Fun thing: my first ever political act was collecting signatures and petitioning the MA legislature to allow same sex marriage back in high school. The Supreme Court decision on that count last week felt pretty fuckin' cool.
Day 24. Feels easier and harder every day. Love who I am now and treating people a lot better in general. No toxins making my temper flare up. Still a lot of work to do on my self but easier without the drink. At he same time I feel excluded from events because I don't drink and find myself feeling weak that I can't handle the drink. I'm rebounding but the hate I have for myself (who I was) comes back often tempting me to drink. To escape. To not feel. I think the feelings are the worst and yet the best. I know it's gonna take a lot of work to get through them. Anyways I doubt anyone is reading this but it feels good just to let it out SD. Hard for me to express myself to actual people but easy on a random Internet forum. 
Triumph: got straight As no idea how. Also took my son miniature golfing. We usually just hang out with neighbors' kids walk around the neighborhood or go to the park when there are not many people there due to my anxiety (which yes I feel horrible about since it limits my kid's social exposures and puts everything on my husband to take our kid out to fun places on his days off) so getting out and going somewhere so busy was a big deal...Struggle: I'm physically and emotionally worn out. Doesn't help that I'm sick and somehow twisted my knee but I'm overall pretty pissy and need to learn how to cope with my frustration rather than just shutting down on everyone around me. Also I'm terrified of applying for transfer to a university. I've gotten along okay at the school I'm at now since they offer so many online courses for working students and parents. I'm one class away from my Associates and two away from completing my transfer requirements haven't even looked at application dates and I'm terrified of applying and getting turned down. My GPA is crap due to my grades when I first started at this school years ago and even with getting mostly As this past year the GPA reflects pretty poorly on me. ..General Chat: I'm kind of worried about the carpenter bee that lives in the corner of my balcony roof... Haven't seen him in a while and the hole he burrowed is now full of wasps :( Do wasps eat bees?
**Triumph:** I haven't been this happy in ages.  So many things have been falling into place for me it feels unreal and I am happy and scared that it can't last.  I love my home I like my jobs I am falling into a new (and healthy!) relationship and everything just seems to be working out...**Struggle:** That back-home trip that has been looming is drawing closer.  Next Wednesday I check in I will be back in the midwest close to all my family and friends the majority of which are addicts of one sort or another.  I don't feel so much a struggle right now but I need to make a plan to stay solid while I am out of my comfort zone.  ..Also I am struggling with letting go of responsibility of other people... I am responsible for only my own actions and emotions and I need to remind myself of this constantly...**General Chat:** I do the Rabbit Rabbit thing when I think of it!   But I am also trying to break away from ritualistic habits.  I'm too much of a perfectionist and have to let some things go otherwise I feel if I don't do something perfectly (remembering rabbit rabbit each month never ever ever drinking changing all my bad habits at once in a ritualistic manner...) I go into a spiral.  But hey "rabbit rabbit"
Triumph : Still sober still feeling committed...Struggle: My eating is still bad - I'm still restricting and binging which is frustrating. It's the one thing I feel is holding me back from feeling content sober - I'm still dealing with my demons through the old addiction. This one has been so hard to get rid of. I wish I knew how to deal with it. 
**Triumph:** I know that drinking will not help any situation. It will not be good and will only make the situation and my life worse. I have repeated it enough to myself that it has become an ingrained mantra. My brain automatically starts spewing out counter-arguments for when I get tempted to drink. My thought process used to be trained to automatically discourage quitting drinking...**Struggle:** Not so much of a struggle as it is something to be very careful about. I will be visiting my cousin shortly who still drinks and smokes and he was a partner in crime.  ..**General Chat:** (non-drinking specific struggle) While I have somewhat better control/stability of my emotions depression is still center stage. I am longer pulling a curtain of numbness provided by alcohol to block it from view. I don't see how anyone can hope for life to improve. There are no more good jobs for someone like me and I therefore no future. America and the world at large have no place in it for poor uneducated idiots like me.
