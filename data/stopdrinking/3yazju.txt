Yesterday I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3y7xqk/wow_christmas_is_actually_the_fucking_worstbarely/?ref=share&ref_source=link) post. As you can tell I was in a pretty bad place. I've struggled with depression my whole life but yesterday it was on a new level. I felt like I was losing my mind. Thanks to all your support and a fuckload of my own determination and willpower I made it through sober and I'm in a better mindset today. I don't think I could have done it without this sub. Thank you.

Huge victory.
Great news. Really happy for you. Imagine the difference if things went south compared to how your feeling now. This kind of thing pays of big time in rewiring our brain.
Good on you for hanging in there. That shit Christmas past is now a solid part of your ongoing recovery plan. Life throws shitty days at all of us. Dealing with the worst days head on and sober makes the rest of the lesser problems a breeze. Drinking made me put my problems on hold but they would multiply while I was drunk.Being sober has not made my life perfect by any means but it has made it a lot easier. Keep up the great work.
That is amazing motivation for anybody struggling!  This too shall pass. 
Great work. I'm so glad you're still here with us :).
Beautiful job! I've been where you were yesterday and it hurts like hell. You are a badass!!!
Brilliant.
