So I am now experiencing my ninth full day sober!  I must say the challenge has been much different than I thought it would be but I am still cruising along enjoying being clear minded well rested  and generally much happier.  Being drunk was the worst and it stuck to me even when I wasn't drinking.  I was always so short fused so angry.  I realize now that being drunk was the only really fun part but everything leading up to drinking like rationalizing it working to pay for it arguing and justifying my way through such a shitty lifestyle just so I could continue to hurt myself was pretty much hell.  That was before I even had a drink and let's not forget the next day of guilt shame and a head full of fog.  My body wanting to just stay in bed.  Depression low self worth and the inability to open myself up to those who mean the most to me.  So why would I even get a craving?  Clearly there is no upside to drinking again right?  Well I guess my urges exist because I'm still trying to fill the void.  I have so much more time now which is great!  I am slowly finding things again that I could enjoy before I met alcohol.  Experiencing what I remember of my sober past.  I used to be so creative and I am allowing that part of me to flourish again.  I guess the reason for this post (aside from checking in) is to share with all of you the greatest tool I've found for myself in the early part of my recovery:  emotional creativity!  Whether you like art music theatre poetry etc doesn't matter we all like something.  Embrace the sublime challenge yourself to see beauty everywhere and especially learn to see the pain that surrounds all of us.  Most art comes from pain and ridding yourself from addiction helps to prepare you for what I call "realistic pain".  I don't hide from it anymore.  In fact I want to help those who crusade against it.  When I first quit drinking I thought I was doing it for me but I am starting to realize that it is more than that.  It isn't just about being sober there's more work than that.  Sober people can still be real jerks but for me being sober is what has been giving me better tools to be a better person. I can actually contribute something to the world now that has real meaning.  I can influence my community and be proud.  I can help other people while I get healthy myself.  So cravings?  What cravings?  Yes it is the weekend.  I'm gonna have to find something to do other than my old rituals.  I will not be drinking this weekend.  I have a date with my separated wife on Monday.  She left our residence after Christmas because I wouldn't stop drinking (she has been trying to get sober since last year and kept relapsing because of me) and I honestly thought me stopping now would be too little too late.  BUT IT ISN'T!!!!  I am taking her out to dinner and I'm so happy that I have that to look forward to while I'm working at a bar/restaurant for the next three nights.  I'm going to save all of my money not drink a sip and be the new sober me going forward.  So I got sober for myself it's what everyone says you have to do (I agree) but can I ask a question?  Is it selfish or a set back to also be getting sober for a relationship?  I mean one of my biggest sources for encouragement and well being is the relationship I'm trying to save.  My wife could have filed papers but she kept putting it off hoping I could get better.  When I told her I was a week sober she didn't even believe me.  But eventually she came by to see for herself and having been through alcohol recovery she knew I was being honest.  She saw all of the signs.  She is incredibly proud of me and I think I may have one chance left to make things right with her.  This is a big reason why I will not be drinking.  I hope that it is okay.  Thanks for listening I love all of you amazing people in this community!.

Congratulations! I too had to find things to do to distract myself from urges. And I prepared for days when I knew I would have major urges like Fridays. Thanks for sharing!
