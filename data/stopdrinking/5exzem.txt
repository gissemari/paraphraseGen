Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening fellow sobernauts! I made the deadline-ish for the day sccoorrreeee..**Theme:**  The Journey - reality gratitude outlook..**QuoteS:** [visual](http://imgur.com/TMI4JEF)..."What? You too? I thought that no one but myself..." - C.S. Lewis. .."The struggle ends when gratitude begins" - Neale Donald Walsh.    .."The round pegs in square holes. The ones who see things differently.  They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for status quo. You can *quote* them disagree with them glorify or vilify them. " -Jack Kerouac..**What THEY mean to me:** I know I hit you all with the trifecta today. But all of these spoke to me when I was looking for what to post. The CS Lewis quote is how I felt in the beginning of my journey - a special snow flake. Coming here made me feel less alone and that people can relate. My struggles weren't my own and there are people who have been through what I'll was going through and actually survived. It is one of the greatest gifts I've ever had - a reality check :)..Throughout my life I've gone through a copious amount of things; a lot related to you my drinking addiction. So the second quote speaks to me personally. I'm still working on it but I am getting more and more grateful for the struggles I've been through. At first it was hard to say "I am grateful for XYZ I did (horrible things) while drunk I'm grateful for the divorce I'm grateful for going to jail... etc". Those are really hard things to except let alone be grateful for. However I am. If it wasn't for [all](http://imgur.com/rcgFcvw) the bad I wouldn't understand how good I have it right now - even if it's not where exactly I want to be. I would still be struggling to know who I was where I belong belittling & tearing myself down mentally emotionally physically spiritually treating myself poorly treating others worse and just existing instead of living. ..The third quote is something I need to practice in my life. Not only do I do it to friends and family but I also do it to people I see everyday randomly at the grocery store or perhaps in an AA meeting. I define them. Nothing/no one is neither good or bad until I decide it so. I am a round peg in a square hole. Who am I to judge others? We are all just people trying to figure things out my mind gives them the power on how they will or will not effect me & I need to choose wisely....[High Five](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg) ..& Happy Saturday!

Like these! Are you the official quotemaster now? If so congrats! Happy and sober Saturday to you and all here.
Great post.  Thanks Red for taking the time to do this.  I disagree though.  I think you are more of a square peg in a round hole. ;)
