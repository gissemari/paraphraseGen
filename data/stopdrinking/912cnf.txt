Longest I've made it in a couple months. After day 2 I've really wanted to pick up a bottle every single night (fri sat and today) but told myself to think about how good I'll feel once I hit 7 days. To think of my body being able to dry out and my brain to start functioning semi normally again. I think the last time I made it through an entire 7 days was a year ago when I had to because of antibiotics I was on. Still every night has been a struggle of eating a ton and smoking a lot of weed. Still better than booze. .. I also can't remember the last time I made it through a whole weekend. So I'm very proud of myself for that :) I went out to lunch or dinner with my family every night woke up this morning to go to church and have been productive around the house. Still I feel like I'm just scraping by until Wednesday when I can drink since my 7 days will be over :/..Being sober for the last 5 days has made me very aware of how I have no friends no hobbies and really don't get joy out of anything. I know it's all because of alcohol so why am I looking forward to Wednesday? To wake up with a hangover Thursday? Ugh. The only way I made it 5 days is that I told myself I can't stop by the liquor store on the way home from work. I almost never want to leave my house once I'm home for the night after a long day. I could go to the liquor store later on or get delivery but it would be rare for me to do that.  Also telling myself that I CAN drink tomorrow if I want to- one night sober seems much less daunting- helps me stay sober for the night. ..It's a journey guys. Alcohol has completely fucked with my mind and outlook on life but while I'm sober at least I can get happiness out of the little things. IWNDWYT

i'm wondering what it would be like is you just decided to add another week and see how it goes? I started with 30 and am still with it. Next goal one year. but of course the main goal is today. if you haven't already it might be a good time to start reading some of the books in  the side bar. your perspective about what short and long term goal you will pursue for this life of your might do some positive shifting. congrats on 5 days! that is huge! and i can tell you it does get easier! i w n d w y t.
