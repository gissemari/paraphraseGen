I'm struggling.  I have recently come to terms with the fact that I am without a doubt an alcoholic.  Yikes.  Ok.  I'm simply not even sure what to do or if I even am "fixable." Adding to this issue I have an extremely difficult time talking about my problem.  Such a difficult time in fact that I have isolated myself from nearly everyone in my life over the last few months.  I have been sinking deeper and deeper into my alcoholism and depression....while "keeping up appearances" of course.  Ha.  ...For more on how well that is working out see "i've caught my GF sneaking drinks too many times" -- or something of that sort composed by my boyfriend who I think is beginning to suffer more than I am from all of this.  He's the one who has encouraged me to reach out here.  I apologize I'm entirely new to reddit (aside from cat pics/videos) :)  .I really do want to stop drinking.  I've done some counseling in the past and I've tried AA.  AA is hard for me emotionally and geographically because I live in a relatively small community. I have honestly never really connected to anyone (despite the 20+ meetings I've been to) and break down crying after nearly every meeting.  Which makes me want to follow up with a drink naturally.  Most importantly like I said before it is so unbelievably difficult for me to talk about my problem.  ....So I think my most important question is how do I open up? I know I need to open up to some family and friends because I honestly think I do not have any chance of recovery without some support system.  I should mention I have an amazing family and group of friends.  I'm just so ashamed/disappointed in myself I don't even know where to begin to ask for their help....Thanks for reading/listening.  Any guidance would be truly wonderful (and potentially life-changing) at this point...

&gt;if I even am "fixable"..You are not beyond repair...I wasn't a broken down car in need of being scrapped at the junk yard. I was a struggling complex human being in the midst of a terrible addiction. I needed support education rehabilitation tough love competent care and a safe place...I found that in rehab. I started reaching out bit by bit. I got sober at 25 years old and my life has gotten so much better...I stick to simple scripts when I start talking to people about my problem. My conversation might look like this I'd probably pick the closest friend/family member first...I have been struggling with something...I am very scared to tell you...When I tell you I will probably cry but I *need to finish what I am saying because it is important to me*..I drink more than I want to. This is my first step in reaching out...I need from you (whatever that is it might just be a hug)
&gt;Ok. I'm simply not even sure what to do or if I even am "fixable."..Hi and welcome!  Glad you are here.  If I may make a couple of quick points for you:..First you are definitely "Fixable"!  Whatever you have done in your first 26 years is absolutely meaningless in terms of moving forward from today and beginning a life of recovery.  I understand why you might thing that you are not fixable or worth the time to even try.  I know I most definitely thought the same way.  Because of that I put off for years actually trying to fix myself.  I wasted so much time; inflicted additional unnecessary damage; and almost killed myself.  I am jealous that at 26 you are starting this path now...Second you have actually started this path by posting here today.  Oh I am sure you have a long way to go (we all do) but you have taken a proactive step to start being honest and getting better.  Recovery is all about moving forward...not sitting still or living in the past.  If you can move forward a little bit every day you can absolutely change your life...As for "opening up."  Think of it like a habit or skill just like everything else.  Some people are really good at it and some people suck at it.  So you suck at it right?  Does that mean that you can't do it?  Of course not.  It means you have to learn and train yourself to start doing it.  Start with small steps.  Maybe for you a good start would be to come to /r/stopdrinking **at least once a day for the next 60 days** and spend a minimum of 30 minutes reading stories AND posting your honest thoughts???  It is relatively anonymous and you can start the process of teaching yourself what it is like to open up to other people.  Who knows this could lead to you feeling more comfortable with live people face to face?..Anyway good luck!
Therapy.  Therapy.  Therapy.  ..Did I mention therapy?..Therapy.
Welcome! ..Have you considered seeking help from a D&amp;A program? Not sure if you've tried that in the past. I am in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) that has 2.5 hour groups twice a week and 1 hour of individual counseling once a week. I have never tried AA but I can say that my IOP has made all the difference to me. ..I had to do a bit of work to find the right agency the first one I tried wasn't a good fit but I am so happy with my program now. ..Anyway good luck with your journey! It takes a lot of courage to admit you have a problem. I wish you well!  
Nobody can get sober without a support system. And if your family and friends truly care about you they will understand and be happy that you are wanting to change. But you'll need more than that. Keep going to AA meetings go early and stay late. Listen to everyone's story. You *will* hear one that mirrors yours. Talk to that person. If you are afraid of being judged stop it. There is not a single person with any decent amount of sober time who will. Everyone at those meetings everyone is equal and everyone wants you to get better. ..Most AA groups have a phone list. Anyone on that list will take your call and "talk you off the ledge" so to speak. Utilize all the things they give you. ..But most importantly don't drink today. Make it through today and then try again tomorrow. The "One Day at a Time" motto isn't a motto it's a suggestion to live life. Breaking everything down into small bits is a much easier way to do it. I quit drinking at 22 so hopefully I have a lot of life to live as do you and thinking about being sober forever is too much sometimes. However being sober today is entirely doable. ..You can do this. 
Hey there thank you for posting. I have zero advice regarding opening up since it is something that I myself find incredibly hard - and in that sense this place has been a God send because it has allowed me to do that without dragging my loved ones into the utter desperation I feel most of the time. I figure I have put them through enough. You are incredibly lucky from my perspective to have the love and support of your SO and also I think to have found this place. .The only advice I can share is that I have found some supplements that have helped to redress the chemical balance in my brain with regard to feeling depressed and generally shitty - I take Thiamine or B1 as people who abuse alcohol tend to deplete this significantly and it really plays a role in clear thinking and general brain function; and 5HTP which plays a big role in melatonin and seratonin production AKA mood and sleep control. And milk thistle to help the liver recover. Feel free to check those out on Amazon especially if you're like me in being resistant to potentially being medicated via the prescription route (though I am not knocking that at all it's just a reluctance for me to potentially give my body something else to get hooked on)..All I can say other than that is that everyone on here is rooting for you we all feel the same struggle and I am sure that together we can do it. All the best of luck to you in your endeavour - and welcome to this subreddit it's a wonderful place!
Hi my name is ? and I'm a 26M alcoholic :)..First thank you for posting. That takes real courage..I think you'll fit in quite well here - I am just now after two months starting to open up to my close friends. And you know what? Many of them will just never ever get it and it's been hard to have to accept that that's ok. I know I'm getting better and I can see my progress and that is going to have to be enough for my happiness...Maybe you can try opening up here first and then try taking it offline? Tell us a bit about your personal experience and why you want to stop and then maybe someone can offer some better advice as to how that can translate to getting better offline...I don't know if any of this is helpful but I'm glad you posted here and I hope you continue. It really is an incredible community and I couldn't have gotten to where I am now without it.
AA and IOP have saved my life. If you cannot get into treatment (IOP/PHP/In-patient) then you must do AA. It is very tough at first that is just a fact everyone has gone through it some more than others but it is tough for all. Each time you go will get better. ..Look at it this way: Would you go out of your way geographically and/or do things that hurt emotionally to get alcohol into your system? Then you can do those things to save your life. You have to :)..We are here for you! You can do it I promise. ..I always used to hate when people said "If I can do it anyone can". I would always think "Well you have no idea my shit is waaaaay worse than yours ever was so no I cannot do it you don't know my shit". Well it turns out that I could and did get sober despite being addicted to alcohol xanax adderall herion/painkillers and cocaine...No one's shit is really any worse than anyone else because our bottoms are the worst that we know. My worst was the worst I had ever known or felt your worst is the worst that you have ever known or felt...Immerse yourself in the AA community. Even if it is small where you live it can be the biggest most wonderful thing to ever happen to you in your entire life. Seriously...:)
Welcome! There is lots of good advice already here. I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of **you are fixable and worth the time and effort it will take to make this happen.** I wish I had learned this at 26! .
