 This past week  I found out I'm pregnant.  This will be baby #4 for me.  With all my pregnancies  it was easy for me to quit all harmful substances  and I'm confident this time will be no different.  The real struggle will be not "celebrating" with a drink after the baby is born.  I'm so excited! Excited for the new addition  and excited for the added strength and resolve this will bring.  I just want to thank everyone here for just being here on this sub.  Let's make today the best sober day yet.  I will not drink with you today.

Congratulations! That's a kick in the pants to get healthy amiright?! ..I also had no issues not drinking while pregnant with my son but dammit! I let booze back in before too long. It's a sneaky devil! ..Happy and healthy 9 months to you! And I won't drink with you! 
Congratulations! It doesn't matter what kick starts your sobriety (baby) as long as you work the journey and keep on the path; even after baby comes. You can do this! So excited and happy for you!!!  
Congratulations    
Just remember baby gets alcohol or any substance for that matter from you when you breast feed that should help post baby.
Aw that's wonderful. Congratulations! I won't drink with you today either.
That's wonderful news!  If it's a girl maybe you can name her Temperance:).  I will join you in not drinking today.
