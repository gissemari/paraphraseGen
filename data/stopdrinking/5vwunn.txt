Started drinking when I was 17. Stopped when I was 23. Started again when I was 25. Stopped drinking on November 6 2014 when I was 38. ..Daily drinker of beer between 12 and 30 cans depending on if I had time. Drank whiskey or vodka if I had to hide it...I have been fighting the cravings for the past couple of days but they're getting worse. Usually they go away after a few hours but not this time. Can't sleep. ..Fucking saw some limes at the gas station and that's what set it off. Really struggling right now. ..Been thinking about going to AA but not that much into God. Or people for that matter. No offense. ..I'll be ok. Taking it a minute at a time. ...

Sorry to hear you're struggling. Have you tried checking in to the chat on the sidebar? You get a more immediate response. 
I may do that. Better today but the night may be bad so I'm going to put in a 10 hour shift and also work through the weekend. ..Maybe I can get back to where I was. ..Thank you for your time.
