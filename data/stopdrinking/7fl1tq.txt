We went to a Brazilian restaurant in Albuquerque for the first time last night. The server told us about our drink options going through the wine beer and typical soda and sweet tea. Then he added that they also have a delicious Brazilian lemonade. I love lemonade and just was like sold! My husband (who isn't sober) immediately asked 'is there any alcohol in that? What's in it?' Luckily there was no alcohol because it was amazingly delicious. ..After the server left I thanked him for thinking about the booze. He told me he was proud of me for making it so long even though it has been a struggle. ..Gosh I love that man!

Great story!!
What a team! Bless your husband
Love this
Good for you and the team! .I wish my SO would feel like she was supportive.  But she doesn't seem to notice at all.  But then she doesn't know the struggles we go through. Sigh.
Warm and fuzzies  :)  Keep him!  And well done you   winning at the sober social life (it IS possible)! 
Good man.
It really helps having supportive family. I can't imagine doing this without my husband's support. 
It can be done! When they really love us they will look out for us! Good on your husband! And you on 123 DAYS! I agree with you that it isn't easy to get *and* stay sober but it's not impossible either! Continued good luck to you!
Good for you! Support at home makes it so much easier.
What a blessing to have support form a loved one like that 
I got a taste of alcohol in a chocolate mousse dessert on thanksgiving.  Surprise. One taste was all it took. Pushed it away and went back to the dessert bar to select another. No note on the desserts chalkboard that would have indicated the alcohol was present. Oh well. Sober on. Glad you had someone looking out for you
