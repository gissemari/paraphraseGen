I've been sober for a full 7 days now - the first time in 3-ish years (since I was 19). It started hard there were a few good days but I've been struggling for the last two days. But here I am! I've gone to at least one meeting every day since the 4th and I'm still going strong. I'm a bit grumpy and my body and brain feel wacky but I'm holding on. Thanks for the support and love everyone!

Great job! Thats so awesome!..The first week is a hard week. Your body should just about be done with the physical withdrawal. Now comes more of the emotional part...I was super overwhelmed around the second week. There was a lot of anger and sadness that i felt. Please just talk to someone if/when that happens. Post here... just do something else. ..You have got the hardest part of any project done. You started. Just dont let this ball stop rolling. You can do it!.
today is my 2 weeks. the first week was really hell but each day after that gets better and better. Physically I feel great!! I have been walking 4 miles every morning at 5.30. Normally I'd either be passed out pushing off waking up until 2 pm to avoid the hangover. or I'd still be up drinking at that time. it's crazy how much your life changes in such a small amount of time. I support you and hope nothing but the best for you. 
Hang in thete! I won't drink with you today.
