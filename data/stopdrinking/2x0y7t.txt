Do they not have the secular equivalent to a chaplain you can safely communicate with?.If not I recommend you go to the chaplain as it seems that would be what they are there for. .Sort of exactly that kind of crisis..I bet there are some military on this sub. Seems like they have mentioned there are available AA meetings and such inside the base..Hopefully someone who knows more will chime in..Good luck!
Welcome /u/xXAlecBaldwinXx to /r/stopdrinking -- there are [ideas at this link to a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that helped me and a lot of other people to stop drinking and get sober.  There are also a lot of resources on the sidebar of this subreddit that can be enormously useful.  Good luck.
Hey thanks for posting. The first step is admitting you need help. This place has been awesome for me in terms of support &amp; just being able to vent. IRL though a chaplain might be a good idea simply from the perspective that I doubt he will want to convert you to religion - in my experience 'people of the cloth' can be wonderful to talk with because they really don't judge approach every problem from a genuine place of wanting to help and it might be good for you to be able to get support from someone who is in close proximity. Whatever you decide SD will be here for you and all the best in your recovery journey!

You need to go the chaplain or a commanding officer and request help via their SARP program. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND REHABILITATION PROGRAM.Information on how to do so can be found here: http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/LGuide/alcohol_drug.aspx. .Also if you self report rather than wait until this issue affects your job performance it will not look negative on your record as would being Required to attend SARP..I know an ex sailor who was in the USN when they still had beer machines in the barracks. Eventually he was sent through their rehab program also and they were very supportive. Good Luck Sailor.

I was a commissioned officer in the Air Force for 5 years unfortunately I separated from the service as a result of my drinking problem.    .I encourage you to set up a meeting with your 1st Sargent and explain to them you are concerned about your drinking. You don't have to say anymore and they will point you in the right ditection. That is what they are trained to do. As far as I know you the 1sgt and maybe your commander will know.You should not be punished for seeking help. That is from a career stand point.    .From a personal standpoint if you want to stop drinking and all your friends do is drink you will have to change friends. That is hard but it is a must or you will not stop that's just the sad reality of the situation.    .I don't want to discourage you but there is help for you and you are not the 1st or the last sailor to have a drinking problem. I encourage you to do something/anything to address it before it damages or end your military service as it did me. You can PM me and we can talk more off line. Best wishes going forward my friend.
