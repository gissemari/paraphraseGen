One of my best friends is 31 with three year-old twins and and has been divorced for 2 years.   Divorce wasn't about drinking specifically but it was a factor if course just a no consequences &gt; no problem situation. He has been curious and  me about my sobriety since I started out I actually had my last drink with him when I decided to stop.  Anyways he has been curious because nothing happened I just up and quit (he doesn't understand how or why I stopped without a DUI or other defined bottom).  I've tried to explain it to him and he feigns comprehension with that look we all know the  i hear you but I'm not done yet . I told him a lot of why I'm quitting is because I know what is coming and I'm not going out like that  plain and simple.  I spent ten years throwing all caution to the wind and I'm getting out now with my health and reputation.  There are horrors ahead and from what I've been through I can't imagine it getting worse though I know it does...I made the case to him that the way we drink has trouble written all over it and it is just good luck that nothing horrifying has happened.  I being single with no children haven't much to lose besides the possibility of better things to come.  He however has two 3 year-old boys that he spends 1/2 of their lives with and if anything were to jeopardize his relationship with them he would be jettisoned into an earth-shattering depression which I'd be very worried for his safety over.  I have never seen him drink on days he has the kids I was worried about him getting a DUI or something that his ex wife would use against him...All of these talks we had became more relevant after he had a nervous breakdown at work in May (high school math teacher).  He kept chalking it up to anxiety/depression and I modestly suggested the nips of 99 rootbeer might be a good place to start.  He decided to try quitting drinking out and since May he has told me about a couple slip ups but said he was trying.   He asked me about my urges and whatnot and I explained to him any urges I get are very easy to deal with as I have chosen a new path in life and no part of me wants to return to where I was and never having the first one is working for me so far day at a time yada yada.  Pointed him here but he had no interest.  Suggested AA but due to his knowledge of my views on it he was able to shut that down (which I am ashamed of and have learned a dear lesson about how delicate conversations must be concerning addiction.  My thoughts on AA that I shared with someone negatively influenced the likelihood of them trying it out something I fully support anyone struggling to try out). Unfortunately I could tell he just still was not done.  The message would not fully transmit...Here's the surprise ending for you faithful readers still with me at this point:  a slip up this weekend resulted in his ex-wife finding him passed out at 2pm because he was unreachable and home alone with the boys.  He told me he decided to have 1 or 2 nips (turned into the whole sleeve) around 9AM because he was so stressed from his mom's current health crisis and everything else going on in his life.  She drove him to the hospital and now he's grasping at straws full of the positivity only a desperate man would feel.  Really turning things around now... this time it's serious...  so sad.  If only he regarded it as this serious a few days ago he might not have just ruined his life (not to mention put his children in unsupervised mortal danger for 2-4 hours who knows how long he was out).   ..I love this sub for being the thing that grabbed me before I spent one more day tempting fate.  I wish I knew how to help a friend better than I was able to this time.  IWNDWYT hope everyone closes out their weekend pleasantly.  Take care all of you....

You're helping him by leading by example. I do AA (it works for me I understand it's not for everyone) and at my second meeting I saw a guy get an 8 year chip. That was insane to me. It was insane to think about going a week without drinking but it gave me hope. It was total blind hope but there was some evidence there that someone had done it. You're doing that for your friend. Keep your chin up and keep living by example. Others definitely take notice. 
You're a caring person and I'm glad you're in his life.
