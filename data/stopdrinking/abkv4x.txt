Two years ago I made a resolution to not drink. Period. The end of 2016 was pretty awful for me - I got fired right after moving out of my parents' house among other things and was terrified I wouldn't be able to pay rent - and was using alcohol to cope. It was a horrible time. But I got a new job that December and I promised to myself that things would get better and I didn't need alcohol to have peace of mind. ..So starting January 1st 2017 I promised I wouldn't have a single drink. Not even casually. I didn't want a snowball effect to happen. ..I lasted six whole months! ..But then I got promoted to a call center job that was understaffed and high-expectation. Every few weeks I was having days of anxiety and depression so bad that I couldn't feel my face or hands. It was a nightmare. ..It was all too easy to turn back to alcohol to cope. Almost every night just so I could forget about the stresses of the day. Later to  fast-forward  through my weekends because - yay depression! - I had lost interest in many of my favorite hobbies and activities and couldn't bear the monotony of a day without too much to do. It was like being shuffled from a burning room to a freezer with nothing to comfort me but alcohol.   And despite the fact that I cook very healthy meals I gained far too much weight to the point where I was disgusted with my body. ..But these past few months have been slowly getting better. My depression medication was adjusted and my old interests feel like they're waking up and calling to me. My parents adopted a dog and he's the highlight of every visit. ..And most importantly I finally left that terrible job. I started a new job right after Thanksgiving  with an enormous support network and fantastic coworkers.  The expectations are reasonable and I'm actually receiving proper training instead of being expected to learn as I go and live in constant fear of messing up. And it's work I'm super passionate about: I'm going to be advocating for kids with special needs and their families so they get the insurance benefits they need and deserve. It's fulfilling and I can't believe I'm so lucky to be in a career where I'll be making a difference. ..I still feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop like all this good fortune is just a prelude to another disaster. But I'm taking charge of that and working towards routines of self care so I'm not worrying about what could or might happen and living in a wonderful present. ..I'm already seeing a difference in my mental health since I started this new job. I'm doing things like moisturizing my face and brushing my teeth when previously I couldn't have cared less about taking care of things like that. I scheduled my yearly medical exam after neglecting it for the past year and a half because I finally feel like taking care of my body. ..And I've been able to taper off the drink. Sometimes it's a few days sometimes it's only one day and sometimes I don't make it at all but it's no longer a nightly need. ..So I'm making this resolution to myself the same resolution I made two years ago. I have tears in my eyes as I write this because I still struggle so much with the idea that things can get better. ..But things are getting better. ..And I've done this before. I can do this again. ..I will take this next step to take care of myself even further. ..I will not drink with you today.

You have taken so many wonderful steps...so much to be proud of. Keep going! You can do this...I believe in you.  IWNDWYT 
Fabulous! You should be so proud of yourself. You have already made such amazing strides forward in your life and here you are now literally about to be the cat that gets the cream...I suffered really badly with anxiety about just about everything and 'comforted' myself with a nightly bottle of wine. I have had virtually no sign of that anxiety since about 3 weeks in and where it has risen its head I could clearly identify the cause breathe and try to do something about it. Often that 'something' was to come on here to ask for and receive really great support. I am delighted that you are here to share this journey and I look forward to not drinking with you today.
