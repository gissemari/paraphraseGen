Hi everyone..Well I'm 20 and I was heading to be an alcoholic. I drowned my problems and sorrows in alcohol and drugs. I loved the numbness the false sense of power it gave me. I never admitted it though.  I don't drink regularly so I am obviously fine   My grades aren't that bad so I am fine  I tried to convince myself. I knew that that was bullshit so I tried to justify myself my "favorite" excuse was that I am not in controll. That I am the victim of my own actions. Drunk me makes all the mistakes; sober me is perfect. Nevermind that sober me planned and hid the drinking. .Whenever I felt bad I had the urge to just down half a bottle of Vodka and watch a Netflix. Thankfully I had enough control to not do that. But it wasn't an easy fight. It was a fight that I was bound to lose. ..I'm writing this to thank everyone on this sub. You helped me turn my life around. For the first time in a long time I am happy and have a positive outlook on life. I'm no longer afraid of what will come. I no longer live in my head and dream about the thing that could have made my life to day better. The if-only used to rule my thinking. I could be popular I could have a lot of friends I could be happy if only ... I still daydream but now it is about the future about how I can make me happy. ..I have been a long-time lurker reading and thinking about the stuff written here but what really made a change in my life was making my bed every morning like someone here suggested (I sadly didn't save the post otherwise I would have linked it). This small change in my routine had a surprising impact. After doing my bed for a couple of days I cleaned up my entire room. It's not perfect but I am happy seeing my room like this. I would have never guessed how much these small thinks matter...I never liked looking in the mirror I didn't like what I see. I didn't like how much I weight I didn't like how yellow my teeth are   Now I accepted that I fucked up and the responsibilities that come with it. I am not happy with what I see but I'm ok with it because I know that I and only I have the power to change me. To become who I want to be..I now work out twice a week brush my teeth twice a day every day I watch what I eat I rediscovered my love of cooking. Even if I can't fix everything I am still happy. I'm doing my best I can justify my actions and looks to myself. Isn't that what truly matters? ..I used to hate stress situations. They made me feel like shit. I could never really concentrate and learn the stuff I had to do. And since I failed miserably I felt worse. Oh boy I was happy when the  learning  was over and the party-time began. I was happy until the next time I had to learn..Since I didn't learn enough for the exams I just had I'll have to rewrite some. But you know what? I'm not afraid. I am actually enjoying myself WHILE learning. It still takes disciple not to game or spent time on reddit but I can do it. ..A friend of mine gave me the opportunity to work a part time job and it is one of the best things in my live. Admittedly it is a bit boring but it gives me a sense of accomplishment. I managed to work concentrated for 7+ hours. The first day I left work I was proud and happy. I just had to smile. I'm just happy for no apparent reason. I never expected that to happen. It seemed like a thing that only happens in movies...That being said my life is not perfect. I still struggle talking to new people but with the newfound happiness and self-confidence I will make it...I doubt that I will ever stop having the urge to drink/ get high but I know that I will not give in...Sorry for the context-jumps I hope that they aren't too difficult to follow...Thanks to you all I don't imagine my future in a coffin anymore but me being happy. I will never be able to repay you guys for that so I hope a thank you will suffice..IWNDWYT.
