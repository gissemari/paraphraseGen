If I can do it anyone can! Ive tried to get sober many many times over the years. I am the Relapse Queen! But here I am at 100 days and Im so happy and things are so much better and I'm going full steam ahead. There's no turning back this time. I want it so bad this time. I'm super proud of myself and of all of you warriors out there! I wouldn't wish addiction on anyone. It's one of the hardest battles a person can fight. Keep on fighting! You're worth it! IWNDWYT

Echo thank you for sharing. I'm right about where you were needed to do something and think I'm finally there. I also needed to read words like yours. So again thank you IWNDWYT because our lives depend on it. Good job so far.
