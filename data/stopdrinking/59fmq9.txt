[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety check in see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..**Triumph:** I was very worried about seeing my friend Odette. I lived at her house outside Paris when I was a teenager and I remember having drinks with her at a sidewalk cafe before I ever had a problem. It's easy to romanticize drinking with her. But then I realized: this get together wasn't about drinking anyway. It was about enjoying our enduring (30+ year) friendship. And we ended up having a lovely lunch together. Since I was sober I was fully present to hear what was going on in her life...**Struggle:** I am getting physical therapy for my left foot. By coincidence my new therapist is on the same street where I used to work a corporate job (before I got fired for keeping a bottle in my desk -- my biggest humiliation). It's hard to be back in that neighborhood -- it brings back so many drinking memories both good and bad...**General:** Recently someone on this site called me SFG and I have been thinking that from now on my sober rapper name should be Notorious SFG..
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph**: Got through a vacation (overall great) but spent a lot of time with the in-laws (nice people but stressful) without having too many temptations. ..**Struggle**: Heading back to work tomorrow and though my boss has been good about letting me have a worry free vacation some of the work emails I've been CC'ed on make me think I'm going to be putting out a lot of fires this week. Also need to make sure the *slight* slacking I've done on my workout/diet over vacation doesn't continue beyond today...**General**: Today I learned that adult cats do not meow to each other only to humans. So basically the way I see it I am trying to speak Cat to my cats and they are trying to speak Human to me and neither of us can understand what the hell the other is talking about.
Triumph: Uhm went to my cardiologist and learned any damage done to my heart through high blood pressure drinking and smoking is reversible given my age. Down to a size medium in hanes shirts about to hit 60 pounds lost as of May this year. Impressed my cardiologist with my diet weight loss and my lack of sugar intake. ..Struggle: Cut ties for good with my ex. Ended kinda ugly. Learned I still have high blood pressure and that one of my heart walls may be enlarged or thickened. Still trying to lose those last 20 pounds to get down to a nice trim 188 @ 6'1. Learned a few hours ago a cousin of mine overdosed on heroin and died. Not surprising given he is an ex felon who went away for drugs what pisses me off is he left behind a wife and a baby boy who now doesn't have a father. Though I guess it is up for debate if having no father is better than having him as one. Can't believe him and his wife were exposing a child to that...General: I guess I am alright. I'm not going to visit family for Thanksgiving because last time I must have been offered alcohol at least ten times Gonna go dust off the ole racquet and play some tennis this weekend. Maybe go for a jog. 
Triumph: Hit a month this week. Returned to BJJ been going to bed at a decent time...Struggle: People aren't taking my sobriety seriously. That's ok they'll get it eventually. If not I don't care. Also my diet is a mess I'm eating way too much sugary shit and chocolate.
Hi guys. I'm new here. I'm a bar manager at a restaurant with a drinking problem...**Triumph:** I didn't drink on Tuesday! Day one is officially in the books. Thanks to the supportive ruffians in the IRC for pushing me forward. New phone day means i can finally browse through empowering stop drinking resources...**Struggle:** My spending habits are alcoholic. Looking at this months Bank statement is embarrassing shameful and maddening. I'm running behind at work due to procrastination and my boss' boss' boss is coming in tonight. My brain is mushy and it's so hard to put sentences together!..**General:**  One day at a time. Exercise needs to happen today. And chocolate.
Triumph: I got through 37 days without. And I actually wrote something - only a letter but it feels good to write...Struggle: I am really struggling with all my symptoms anxiety sadness. Wondering if I did good thing breaking things between me and ex. I miss him so much it hurts. So I have this and in outside world (outside of my head) cockroaches came back after only 3 weeks of peace. I need to move out and I hate that. At this moment I just want to resign log out hit pause button and go someplace faaaar away. I don't have anyone who cares to tell this because I broke up with only person who cared. Well! Life choices. You need to live with them. Sorry for venting...General: I feel like I lost my identity due to quitting alcohol cigarettes and black coffee. It would be kind of fun to search new identity. Would be.
Hey everyone.....**Triumph**: I've been working on my TV Pilot (semi auto-biographical and coming your way in 2017 *hopefully!*) and it is therapeutic to go through my drinking life from an external viewpoint...**Struggle**: Dreams of drinking - last two nights in a row I have woken up thinking I have drank or got a bottle stashed under my pillow. Felt the humiliation of slipping before realising it was just my brain screwing with me...probably because of the above...**General**: Big meeting today with a client I used to work for until (like /u/sfgirlmary) I was fired for drinking on the job. It's pleasing that they hired me to do a contract job despite knowing my past but also quite hard to go back into the office where my shame occurred.
T: Admitting I am an alcoholic..S: Relapsing.G: Grateful for this sub and all of you. Thanks.
Triumph: Had my best friend from overseas and had a great time sober - even when her and my partner had a few. Won a $100k deal on Friday which was a great way to finish the week at work and have made a conscious decision to be proactive doing small tasks immediately instead of procrastinating. The trick is if it takes two minutes or less do it immediately. ...Struggle: Not a bad struggle but trying to get on top of my work load it's been pretty intense in the office and I just can't seem to get my to-do-list down got the laptop home tonight so should tidy it up this evening....General: I must remember when ordering at a restaurant to stipulate I can't have any food with alcohol in it. Almost made a mistake out over the weekend with a desert. Also need to keep up with This Naked Mind almost finished. Once I'm finished I will re-read. And go to the gym! 
Triumph: Wow. I am going to bed tonight and WANT to wake up tomorrow. I haven't had any ideation or any thoughts of hurting myself since re-commiting last Thursday but this is a nice change. I'll text my therapist and let her know in the morning. Also I heard back from the recovery center I looked into over the weekend that my insurance is verified and good to go! Going in for an assessment on Friday...Struggle: Pow. My partner who I've been living separately from since January and only in the same state again since May just talked to me for the first time since my last binge. She's (understandably) furious with me...Because I was drinking I missed our last couple's counseling appointment (with a doctor I really respect) and she chose to go on a pretty important trip we had planned together - without me...We'd been texting over the weekend and I was aware of her anger and expected the extent of it (this is not a new pattern for us unfortunately) but hearing her say it out loud was heartbreaking and terrifying and *incredibly* painful. I am still sober and aim to be tomorrow but after that phone call was the first time I've wanted to take a drink all week...I want to be angry at her for the way she treated me on the phone but deep down I feel like I deserve it...General: Holy cow. I bought a lunchbox for the first time in twenty years. What a novel idea! I can save money AND I don't have to carry cash so I can ~~stop at Kroger W&amp;S on the way home~~ buy lunch on campus!
Triumph: My wife and I have been separated for the last six months but last night had our first real talk about me moving back into our house and the logistics of that. We didn't end up making a plan but decided that we would talk to our counselor about what the next step forward would be. It never would've happened if I was still drinking..Struggle: Tomorrow is the day that I put on my calendar that I would quit smoking. I've been working up to it for the last two weeks and I know I just have to do it. I had my Dr. prescribe me wellbutrin which is how I quit last time (and stayed quit for over 5 years). I know I can do it but it still makes me nervous..General: Working out the logistics of a trip back to my hometown and playing a reunion show with the band I was in when I was 20. It's just for fun but I wonder: who wants to see old guys play punk songs no one has cared about in 20 years? It doesn't matter it's just for fun...
(I'm new at this...)..**Triumph:**  Well got through my second day and night 100% sober.  And since I'm spending a week at home with the wife and kids have had so much more patience and energy with my two young ones.  We've even started an evening run around the block together (I run they are on scooters).  Fun!..**Struggle:**  I still don't really know how I'm going to face life sober.  This is just too early in the game for me to have any idea what I'm in for.  At 41. :(.
Triumph: I turned down a pot cookie the other night. We were out to play trivia and the cook was not so discreetly handing them around to staff and the "cool" regulars. As I saw what was going on I was secretly hoping he would offer me one. That little cookie held the promise of feeling good for a while maybe a little escape or something. He did end up offering me one and I did end up turning it down even though I kind of really wanted one. ..Struggle: I've had thoughts of other substances on my mind a lot even before the cookie incident. Like I know certain teas can be extra calming or even euphoria inducing and I've actively searched out how to acquire them. This is not a judgement on people who do use other substances but for me I know it's just a loophole. Quitting drinking for me includes facing the reality of my life and feelings in an unaltered state. But it's still been a struggle for me; the idea of taking something else to alter enhance or suppress and it wouldn't count because it's not alcohol...General: Ha ha Notorious SFG! I like it! I'm trying to think of a cool rapper name for me PolarB? I'm not clever :( 
**Triumph:** Still sober.  Despite relapsing into other old behaviors which I guess is to be expected at this point...**Struggle:** Shame.  I've been digging into my psychiatric treatment pretty hard and left a fairly...dysregulated email for my pretty unavailable therapist Friday re: his unavailability and my issues with that.  I also gave him access to my life story /inventory last week and I am pretty much terrified to see him today.  Going to have to force myself to get out the door this morning...**General:**  I need to balance my efforts in the different areas pertaining to my recovery.  Everyday life is becoming a slog where I try to put maximum effort and energy into everything which just isn't possible for me (and possibly anyone).  I want to focus on kindness to myself without going all the way into the other direction to avoidance.
Hey 'Notorious SFG'!! I like it ;)...Triumph:  A dear friend that is a very sickly alcoholic (a case and at least a handle or 2 of bourbon every single day) needs help. I saw friend's apartment a few weeks ago and almost vomited - fruit flies in the kitchen dishes falling over the sink leaking water bad moldy food in fridge etc.. So I threw on my sweats rolled up my sleeves picked up a shit ton of cleaning products and got to work. Cleaned the place top to bottom for 4 hours on my hands and knees (even put up some early Thanksgiving decorations). Ironically the easiest part was throwing away all the empties. I was actually HAPPY to throw that shit away! My friend was thrilled. I let the friend know that I will be here and will help pay it forward when they are ready to stop drinking. Yay!..Struggle: There are some Halloween parties Friday and Saturday night and I've decided not to go. I was kind of looking forward to finally getting into a costume for my first sober Halloween in ages but ya know what? I'll be very happy at home with my candles and a good book :)...General:  My sister BIL and nephew are on a cruise to Bermuda. I am taking care of Mom my sis's apartment her cat and had to drive them around Manhattan to get to and from the cruise. I'm handling everything and can't imagine doing all of this while drunk!
**Triumph**: Ran four times last week! I did just the most hilly ridiculous 5k ever on Sunday which kicked my ass completely and I loved it. ..**Struggle**: My anxiety is appearing again ever so slightly. However I made an appointment with a recommended therapist so hopefully that will help...**General**: I get the keys to my new flat on Saturday and I can't wait. I have been bunking with my parents for a month and I finally get space to myself again. Yey!
Hi everyone new here...**Triumph:** Made it through day 3 yesterday even went out for dinner with a friend without having a few glasses of wine. The longest I've been sober for since I was 16...**Struggle:** Things went sour last night couldn't get to sleep at all. My OCD was playing up hard for the first time in years much anxiety and tics like no tomorrow. Craving some selfmedication in the form of alcohol to make it stop...**General:** Glad I found this sub.
Triumph: even though I have a lot of anxiety about work I am going in and doing the best job I can. My therapist suggested that it is beneficial to do things even if/when they are uncomfortable and scary. I really took that to heart and am proud of applying myself to my job. ..Struggle: going to a wedding this weekend and will see a bunch of friends with whom I have been drinking for ~11 years. I believe in my sobriety but it will be a challenge. ..General: my skin is clearer than it has been in years. I'm putting a ton of goodness on every night and only needed a teeny bit of makeup this morning. Also I smell fantastic. Hoping others can see the change too!

Triumph: Seeing my star turn to 7 the other day. Recognizing real improvement in my relationship with my wife and kids. Being down 35 pounds since I stopped drinking the poison...Struggle: Fighting against complacency continuing to find ways to remind myself that sobriety is a delicate state that cannot be taken for granted. Also still need to quit smoking!..General: Need to find a new series on Netflix for nightly binging. I've already caught up on or re-watched all of the shows I missed by "watching" while I was drinking. All recommendations are welcome!
Triumph: There are a few minor things that I'm happy to have in my life not really a single huge triumph.  I am happy that I went running yesterday and happy that I went to a meeting instead of picking up.  I'm happy that I was able to give my wife the night off from watching our son last night...Struggle: I feel like I'm being set up to loose my job in a rather undignified way that is so my boss does not have to pay unemployment.  Also my wife has had to be away from the home a lot recently meaning an unusual amount of alone time.  This has led me to a place of intense fear stress and temptation...General:  I know intellectually I cannot drink and that if I have a drink today I don't stand a chance in accomplishing anything positive.  But sometimes I don't feel it in my heart.
Triumph: Yesterday was my four months of sobriety! It feels pretty amazing. :)..Struggle: I'm dragging my feet about working the steps. The feelings being brought up are pretty painful however I am making myself sit down to work them this weekend...General: My city is having a Young People in Alcoholics Anonymous conference this weekend and I'm pretty excited. My friend made me a hedgehog costume. I can't wait to party it up sober!
**Triumph:** Feeling good getting things done...**Struggle:** You know when procrastinating on a task makes that task even bigger how the work looms like a horror movie monster the further behind you get behind? Yeah that's where I am on a major project...**General:** The weather has been fantastic the last week. I've been enjoying it thoroughly.
Triumph: Today is my last day one. I have made my decision. This time I'm going full on renunciant; no alcohol and no tobacco. I have an awesome program to work I have a larger toolkit than ever before I have more motivation now than I've had in months I have a fantastic group of supporters who understand me and are rooting for me and are THERE for me. I have already won the war; it's time to do battle. .Struggle: I got my two weeks' notice at my job. I've been a contractor working for the same firm for 11 years and even though I feel confident that I'll find another job relatively quickly my finances are in pretty bad shape and I'm growing more and more nervous about my career. .General: I'm really getting excited about working out and meditating and doing yoga and jiu-jitsu and playing music and studying math and working on my website and my blog and engaging in all my geeky hobbies!.
Triumph: Closing in on 30 days. Traveling this week for work has been easier than anticipated because I made sure to do a lot of pre-planning stocking up on teas and fizzy water and shows/movies/activities for the hotel room. I also have my sponsor on high alert for text messages and check ins. Reading through this sub has been helpful too though I haven't been posting as much...Struggle: we're selling our house and it's leaving me in this sort of existential "what in the fuck am I doing with my life" mood. My marriage has been on the decline for years (mostly my fault from all the bad behavior and drinking though my partner did plenty of drinking and fighting too). He wants to buy another house and move forward whereas I am wondering if this is really what I want to do for the rest of my life. I don't know how to handle that conversation because once it's all said it can't be unsaid and I am conflict-avoidant and don't want to hurt anyone. This is causing some major depression and anxiety which I am struggling with a lot this week...General: Finally sleeping again after 20-something days. Feeling healthy. Got some compliments on weight loss and how nice my face looks now. Really proud of myself so far. Anticipating that 30 day mark but same time taking it one day at a time...Thanks for listening y'all.
**Triumph:**  Fought through a serious sugar craving at work yesterday after committing to not touching the snack cupboard and instead bringing my own healthier snacks to work.  I treated it just like my alcohol craving - ride out the urge and get the hell away from the trigger as soon as possible...**Struggle:**  Same as before feeling heavy and weighed down by the rat race mentality regardless of all of the healthy things I'm doing for myself.  I need to meditate!!..**General:**  I've committed to hosting Turkey Day.  Aiyiyi what have I gotten myself in for??  I do like to host dinners but I'm feeling so busy and overcommitted as it is.  Ah well it will be fun to plan and make yummy food.  
Triumph: I'm still feeling proud of every new day I have behind me. Work has been going well. Overall I feel happier and more optimistic than I have in a while. Not just because I'm not drinking but I'm starting to get more confidence and direction in my life. ..Struggle: My mom is a heavy drinker and I can't stand it. She got shitfaced on a Monday and was being really obnoxious when I was trying to have a conversation with my grandma. I'm also absolutely exhausted today as a combination of difficulties sleeping (bc my drunk mom can't keep quiet when I'm trying to go to bed) and stress at work (not bad stress just a big project). I'm also feeling a little sad because I don't have plans for Halloween and I might be too tired/busy to do anything anyways...General: 80 days is tomorrow for me and I'm starting to get excited about approaching the 90 day mark. I'm trying to establish an exercise routine for myself but the stress/exhaustion from work makes it hard for me to get motivated. Monday and Tuesday I worked out before work but this morning I didn't do it. Even if I can do one set of crunches/squats/curls it's better than nothing but it's hard to get that through my exhausted brain when the time actually comes to exercise. I really want to get rid of my beer belly lol
Triumph - Feeling less depressed and anxious. Back at work at my old job and regaining my financial footing. Getting back into a workout routine but still struggling to work around my injured shoulder. My dog is going up to doggie daycare for a halloween party. The owners of the daycare own my dogs brother. Mort (brother) is being dressed as BB8 and Slug (my dog) is going as R2D2...Struggle - My shoulder injury still holds me back. Still struggling to regain a strong foothold on my anxiety and depression. I'm definitely not out of the hole I dug from the last relapse but I am getting there...General - Much better. Not perfect but I'm on my way. Trying to get my study on for my personal training exam in a month. I printed out flashcards and basically carry them everywhere and glance at them when I get a chance. 
Triumph:  Reconnecting some of the wires that reminded me of the correlation between sobriety and recent success in my career in time for a big opportunity this week.  If I bomb it it will not be because of a hangover.  ..Struggle:  Struggle is the right word as I am struggling to commit to sobriety.  But I will commit to this day.  I am getting close to quitting out of spite which is for better or worse a very strong motivator for me.    ..General:  Did my first run since I had surgery this summer and it was fine.  My exercise has been very limited for five months and that is usually a critical part of any sober stretch that I manage to string together. This is a good thing.  
**Triumph:** Got through my first sober weekend in quite some time!.**Struggle:** I've noticed I'm feeling constantly dehydrated and a bit ill all the time despite drinking lots of water.  I'm concerned it's damage to liver or kidneys.  Probably going to see a doctor in the next week or two..**General:**  Feeling great had a productive first weekend and very happy I'm back in recovery after disastrous few months of relapse.
Triumph:  I got some decent work done and I thought this would be a garbage day because.....Struggle:  I have been feeling insanely lonely and emotional today after going to dinner for my buddy's bday last night and being a 7th wheel causing me to have lots of stupid thoughts of my ex and wanting to escape my pain...General:  Taking myself home early to do a little self care and get some more work done. I know everything will pass no matter how strong an emotion and I have gotten so much better at taking care of myself as required.
Triumph: This is my fifth day of sobriety which is the longest in two years. The changes that I've noticed in just four days are amazing. The clarity the sharpness the happiness with myself the confidence coming back. I know it's only been five days but five days are significant after years of being hungover and hazy...Struggle: Dinner with friends this Friday. Office Happy Hour tomorrow. The reactions I'll get. ..General: I'm on the west coast and my family in the Midwest has been on my mind in clearer way. Probably should think about a visit. 
**Triumph**: I lost ten pounds. ..**Struggle**: I'm going pretty deep on some sexual abuse issues with my therapist and for the first time in my life I'm allowing myself to experience the full terror and crushing grief of it. I'm waiting to experience full joy but it hasn't happened yet...**General**: Today I Learned that my cat is actually a blabber mouth. Oh and this: **bold.** So I have that going for me. Which is nice.
**Triumph:** Closing in on 300 days. I'm gonna be a Dino in the not too distant future!..**Struggle:** Calling people out on their bullshit more. Even though I didn't drink every day I think drinking my frustrations away must have been something I did without realising it. Need some tact &amp; diplomacy lessons!..**General:** Bone DMC has a certain ring to it...
T: not getting alcohol on my way home .S: I am so behind at work and had to take 2 quick naps this morning and one on my lunch break and I'm going through withdrawal right now and feeling shaky and depressed and low.G: going to watch some tv tonight drink a bunch of water take a sleeping pill and fall asleep and make it a better day tomorrow
