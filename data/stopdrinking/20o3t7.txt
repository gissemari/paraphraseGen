I woke up this morning at 4:30 am still drunk from the night before. I was still tired still wanted to go to sleep. But I was afraid that if I were to go back to sleep that I would most certainly die by choking on my own vomit if I were to do so. Over the course of the night i had drank way more than i had drank in my life yes even as an active alcoholic i never drank as much as i drank in one night as i did last night. I think i drank enough to kill a small human. ..I woke up with a vague recollection of some things that i had to piece together by asking other people and txt message logs and shit like that. I was quite seriously out of it. I had only ever blacked out or browned out once in my life (tho if it was more would i really know?). I drunk texted someone who is like a co-sponsor the person who got me to even think about quitting drinking. And he's quite pissed (i'm always worried that he's pissed but this time i know it's serious). I've pissed off a quite understanding Pastor friend of mine who is in the program and is not the kind of person who gets angry. ..Why did I drink? Well It started with a panic attack on wednesday night i awoke at 3am with an intense pressure in my body the same pressure i've had before when having panic attacks and didn't want to go to the ER at 3am. So i took what was handy which were some percocets that i got from my MIL. Yes i know i need to stop taking pills from her. I'm working on that. So I took some and went back to sleep cuz they mellowed me out. Then went about my day things went great i did some big things with church and stuff was very happy felt the best i had in a while was so happy to have turned a corner. Later that day i was sitting at home and decided to for no reason in particular to take a handful of percocet. woke up sick took a few more went about my day. woke up sick went to therapy felt like a dick for using told 1 friend. ..That one friend said i need to come clean. Asked around the webchat on sunday was told i need to come clean about relapsing. Didn't want to have to go in and say I FUCKED UP. Especially since someone in a meeting (my former sponsor) told me I was going to relapse because I wasn't doing it for myself so it was going to happen. This was in response to me saying that I didn't want to drink but was afraid I was going to relapse. I don't want to give them the satisfaction that they're right. I didn't. So upon stress due to the pressure of having to be truthful I drank. .And I drank more than ever before because I couldn't deal with all the AA and shit that i've got going on in my head. It took a lot to get me past that feeling of guilt and shame. ..But now i know this shit will fucking kill me if i don't get it together. I can't drink like i did before going to meetings because the first place i go is guilt. And it'll just be harder and harder because i'm driving away the people that want to help.

You're back and that is what matters.  Congrats on being brave enough to admit it.  I relapsed quiet a few times in recovery so I think I understand your guilt I felt something similar. The pride took a big dint.  Like you said as well my drinking went into overdrive as well.  I think I just said to myself I know I am an alcoholic so I may as well go for it. I drank twice as much twice as quick. I was lucky to survive them relapses.  When I went back to meetings etc.  I just said "fuck it and fuck them this time I am going to get sober for myself".  I had no qualms about using the meetings for myself as well.  It is working up till today.  Good luck.
There's a paradox that I live by especially when I reach the point where I can see that all my efforts all my willfulness are to no avail: you have to surrender to win.  There is this moment that many of us finally give up the notion that we can of our own accord defeat alcoholism.  At that moment the How it Works portion of Alcoholics Anonymous makes perfect sense.  Total surrender I'm no longer in charge.  I will follow directions.
