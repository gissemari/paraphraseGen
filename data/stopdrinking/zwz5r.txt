This is my first week in what I am guessing is about four months. My recent binge is what I think is my worst "all-day-alcoholic" experience where I would drink before work on workdays and on my day off I would wake up drink eat some crap pass out and repeat. Like four times a day... Pretty sad. I gained 12 pounds in this time. I even tried to stop last Saturday but I had the shakes so bad I felt I had to drink or I would fall apart. The next day I knew that had to be it. I'm done hopefully forever but I decided if I relapse one more time before Christmas I'm packing up and going home. .Related tonight I have a date to go on. I have to be incredibly strict with myself or I will fail. Not going to happen. Here's to one week plus one!..Update: my date went incredibly well! She had a beer with dinner (usual in Japan) and I just said "No thanks not for me tonight." and it was that simple. I'll admit I was a bit worried about this. Glad to have come through. Thanks to everyone here!
