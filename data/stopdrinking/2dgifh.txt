Nearly two weeks since my relapse. I've got the house to myself today and a day off. When other people are around it's easier not to drink but today's a bit hard. I'm bugging out over Robin Williams and even though I didn't know him personally it's difficult to resolve my own problems with depression and addiction so I feel an immense sense of empathy for him and his family. I've been sitting on my porch for the last hour or so mindlessly browsing reddit on my phone smoking a cigar (my next vice to conquer!) reading Aurelius' Meditations and thinking about things. Sometimes I feel as though we're all trapped in the belly of the beast. Our society has to be one based on compassion not self-aggrandizement. Not sure if we'll ever escape the paradox of being but we have to take this one day at a time. I'll probably try to write something later and head to bed early.   ..Hope y'all are doing well today.   ..Cheers!

Nice check-in /u/thatguyfromcanada -- I was having coffee with my pal Crhis this morning and I was reflecting on the fact that the Robin Williams story was so huge on SD and yet at my overflowing noon AA meeting there was not a mention of it.  My pal Chris is my real time version of the Dude from the Big Lebowski--Chris observed people on the interwebz tend to have meetings with themselves so tragedies like celebrity deaths have exaggerated impact.  People in AA meetings have gone outside arranged transportation showed up at a meeting and by definition are living in the world as we know it.  A celebrity death can be sad but it's nothing like the loss of friends and family to all sorts of alcohol drug and depression related tragedies.  ..I think my friend makes an excellent point.  We lose friends and family to this "disease" all the time--those deaths are shocking and yet I don't feel that my sobriety or mental health is at all endangered as long as I continue to work my program of sobriety.  If we keep our perspective we can appreciate the cultural significance of a life like Robin Williams but focus on the maintenance of our relationships with friends and family in this recovering community to support one another through immediate and profound loss and suffering.
