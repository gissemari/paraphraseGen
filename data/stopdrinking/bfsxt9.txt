Ended up relapsing in December 2018 and continued to drink smoke weed and do kratom up until now. ..I like smoking weed I love drinking and I love the contentness that kratom gives me but it all subtracts from my bigger purpose in life. ..I want to be present I want to succeed at my endeavours professionally and personally. I want to be there for my partner and my family but I can't fully commit when I'm stoned or drunk. ..I will not drink with you today but my sobriety date will be tomorrow because I already took kratom. Thanks &lt;3
