After an extended period of sobriety I have come to realize that not only was I self-medicating with alcohol to treat my social anxiety but I was also using it to battle my ADD. After I quit drinking I was having a terrible time concentrating and struggling to get even the simplest tasks done throughout the day. (Have you ever cut only *half* of your fingernails???) I talked to my doctor about my troubles. He suggested that during my drinking I was using alcohol as a "numbing agent" of sorts to quiet down the stimuli that was bombarding my brain all day. SO TRUE. I always felt like a heavy alcohol buzz helped me concentrate and get stuff done. In the past I had tried stimulant-based medications such as Adderall and Vyvanse but I had to quit because they made me too irritable and made me *very thirsty* for alcohol. My doctor put me on a non-stimulant treatment for ADD and my therapist introduced me to regular meditation. HOLY SHIT...what a game-changer. I've been getting so much more done in the day. My wife thinks I've been kidnapped by aliens and replaced with an impostor. I don't take being on medication lightly but it has really helped in the last few weeks. Meditation has had a profound change on my mood and anxiety as well. Now if I could only control my Reddit and SD habit...
