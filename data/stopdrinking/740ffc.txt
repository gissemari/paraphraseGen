The only thing that everyone who succeeds has in common is that they tried one more time than they failed.  Keep on keeping on   you can do this! I won't drink with you today  :)
And I'll bet you've had a lot less to drink between December and now than you did before you started this process! You're back here now that's what matters. It's a process and relapse is a part of that process for almost everyone. Remember that drinking on one day doesn't invalidate all of the days you decided not to drink since you started trying...I will not drink with you today!
