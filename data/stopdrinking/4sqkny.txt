Trigger warning: discussion of suicide depression anxiety..Hi all and thank you for reading this. This happened yesterday (July 12) and I feel a strong need to write about it to help process it.  I also posted this on depression forums so if you have an account there you might see it there too...Any feedback and thoughts are welcome...General background info: I am a 31yo woman diagnosed with depression/anxiety at age 14 OCD in my late teens and finally Asperger's syndrome at 25 (the mental health issues are related to the aspegers). I take 90mg Cymbalta 400mg Neurontin and 25mg of Seroquel daily. When I was a kid in the 80s and 90s professionals in North America did not know about Aspergers. Drank throughout my 20s and went to rehab in Sept 2015 had almost 10 months of sobriety until yesterday...Context of what happend yesterday: I graduated in 2010 with a masters in social work (MSW). Due to the recession I was unemployed for 13 months and became an alcoholic during that time. I got a couple of awful abusive jobs by removing my education from my resume. I was also fired from one when they pressured me into disclosing my aspergers diagnosis. The job I have right now was hard won and I got it through my then-fiance (now husband). However we got a new manager in the spring and since then I have been targeted for bullying. Due to this I applied for another job in my company one that requires the credentials I have. I went through three interviews and today got an email that I didn't get the job...What happend yesterday:..I've been on scheduled vacation since last week so I wasn't at work. When I got the rejection email I felt such anger and pain rise within me like a black cloud. All of the pain disappointment shame and anger about my past failures just rushed to the surface and I felt knocked down. All I could think about was not having the pain of rejection and humiliation because I am going back to work in the same office where I interviewed and where 5 people were trying to help me get this job. I am also in debt and can't get out of it due to my low wages... Unfortunately my husband is unable/unwilling to help as this is credit card debt brought on by too much spending. I am paying it off slowly but at this rate it will take 3 years to pay it off and I'm still short of money every month...When I was a new grad in 2010 all the jobs on offer required 3-5 years of experience In my first interview for this job the recruiter said that if my MSW had been from 2016 instead of 2010 I'd be a shoo-in. But I didn't get the job so my $16 000 degree is apparently worthless...The anger and pain was so much that I texted my husband that I was going to the liquor store. I was so angry I just needed to feel different and it didn't care if it sparked up my addiction again I went and bought two beers brought em home and cracked one open. I also found the champagne bottle that my coworkers gave me when I got married popped it open and slugged from it...When I was an undiagnosed Aspie I used to come home from school every day feeling as though my skin were crawling with bugs and a racing thumping heart brought on by constant vigilance for bullying and ridicule. I was a ball of anxious nerves after a full day of teasing and bullying from students and teachers I used to play my favourite music and sing along and somehow this helped me get the emotions out. Some days I would sing the same song on repeat for hours. ..Back to today. After knocking over some chairs and punching the wall a few times and sobbing into the bed I put on some of my favourite wallowing music and lay face down on the floor sobbing lifting my head only to drink. I continued to text my husband things like "this proves that I'm useless and worthless" and "I wish I could go back in time to 1985 and kill myself when I was born so I wouldn't have to live this pain right now"...finally my husband texted back "help is on the way". I thought it meant he was coming home. I was blasting Alanis Morissette's song "Sympathetic Character" and emotionally singing along to try and get my feelings out when the door of our apartment burst open and four cops came pouring in. Two of them immediately took the bottle of Alcohol from my hands and handcuffed me while another turned off the music. An older lady cop identified herself as a nurse and started asking me if I knew why they were there blah blah blah as other cops looked around our messy apartment. I was crying and couldn't look her in the eye and she kept telling me to do so. She asked if I was erally going to jump off the balcony like I texted mu husband which I never said. She asked if I was doing for for attention and given the choice between the two and her insistende that I answer I said "attention". ..They asked me what happend and when I explained about the job which ironically was to be a telephone crisis counsellor and the lady cop told me I was hardly improving my case for getting the job by doing this...Eventualy my husband came and they said we were going to the hospital. They drove me to the hospital in the back of their squad car still cuffed. It was 37 degrees Celsius in Toronto today and my hair was sticking to my face while my nose was pouring as I cried and I could not move my hands to clean my face...At the hospital they still kept me cuffed as they walked me through emerg. The waiting area was standing room only and every single head turned to look; I never thought I'd have to do a perp walk. Thankfully they took us behind the doors immediately but they made us sit down while they waited for the doctors to see me. I was still handcuffed. The mean lady cop approached me with a handful of paper towels and wiped my face for which I was grateful if not mortified...(When they arrested me from the house and my husband was gathering my things I asked him to put a figure of my autistic special interest character in my purse (Dr Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park - I carry his action figure with me everywhere especially to social events that make me nervous). When we were waiting to be seen by the doctor my husband put my Ian figure in my handcuffed hands. It made me feel better to have Ian with me. The nicer cop tried to make conversation about the figures but I was in shock and could only cry harder when I thought of Ian seeing me like this.)..i guess when they realized I wasn't going to be aggressive they took off the cuffs. I blew my nose hard in gratitude (I'm also getting over a nasty cold)...Finally the ER Doctor spoke to me and whatever I said it made him sign a paper that I was a significant danger to myself and others and must see the crisis team. At that point they put us in another room where we waited the betrer part of an hour for the nurse and psychiatrist to come in. By the time they got there the shock of everything had started to affect my stomach and I vomited several times even though I hadn't eaten anything in over 12 hours. The psychiatrist even left the room at one point when I couldn't stop vomiting and therefore couldn't answer his questions to take care of the other patients. I also had a massive headache on the back left side of my head that throbbed and screamed in pain every time I moved much less retched. They did bring me Advil and water but it was nearly impossible to keep it down...the psych made a helpful recommendation that I can take my usual nighttime drug (seroquel)vin the day if I'm feeling bad. Since coming home from the hospital I have taken advantage...After talking to me and my husband and feeling confident I would be safe they released us. By then my body was done and just wanted to sleep the physical and mental pain away but we had to get home.  When we did I collapsed in bed and immediately had a dream I was admitted to the hospital because all of my bones were broken and my best friend (who lives in another country) and husband were there...In the end I had drunk about half a tall boy of beer and maybe one or two standard drinks of champagne. We don't have any more alcohol in the house and I do not feel any cravings. I have an appointment with my addictions Doctor/psychiatrist on Friday that was scheduled long before this incident...Thank you for reading this it is so helpful to get it all of it out. Feedback/questions are welcome!
