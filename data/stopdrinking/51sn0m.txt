I haven't checked into stop drinking in a long time. I had actually lost track of how many days sober I had so I came here to discover it's been 110 days since my last drink. Damn! Seems like it's been years other times it seems only yesterday that I was hopelessly devoted to drinking my life away. ..For those of you struggling to make through the first week - hang in there! I was thinking last night of the expression "Do something today that your future self will thank you for." Here's a partial list of the ways not drinking has improved my life...* I've started playing guitar again. Picked up a beautiful Fender Telecaster yesterday..* I'm more available to my children not slurring my way through bedtime stories more patient.* Sober sex with my wife is way better (and more frequent) than drunk sex..* No longer have muscle cramps in my legs and back at random intervals.* My hemorrhoids have gone away (TMI?).* I remember what I did last night! .* I'm feeling more grateful and enjoying each day more...What has sobriety given back to you?...

I thought of another thing - I've lost almost 10 pounds without even trying (50 more and I'll be back to my "fit" weight).
Holy cow that's awesome!  ..Mine gave me back the present tense.  I'm not ticking down the moments until I can get wasted skipping hours in the day or days in the week until I can get loaded.  Or begging for time to pass to give me relief from the hangover.
Nice! Congrats on 110! So glad you're enjoying the benefits of not drinking :).
I no longer wake up in the middle of the night in terror wondering if I had disposed of all bottles before anyone could find them. Sometimes I would sneak out to my car in the middle of the night in my underwear to make sure I didn't leave any empties in there. So yeah it's given me worry free nights.
