So one thing I've been struggling with is how I managed to develop a psychological addiction (+ get to the point of physical dependence) when I usually have a lot of self-control. I'm the type of person who has no problem fasting to lose weight etc. In fact I was anorexic once. Self-denial is usually not an issue for me...On the other hand I am a bit what psychs call "disinhibited" meaning having fewer "brakes" than most people less desire to stop from going to excess. So unless I make the very conscious decision to stop I keep going. Unlike most people who I hear don't really enjoy the 5th or 7th drink - baffling but apparently true...I think what happened is I built up a tolerance during socially condoned drinking and then reached a bad point in my life where I didn't *want* to exercise self-control. To stop yourself from drinking yourself to death you have to believe it's important for you not to die. You have to believe your life and health is valuable and worth making an effort for. For me at one point I felt so guilty about something I'd done in the past I didn't feel like I was worth the effort...With the desire for excess + built-up tolerance + mild psychological addiction ready to go it only took a month or so of half-hearted self-control to really slip into some bad places. And now of course the physical dependence + psychological addiction is much stronger and harder to beat. I'm at least glad I figured out how I got here hopefully this might be useful for other people in this situation.
