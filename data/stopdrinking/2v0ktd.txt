**By not drinking.**..*The End.*..###How a Theist Gets Sober...###..**By not drinking.**..*The End.*....Our paths are far more similar than they are different...##Whether we walk crawl or roll along we are moving towards the same objective a life free of the shackles of alcohol.##....As an atheist I STRUGGLED to figure out how I would find the support I needed to get and stay sober without being turned-off or away by the theists of the world.  ..It started with THIS sub...It turns out I don't have to believe in GOD or go to AA but it does help to believe in something...**I believe in me.**  After years of self-assessment religious evaluation and thousands of tuition dollars I find that my faith is set best in myself....And my belief or lack there of is no indication of another's beliefs and there validity.  ..**Beliefs are personal.  Just like feelings.**..Security in one's beliefs can best be demonstrated in the acceptance of the right of others to hold different beliefs...**"This is my way.  What is your way? There is no "way."**.......

I'm also atheist and don't go to AA but I made sure to have a support structure with regular therapy. But hey if AA works for others by all means go to AA.
Well said. I am a theist but I am glad /r/stopdrinking does not promote any dogma.  We are simply here to support one another regardless of the path one has chosen to recovery.
This!
Don't get too worked up over it. The person who started this whole thing did it on purpose. He knew he was lying. This is what people do.   This is how people are. 
exactly how I feel. I have always believed in me.
As an anti-theist this really hits home. Thanks for giving me hope for the future! 
whatever works for you man. Way to go.
Awesome this makes so much sense to me now..I share the same feelings. 
Yep it's all about not drinking. My wish for all of you in this sub is to never again to have a hangover or sober up (unless your new ;) ).

not being a cunt...but you have 101 days    maybe chill a little with the my way works angle until it... i dont know....does.    AA atheist checking in is all.   to each their own and all plenty of ways to do it
I'm an agnostic. I like to keep it to myself and I expect the same in return from theists but I'll expand a bit on it in the interest of debate...I agree with you 100%. To use the AA programme as an analogy I would say that my higher power is the potential I can achieve by avoiding alcohol and using that time and energy to get to that higher power...Not drinking? My mind is sharper..Not drinking? I'm in the gym breaking a sweat...Etc etc. The "higher power" is the potential I am achieving in slow increments  but structured such that I am getting some fulfillment out of the work I'm putting in which gives me more power and builds me up. Damn this sounds cheesy as hell! I never write like this....To finish up I discovered recently that you can be spiritual without being religious. To me that means hoping loved ones who have passed are no longer suffering missing them hoping if indeed we do ever meet them again that they're having fun and are happy. We're allowed to feel great kinship with the people we are close to and by doing that I think we are "spiritually" fulfilled. Sorry if that doesn't make any sense in say a Christian context...Those are some of the tools in my arsenal that I use to keep me on the wagon. And lots of tea! :P...Anyway I kind of just brain spewed that. I'll expand on bits that are unclear if you want.
Damn.  I wish everyone on this site would write with big letters and bold like that.  I can barely read this sometimes!  I have to pump up the zoom on IE to read the regular type but it also pumps up the ad banner thing on the right edge.  My eyes suck.  Anyway kick ass on 101 days! :)
This is a great discussion thanks everyone.  I agree that ANYONE can get sober despite themselves.  I will say that I personally love AA in that I learned how to ask people for help.  That certainly isn't the only means for self help.  AA was designed to help ANYONE stay sober but many times the meetings can certainly fall short of that and to this day that is disappointing to me.  However some of the best advice I got is that even being willing to go to AA meetings isn't enough to keep me sober.  I have to be willing to live sober to stay sober.  I hope that everyone that seeks the teachings and is willing to go to any length to get the knowledge finds what they are looking for.  I am certainly grateful that I am today!
Thank you for the wise observation /u/dynastiesdiedaily...Having had experience in AA I can say it was not the religion-based content with which I had trouble connecting.  For me the group and social based model coupled with (what I felt was) a very male-centric recovery program meant that it did not fit my needs alone.  ..That being said there is so much to be learned from people in AA about life without drinking.  Understanding the "language and culture" of sober living based on my time involved with AA has made it much easier to get off of alcohol and continue to make a daily commitment not to pick up a drink - including finding and learning how to depend on this sub for the best support it can offer...I connected with both long term members and newcomers and I am depending on some of those contacts these days...Thank you to everyone for all of the thought-provoking and informative comments.
My husband and I are both well over a year. No gods no AA.

The "Higher Power" thing has kept many people from seeking help with AA myself included...I understand that there are many more people than not who need that aspect of AA. I guess it gives them a sense of connectedness...Whatever works right...Anyway I've always felt that AA'ers don't give themselves enough credit for their sobriety. They became sober their "Higher Power" didn't do it for them...Besides we don't stop drinking just to stop drinking we do so in an effort to become a better person...AA and other "God based" programs help people to become a better person...That ain't a bad thing.
Congrats on your 102 days!  I'm an agnostic.  Reality teaches me what I need to learn and provides me with various activities from day to day.  The actions I take in life **now** are based on the lessons I have learned from past actions.  The knowledge I have gained from experience has more value than all of the knowledge gained in the course of attaining two degrees.  Also I'm an admirer of Nietzsche and these are my favorite quotes from him-  .."Later around the middle of life to be sure I decided more and more strictly against all 'spirits': I . . . cannot advise all more spiritual natures earnestly enough to abstain entirely from alcohol. Water is sufficient."  ..AND  .."here and there [my books] achieve the highest thing achievable on earth cynicism . . . ."  ..(He's referring to the philosophy of the Cynic philosophers not the cynicism of our modern age.)
The support and tools I get from [SMARTrecovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/) has helped me stay sober.  The community here at r/stopdrinking has helped too.  I am glad a secular science based program for addiction recovery is out there.
