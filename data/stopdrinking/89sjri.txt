SOOOO after my jubilant post for my 60 days as I suspected I would I drank. ..A family member is here visiting me and I knew that I would drink at some point. I had however accepted and made peace with this fact as a part of my journey and I had 2 glasses of beautiful red wine with dinner. ..No more no less and no cravings for more whatsoever. ..I've had worse relapses but this one was... dare I say it... anticipated embraced and enjoyed...Reset please!

I relapsed this weekend.  I went to my AA home group this morning and someone shared that because of the steps/program we have the tools to pick ourselves up after we fall instead of staying down...Great point.  Even this sub is a great tool...IWNDWYT!
Whew. It could have been that moonshine Firewater!
