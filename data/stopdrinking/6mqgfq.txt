I'm doing well with my latest attempt to stop drinking but I can't forgive myself for the amount of money I blew in my last spree. It's making me sick...Basically   I inherited some money at the start of the year and ended up blowing 60k Australian by not working paying off bills/debt and drinking/drugging...Even though I'm clean now and my life is getting much better I can't get over the resentment of how much I spent...I feel like I blew my one chance to perhaps buy an apartment (in Sydney it's almost impossible to buy without family money)...I feel like I'm alone and the only person to have ever made such a mistake...If anyone else blew a load of money like I did how did you make peace with it and move on?..I feel like I disrespected the family member who gave me the money and I will never see that amount of cash ever again...Thanks all and hope you're doing well with your own struggles.
