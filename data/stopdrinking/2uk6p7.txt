AA meeting always made me wanna go right to the liquor store after . I'm struggling with some serious self loathing issues  and or mental health issues. i think if i wasn't such a coward id fucking kill myself  but alas i am what i am (not popeye ) . been fighting the urge not to open this beer in front of me. but ive lost that battle now . feel free to chime in if anyone feels there is somewhere else better suited for where im at .. thx

This absolutely sounds like the place for you. Many here have experienced self-loathing...it's a common theme...Please come back when you haven't been drinking. We'd love to have you here but as the sidebar says: For everyone on the subreddit and for the sake of your own recovery please only participate here when you're sober...Do come back. This is a wonderful place full of people who understand.
Sounds like you are suffering the same stuff as many here so maybe it is the right place. Stick around for awhile get involved read people's stories and you will see that people who started where you are can and do reach a much better place.  Please don't hurt yourself things can definitely improve. I don't know you and I believe you are worth fighting for. 
I lurked around this subreddit for a month before deciding to stop drinking alcohol (bring on the club soda). After reading the tales of many who felt better I finally decided I was worth feeling good too. I am my own worst friend and best enemy but I think maybe just maybe quitting alcohol will go a long way to silencing my internal critic. Perhaps this will be true for you as well. I hope you come back tomorrow.
