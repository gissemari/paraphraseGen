Insistent nervous banging on my door the dawn smearing the humidity of this place across a dishwater sky a sky the color of gravel and runoff of water tainted. I tumble into awake...The assistant platoon leader my reluctant relief asking if I'm coming with him. I pull on a t shirt step into some sneakers and emerge. I am sober again. I have resumed the struggle not even knowing how many times I have done this clear headed lean and nervous and purposeless. I have stopped counting. I have stopped seeing the faces of the boys. I cannot run my eyes over the ones I love the most an outsider watching the warm dull flicker of this life's soft small films so beautiful and so full of promise so I ignore the faces surrounding me here thousands of miles from the place my real work lies coiled massive a burden I made out of love and devotion so fervent it defines me stronger than I could ever hope to be...These are my boys yes. I lead them. But I do not know them and don't want to. This platoon is just a body of men I listlessly pull through the days. They aren't mine. I am not one of them...I had a platoon. My own platoon and we were fierce woven into one another and fired bloodied each one a giant of humanity each Sailor a vessel of sullied wisdom and pure fucking heart. I did not lead them I led with them and we were a secret unacknowledged isolated forgotten and heartbreakingly loyal to one another. We were a light platoon proud and punching far far above our weight. We were the Goddamn experts the fucking professionals even when it all came tumbling down bruising us lacerating our hides and rocking our bones our veins and muscle and souls into unnatural obscene contortions...Time burnt down. There are three of us now shattered and forgotten haunting the green choked terrain under the soiled moisture saturated sky of this isolated place. We are hollow...The emptiness vibrates through me  forcing my scarred shoulders into a slump as I don my armor taking in the filthy now-searing sky of a jungle morning...The comfort is distant coming only in minute pieces. The familiar press of the plates into my chest the reassuring dig of the harness into my clavicle the filthy nylon and ceramic compressing my battered lumbar as my torso and kit become one - it is the smallest comfort. I rest my forearms on the grease-sodden pouches now holding only empty magazines and it is not without some bitterness that I begin my exercises forcing the soon-carrion of my body into movement. ..The foul sky begins to release it's burden salt and rain running into my eyes mingling with clean sober sweat soaking me. I am sober again. But even before the sun makes it's slothful lethargic approach into the heavens I feel my shadow growing. One foot begins to fall in front of its' mate. My calves and thighs burn. The old pain rattles though my throat and lungs. Forearms and chest strain pulling myself over obstacles ascending my broken frame following my eyes rooting only on the place I need to be in a moment then the next and another. I am sober. There is no joy in this anymore. This is automatic a function of nerve and muscle just like drawing breath...Sober. Staring into a treeline that no longer conceals danger. The land is pacified swaddled and complacent even the predators move languidly. The irritating vibration the hum of of filthy overworked diesels no longer screws into my skeleton my brain slowly pulling me into oily fitful sleep - it is absent. I no longer crane my neck over the salted dim radar communing with a moon silhouetting dull weaving guns. A shadow looms long eternal taking on weight and form tracking my fevered movement around a shrinking globe. It is silent massive and shapeless accusing.  ..The gravel still exacts it's tribute blood staining the knees of my trousers ankles and elbows bent at unnatural angles as I raise my weapon to my shoulder. There is no face shining with pespiration tongue fat and craving water eyes wide and focused with fear just beyond the matte black cage of my muzzle. There is no threat in front only a dark pool to my rear reaching across time and smothering memory...There is only a paper target ahead a reminder of an enemy no longer present tacked to rotted plywood and placidly absorbing my rounds. I feel empty the hollow within wider and sharper as I slowly lumber further from alcohol my bitter serpent of a companion...I squeeze the trigger. The carbine cracks once twice three times. Holes appear in the green silhouette's head and chest the incongruous twang of the buffer ringing in my ears. There are no more enemies. This is automatic a bodily function. I do not have to think a small mercy my mind consumed with the things I wish to saw off of my memory and cast into this violent turquoise sea...I circle my bed a cheap pallet of springs and foam a vulture not ready to commit. When I lay down in the dark the wash of the ceiling fan slapping the blades of the blinds against the slit of my window I feel a keen piercing loneliness. My shadow is there. Not malevolent not kind either. It is a part of me worn living. ..I am sober. I am resigned to the fight again. There are no more enemies and no more wars for me. Only my love my isolation my muted will...I will rise again tomorrow. The long stain of my guilt the accumulated misdeeds of a life lived poorly will rise with me to follow at my heels a faithful tragic shadow.

As my shadow follows me away from the battlefield I look back and reflect on the things it went through with me then turn my face away from the killing fields and up to the sun in a wide blue sky.
