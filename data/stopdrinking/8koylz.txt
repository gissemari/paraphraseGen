so much has changed in these 10 months. I poured my heart and soul into being able to work a job i wanted to- and finally i can say it's what i'm doing. .I moved to the country i fell in love with many years ago and always wanted to live in. .I have friends again..Of course not all is good. I still struggle with anxiety and sometimes sobriety and abstinence from my multiple addictions can feel suffucating...But i have you...I know that when i struggle i'll have people to support me who know exactly what i'm going through. People from all walks of life from all countries.....When i'm sad i can read your stories of your accomplishments of joys small and big and feel happy again...there is always wisdom here from many different stories...lives made better by not drinking...i do believe i would not be 300 days sober if it hadn't been for r/stopdrinking and its amazing community...thank you...Ps: they don't sell LaCroix in the country i moved to either. So that particular love of the community will continue to elude me. My collection of herbal infusions grows every day tho. My goal is to have a different one for every day of the week!
