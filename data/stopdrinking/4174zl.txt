Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Motivational..**"To change a habit make a conscious decision then act out the new behavior." - [Maxwell Maltz](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/maxwellmal157451.html?src=t_decision)**..*What I get from it:* I tend to do better with a plan and a course of action.  [I realized this pretty quickly](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d6/2e/10/d62e10e5ae5ebc8bc0dde8f2a5ccd30f.jpg) when I decided to stop drinking; I absolutely had to make a decision and then act out choices and ways of behavior that supported that [firm decision.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2f/ed/b1/2fedb174ef754a15fb0eafea9de4178d.jpg) It wasn't really easy at first but I got used to it.  I guess in a way I acted my way into better thinking bc these days I don't even really think about doing what I know works for me to stay sober and keep from relapsing. It's just part of my daily routine and [I'm grateful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CerbImsPsqw) to have it...Have an awesome day all!
----------immediate responses--------

As a drinker I didn't like doing that - "making conscious decisions". I had succumbed to a lifestyle of responding to my brain's whims. Whether that be drinking instead of not drinking eating a pizza instead of a salad taking a day off of work when I wasn't sick and had no real reason to do so avoiding social confrontation etc etc etc...I avoided responsibility. That first "conscious decision" - to not drink - wasn't easy. But it cascaded into a truly wonderful change in my life. Good quote.
KJ that sounds just like the first [Baby Step!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
I made the "conscious decision" and I used pure willpower in those first few days. It worked for as long as I expected. Then I used SD as my support network and made an effort to post and check in to remain accountable to somebody else (for once). When I started to make that decision daily (at the suggestion of /u/coolcrosby and the baby steps as well as great advice from /u/pollyannapusher) I started to change. I was willing to do whatever it took to get and stay sober. /u/KetoJam is right in that it's not easy but fuck it's so worth it! Happy Saturday!
