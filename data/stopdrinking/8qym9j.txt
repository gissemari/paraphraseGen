I recently started up the keto diet again (I stopped after a relapse in drinking a while back and became super dehydrated and ended up in the ER) and having a goal has really helped curb the cravings for booze! The only times I really think about it now is early in the morning when I stay up too late but by then I play games or go to bed...So happy with this journey and I've lost 10 lbs! IWNDWYT! Or ever! Soda water for me

Yay! I recently fell off the keto wagon but trying to get back on. Soda water cheers! 
I started strict keto again 7 days after sobriety. I lost 10 lbs so far as well. glad I found another r/stopdrinking &amp; r/ketp buddy. 
Congrats on 25 days. ..I looked at the Keto diet that everyone in the Fasting group was on about. I think definitely a change in diet helps when removing booze. I've moved to a primarily vego diet with Juice and veggies/salads as night. I think I'm using this month to create new eating patterns and yes dropping a kg/lbs would be nice too. ..Good job on the weight loss and 25 days so far.. won't drink wtih you tonight. 
Doing the same thing! I'm having virtually no cravings since. Lost 10 pounds this month without the extra calories from alcohol &amp; doing keto.
The Keto has helped me for sure with quitting booze. Lost 8 lbs as of last Friday however gotten a little lax on the Keto lsst 2 days as sugar cravings kicked  up last night and tonight so  I'll satisfy that way before booze if it comes down to it ! 
I remember doing keto while drinking. All my carbs were saved for low carb beer. I was an idiot. Then I heard drinking stalls ketosis as well. You and the comments make me want to do it again. IWNDWYT &amp; KCKO! Thanks for the post.
