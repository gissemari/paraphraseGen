I've been lurking for a while and was jealous of all of you for being able to stop drinking even when some of you had relapses. Thursday night I got way too drunk and vowed Friday to stop drinking. ..So far I made it! I got some pomegranate and blueberry V8s and drank those instead. Yesterday for the Super Bowl my husband bought a 6-pack of cider which is my favorite. I started to reach in for one and remembered how shitty I feel after drinking and grabbed a water off the top shelf instead. I did get a good laugh over the V8s because I was complaining about the calories and sugar before I realized I never had an issue with those things when alcohol was involved. ..Anyway thank you all for staying strong and inspiring others. I will not drink with you today!
