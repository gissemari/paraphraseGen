Hey SD..So I've been drinking again and thought I had it under control... but then my emotions got the worst of me...Although I haven't fucked up physically I'm having a hard time barring this weight on my shoulders. I am not happy with myself... and I think quitting alcohol and seeing a therapist is in order...I will be resetting my badge soon. I have to get rid of some stuff at home and then I'll be good to go! ..Thanks for listening and being there as always.

Welcome back. I hope you manage to find a little peace. I will not drink with you today.
Have you thought that you might need some medication?  I used alcohol to help me sleep.  Good luck to you.
