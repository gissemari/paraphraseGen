TW: Self-harm......If you are reading this it is because you have likely felt that something about your life is not right and maybe you'd like to change it. ..Know that even though you might be a perfect stranger I am glad you're here and I want you to get well and I want you to succeed and that this sobriety might be the hardest thing you ever do but it is so worth it. YOU are worth it. ..I am telling you this because others have been kind enough to tell me this when I have struggled and I must pass it along. ..I won't lie to you and say that this work is easy - it's not. I have 19 months sober and tomorrow I am checking myself back into therapy and getting my medications changed because I had a panic attack that lasted a whole week couldn't get out of bed for 3 days couldn't eat for 5 days thought about self-harm (though luckily didn't go about it) told myself every moment that I was a terrible person who deserved to be hated and yes - I did in fact think about whiskey. ..But I finally got up out of bed took a shower took my dog to the park and went to my AA meeting. ..I am up against no small odds. Both of my parents suffered from severe mental illness (and it killed them both) and I am no stranger to the darkness myself...But I am going to fight. I am going to try a new medication. I am going to do the homework my therapist assigns me. I am going to go to my AA meetings. Because I believe in my life and I believe in hope and I believe I am worth fighting for. ..You - no matter how far down your  rock bottom  might be no matter how worthless you might feel no matter how many mistakes you've made - you are worth fighting for too. And I hope you'll fight. ..Something that I heard in my meeting tonight that will probably help me forever (and I hope it helps you):.. If I go into the work of sobriety expecting myself to be perfect I have already failed.  ..You can do this. You won't be perfect but you don't need to be. And I just want to say again I'm happy you're here.

Thank You.  Reading this really helped.  Anxiety has been a big problem for me and a major contributor to my drinking (the other one being pain which of course triggers more anxiety).  I spent my first 3 days too panicked to sleep or do anything.  Then I spent a week in a mental hospital where I stayed freaking out.  I'm hoping desperately the meds they gave me in the hospital will keep major panic at bay but I live in fear of living a life of fear.  Right now is especially hard because all the mental health care stuff is on hold while the staff shifts around and I stabilize my chronic health problems.  It's so easy to get overwhelmed when life gets like this and do something stupid.  
On the mental health side of sobriety my largest and most profound break through came between 18 months and 2 years. Hold on tight my friend the shores are rocky; but there is hope for safe harbor and calm seas.
