Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: Got my six month chip(s) this week!  I can't believe how well sobriety SD and AA have worked in my life.

I need to slow down and Take It Easy...General chat: I'm looking at travel in the future any suggestions?
----------immediate responses--------

Congrats! 6/12!..Triumph: started training again. .Struggle: work life balance is complex. The day spa was nicer then work....General chat: travel you say? Maldives Venice east Berlin St. Petersburg? 
Fruits of recovery getting ready for a 3 month road trip.
Triumph: I'm at 37 days my relationship is at it's best in three years I have repeatedly been exposed to/had the opportunity to drink and haven't and I feel amazing. ..Struggles: Seeing a delicious cocktail on a sushi menu last night :(..General: Thanks to everyone here! Also one of my favorite places is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan Lake Huron is beautiful! 
Congrats!!! Trimuph: Sober for another day. Struggle: can't think of any today. General chat: Finishing my new tatoo today
I had a reeeeeeeeeeeeally hard time getting my ass to the gym this morning.  But I went.  And I rocked it.  
Triumph: I really like my local AA meeting but unfortunately when school starts I'll have to find another one. ..Struggle: I've been sick with something for the past week and slowly getting over it. Makes me feel tired. ..General Discussion: Congratulations on six months that's fantastic. The past two days a few thoughts have been running in my mind about long term sobriety. One that I am looking forward to a life of sobriety but also damn it will be hard. Than you keep reminding yourself. One day at a time.
Thanks for posting this!  Congratulations on your 6 months!  That's really awesome...**Triumph**: I've gotten down to 260 lbs.  I weighed ~288 in July.  By cutting down my drinking July through November and stopping completely in November I've really started losing weight getting active and really feeling good about myself...**Struggle**: I'm having a hard time concentrating at work.  I'm sleeping better but I just feel like my head is swimming a lot lately.  I'm hoping that it clears up in a few days and my head gets clear again...**General chat**: I planned a trip to visit my parents in the next month or so.  Looking forward to getting away and taking a few days off from work.  They have a nice hot tub that I'm looking forward to hanging out in.  They are aware of my new-found sobriety and are supportive so I don't expect any problems there.
Hey there hit my first week mark. Feels great except for some pretty strong cravings on Monday. Opened up to my husband and best friend about my drinking. First time I think I've ever really talked honestly about it. Everyone is very supportive (though their first responses were both "just drink less!")  If only. :).  Otherwise my mind is feeling clearer and I've been more productive at home and at work than I have in a long time.  Finally I'd highly reccomend an Alaskan cruise. I did it a few years back and had the time of my life. Plus side too is the Alaska cruises didn't have the same party atmospheres as the Carribean ones seem to. 
Triumph: Been trying to get a little more serious about my running lately and made it to a track workout with a group. Only afterwards did it hit me how ridiculous it would have sounded to me a couple years ago to jog 2 miles to a track put in another 2 miles of speed work there and then jog 2 miles back. But it was the best damn morning all week so far...Struggle: I'm between roles at work right now hanging out while a promotion comes through. Should be fun right with no hard tasks and some slack between the two roles? I HATE waiting and I HATE uncertainty just want it all to be done NOW...General chat: Don't know how exotic you want to get but I've been to South Africa a few times and I think a Safari should be on everyone's bucket list. Paris London Madrid get to those as you can. Make sure you can see wild game while we still have some left..
Triumph: Ran a 10 minute mile and celebrated 100 days! Really excited for both. Got emotional after the run and worked through some stuff on the way home. I feel better...Struggle: The novelty of my decision is wearing off. Had a chat about my sobriety with some friends and it made me think a lot about alcohol...General chat: I dropped $55 on records in one shot. DFA is releasing a remaster of the LCD Soundsystem single 'Yeah' at 45rpm so I pre-ordered the single and got a little carried away buying up more 12" &amp; 7"s. If you have any idea what I'm talking about High-five for being a huge nerd like me!
Triumph - 1 full week was stranded with workmates whilst working out of town and we all went to two pubs and a restaurant - didn't have anything but a coke at each pub and a mango lassi at the Indian restaurant.  Had no problems socialising like I assumed I would in fact it felt exactly like being out drinking except without the sloppiness - I was way sharper and it was much more enjoyable.  Been exercising and have my gym induction tomorrow so I'm gonna get back to lifting weights...Struggles: Every now and then I get caught up reminiscing about drinking with my pals usually after hearing a song or someone else talking...General: I've already achieved something I've never managed to achieve before after joining this community (and it genuinely is thinking back to other people's posts when I get a craving).  I still have yet to attend any meetings so I can definitely attribute it to this place - thank you!
Triumph: Another sober day. My shirts are also starting to fit a bit better after the debauchery of holiday eating...Struggle: Job stress and uncertainty but that is getting better...Travel: Go skiing!
Triumph: Off the waiting list appointment booked on the 23rd for a psychological assessment. Things are progressing ever so slowly. ..Struggle: Every. Thing. is so. damn. hard. I feel like my life is a train-wreck since I've quit drinking. Not regretting the choice but it seems like things have to get worse much much worse for me before they get better. ..Travel... much better in the summer but go to the pacific northwest especially the coast. Oregon Washington B.C. if there is such a place as God's country that's it. But go camping don't stay in a hotel.  I'm getting goosebumps right now just thinking about it.
