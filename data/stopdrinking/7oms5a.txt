I made it 5 days and 4-5 seems to be the magic number when I start to feel completely normal again. It is also the weekend which is a trigger for me. I have a chance to meet some friends - at a bar no doubt- later tonight. I'll be going with my husband which is a golden opportunity for me as we don't often get out together. Two little dolls make it difficult for us!  ..I really want to dress up and go out but I keep obsessing over wanting to have a few drinks or just get some blow and do that instead. (Wtf?!) Yes i remember why I stopped and all the pain associated with it. Somehow my desire to alter my mind is wickedly adept at silencing my logic and good intentions. ..It felt amazing to wake up this morning and experience all five of my senses with a clear mind. I vow to do whatever it takes to get the same tomorrow. I will not let the demons win however loud amd convincing. Just needed to get that out...IWNDWYT

Perhaps consider ditching the bar altogether and just have a date night with your husband?  ..I found "dry people and dry places" was a good strategy especially in the early days.  
Thanks so much
