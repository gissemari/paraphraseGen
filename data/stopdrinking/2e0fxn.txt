Hi SD .So after many ups and downs...periods of a sobriety followed by destructive relapses for seemingly no reason I've decided to really dive into AA (SMART isn't available in my area but the women's group here is actually pretty great) but in addition as a stepping stone  I got the Vivitrol injection yesterday. Without getting into too much about why I decided this was the best course  I'm just curious about other people's experiences with it.  I'm trying to keep an eye out for side effects (mostly concerned about depression) without subconsciously manifesting side effects cause I think they should be there (does that make sense?) Anyway enough rambling...just interested in any info from others who have taken it.  Thanks!

Thanks for posting this...I've read through all the official literature more than once ...just looking for personal experiences.
