I was a very emotional drinker when any emotion got too intense my primary concern was to pour enough alcohol down my neck to numb everything out as soon as humanly possible...Now that I've been in AA for roughly a month I'm struggling with feeling my emotions now that my safety net is gone. I was at a meeting today and my share didn't go well I clammed up and I couldn't get out what I wanted to say. Now that I'm home I feel consumed by vulnerability anxiety dread and sadness. I feel so judged yet the only one who is judging me is well me...I'll be honest I'm desperate to pour myself into a bottle of fortified wine :(..If anyone out there has any advice or could even tell me they've felt like this too I'd love to hear from you. Thank you so much for reading

I'm a very sensitive person and what has worked for me in the past is giving  permission  to myself to feel my feelings. Once I feel them they subside. ..One of my favorite song lyrics about emotions is from Travis Meadows    Push it down it comes out sideways.  ..Keep holding on friend. 
Having a therapist and working the steps with a sponsor led to considerable personal growth in the area of feelings. 
I am the same. I get overwhelmed &amp; alcohol numbs it so fast. Until it made ne even more emotional. One therapist (Gabor Mate) said addiction  anesthetizes the pain of living. ..I have started doing DBT along with AA. The unit on  distress tolerance  has really helped me &amp; their concept of radical acceptance is very similar to the serenity prayer. There are a lot of really good videos on Youtube if you're interested in checking it out. It doesn't replace or compete with AA in my case I find the two really enhance each other.
