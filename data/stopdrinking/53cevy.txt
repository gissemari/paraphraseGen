Ok friday I drank. Sober this weekend. I get my son from my ex hubby tonight and I don't drink when I have him. Really struggling. Three uninteresting beers in on friday and threw out the rest of the six pack. I owe that to the neutonin I call it gabapentin. I will remain sober this week. Somehow someway. If I have to spend friday at my cousins.

Yeah it got to the point where I had just drank away all the good that was left in drinking. How ironic that the thing I turned to for comfort provided me exactly the opposite. That's when I knew I was done...I found that I could not stay sober on my own but if I stayed in the middle of a pack of recovering drunks somehow drink wouldn't find me and I wouldn't find it...That and a little work on myself to address the deeper issues of why I drank like I did to begin with made an immense difference in how much easier it was to stay sober. Once I put enough time between booze and me the allergy of the body died down leaving me with the 'ism the I Self Me. Addressing that in a program of recovery is what kept the obsession of the mind at bay and gave me the mental defenses I needed to stay away from that first drink...Don't give up half way through the miracle--I'll stay sober with you today! :)
Thank you. And I find it is helpful for me mentally to turn down a drink after work by telling the invitor I don't hang out with people who are drinking because they are boring. Helps me to put it like that. Instead of an I can't it's an I dont want to. But when I drink it's usually alone and for varied reasons. Which I am in counseling for.  I like the gaba just because it takes the craving for alcohol in my mind from this end of the world thirst for the last glass of water on earth to eh I may want a piece of chocolate but I want to stick to my diet more. Tones down the level of desire by many degrees
