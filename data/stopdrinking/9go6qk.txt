I am a big fan of the humorous fantasy Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. Samuel Times has always been my favorite character in the series. He is an alcoholic in his first book and his struggles with it were always extremely profound. Since I quit drinking I relate to it even more...Does anyone else have characters that mean more since they quit?

The description of '[knurd](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Knurd)' always reminded me of [Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome)!..I certainly felt pretty *knurd* at times when I first sobered up.....I'm a big fan of Pratchett too!..IWNDWYT

I had started reading the series before I quit and actually sobered up at the same time as I got to the book where he did. It was a fun coincidence that we got to go on that journey together. 
I love Vimes. One of my all time favorite characters. 
Terry always said that Vimes was the character who he most resembled who had the most of the author in him. I have often wondered if Terry might have experienced or been close to problems with alcohol to write so well about it. Off to listen to one of the Sam Vimes audiobooks thanks for the reminder! :-)
