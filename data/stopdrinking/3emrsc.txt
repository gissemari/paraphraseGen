I was out to dinner and ordered a tonic water like I usually do. Took a drink and it had alcohol in it. I set it down on the table. For a minute I wanted to take another drink. But I didn't. It took about four minutes but I picked the cup up walked it to the trash and threw it away. I've come way too far.

I don't know where people here eat dinner but y'all gotta start eating elsewhere.  According to this sub the waitress *whoopsies I brought you alcohol instead of water* incidence rate is like 40%.
This is why I always sniff test!!
Glad you chucked that shit right out. I stay away from mocktails etc when I'm out as it's too dangerous. I tend to order soft bottled drinks like Appletiser J20 as there is no chance of a mix up :)
