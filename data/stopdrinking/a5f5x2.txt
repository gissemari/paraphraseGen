I've been struggling a lot this week as my stupid brain keeps trying to talk me into a relapse. I've wanted nothing more for several days than to post up at my favorite bar where I know and love all the bartenders and have a few beers and just have my old life back for a few hours...I drive past that bar on my way home from work. I decided not to stop...And then as I drove by I gave it the finger.

     hell yes
Haha hell yes!
Good for you! I often blow raspberries at the one pub we have in my town if I go that way when walking the dog. If they had decent food I might be more inclined to go now and then for a meal and a soda water but the food is so bloody awful and expensive the place is full of all the least lovable characters in town so it's just not even on my radar to walk through the doors anymore.
Immature?  Noooo.....That was sensible dude. Way to go.  Congratulations on 68 days. IWNDWYT  
That wasn't at all how I expected this post to end but I'm glad that's how it ended. Thanks for the laugh.
