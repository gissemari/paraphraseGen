9 weeks and 2 days ago I had my last drink. I decided for many reasons to quit but the main reason was my anxiety. Which it has significantly improved. After a month I decided if I can give up something I enjoy to better myself then I can give up something I hate. I smoked my last cigarette a month and a day ago. Cold turkey. Being able to do these things helped me realize that I can do whatever I set my mind to so in January I'll be giving up social media aside from Reddit and a few other things. Anyways to the point when I gave up drinking it was for my anxiety. Like I said it is now significantly better. During this time I realized there's this fog. It's in my head. I feel... sluggish. I am constantly at a loss of words. My vocabulary isn't what it used to be. I don't seem to be able to focus. I noticed these things when I quit smoking. I started reading again and I read a lot slower than I used to I struggle with words I know and half the time I can't focus and end not even paying attention to what I just read. That got me thinking about the fog you get when you consume lots of harmful things for long periods of time. I guess if I have any questions in this rambling they would have to be:..Anyone here who has been sober for a few months or better gained a clearer mind? Am I at a loss? Will this be me from now on? Is this something my brain is going to have to spend a lot of time getting back to normal? ..No matter what I'm told I won't be driven back to drink. So any information on this topic is acceptable. Thanks in advance.

I quit smoking for good about six years ago after about 15 years. (This was before I had developed the drinking problem I'm here to solve.) That quitting-smoking blues of the kind you're describing took oh a good year to fully clear for me and caused me to fail to quit on multiple prior occasions.  I'm only about 7 weeks into quitting alcohol and I'll say that already I don't feel much lingering malaise like I did with nicotine. Of course YMMV..
For me the brain fog has taken months to subside. I still feel it though not so intensely as I did when I first quit. But it is really crazy how I noticed week to week my mental faculties regaining clarity yet it's still a work in progress. I've had to retrain myself on how to focus especially since alcohol was my "creativity crutch." I relied on it to get the juices flowing with just about *everything* I did. I'm a writer musician painter...it is still hard to get over the fact that I can't use alcohol to "help" me with my projects! Then again leading up to when I quit it was more a destructive force than a creative one! Long story short these past months I've noticed a significant improvement in the dissolution of my brain fog and I can only hope it will continue to improve. Everything's a bit more vibrant now (including books). So keep pushing along because I have a feeling you'll notice the same as you continue your sober journey.
