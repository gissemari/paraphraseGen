One week sober today I've been struggling with wanting to quit and only making it to day five while still pining for booze. ..I woke up last week and just didn't feel like drinking that day and then the next. I feel pretty good there are no cravings and no insomnia this time. I also wanted to say thanks for all the inspiration.

Good job! Keep going IWNDWYT
Hey man. Good job. About to hit four months myself. When I first started I found myself on this subreddit every day. This is my first time posting in 3 months or so. That should tell you a lot about where you're headed. It's not easy but you've gotten over the hard part.
