Hey everyone!..Just wanted to check in. I'm about 5 days away from 4 months sober and I feel great. My grades have been awesome this semester I've lost 65lbs and found a new hobby I love (weightlifting) all thanks to the support of you guys and a few close friends. Reading everyone's stories really helped me deal with your own issues and figure out solutions. I never thought I could make sobriety a lifestyle but here I am. Literally every part of my life has changed for the better. I don't miss drinking at all. So if you're struggling in your first few weeks let me tell you first hand it gets better. We're all gonna  make it!

Keep up the good work! Have you been able to identify what triggers you've had in the past and what you'll do if they pop up again? 
Congratulations! :)
