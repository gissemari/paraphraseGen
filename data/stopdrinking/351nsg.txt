Woot Woot Wednesday! Guess what day it is? No really. [GUESS!!](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/11/90/5d/11905dba9e19018fd7b5cdf763a9bb60.jpg)..[Let's hump it out](http://3guys1movie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/00011.jpg). Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph**: I ran a race this week faster than I did fifteen years ago. I am healthier and fitter now than maybe I've ever been. As someone who has struggled with weight and fitness for years it's a great feeling. And yup I owe it to being sober. ..**Struggle**: I've never dealt well with uncertainty. I prefer life to be black and white and before when faced with the unavoidable grey bits I would get anxious and uncomfortable and just decide to throw up my hands and start drinking. Now I can't do that and I have to sit around in the discomfort and experience the uncertainty. This week I am working hard to accept those things I can't change or control. It's tough...**General Chat**: I love reading all your posts about the great things that are going on in your lives. And I can relate to SO MUCH of your struggles. I just wanted to throw a quick thanks in here and let you all know that the time you take to post and comment here is so appreciated. Every morning I see something that speaks to me and it helps me stay sober that day. [SD fist bump](http://cdn.attackofthecute.com/August-05-2012-02-04-20-fistbump.jpg)!..More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:**  I am not going to drink TODAY which means that I will not relapse TODAY...**Struggle:** Still struggling with my feelings around financial debt (especially to the IRS) and implications for the my life autonomy and options going forward...**General Chat:** I love the SD newcomers and the power of example as they confront and overcome their obstacles.  I'm super proud of the young SD mods that have stepped up to do service work on the Sub and I hope that we will see lots of others come along as the population of this recovery community continues to expand.  ..Let's do this!
**Triumph:** I seem to have gotten over some urges I was feeling for awhile off and on.  Never did anything about them but they eventually passed!..**Struggle:** Have been super emotional lately.  I gotta stop watching sad tv shows and reading sad books because it's not helping!..**General Chat:** I am doing an argument in the United States Court of Appeals today and I'm equal parts excited and nervous (actually like 1 part excited 5 parts nervous)!
**Triumph:** My wife's family was in town last weekend and they wanted to go to a new brewpub in our neighborhood for dinner. I contemplated not going because I didn't want to be the odd man out not trying the beer but I went and it was really easy. I wasn't tempted at all by everyone passing around their beer for others to taste...**Struggle:** Last weeks struggle was work but what I'm starting to realize is the problem isn't work it's my way of thinking. My strive for perfection and wanting everything to be a certain way. I need to learn to 'accept the things I cannot change' in all areas of my life. A work in progress I guess...**General Chat:** The cherry blossoms are blooming at the park by my house and they're [beautiful!](http://i.imgur.com/vzuTNjN.jpg)  
**Triumph:** I'm on day 4! I felt good enough to go outside and finally start pulling the weeds off the entire backside of my house. They had grown all the way to the top but now it's all clear again! I bet my neighbors are proud of me lol...**Struggle:** Up and down emotionally. Lost a friend because of my last night of drinking with him. I blacked out that night and don't really remember what I did/said but he isn't speaking to me anymore. I sent an apology and understand. I hope to never disappoint someone like this again...**General Chat:** Hopefully I receive a callback regarding a job I interviewed for last week. The supervisor told me to contact him if I don't hear anything by the end of Wednesday (today) and he will contact HQ for me.  Will be happy to know whether it's a yes or a no regardless I will stay positive :)  I'm glad I found SD.
Triumph: Almost too much to list here. I've had the new pup for aver a week now and she's fantastic I couldn't have asked for a better dog. I still dropping weight at an almost alarming rate but between jogging with the dog riding the bike to work and hitting the gym 3 days a week its gonna be hard to keep any weight on and I know I'm eating healthy I just have to keep telling people at work that I don't have cancer and that I'm just taking care of myself now. ..Struggle: Work's been kind of rough lately but it always is this time of year. The springtime menu is out and its incredibly saute (me) heavy. So every night at work has been incredibly annoying for the past several weeks. Also with the warm weather the kitchen starts to get incredibly hot which leads to more frustration. Also I'm feeling a little down about the love life. The girl that I'm after and have been spending time with is giving me nothing  back in return and even after talking to her about how I feel I only get vague answers back from her. I know that there she is interested in me but something is holding her back and she won't tell me what it is. I'm just feeling like I need to cut my losses on this one and move on. I've got a date tomorrow and we'll see how that goes but I'd much rather be with this girl. I've done everything I can and the balls are all on her court now and if she's not ready than I have to accept that. Maybe further down the road we can work something out. ..General Chat: I got my tax return back and treated myself to a PS 4 yesterday. About to play the hell out of some bloodborne and start getting super amped for witcher 3. I've been looking forward to that one for years now. ..EDIT: sorry forgot to finish my post. ..
**Triumph:**  Started getting back into running and walking again my girlfriends parents bought her a lawn mower for her birthday so we can finally get our yard in check. (That may be a struggle for her as now we are adults and this is the kind of thing you get for your birthday)  We also started Geocaching which is kind of fun for something to do....**Struggle:** I have a big exam for work starting this Saturday and I am scared I am a bit behind the curve.  Been working with a co worker trying to get ready but still always scared for these.  I have colors now so getting up every day at 5:05 to call in makes me sleep until about 7:50 now which is kind of annoying....**General Chat:** I haven't been going to meetings as much as I used to.  I think once I get my restricted license it will be different but it's just been a little bit harder to get to meetings.  I may start a 3rd shift job coming up for 6 weeks which will be nice because I will be getting close to hitting a bonus this 1/4 but getting used to third shift will be a bit harder.  The good thing is it won't cut into my drinking time like in the passed when I thought about 3rd shift :P.
**Triumph:** I had a couple of awesome triumphs this week.  I did the 5th step with my sponsor (AA) which is a triumph after I triumphed doing my 4th step (writing down an inventory of my resentments fears sex inventory and wrongs done to others).  It was hard and scary but very worth it.  ..Also maybe TMI but....[this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/34plbo/sober_sex/) is a big part of my life right now.  Sex was pretty non-existent in the last few years because of a number of things but being a drunk lazy shame filled mess was definitely the biggest reason.  Because of the work I am doing in therapy and AA my relationship with my partner is blossoming and getting stronger by the day.  Hard to believe I wrote [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/324sv8/i_hate_to_do_this_but_could_use_some_advicewords/) just a few weeks ago.  But yes - sober sex.  YES.....**Struggle:** Drama at work.  It has nothing to do with me but I am by nature a gossipy pot stirrer.  I do it because of my own fears and self esteem issues and I am trying my darndest to just stay the fuck out of it right now.  It's not hard until other gossips come in and want to talk about it.  That's when I have a hard time knowing how to stay out of it but not come off all self righteous.  Bah.  Life.  ..**General Chat:** My coffee consumption is just out of control.  BUT IT IS SO DELICIOUS.  I want to try [cold brew coffee](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/04/best-way-to-make-cold-brew-coffee-iced-coffee-technique-tips.html) because [TIS THE SEASON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8) AMITRITE?
Triumph: I hit 90 days a few days ago and am feeling pretty damn good about it! ..Struggle: still feeling anti-social but I hung out with friends briefly twice this week so that's better. Trying to get more proactive about reaching out to friends. ..General chat: Choosing sobriety is definitely helping with my mental health issues.  I've had a lot of shame over who I am where I come from etc. Somehow this week that shame seems to have left me and I feel like I am no better/no worse than anyone else. Usually I feel like other people are better than me. Their families are not filled with people with drug/alcohol problems etc they didn't have to go to CPS when they were kids etc etc etc. ..I realized that all those things I was telling myself were totally wrong and I can hold my head high and learn how to be proud of who I am rather than denigrate myself &amp; my experiences. And sobriety helps so much with that as I'm not doing things to further the shame spiral anymore. I think for me at least there's a strong connection between my drinking and my self-esteem. Happy Wednesday!!! 
Cakes: You are CRUSHING it!  Congrats on you race.  That's amazing.  I have a feeling the "grey bits" will work themselves out.  Keep being awesome yo!..**Triumph**: Been really busy at work and am getting over a cold.  But I've been able to get back out on the courts and the mat this week.  Tennis and Krav have been awesome and I've been doing really well with both.  Work can be overwhelming and I'm hoping to be able to hire some help soon...**Struggle**: I'm just trying to maintain good balance between home work and fun.  Sometimes it can be draining...**General Chat**: The weather around here has been amazing.  Spring is DC is the best couple days of the year! ;-)
Triumph: better sleep less anxiety less depressive thoughts. I feel better at coping with all sorts of different feelings. Going to therapy sharing without censoring..Challenge: I want to hit more meetings. Even though I have had time off from work I have only hit one meeting. I find it as effective is counseling and it's free!
**Triumph:** I posted a while back about writing my final exam for my final university class. I was one class short of graduating for the last 5 years. Finally getting sober allowed to me take the class (both cost-wise and performance-wise). I got my final mark back this week and I got an A+! This is a true gift of sobriety. Proof that I'm thriving in recovery. I'm very very happy!..**Struggle:** I continue to struggle financially while I slowly pull myself out of the debt hell my drinking out me into. Even with all the extra money I'm not spending on alcohol I'm still barely making ends meet. I have no freaking clue how I managed to pay for alcohol before. One of the AA promises is something like "you will know economic freedom" and I'm holding onto that hope for dear life. I know I can't expect things to be prefect after only 217 days. I'm a work in progress in many ways...**General Chat:** 217 is my lucky number! I don't know why but I notice this number everywhere I go. Could be confirmation bias or coincidence. But I am expecting great things for today! I have a difficult event to deal with later: a work networking event that will have free flowing alcohol and dreadfully boring people galore. I am 100% confident in my sobriety today so I know I can go and not make a fool of myself. This is an annual event and last year I drank too much and got a bit silly. I shall be redeemed today...I love this sub and all of the support I get from it. Stay strong everyone.
**Triumph:** So many! I have sober friends from AA now who are awesome I finally asked someone to be my sponsor and she's been great I took a full-body picture at Day 2 and one at Day 38 and the difference is HUGE (I didn't realize it until I was looking at a picture that I really have changed) and I'm already on Day 40 but I feel like I'm just at the beginning. There's more to come :)..**Struggle:** Deflating the ego. I think about myself constantly and it's important for me to get over my selfishness let go of my own petty desires and find ways to be of service to others...**General Chat:** I survived Cinco de Drinko without so much as a hiccup thanks to my progress my plans and the kindness of a new friend. Super grateful that I wasn't even tempted to drink yesterday.
**Triumph:** I feel more dedicated than ever to commit to sobriety and I have an excellent support system to help me along the way...**Struggle:** I'm nearing an all-time high with my weight and my general fitness is pretty terrible.  I have lost maybe a pound despite not drinking for 16 days now and watching what I eat (only modest exercise)...**General Chat:** I'm really looking forward to a romantic getaway to Aruba in 10 days.  It has been awhile since my wife and I have gotten away alone and this will be the first time doing so sober.
**Triumph**: Got through the weekend and now have a week.  It's a lot easier already.  Best thing is the amount of energy I have now.  The weekend wasn't all about somehow slogging through the day just to get to 5:00 - I actually got a ton of chores done and spent a lot of time with the family...**Struggle**: still love the thought of "just having a few beers" on Saturday/Sunday afternoon and hated that I couldn't do it.  Took a few hours to get over feeling peeved...**General Chat**: I got nothing. Not much going on outside the norm in my life except getting through next weekend without drinking and enjoying feeling better.  Need to start exercising though.
Triumph- Another day clean and sober. Chairing a 6:45 am Sunday meeting and having to find speakers is great for me. Will have a year sober in 16 days. Getting married June 21(after my first year sober passes)super psyched to get married not so psyched planning a wedding. It's just not my thang. I work on a farm as does my fiancee and this is the busiest time...but it will all come together and the guy I'm marrying? He's just the best guy with the biggest heart. We've been together four years so it's been cool getting sober and having our relationship evolve. He's not an addict but he loves the idea of AA and is super supportive. I'm a lucky lady. ..Struggle- Not having a driver's license and feeling overwhelmed at times by the process of getting it back...Not feeling like I'm moving forward in my professional life...putting off 4th step/5th step which I know I need to do and will feel great just feeling a little overwhelmed by life in general. ..General Chat- I love my daily AA home group meetings they're amazing. And so is the stopdrinking community! Don't post much (too busy!) but check in frequently. 
**Triumph**: I did a five minute unsupported headstand at Yoga yesterday. The rest of the class all dropped out by two minutes. Felt a bit like my brain was going to explode out of my ears by the end but if that's the price for impressing a class full of ladies then I'll take it. ..**Struggle**: Continued uncertainties with a restructure at work. I'll definitely still have a job but damned if I know whether it's one I'll want to do or not. ..**General chat**: The gals in the office are pushing me to get on Tinder but I've been stalling them saying that I'm not sure if I'm ready to start dating again yet not sure how to do sober dates etc. *Little do they realise that I'm just counting down the days 'til Witcher 3 comes out. Why would I want to start clogging up my evenings with romance when there's witcherin' to do?*
Triumph: having a great vacation. Remembering all of it even the bumpy and grumpy bits...Struggle: vacation stress. Vacation cravings like the gentle waves rolling in along the bay. My brother is a pissy bitch when he's drunk and gets wicked hangovers. Hard to deal with him on both ends...Chat: on a mobile with a slow connection. Not posting much but lurking daily. Thanks SD!
Triumph: Cleaned 100 lbs at the gym this week! Hashtag sober strong...Struggle: I have loads of anxiety due to life transition stuff most of which is actually good but the what ifs are killing me. I feel hot I feel cold I feel my blood pressure rising I get a little lightheaded throughout the day. It's causing some cravings but I'm proud of myself for staying strong...General Chat: Just hugs to y'all...(edit: typo)
**Triumph:**.Finished my classes for the semester.  Looks like 4.0 again.  This should bring my overall GPA up to around 3.25 (much better than the 2.7 it was when i re-enrolled in school three semesters ago).  Start my job in a research lab on monday.  Very excited.  ..**Struggle:**.Broke up with my girlfriend and have serious doubt about my ability to function "normally" in a relationship.  Oh well though i'm trying not to let it get me down...**General Chat:**.I'm a lurker for sure but I want to try and post more.  This place has helped me a lot and I want to start giving back...Hope everyone is doing well today!..
**Triumph:** I'm currently in one of those EVERYTHING IS AWESOME moods which is great. Work has been going well. I've managed to avoid all the work drinking for 4 weeks now and I told another coworker that I don't drink and she was like "Oh yeah lots of people in the office don't drink it doesn't matter at all." So that was good. I'm opening up an becoming a lot more social and fun with my new coworkers as well which I'm excited about. Also learning a ton :)..Aside from that made it through last weekend which was rough af. I wanted to drink pretty badly. Glad I didn't :) ..**Struggle:** I feel like I've had the same struggle for months now. Weed. I can't stop smoking weed and I hate it. When I don't have weed after work on my walk home I get like depressed and panic-ey about what I'm going to do all night. I know I'm just using weed to deal with my issues now and avoid life it's just not wrecking my life enough for me to feel like I NEED to stop. ..Aside from that the fact it's summer time is rough and having a place to myself for 8 weeks has been rough. Had a crazy close call on Friday night where I was just staring at some beers going back and forth with "you should drink tonight" and "seriously don't do it". Made it out alive though. ..**General Chat:** So like did they ever find that missing plane? The Malaysia Airlines one? So weird! Like WHERE is it??
**Triumph:** Full disclosure I hate these things. I hate myself. The only thing I feel that's good is that I'm still kicking around at this point. [There are some things in the future I have to look forward to and they are mostly superficial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/354q02/can_we_have_a_thread_where_we_talk_about_all_the/cr14c7i) Technological advancement is about the only thing in life that makes me look forward to the future...**Struggle:** My own mind is out to kill me. It just won't shut up no matter what my doctor throws at it. I'm at the end of my rope and I just found out how much it costs for the last antidepressant I've tried. Note to self: Don't bother with the samples next time. There's no way I can afford it. What a goddamn waste...**General Chat:** I'm on a waiting list for a therapist when one becomes available at my local Department of Health and Human Services but there's no telling how long it can take. I'm terrified of being put back into a box or cage with or without my consent but I don't know what else to do besides wait while my inner monologue grinds me down.
Triumph: 4 days. First time making it four days in a couple of months other than when I had the flu. Yay!  .Struggle: This is one of the roughest weeks I could have chosen to quit drinking and this weekend is going to be an insane test of my willpower. I am I am ready.
