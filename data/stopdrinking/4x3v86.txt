I'm not religiously keeping track of my days like I was in the first couple months but 250 seems like a lot so I am celebrating how far I've made it. I realized today that it was about this time last year I really went off the rails drinking almost every night (and during the day!) to the point of blacking and/or passing out. August through November 2015 are very blurry months because of how much I drank and I was really caught in a messy cycle. I was shocked by how difficult it was to stop. I'd quit in early 2014 for 3 months and at the time it was very easy for me to give it up but this time around I really didn't want to let go of drinking even though I knew I needed to. I'm incredibly thankful that I quit at 25 and didn't wait to get older and for my drinking to get even worse. ..I was really struggling a couple weeks ago with intense cravings but I've found every time I make it through a rough patch I come away with even less desire to drink than I did before. I'm thankful that SD is always here if I ever need encouragement or just want to hear other people's experiences. Thanks SD! :)
