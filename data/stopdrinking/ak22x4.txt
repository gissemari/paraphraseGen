Quitting drinking revealed a lot about myself. With all of these emotions and struggles coming up and no alcohol to numb and/or blame I turned to the trusty internet to look for words to these emotions at least. I learned that the hand-wringing feeling of constant pending doom worrying about myself or my cats or my family dying while I drove to work every day...that's called anxiety and *not normal*. I don't really recall having issues with it before my foray into drinking. But it was becoming crippling and making me unable to leave my house or car (or brewery) at the height of my drinking. It's gotten SO much better. ..But I still struggle with it now occasionally. I had hoped it would completely go away and for a while it seemed like it had but I have bad days. So I'm slowly learning to identify what's making me anxious and other patterns like has it been several days since my last physical activity? Is my period coming up? Have I had 3 cups of coffee and no plain water? And better ways to handle it like if I drop everything to do the thing that's bothering me will I feel better? Is that even possible? The difference is the ability to think through what I'm feeling instead of the alcohol gremlin immediately screeching "OMG THIS IS TOO MUCH I NEED A DRINK" and then doing that at basically anything...So this morning I got up later than I wanted. I couldn't find any gym clothes anywhere in the house so I skipped my class otherwise I'd be 10+ minutes late. I snapped at my husband and sat on the couch to pout the list of things I have to do today swirling around plus the house is a mess and I start feeling anxious. But now I'm armed with the knowledge that writing my list of things I want to accomplish today and being realistic about what I should to today vs tomorrow and planning my weekend will make me feel better. So that's what I did. No more just starting on the first chore that pops into my mind until I think of something different and do that instead ad nauseum until it's the end of the day and I haven't *finished* anything never went to the gym or the office. It's taken me 25 weekends of trial and error to figure this out. It still feels like I'm at the bottom of a very large self-discovery mountain. But hey tonight at least I'll have done my office work cleaned the bathroom and gone to the gym and be ready to tend to my garden on Sunday. Hopefully. I'm still working on the execution. But there is absolutely no space for alcohol no matter how nice of a day out it is...

Congrats on 178...that is really awesome.  Thank you for posting I fall into the same drinking thoughts with anxiety a drink would help me right now...nope.    I have found with: tasks diet sobriety: "failing to plan is planning to fail"  No space for alcohol - you said it!
