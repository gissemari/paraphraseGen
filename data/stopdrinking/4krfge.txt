I fucked up guys. I just need to vent. I kind of avoided this sub because I had a relapse a few weeks ago and have pretty much been going at it every day since. ..I haven't drank since yesterday so this is a start. I guess I am posting for accountability. ..I don't even know why I did it but I had quit my job after my boss made me cry so I think that flipped a switch in me or something to slip up. ..My fianc  is out of town for work for possibly up to a month so these guilty feelings are not fun to deal with alone. Sigh. ..I'm going to wait a few days for the shakiness/anxiety to subside and get in touch with a friend I know who goes to AA and take my ass to a meeting. ..Sorry for the jumbled post but I kind of just needed to let it all out. ..Thanks for reading guys.

Sorry to hear that...You wouldn't be the first or last person at a meeting shaky or anxious if you don't want to wait those few days :)
Kudos on coming back so soon. I've been known to disappear for months on end. ..What are you going to try differently?
I just turned 41. When I was 23 I quit a very good job because my boss made me cry. To this day I am so proud I didn't keep myself in an unhealthy situation where I and everyone deserved much much better. I realize this may seem like an odd response but congratulations on quitting your job! I'm sure that was a very difficult decision to make. I have a strong hunch though that it was the right one. And yes that sounds like a switch alright. But here you are: back. Congratulations on that too. I'm new (day 1!) and I'm a little curious why you avoided this community during the fudging (your term   ). I guess I thought maybe when I'm feeling the lowest is the best time to scroll because I may see something that resonates with me and uplifts me somehow. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it all soon. Welcome back!
