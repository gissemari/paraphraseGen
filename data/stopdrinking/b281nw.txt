Hey y'all. I've been struggling with alcohol not even a full year but it's quickly getting way out of control. Every morning for a month Ive woken up hungover and say  that's it I'm done.  But every night I find myself back at the liquor store. Well today I'm spending time in the sun with my best friends and then they're coming with me to a doctor so I can truly start this journey. I'm scared but I don't want alcohol to rule my life. I have so much to look forward to and I can't be drunk to do it!

Good luck! You are fortunate enough to have friends who support you!
Good for you!   It's hard to start the sobriety journey but since I committed myself my life is so much better. Here is a new subreddit for women in recovery  r/women_in_recovery
