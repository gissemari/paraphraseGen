Just posting this as a text link here cause I want to preface it:..I just found this subreddit. I'm not an alcoholic myself but I understand addiction and breaking away from it. One of the things that restores my faith in humanity is watching people overcome it seeing people be strong and come out on top. When I hear "I haven't had a drop in 8 months/1 year/5 years/etc" - even if I don't know the person it makes me happy for them tears-in-eyes kind of happy that they've done so well in facing that demon. I collect stories like this and file them away. ..So I don't know how welcome someone like me is around here. Since it's not a struggle for me I can only empathize I can't relate. But I would like to offer that and I'm happy to listen and let anyone unload. I know it's a terrible painful struggle and have nothing but respect for that. Even just recognizing it and addressing it is brave and I respect you all for it...So I wanted to share something I came on a while ago. I read Cracked semi-regularly and stumbled onto an article from one of their editors who documented his sobriety over 2 years - from the night he decided to stop drinking to the 2 year anniversary. It's amazing what a turnaround you can see in him and I think it could give hope...Um that said link below. Mods if you feel I'm out of place or if I approached this wrong and said something wrong (I'm pretty sure I didn't) - I apologize just delete this and let me know how I could have worded it better. I'll see myself out and continue to just lurk and be happy to see all of you doing well. :)..http://www.cracked.com/blog/9-youtube-videos-that-prove-anyone-can-get-sober/
