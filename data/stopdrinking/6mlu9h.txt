This board is great because people are willing to share their successes and their mistakes.  I think one of my biggest stumbling blocks in the past has been thinking about the fact that I'll "never ever get to drink again" and if I do I will have failed so what's the point in trying... but I'm coming to realize that it's not so black and white....I thought I understood the "one day at a time" cliche but it's taken on a different meaning for me this time around.  We really don't know what the future will hold.  Maybe one day I will drink again maybe I will binge again maybe I will fail... but that won't take away the string of successful days I'm leaving in my wake.  And the fact that people will support me and help me climb back on that horse as long as I don't give up....So thanks again for the relapse posts.  They help me see that the future is not so scary or "final" as I used to believe.  And by lessening my anxiety I'm actually more likely to keep going!  Here's to another day that I'm excited to not drink with you all.
