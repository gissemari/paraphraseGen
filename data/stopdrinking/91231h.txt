I use quotes because I hate that word. It's more like having friends over for dinner. I usually drink 3 nice sized glasses of wine while cooking chatting cleaning up. Not this time. I enjoyed myself so much. I cooked dinner perfectly. Kept the kitchen clean. Didn't forget things. Was able to be present and engaging. Everyone else drank wine I wasn't even tempted. FYI Indian tonic with ice and lime is DIVINE. ..I don't expect all evenings to go this smoothly but I'm thrilled I'm not struggling as of yet. Maybe third time really IS a charm. . .Edit - added a sentence .

Awesome! ..
Good job! What is Indian tonic?
Did anyone give you shit?
I've had a couple instances lately where I had to stay sober around friends I would typically drink with. I had just as much fun and was much more engaged present(as you mentioned) witty and funny than if I had been drinking/drunk. It's not really about the alcohol it's about the people you are with and spending time with them.
