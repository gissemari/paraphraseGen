Is anyone else struggling with these services that now deliver alcohol? Just had the thought to order a few groceries and a bottle of wine...or two...I deleted the app instead. Not drinking today.

Alcohol delivery? As in the same way you'd order a pizza?  Dear gawd I'm glad I sobered up long before this became a thing...
I've fallen victim to these services. Super easy to isolate yourself and fall into a drunken spiral. 
My friend just took a job as a driver for a grocery delivery service.  He said more than half of his customers are isolated alcoholics  which is no surprise to me. Good on you for deleting the app. 
I've definitely done this before. When I was so hungover from the night before and refused to leave the apartment and the bottle was empty.... luckily I'm no longer in a place where postmates operates (fuck that company overall)..Will not be drinking today.
