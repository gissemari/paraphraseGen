Stayed home Friday and spouse drank with work friends great..Had people over last night didn't drink great..Went to Aldi for THE FIRST TIME since quitting today and survived that.  Great..But man I'm so salty this afternoon nothing sounds good nothing feels good I just don't feel safe.  Super anxious and struggling.

Yeah I feel a bit grouchy at times too. Occupying myself with something else usually helps a bit. Good luck.
I always like to go for a long walk...preferably in nature. Usually by the time I get back home my mood has changed for the better. IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT even though I want to. Hope your run helps !
Trying to remember that this too shall pass...
I'm glad the run helped ! Let me know how the meditation / mindfulness goes. IWNDWYT either!
I wanted to report back I kinda got my shit together. Had an Odouls and a tonic with dinner and feel less like crap.  Thank you for the support I really needed that today.  I DIDNT  DRINK and I really really fucking wanted to.
I have these days sometimes.  They are a pain in the ass.  I feel like throat punching everyone and everything.  It's the days I get mad because I can't drink.  I can't keep my mind on one track.  It zooms here and there testing me. ..It usually only lasts a day.  Then I'm back on track. ..Sober on my friend!
