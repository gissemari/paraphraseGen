The kind of hangover which gives you a jolt making you feel so sad and disgusted with oneself that you resolve to truly change; you begin dreaming good intentions almost as a way of jettisoning the hangover and reassuring your twisted-up mind...As the pain of the hangover ebbs away dreaming good intentions is a pretty fine fucking feeling when you consider it. I know that people mostly don't discuss or analyse their hangovers and just declare them bad but the mental effects are always what have stuck with me longer than the many associated shames a night can bring even...I dream good intentions resolving to stop drinking try this get that body I've always wanted and felt held back from until this very hungover morning; I dream about a lot of things...It's like you can see the crack in the ceiling more acutely when you're hungover; you can see that glimmer of light winking through this fissure but all you can do is dream good intentions about how you're going to get to it...And then you start drinking later on just as the hangover has passed and you're feeling thirsty again...I fucking hate this...The whole cycle makes me feel corrupt in the end because I never achieve anything; I only delude myself because I get so frequently rocked out of my mind...Been struggling this last week and drinking ever more on weekdays then going into work like a phoned-in zombie...I need to remind myself what makes me so angry and despair with the entire process...No drinking today...

I just decided I was sick and tired of wasting time and money and I stopped.  I read all the stories in the sidebar under Saturday Shares and Sunday Solutions and I read the book This Naked Mind Available thru link to free download in sidebar.  I went to Smart recovery meetings for awhile.  I post daily.  Not forever but in the beginning it helps.  Oh and Fuck Luck.  Just do it.  I won't drink with you today.
Ugh. I've been there so many times. Thinking of you.
