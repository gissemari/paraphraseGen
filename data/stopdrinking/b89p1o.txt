Hi my name is Samu people usually call me Sam. I have been pushing through for the month of March &amp; thankfully with great effort &amp; faith I was able to get through 1 MONTH SOBER!..I thought I needed to remove all signs of alcohol in my apartment but realised  If I cant say NO to myself how in the hell will I be able to find strength to say NO to others  So I left them in my Refrigerator &amp; would routinely say to myself  Sam NO..its not worth it  every-time I had the urge to drink as I saw the cans &amp; bottles!..Last week we had a party involving alot of drinking but I was surprised to find myself easily saying NO to my friends!It was harder to say NO in the beginning of the month!..It becomes easier!Letting my close friend(s) know about my struggles also pulled me through!

I'm so proud and happy for you!! It's really inspirational and I commend you so much as I feel like I'm really disciplined with everything else but staying sober is so hard when the alcohol is so easily available. Staying sober at a party is such a milestone I hope you know!
I did not drink with you in March! Way to go Sam!
