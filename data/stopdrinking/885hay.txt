I can't quite get my head around it - I couldn't do 24 hours before! ..The compulsion and cravings have largely gone now except for the odd surprise guest appearance of 'WhineyMcLoserFace the relapse lawyer " when an unexpected feeling comes along. ..Don't get me wrong - I'm still very early days and I'm still working quite hard to keep things on track. I still don't feel comfortable in my own skin at times - I'm trying to learn new ways of sitting with my feelings - hell -being able to identity some of them would be a start  ..But life is already so much better   ..Thanks for being there for me - Day in day out  and helping me to keep the faith when I have struggled to put one foot in front of the other. ..IWNDWYT
