Having bad cravings. I'm a chronic relapser and have historically not done a great job at playing the tape forward. At least not the one where I wake up with a pounding heart sick as hell vomit in the bathtub am secretly drinking all day starting at 7 am and doing shit I will regret months to years later. ..The buzz from 6 beers sounds great! That shit does not. ..IWNDWYT

Sugar in large doses helped me a ton with cravings.
For me the sliver of enjoyment I was getting kept getting smaller and smaller. 
Sometimes I have to play the tape *really* far forward..."If I have this drink I'm not sure if I will stop after the 1st one. If I don't stop after the 1st one I'll probably over drink and be hung over tomorrow. I will wake up feeling like shit and hate past Cruzin for making the wrong decision right now (I ruminate some on how angry my future self would be at my current self if I end up hungover). I'll be stuck in bed my house will continue to not get cleaned which will stress me during the week. My husband will be disappointed and have to pick up all my slack. I might keep drinking after that and end up back in that cycle I so desperately worked to get out of. I have changed maybe but alcohol has not and it is still addictive. I'll end up right back at the bar every day spending money I don't have doing nothing useful and I'll tear my sister and husband apart for the rest of their lives even after my alcoholic dad dies and continue the pain of being in love with an addict."..Usually by the time I get there a drink = source of unending pain and suffering for myself and my loved ones not some magic elixir that will make whatever bad feeling I have go away.
