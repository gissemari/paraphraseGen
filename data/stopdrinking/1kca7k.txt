Hey everyone it's Wednesday that means the week's half over! How's it been going? Share your triumphs struggles or just general chat!..Triumph: I had a talk with my boss around moving out of a stressful position I've been in for 2+ years.  He took it very well and those duties are no longer mine.  I'm back to doing what I love!..Struggle: Dealing with unpleasant co-workers.  Also fixing mistakes I've made.  I've eaten some crow these last two days...General chat: In one month I'll be taking my third trip sober.  This time down to SF for a week maybe 10 days...Have a great 24 hours folks!
----------immediate responses--------

Spent a lot of time browsing this sub and thinking about how massive this decision is. I've tried time and time again enough to know that one drink will give me enough of a excuse to go off the rails... So it's no booze. Ever if I'm serious about it...I think a lot of how my parents gave up for a full 6 months then had one complimentary glass of wine with dinner. They bought a bottle on the way home and... Well that was around 20 years ago. They still drink quite heavily...Then I think alcohol is one tiny element of this life. I know plenty of non-drinkers and have envied them for a while now. I think I can do this...That's where I've been at... Still very much entrenched in my own thoughts but wanting to know where sobriety will take me. I start a 6-week course on the 29th... My mission is to make it there without a drink so I can be proud to say I've been sober...Happy Wednesday to you too!
**Triumph**: I moved succesfully despite a lot of stress like the lock of my apartment being badly installed and not opening when we arrived with the first vanload of stuff. Also my ex and me repainted the old place to get rid of the nicotine stains (took us 3 days...). ..Most of the stress involved in moving is over now it's just unpacking and putting up curtains and so on but I can set my own pace now...**Struggle**: Dealing with my ex is pretty difficult and I have the idea that she's in a worse state than I am at the moment. It looks to my untrained eye (except from being at the receiving end) that she's close to a burnout or even a depression-like period. ..I hate to see her suffer (even though she broke it off) but I have a hard time getting through to her on any level except the practical aspects. Well she's on holiday now so I don't have to fret about it too much until she's back :-)..**General chat**: I'm going to a house-warming party of a friend on Saturday that'll be the first time I'm exposed to (and have to interact with) lots of new people in a social setting. The people I do know are nice (not close friends though) so I think it'll be okay - and if not I can just go home again plenty to do there as well!
Happy Wednesday!..Triumph: Things are going really well for the most part.  My wife was out of town for 4 days but there were no real challenges there.  I had a busy time with Krav Maga events doggie duty (not doody!) and keeping the house straightened up...Struggle: I've been frustrated a lot lately.  I can't tell if it's me or if everyone else is being an asshole right now.  I know that since it's not just one or two people I'm dealing with it's probably me.  But it doesn't feel like me.  It really does feel like everyone else is an asshole.  Oh well... Based on experience this feeling will probably pass soon...General chat: I'm one reddit day away from 9 months and 4 real days (Nov 18 is my sobriety date).  feelsgoodman.jpg.
Triumph: Still rocking and enjoying the sober life...Struggle: I have too much of my own ego wrapped up in my parenting.  Daughter missed qualifying for the academic middle school but one point on one standardized test.  I was devastated and that's silly.  I want her to be happy and healthy.  But I allow my own neuroses about what it means to be a good parent or to be SEEN as a good parent to obscure the main goals.  I want to remind myself that for her (and me and everyone) is that goal is to THRIVE not WIN...General chat: I signed up for a marathon in November.  Bring it!
I look forward to this every week! I read most of the posts here but this thread is the only one I usually comment on. ..Triumph: last week I was in a kinda bad place but this week I'm feeling 100% better. Woo!..Struggle: I am still kinda dealing with a back injury and want to get back to training for my marathon but am struggling with the injury and fear of pushing it too hard..General chat: I love this cooler weather! 
Hi!  Can I join in?..Triumph:  Well today is my fifth day without a drink which the longest I've gone without drinking in over five years.  I went to my first ever AA meeting and didn't die of terror.  I'm feeling a lot lot lot less anxious today than I was 3 or 4 days ago.  I'm even taking a day off from the gym which I haven't done in several weeks...Struggle:  I don't feel like doing anything but I also don't feel like not doing anything.  I feel overwhelmed by stuff that's really not that overwhelming.  My classes start up in a week and a half and I feel totally unprepared - I'm THE PROFESSOR but I haven't like reread the books or prepped the syllabi.  I just don't want to deal with it but I don't know why since it's stuff I really enjoy usually.  And my husband is simultaneously like "well if we're not going to be drinking we need to come up with new hobbies together!" but I just don't even want to think about doing new stuff right now.  blarghghblblarghblargh  I feel super whiny for complaining about this stuff NONE OF WHICH IS REALLY BAD AT ALL.  ..General: thanks to everyone for being cool and supportive. 
Triumph: 88 days! Feeling very proud of myself this week I truly didn't think I could do it and I feel great. ..Struggle: even though I am saving lots of money did our family budget and realized we are broke. ..General chat: Going to ask for a raise today!
Thanks for making this post!..**Triumph(s)**: When I wake up tomorrow I will have double digits on my badge! Also I dumped a bunch of booze down the drain last night:..- half-empty wine bottles (long since gone to vinegar but didn't want to see them anymore).- $150 bottle of unopened tequila :( (I have zero temptation to drink hard liquor but again wanted to rid my household of it).- various drinking accessories like bitters cointreau etc..**Struggle**: My commute home and first 30 minutes after getting home from work. I have identified this as my main trigger. I find myself walking to the fridge and opening the door from pure muscle memory and habit. Been coping by making myself chug a quick protein shake to satisfy the desire to drink a beverage then heading directly to the gym to burn off stress and change my brain chemistry. Also still having trouble sleeping. I don't get tired until 2-3am whereas my beer habit allowed me to conk out at 10:30 or 11pm every night...**General chat**: I have already saved $110 by not buying beer over the last 9 days. This morning I set up an auto-deposit that pulls $12 (price of a sixpack in NYC) from my checking and dumps it into my savings account every day. Stoked about this. Between the /r/stopdrinking badge and the financial incentive I'll have two tangible signs of daily progress.
**Triumph**: Passed 100 days last week. Pretty proud of that actually...**Struggle**: Having those "well clearly I can cut alcohol out so I could probably become a moderate drinker" thoughts. I *know* this isn't true because I know how quickly I can backslide from moderation to drinking too much. Just trying to keep my head down and get through each day. It's hard some times. I wish I had some real friends to talk to about this sort of stuff but I don't which sucks...**General**: I'm sad that summer is winding down. Now that my kids are in school summer has real meaning again and I don't want it to end! Then again its brevity is what makes it beautiful I guess.
.Triumph: none but working on several. Will report back...Struggle: marital. Also working on it but clarity one way or another is more e goal than a specific end of working it out. So yeah...Chat: also signed up for next marathon (see marjin's post). Mine's in early October. Training is going well meaning I am not hurt and is one of the important legs I stand on. Knocking wood.
Triumph- running 9 miles since Sunday. Helped me blow off a lot of steam. ...Had a weird scary dream last night it threw me off today. Ran my 3 miles tho.... That helped a bit. I had to go grocery shopping earlier and was nervous but I made it out without an urge to buy a bottle of wine. Hoping I can shake this uneasy feeling in the next hr or two. I'm on day 6 without the "juice"..Have a great day everyone! It is a blessing to feel awake and alert in our lives! 
Triumph: Seriously too many triumphs to post. Sobriety is awesome. Changed all my AA meetings and  am pretty happy with the new ones. Daughter told me that her friends wished they had a Dad like me...Struggle: A guy I knew relapsed 1 month ago. He died this weekend. Alcohol. 2nd person I personally know to die from drinking since I got sober. Sad...General chat: I am finding that it is a lot easier being myself now that I am sober. I was always trying to blend in / fit in so people wouldn't think I was messed up.  Now I feel like I can be whatever/whoever I want because I am not hiding anything I am not embarassed or breaking any laws. Long story short I am free.
Triumph: A full month today!..Struggle: Nobody aside from my SO and one friend know I've stopped drinking so everyone assumes I still do. Tonight we're supposed to stop by the neighbors' for "champagne and visiting." I'm confident I can turn it down politely but it just feels awkward...General: I am starting a new brewing experiment ... ginger beer! I've had my starter bug going for nearly a week and am ready to bottle tonight. I'm curious to see how it all comes out in a couple weeks.
Triumph: I moved! And in the last 24 hours got a lot unpacked &amp; hopefully will be done tomorrow. Also ran into my serious exboyfriend at my first meeting back in my hometown and surprisingly it doesn't ache like it used to. I'm okay! A friend invited me to a baseball game Saturday too!..Struggle: moving is exhausting. I'm nervous about my new job. My parents are being frustrating...General chat: oh.my.gosh. The south is way too hot. Seriously. Also anyone know how to wakeboard? How do I learn?
Triumph: I am moving closer to getting everything settled in court from DUI charge.    .Struggle: I still can't really move forward in terms of Jobsetc because I still have to wait and see how the DUI charge will play out.    .General Chat: College Football is almost here and I am excited to see my Ohio State Buckeye roll:)!!!
**Triumph:** This is the longest I've been sober in ten years. I've had a handful of two week stretches here and there. ..**Struggles:** I thought part of the reason I drank was out of boredom. Certainly that was part of it. But I've come to the realization today that I really hate the field of work I'm in and I don't like my job very much at all. I feel stuck because I know I would be happier in another field of work but the salary cut of at least twenty percent or more would be hard to deal with. I am Peter fuckn' Gibbons in Office Space...Sobriety damn you and your clarity.
Triumph: I called my lazy landlord once again to ask him to fix like six different problems mostly caused by a flood a while back.  Might sound silly but I've been putting this off for WEEKS because I am so afraid of confrontation and not used to standing up for myself...Struggle: I can't seem to let myself relax.  I'm a college student in the last weeks of summer and have picked back up on my hobby of disc golf playing every single day sometimes two or three rounds.  I'm taking 21 credits this fall more than I ever have to graduate in December so I feel like this is my last "summer" and I should soak it up (even though I'm stil working my PT job) but I feel super guilty because I feel like I'm becoming obsessed with it and possibly hiding from my feelings still.  Bah...General chat: planning a short camping trip Labor Day weekend.  Never done it by myself.  Looking to face some fears and work my spirituality muscles :)
Triumph: I didnt drink today didn't even think about drinking. Got asked to make some signs for my AA group...Struggle: I really need to find some work...General Chat: I'm gonna go see Huey Lewis and the News tomorrow because they're awesome. 
I work at an airport and today I organized/arranged to have an AA meeting there in a conference room each week starting next week.  I really hope that it can be of help to stressed out trying to stay sober traveling folks as well as any employees of the airport and/or people in the community...Tomorrow will be a first for me...going to a social gathering where there will be drinking for the first time since I've been sober. I honestly don't think it will be a problem though. My boyfriend will be there as my support and I have my peeps to call just in case...Thank you everyone here for being here and coming back!! XO
Triumph: Decided to quit drinking..Struggle: Quitting drinking..General: This subreddit is already helping a lot. Also is Tomb Raider worth finishing? 42% done but bored and BioShock Infinite is waiting in the wings...
Triumph: jumped off a perfectly good airplane on Sunday and lived to tell about it!!..Struggle: Trying not to get sucked into all the drama and gossip at work because I would actually like to be considered for a promotion sooner or later. Oh working on my 4th step. Ugh...General chat: kind of liking these chillier days but I kinda feel cheated out of a summer.
I always enjoy reading these posts! ..Triumph: a customer emailed my boss today to compliment me on how well i did my job. Felt really great. ..Struggle: been feeling lazy the past few days and like all I want to do is sit on the couch watching tv and eating snacks. I've been trying to apply the advice of others i've read in various posts and let myself do it without feeling TOO guilty - it's better than drinking. :) I'm also off work on Friday so I will have to watch myself as a long weekend will definitely bring cravings.  ..Chat: Weather is cooling off where I live. Fall is my favourite season so I'm ready for it! ..
i have moved to chicago and i am about to start physical therapy school next week. i am in a new city with new people experiencing tons of new things completely sober and loving it. my roommates drink so it is around a bit more than it used to be but its really not even an issue anymore. its great! 
Triumph: Home safe and sound after driving halfway across Canada! Two+ weeks of driving camping and sightseeing with my fiance. We didn't kill each other and we're actually a lot more in tune with each other. I'm so thrilled...Struggle: back to reality...General chat: east coast rules
A little late to the party but like the idea of this weekly thread!..Triumph: 3 days sober and without a cigarette.  Worked two double shifts (yesterday and today) and running on about 6 hours sleep in the last 48 hours but not giving in to the stress and urge to drink...Struggle: Wondering how I'm going to deal with staying sober on dates.  This is actually a triumph in disguise because having a couple dates lined up is a good thing but still unsure whether or not to admit to a new friend that up until recently I had a problem with alcohol.  Thoughts?..General chat:  Thanks to everone who contributes here!  Having a forum like this is making things easier.
