OK... so maybe I'm not as pumped about this as I should be.  I'd say the first 7 to 14 days were WAY harder.  And I'm more proud of accomplishing those that than today.  It's kinda like oh cool a nice solid round number. Onward...My biggest struggles have been social gatherings bars with the wife family weddings etc.  But those are getting easier.  For the most part people don't notice or don't care that you aren't drinking.  ..Although my scariest day happened last week.  My wife was going out of town.  I actually planned on it.  I was going to drink after she left and I didn't care.  I was actually looking forward to it.  Then... I didn't chant a mantra or anything.  I just went about my day spent a ton of time with my son mowed the lawn went fishing we had some ice cream.  Pretty soon it was lights out.  I didn't drink that day.  I think back and wonder what the hell I was thinking and how I came out of it without drinking.  I guess it gets easier after a little time under your belt. ..Anyway blessings to count.  I'm less bloated.  I sleep WAY better.  I'm a bit happier and less irritable. The bags under my eyes are fading.  My nose and cheeks aren't red.  My liver enzymes are normal.  I've gone from hovering around 215 down to 195.  All around I just feel HEALTHIER!..I really don't see anything positive about returning to my previous lifestyle.  It's not worth it.  And my wife and son deserve a healthier happier more engaged me...Cheers to not drinking!

This is a great story to share thanks! and a hopeful sign of where I might be after 34 more days of just not drinking 'today'. ..Cheers to you too!
