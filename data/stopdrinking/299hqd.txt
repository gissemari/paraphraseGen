I haven't posted on here before so hello! Four and a half months sober here...I just noticed a milestone which I think is really important. It was only recently I stopped dreaming about alcohol and I'm going to facetiously call such dreams 'wet' dreams since I love a good pun and they seem to be a developmental phase you grow out of. ..Basically I think until I stopped dreaming about being in bars or looking for/anticipating booze I felt like there was a rift between my subconsciousness and me. Like I was still essentially a drinker and relapse was just a matter of time.  ..But the point of this is those dreams ended naturally. It took a while for my subconscious to catch up with my decision to be sober but I got there. I hope anyone who gets lots of these dreams can take heart from this: it's not a sign you're not ready for change. It's just a lingering symptom that you have to wait out...Also I stumbled on a great academic article on the complex phenomenon of recovery dreams for anyone interested:..http://www.asdreams.org/magazine/articles/peters_recovery.htm...

I had my very first dream with alcohol in it.  In my dream I had forgotten that I don't drink and I took a big swig of whiskey.  Then I remembered and thought "Oh crap why'd I do that? Does this mean I have to reset my damn badge?"  ..When I woke up I was seriously happy to figure out it was a dream.  ..I was surprised by the dream because I don't think about drinking booze during the day (certainly not whiskey) but there you go.  ..I guess I am entering that stage...
