This is my first time posting. I want to thank everyone is this sub I'm sad I only discovered it a month ago! It's been a long time struggle trying to  figuring out who I am sober. It's amazing how you can be two different people for so long. Tomorrow I am going on a date and it's the  FIRST time in my life it won't be over drinks and I won't be drinking. When I used to go out I would get a high off of slowly getting drunk flirting being charming then ultimately make impulsive decision to go home with him and never see him again. I was in love with filling that void of drinking and feeling wanted for one night. I would never see the same person more than once my game was just one and done because once a guy sees you get drunk twice it's no longer an impulsive good time it's a bad time. Plus never seeing him again I avoided the pain if he actually got to know me and didn't like me now that scary as shit. ..But after lots of growing I am glad I can finally have a date and SO glad I get to share this with you. How have y'all been doing in the dating world? Any ladies that can relate?
