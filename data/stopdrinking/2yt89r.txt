Sober life is getting easier. I'm going to hit an AA meeting today though since I haven't been in a while. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for supporting me through my numerous relapses and attempts and also want to say if I can do it you can. Sobriety is achievable people can change for the better...If I can do it trust me you can. Let's not drink today.

Good for you.  I know this was not easy for you but you sound so much better than you did.  Keep doing what you're doing.
Congrats stick with it!
