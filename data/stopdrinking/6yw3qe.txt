This part really resonated with me and drinking.."It was the kind of thing you couldn't see when you were in it it was too much a part of you. ..Two donkeys meet at a hitching rail in a western town. One of them is a town donkey with nothing on his back but a saddle. The other is a prospector's donkey loaded down with packs camping and cooking gear and four fifty-pound sacks of ore. His back is bent into a concertina shape from the weight. The town donkey says That's quite a load you got there. And the prospector donkey says What load?"..What load? Being either drunk hungover or horribly sick was my normal routine for so long and I couldn't even see it. So thankful to be coming out of that fog now. ..He's one of my favorite authors I know he struggled with alcoholism and addictions and overcame them. Also can't wait to see the new movie "It" ..Happy Friday everyone IWNDWYT

Have you read his book *On Writing?* He has some wonderful funny insights about his drinking problem.
Read in 30 Days Sobriety Solution that it was all the dead soldiers (empty cans) in his recycling which made him begin to question his intake....a genius in my eyes...hoping it will be better than the travesty which was The Dark Tower....!
