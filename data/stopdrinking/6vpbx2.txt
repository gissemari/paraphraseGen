My journey of sobriety is proving to be a difficult one.  I've fallen for the moderation; the just one; the just  two. Inevitably ends the same old pattern of wine every time I feel any emotional pain. Had a cry yesterday over my estranged sister who loves to play games with me and my  family its far too long and boring to explain. But it's one of many  situations I need to accept and deal with sober. So to all you kind people out there struggling and those who have succeeded in quitting; Hope you have a good day and today I Will not drink with you all

Estrangement is tough I'm sorry about your sister. Today's a new day a day we can both take better care of ourselves and leave others to their own lives. I will not drink with you today. Good luck my friend. 
I'm sorry to hear about your sister. Estrangement must be very difficult and the game-playing must get very old. And that drinking voice is loud and nearly always wrong. Take good care of yourself today darlin'.
