For everything I've done and will do. Not the topic of my morning meeting but something another member lead us to. ..I truly believe that being kind to myself has been one of the things I have always needed to stay sober. I'm my own worst critic most of the time but I'm human too and need to make my mistakes and move on from them. ..Just a thought I felt I could share to help any of you struggling with anything similar. ..I will not drink with you beautiful people today!   .

This is massive. I take responsibility for my drinking but it's amazing that I haven't done anything regrettable since I stopped drinking. I feel out with a close friend by getting wasted at his wedding. I was full of guilt and regret. I called him recently to apologize but unfortunately he ignored me. Anyway I felt a huge weight lifted after I faced up to it and made the first move. I will try again at Christmas. Forgiving myself was huge and it took me months to do it. It's so easy to keep drinking when full of regret my attitude was well things can't get any worse!  Well done you. 
To err is human to forgive divine.
So happy for you &amp; agree with your comments on this. Forgiveness is the bedrock of recovery. IWNDWYT 
A lot of people here really struggle with shame. I'm always telling everyone that self forgiveness is super important. For me wallowing in guilt and shame over past incidents has always led me quickly into the warm and numbing embrace of the Demon who will promptly provide me with additional sources of shame and regret...We have to treat ourselves with the kindness with which we'd treat a sick friend if there's to be hope for real recovery. I forgive me too. And I will not drink with you today.
