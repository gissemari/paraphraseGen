I've been struggling with alcohol addiction for years.  My longest time sober was nine months and I thought it would be okay for me to drink at a party one night.  Of course it wasn't okay and I was right back into it.  I'm crying right now as I type this. I don't want to do this to myself anymore. Please help me to help myself.  I don't know what to do...Edit:  You guys are great.  I'm feeling better already.  I have to go to work now but I'll be back this evening and I know I'll be sober.  Thanks...Edit 2:  Made it back.  Feeling good being sober.  I've got one day down and I'm pretty happy about that.

Congrats on nine months. That's quite an accomplishment. You have to think you can do it again and longer this time!
This is support central! Pull up a stool and chill. Read some posts and see that we're nothing if not support however if you really think you need it don't be afraid to reach out to someone in your community. We can't be there like a trained professional can (sadly)...You can do it.
Welcome. We've all struggled and had setbacks as well as successes. Struggles help us learn and get stronger and build the successes. Do you have some ideas about a plan? Counselor meetings whatever?
Congratulations
Good for you.  Sounds like you have reached a decision point.  For me being resolved to take direction not to pick up the first drink and to attend AA meetings made all the difference in the world.  
Welcome and congrats for starting again. This is a wonderful place for support. Keep us posted.
