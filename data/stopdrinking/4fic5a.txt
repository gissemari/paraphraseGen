 If I had to pick a singular piece of advice to give you all I'd say this   do not let the realities of the past or the possibilities of the future negatively affect the peace joy and happiness that the present has to offer. ..D'Marco Jackson Hermitage High School 2015 graduation speech..Just read about D'Marco who just passed away this morning from aplastic anemia. He gave this speech which went viral knowing that he had suffered a relapse. But he said that when he was giving the speech he "didn't feel sick anymore". ..It occurred to me that we here are all dealing with the "realities of the past" and facing the "possibilities of the future" in ways that can be frightening or enlightening...I wish you all a happy today one filled with hope and dreams of many more to come.

Wow thanks for sharing this quote that's very relevant to sobriety...I hadn't heard this story and I'm sorry he lost this battle. My older sister had severe aplastic anemia 20 years ago and came very close to dying. It's a nasty disease. 
The past has been weighing heavily on my mind as of late and the ghosts of it still haunt me every day. Thank you for sharing this. 
And I keep forgetting.  I have been letting the realities of the past ruin things.  Nice to read this.
