So I'm going on day 10 after a relapse I had during the august long weekend. I was feeling great then all of a sudden depression hit me like a ton of bricks. I just moved to a new town I barely know anybody and I just hurt myself excersizing (sprain). I'm currently laying in bed crying wanting to go to the bar to have a conversation with anybody along with just drinking the pain away. I'm having all these horrible thoughts of regret and the feeling of going back out. I know it will be detrimental to myself and my health but I just don't care right now. ..Any words or advice would be helpful.

I'm sorry to hear you're going through what seems like a hellish time.  ..I've only had what I would call deep depression a few times in my life (thankfully) but I found that booze would only lift me out of for a short period and that I would feel more depressed than ever the next day.  ..Hoping your situation improves soon..
You won't regret not drinking today when you wake up tomorrow. 
Dang. One of the things I held on to was that no matter how shitty things were going to bed sober meant it was an OK day. ..Hope you feel better soon.
