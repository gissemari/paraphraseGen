I returned from a two week vacation two weeks ago and I've been thrown off balance. I've felt exhausted and sad most of the time and have really just wanted to escape from myself for a while. I didn't drink there and don't plan to but it made me want to. It restarted the voice of "maybe next year" which has led to "why not just a little today". I know what it is but it's still hard to shut it up...I also have hit a major slump when it comes to running. I took a much needed break while I was away but I have had a hard time getting back into it. It's all tied together. I posted recently about trying to reintegrate my physical and mental self but lately it seems I don't want to face anything. Running is one of the things that grounds me and forces me to deal with physical reality and gives me time to sort out my head. I've been almost dreading even the short runs and counting the minutes until I'm through them. I having trouble finding the solace they brought me a short while ago. I've realized that part of it is that I don't want to deal with either. I don't want to deal with doubts and limitations. I don't want a challenge. I just want to shut down for a little while...I'm getting through it one day at a time. I'm trying to honestly analyze my thoughts and behavior. I've been reading here a lot posting a little and going through some of my old posts. One that I've gone back to was about settling in for the long haul. It was about accepting that everything take times and work and the importance of moving forward...Today I went out with a goal of 8 miles thought about cutting it to 6 and ended up doing 10. Maybe I'm settling back in again. One of the lessons I'm taking from this whole thing is that while one day at a time works in a crisis I need a better plan for long distance...No matter how far I'm running I seem to fall into this pattern: The first quarter is a struggle filled with doubts. The second is easier but there is still a decision to be made as to how far I'll go. Once I turn around it's sometimes hard to face how far back I have to run but at least I know what it will take. The last quarter is the best. I don't have to hold back any reserves I can just try to fly home to my reward of coffee and a couch...I think a part of me has been waiting for the point where this process of sober living will be at the turn-around point or the last quarter. The point at which the doubts and decisions will be removed and I know exactly what I have to do and how long it will take. The point at which there will be an end to working on it...Well I know it doesn't work that way. Running is great and offers many lessons but the parallels can only go so far. At some point everyone has to stop running. Living isn't an out and back run or a giant loop it's just out and out up down and around. Sure there's an endpoint but it's not exactly a couch coffee and pancakes and no one ever seems to rush to get there...So here I am learning to accept that I have absolutely no idea where I am on this journey how long it will take or where I'm going for that matter. I guess that's okay...PS: Thanks to everyone for being here. You people are like the other runners and cyclists I see when I'm running. We're all doing our own thing but the little head nods waves and good mornings bring people together as a little community. We're all out there or in here together. It means a lot to me.

There are so many parallels. The first few months of running and sobriety are so hard. When we are in the beginning of either and we see the gazelles in short shorts or the old timers who seemingly breeze through sobriety it seems like they have it figured out. As a short shorted runner who has put some days together I realize that the struggles are always there and that in a way is very comforting. Yeah it does get easier and it makes me have massive respect for the newly sober or the novice runner but it is also cathartic to know that we are all just imperfect people trying to get through one more day or mile as efficiently and gracefully as possible. The exploration of humility and progress and their relationship is profound. Keep stringing those days and miles together friend. And when a rut comes on a new trail or meeting or therapist or cross training can be very helpful    
I relate to this a lot. You should think about cross posting in SDrunners :)
