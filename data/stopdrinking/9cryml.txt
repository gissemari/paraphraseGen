Thank you to everyone who subscribes to this sub. Everyone who posts and shares their stories struggles and triumphs. Because it makes what everyone else is going through real. It lets us know our struggles are shared. I made it 4 weeks without a drink. My birthday is on Friday I will be 33. 28 days was the longest I made it without alcohol in my adult life. I decided I would drink that night so I did. Nothing catastrophic happened but here I am 6 weeks later. 28 days got reset made it to 13 then it became less and less...I read and listened to This Naked Truth which I recommend to everyone. It is a great book that helped. My wife has been so supportive and helpful. Her father is a lifetime alcoholic. I felt a thousand better I was taking advantage of weekends instead of using them to get over my binge drinking. I had energy and focus I had not felt in over a decade. yet I knew and decided to drink that one day which turned to a weekend. I felt like crap the week after. My stomach my head...i felt drained after just one weekend. So I decided this proved I am a better man without alcohol. It was worth it...I am resetting my badge today. I know above all else I am a better man when I don't drink alcohol. As thousands of you I have had countless resets. I can track the history of my volume of drinking and relapses and I have gotten better over the past 3 years.  This sub is a huge part of my recent success. Thank you all for making my experiences real every time I read a post I know I am not alone. I start again today as day 1. Discipline and determination! IWNDWYT
