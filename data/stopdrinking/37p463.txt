Maybe a beer or cider tastes good at first.. but I get anxious and afraid to even drive after just one drink. I get restless and anxious to go and move or do things like exercise even. I don't like sitting around a bar anymore.. how did I even do that ever. Let alone I used to sit in a bar 5x a week for hours and close the bar...The money......I have ACNE immediately..I am bloated and my face is chubby and puffy..I sweat a lot more..Considering how AMAZING I have FELT and LOOKED this year I can't even continue to drink just seeing what a bit of it has done to me.....I also happened to try a cigarette for the first time in 5 months. How did I ever? ..What I am trying to say here is if you develop a new routine and mindset it WILL stick and become habit. I am bulletproof. I am a new me. I wake up early sleep early I work out I do good in school and work and I spend my money on REAL things and EXPERIENCES. I put good things into my body and I enjoy how I look and feel. Alcohol has no part in that for me. I considered it recently as more of a "social" option but even responsibly I did not enjoy it...Newbies hang in there. It certainly takes time.
