We hit 5000 subscribers today.  I thought it'd be fun to take a little trip down memory lane. A sort of /r/stopdrinking through the ages:..[8/20/2011 - 10 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jp49i/10_subscribers_already_awesome/)..[8/21/2011 - 50 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/jprwo/50_subscribers_awesome_welcome_everyone/)..[9/16/2011 - 200 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ki6li/200two_hundred_subscribers_awesome/)..[9/27/2011 - 300 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/kt45b/297_298_299_300_300_subscribers_awesome_d/)..[10/26/2011 - 500 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/lq26x/500_rstopdrinkers_500_lives_changing_for_the/)..[11/17/2011 - 700 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mghnc/over_700_subscribers/)..[12/13/2011 - 1000 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/nb728/1000_subscribers/)..[1/5/2012 - 1500 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/o3mi4/1500_members_that_was_quick_unbelievable_traffic/)..[3/4/2012 - 2000 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qhpfr/over_2000_subscribers/)..[5/6/2012 - 2500 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/tan4c/2500_subscribers_wowee_give_yourselves_a_big/)..[7/5/2012 - 3000 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/w3b1h/3000_members_of_sd/)..[9/23/2012 - 4000 subscribers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/10cf92/4000_subscribers/)..12/7/2012 - 5000 subscribers..We picked up a few hundred subscribers last night largely because [this heartbreaking post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14evxu/lady_paid_for_a_bottle_at_the_liquor_store_and/) was the #1 post on all of reddit.  I was chatting with needmorecowbe11 about it via [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/?nick=pick_a_name) where he observed "it's odd how one person's relapse may have helped a bunch of people open up to sobriety."  Poignant.  Cowbell's pretty bright for a Michigan fan. ..It's an important reminder that sharing our stories both the good and the bad helps others to help themselves. That's all we do here - we share our stories our triumphs our failures. We tell others what worked for us with hopes that it will help them find what works for them. ..The aim of this subreddit hasn't changed since Franks wrote these words one year ago:..>As we go forward beyond 1000 users to 2000 5000 or 10000 I hope that we can remain true to the spirit of the subreddit. To make sure that we are open to anyone who wants to get control of their lives and tackle their problem drinking. That we can make sure that everyone feels welcome here no matter who they are where they come from or what methods they're using...In the sidebar you'll see that badgebot has a number after its name.  That number represents the total number of sober days on all of our badges. Right now it stands at 1146144 days.  That's a collective **3140 years** of sober time for /r/stopdrinking members. It blows me away. ..Thanks everyone for making this such a wonderful place.  ..[~~You~~ We've got this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgGr1-JA5io)

Wow this really made my day. Whenever anyone complains about the Internet just being cats politics and porn (not that there's anything wrong with that) I smile a little to myself knowing how many thousands of people here at r/sd are helping thousands of others. It's truly an awe inspiring community.
Yep. That was the post which woke my ass up.
Wow we rock congratulations us!..I'm always shocked when someone comments on my barely coherent ranting and raving and says how much something I said helped them- but it happens. ..Welcome to everyone who's new. Hang around and stay a while the people here are amazing.

And here I thought badgebot was some sort of immortal sober freak of nature
Really hope I'm not the only one that didn't know that Badgebot's number was the total of all badges...
Thank you for being here all of you. You're making my days about living instead of drowning! 
Great post otr! Thanks for being such an active part of this sub and the chat. You helped me a lot in my early sobriety and it's so cool to see this place grow into a better place every day.
Hello... I am not an alcoholic or a recovering one but I would like to try to get more people involved in this subreddit.  I'm glad my post helped so many people find each other for support. This community is amazing and I've never seen so many brave strong souls unite like this.  Thanks everyone you all rock! 
Great post otr.  Thanks for doing what you do.  And everyone be well!
You made me want to request a badge!
This place has made such a huge difference for me. Thanks everyone.
God that picture is heart breaking. It hits especially close to home due to the toonie in there...My three month is coming up too...
All I really have to add is GO BUCKS! Robbed of 1st place!! :-[  .  .And congrats on the sobriety fellow SD'ers. :)
This subreddit is a spiritual experience. You can't see hear touch smell or taste the positive impact of strangers helping strangers but it is real nonetheless. ..Individually who are we? But as a group we are somethin'! This is an example of what I call spirituality. 
I love this place. Love love love. It's been quite the journey so far!
Excellent!!!  :D
Thanks so much to everyone for the amazing resources that have been marshaled to make this place what it is. What an incredible place made all the better by the great mods who keep it all rolling. Thanks to all of you!

I keep comin' back every day
Awesome! I know sharing my story on here has helped me even though I just found this a few days ago. I have since been reading and upvoting everyone's stories.
