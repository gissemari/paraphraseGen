But I'm already down 3 pounds from the almost 20 I gained in the past year of drinking. It's been 3 days. As a petite woman who has always struggled with self image this is unreal. ..I'm excited to see how this progresses moving forward!

Any time I stopped drinking I would drop about 5 lbs of water weight pretty fast.  Especially if I was mostly consuming beer and wine.  Booze bloating is very real.
I have dropped 30 kg in 6 month period. It really goes fast down. Just be on the track! :)
When I slowed my drinking I lost 50 pounds over 6 months. And I'm a pretty slim guy nowadays especially.
It's easy to discount all of the extra calories in alcohol!..Long as you don't find yourself compensating with food the weight loss should continue!
Dropped 16 lbs in 42 days so far.  Only ten pounds over my lifetime average doing nothing but eating better taking daily walks and while still drinking a lot of Coca-Cola for the sugar and caffeine fix.  I've got piles of clothes I was going to give to charity I can now wear again. 
I've always been petite too I stopped drinking last May and dropped 10 pounds. But when I drank I would always eat EVERYTHING and my hangover food was always dripping with grease. ..Most importantly the way I feel about my body changed - I'm liking me a whole lot more :) ..IWNDWYT
I've lost weight too about 5 pounds which was mostly water weight and alcohol bloat I'm sure. Still looking a lot better and seeing results from working out! 
i'm down ten pounds in eight days!
I'm down 15 pounds from however long my badge says! It's the best diet ever :)
