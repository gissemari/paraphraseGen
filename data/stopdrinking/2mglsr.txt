I think as a community we can be kindest and most helpful when we remember that no matter where we are in our journey of sobriety we all started somewhere. And especially in early days many of us were scared emotionally raw and confused and needed a gentle hand to guide us and words of support. I don't think anyone here wants to do harm or be hurtful which makes it all the more sad when it happens. The world can be poopy enough to us alcoholics without us being mean to one another. ..Any way hopefully this will make for a positive change going forward!

Losing a pet is way harder than people like to acknowledge. I shudder to think about going through that experience with my own little bean. Especially seeing as it was very traumatic for you. Remember that your little guy didn't die alone. ..When my grandmother died and I was trying to stay sober I binge watched the first season of Lost. I found that it took my mind off of it in a healthier way than drinking or using. (which we know doesn't even work that way.) ..Anyway I again am so sorry for your loss I can't even imagine what you're going through especially this early in your sobriety. Keep at it I'm not far along yet but everyone I have spoken to (I just broke up with a long-term partner) says it gets better. I'm also so grateful that I'm dealing with my experience totally sober.
