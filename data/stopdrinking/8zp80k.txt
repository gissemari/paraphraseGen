Hey friends. Just another SDer's 2 cents on the badge/time clock phenomenon. I really like that the rule is to use it as it works best for you personally. ..I clung to each hour and refreshed the hell out of my Noom app in the first couple of months. Now I have two clocks going : one that I set back in February after my first relapse of two drinking episodes so I could see the cumulative number of hours/days money and time I was racking up and one that I started from zero after said the second relapse in April. That is my  real  clock and also aligns with my badge on SD. ..Having both clocks if you will helps remind me that even though I relapsed I didn't throw away all those sober days in between (90.days and 56 days!) and I still saved all that money...My badge you see on this post is my cumulative-to-date-no-relapse. Keeps me honest. It may be helpful for some other folks to keep a running clock as well as one that you can re-start which will still show you all the progress you made each time. ..Of course many of you smarties may already have a better system for this! If so I'd love to hear it!..Keep on truckin' everyone. IWNDWYTD
