So I went out on Saturday night and drank a bunch hence my newly reset badge. ..I had fun hung out with people I don't normally nothing terrible happened. I did hurt my leg which is embarrassing and annoying and spent a ton of money which makes me feel stupid. I wasted my Sunday which I totally expected...So here I am at work almost 56 hours from my last drink and I am amazed at how terrible I still feel. I am beyond exhausted (can barely keep my eyes open at my desk) my stomach is constantly growling even if I'm eating more than usual and my motivation is exactly 0%. ..Not that I feel tempted to try and moderate but it's good to be reminded that even when nothing "bad" happens when drinking the effects are hardly constrained to the drinking period or even just the day after! Nooooo thank you. Whatever "fun" I had is not worth this day to day struggle.

"Spending a ton of money" "Hurt my leg which is embarrassing." "56 hours from my last drink and I am amazed at how terrible I still feel".All good stuff to remember.  I won't drink with you today.  Congratulations on getting right back on the horse.  We can do this.
Those 2 or 3 day hangovers are the worst.  It's funny how a not "bad" night still involves things like hurting yourself and spending a bunch of money. I'm realizing I never had good nights..
It's so not even worth it. Welcome back &amp; I won't be drinking with you today.
