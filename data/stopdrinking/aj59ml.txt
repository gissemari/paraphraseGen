Im 34 and living in Germany. I skipped school early and wasted my time with drugs and alcohol. So last year i began a training in retail. I have to work for 750 euro per month for two and a half years. I like my bosses but they are both 8 years younger than me. They teach me literally nothing. They don't even have a degree in something related to retail. I don't go to school because im over 30 years old. It was my choice if i go to school or not because im over 30 years old. Im suffering from panic attacks in a school environment so i chose not to go there. I have experience in many jobs but that counts nothing in Germany. You just get minimum wage. If you want more you need that fucking degree. That means you have to work for less than minimum wage for 2-3 years. When you're 16 years old or something this might be okay but not at my age and with my experience. Every day I'm struggling with quitting this bullshit. Now that I'm sober I'm getting even more frustrated. Don't really know what to do in my situation. But IWNDWYT

If you have any free time you might try online programming classes. At Udemy you can get very good courses for like $12. I'm not sure what its like in Germany but at least in the US you can get good paying jobs in software without a degree if you have the skills.
