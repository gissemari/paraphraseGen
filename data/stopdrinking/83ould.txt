There was something about today that made me look back at my calendar from last year. And sure enough there was an anniversary......The day after Boxing Day 2016 I had decided I had enough drinking. And I joined this subreddit. I made it 73 days. Until March 10 2017. The afternoon of March 11 I thought it would be fun to go for a drink...The mods must be sick of me because since then I've reset my badge what feels like dozens of times (Just checked -- 32 times -- yeah so dozens). And I hadn't always reset my badge on time...After today I'll be back to day seven which I believe may be the second-longest time since that March 11 2017 relapse. When I get to two weeks I'll be on par with the longest time away from alcohol. ..Just posting to take stock of the situation. I am proud of myself for not drinking this weekend because there may be only one or two other weekends in the past year that I hadn't drank...I won't drink with you today..

You keep trying...You have all of my respect.
The point is you keep getting back on the wagon you've never given up and that is awesome! Way to go! 
Good for you! IWNDWYT.
I'm working on that seventh day as well. Hang in there and we'll get through the weekend...IWNDWYT
This is the longest period of sobriety I've had in three years.  Never give up trying!  I was sober for 17 years and they were the best years of my life.  We can do this!  Hang in there!
