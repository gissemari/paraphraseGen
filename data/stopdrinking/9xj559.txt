This is my first time writing here. I just created a separate account. Just wanted to share that last night I realized that I'm definitely an alcoholic. The voice in my head that tries to convince me other wise well that voice is bs. I had a week sober was going to meetings working with a sponsor. Last night I was dwelling over my recent break up and couldn't sit with my own self anymore. I got two bottles of wine drank them woke up feeling horrible drank another one today. I can not live like this anymore.

You are here now with a truth revealed. Glad you are with us. You are not alone and we can do this together. ..What's the next step?
OP can I ask you to be kind to yourself? You're in a double whammy right now. The first week was when I had my worst withdrawals and anxiety. To add to it you're going thru a breakup and such an emotional trigger is pretty tough. Alcohol kicks you down enough you don't need to help it by bringing tough on yourself. ..Think of it this way. If you start in Wisconsin head to California and get lost in Iowa you don't have to go back to Wisconsin. Just have to find your way out of Iowa. ..Stay positive. It gets better - you'll see. Just for today let's try not to drink shall we? IWNDWYT!
When I was in your position words coming at me felt like... a flood of wrongness... even when they meant well. I would nearly faint from social anxiety at AA. So I'll keep it short - come back &amp; check in write yourself a note to do so. We'll be here
