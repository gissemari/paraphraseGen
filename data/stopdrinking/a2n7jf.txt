I've been drinking for years and it feels like over time I've become dried out. My skin feels dry and itches. I've become sensitive to the sun and heat. Sensitive to touch too. My lips are dry and cracked and I keep peeling bits of skin off...The thing is a while ago I went completely sober for a few months and I still felt dried out. I was drinking plenty of water but it didn't seem to make that much of a difference. ..I'm wondering if there's something else at play here. Maybe it's caffeine making me dehydrated too? Although I don't have much...Anyway did you guys struggle with this problem while drinking and/or during sobriety? Did it eventually pass?
