Hello fellow ssober people. Today I mark 191 sober days it hasn't been easy but surely worth it...Six months a go I was emotionally and financially broke. Now I feel emotionally stable have a steady job where Im exceling and somehow I managed to save a whole month salary not drinking has give me great things in life and I can say I dont have the desire to go back to the dark place I was. ..Im going to AA meetings but until recently I feel kinda discourage to attend and actually thinking trying another group. I feel really grateful to what AA has give me and the support and understanding that I get in the meetings but few people on my group gives me the creeps. Im a 26 year old guy with no kids and no partner my group consist mostly of old people some of them with a lot of years of sobriety and I dont really relate to the same issues some of them have. ..I found some really helpfull and special people but I just cant stand the constant hostily of few of them with in and out relapses and the constant feeling that they are hitting on every woman that comes to the group for help. I think is gross. In a way I dont have the feeling of it as a safe enviroment for such vulnerable people and is starting to giving me a lot of anxiety and becoming the major reason im not attending meetings. Anyway I still follow the program by myself and havent even think of relapse. I would like to try and seek a group with younger people that I can relate to and with people that I feel kinda safe?..My sponsor told me that this is about people before personalities and that my sobriety should come first assuming that my sobriety depends on my attendance to meetings I should let things go accept and keep going to meetings. But every time I feel discouraged and I dont think is fair to myself to force me to be in a place where I dont feel good I did that a lot in the past and drank about it now I cannot do that...&amp;#x200B;..Anyway tell me what you think This sub has been very benefitial to me.

Well as a female I tried AA before and this is what put me off. I had a guy following me round the meetings. I spoke to an older woman who initially took me seriously but it soon descended into platitudes. The regular meetings were 95% men. I was shocked when I went to a women's meeting and there were so many people there. And it struck me; they don't go to regular meetings because of those guys. It can be a real problem in some meetings because AA doesn't have a mechanism for dealing with harassment. ..And personally I'd say objecting to sexual harassment and having it treated like a personality clash is one of the many reasons I as a female don't go to the meetings. It feels like they privilege the sobriety of abusers over the safety (and sobriety) of their victims.
