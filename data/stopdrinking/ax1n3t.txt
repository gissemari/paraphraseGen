Little bit of a back story...I've known I did not have a healthy relationship with alcohol for over 20 years. Unlike most I struggle with getting past day 1 but then can go 3 weeks with no real craving.  This is when I start to compromise and tell mself the lie that maybe I can control it better than I had in the past.  I cannot...Today is my fathers 86th birthday.  Im happy to report that although alcohol was present at our family get together I decided to abstain.  As I left the party I thought about how present I was throughout the day.   The interactions with family were not strained.  There were genuine feels of joy and content.  None of this would have been a possibility had I decided to drink...If you struggle like i do then know there is hope.  Dont believe the lie.  Stay present in your life.  It may be the best gift you can give the people you love the most...IWNDWYT

That's so awesome that you were able to have positive interactions with your family. I am excited to have better relationships with mine now that I'm not going to be drinking around them anymore. IWNDWYT

Day 2 for me too. This is a big deal. Don't want to say too much as my actions are more important than words right now. Strength to us!
