I dont want to have a whine but I need to get this off my chest...Today is day 4 no drinking after being a bottle of spirits a day drinker for just over 5 years. But each day after having stopped I'm realizing more and more how bad my addiction has been. I've lost my relationship friends family finances and maybe even my job just from how I was drinking. The withdrawals are the worst I cant stop shaking I havent been able to sleep and I have this anxiety that wont go away. I'm ashamed of what I've become but i know that doing this is the best thing for me even though it might feel like it. ..Seeing this page has really been helping me I'm still struggling hour by hour but reading the stories from everyone and the support has really helped me stay strong and will help me to continue to do so... Stay strong everyone and thank you so much!

Hey I don't want to be annoying if you already know but are you aware of the risks of acute withdrawal? Please see your doctor that's a dangerous amount to come off without medication.   .Congrats on day four mine too. Can't believe I've got this far this time. I drove 1.5 hours away from my bankcard/civilisation though so going home tomorrow will be the test 
Definitely go to the doctor. There are medicines that can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal (I'm day 5 and am currently on one of those medicines) and it's really been helping. The docs will know best and they are so kind and supportive about trying to stop drinking. I felt ashamed when I first went to the doc but it was the best thing I could've done at the time. 
I think I'm on day five or six and still don't sleep. Shaking is gone but cramping and constant stress.  You might need treatment I did but was stubborn. IWNDWYT
