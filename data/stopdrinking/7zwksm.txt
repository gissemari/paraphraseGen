That's really the reason I've relapsed usually in the past. But it's not that simple to avoid stress. Right now I am actually stress free because I am away from my GF and at my parents. I don't really  miss her because of the fact I am stress free. You might be wondering why am I trying to hold on to her? Well we had a child together earlier this year. And she already has a 7 year old kid (from someone else). She is very possessive of her kids and of course everything I do magnifies 10 times due to kids in the house. Anyways not sure what the right thing to do is in the future. Before anyone starts bashing me for not being there for my son I had to come to my parents. She told me I won't be able to see my son unless I "get help" and go to my parents. I was always taking care of him properly 100%. She just did not trust me due to my car wreck and anger issues. She has anger issues too btw. But I am the type who will scream at her while she is the type who won't but in the end we both say the same shit when arguing. I have been taking care of my son financially even when I am away btw so don't hate on me for not being around! Anyways I am going to go see him in April for a week. He will be 9 months by then. I doubt he will remember me. I left him when he was 6 months old. Anyways thanks for reading.

I have been in your situation a couple years ago where my drinking got out of hand and was not the best mother for my son addiction is a strange thing. Everyone was calling me a piece of shit while I couldn't stop drinking to save my life. You will figure it out the best advice is is not focusing on what could be worse focus all the energy on bettering yourself and how you want you want you kid to grow up.  Regardless of you and your girlfriend. Your kid will suffer the most if you don't want recovery. Life isn't easy sober but I promise you it's way better not being a drunk and building the relationship with your kid.   he is still a baby you can do this! My son is 5 and we have a really good bond now that I'm sober it takes time.
