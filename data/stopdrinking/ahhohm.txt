27 years old and I've been drinking for nearly 14 years now with a cross tolerance/addiction to benzos. Last year (2018) I went to detox twice relapsing almost immediately after leaving losing my job after my second attempt at detox. Drinking has controlled and directed my life for years and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of waking up sick needing a drink then being too drunk to accomplish anything after that first drink (because when is that first drink just one?) Scared to just cold turkey after what I've experienced in the past I'm looking to cut down on my drinking but without a job or daily structure it's tough that's for sure! Anyways just here to wish you all the best of luck in your journey and kind of vent myself a bit!

Hi LastChance. I totally relate to how life can control and direct your life. Since you dont have a job at the moment maybe you caN Build in structure a different way that is tailored to recovery. E.g. exercising and eating at certain times finding support groups to go to regularly. .Also I have seen some rough stories on here about dangerous withdrawal symptoms. Maybe you should go see someone medically to make sure you do it safe?.Rooting for you..IWNDWYT
