Posting late-ish but I've been crazy busy today! Not drinking with you all today. :)..Treated my mom my sister and myself to some Strawberry Acai refreshers from Starbuck's (MAN are those bad boys delicious!). Cooked dinner for the family- shish kebabs (kabobs? I still don't know. LOL) surprised my momma with a card a rose a teddy bear Peanut M&M's and tickets to see Bruno Mars this summer! I feel like I forgot how great it feels to see someone genuinely happy and know that you're the cause of it. I've been so groggy and depressed all the time that the happiness of the people I love wasn't really a thought let alone my own. ..Today I presented my ma with the material gifts first- but the tears didn't start flowing until she read the card I wrote personally for her. Don't get me wrong we're both sentimental chicks and cry plenty. But before she even finished it she held me and said that I'm her angel and she'll always be proud of me. That moment is so much inspiration for me to beat these demons and live freely...I still struggle with regrets from messing up in the past but I have to remember that all I can do at this point is be the best me for the future. I've had many friends on here give me this advice as well and it has helped me out so much already. It may be a long road ahead but it's an exciting one! Sorry for the big wall of text really didn't mean to talk this much! I just love my momma y'all. Mother's Day is a great day for some but can also be sensitive day for others but I hope everyone has been able to stay strong and happy today regardless. High five!.

Sounds like a lovely day and I bet your mom really appreciated your thoughtfulness.
