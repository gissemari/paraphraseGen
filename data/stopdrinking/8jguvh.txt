I started a new job completely hungover.  I haven't drank in a couple weeks but it was sunny out and wanted to chill before my first day.  Oops got about an hour of sleep and felt like an idiot.  Luckily the job is online (coding) so nobody knew any better but I sure felt like an idiot at 5 this morning.  The struggle continues. IWNDWYT

Welcome back!..Congrats on the new job don't make a balls of it!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
But you are a powerful wizard of the cheese. You have had setbacks and challenges before an lo you did vanquish them and lay them at your feet with your mighty cheese powers! You shall do so again oh mighty one!!..Sorry -- couldn't resist -- your user name is just too awesome...Seriously though - way to fall down and get right back up. I'm right there with you on the power of a gorgeous day to trigger that desire for a long stretch of drinking. Still working on doing other fun stuff (fishing going for a walk or a drive etc...) in place of sitting in a lawn chair next to a cooler. But we'll get there!!..Congrats on the new gig!..IWNDWYT!
