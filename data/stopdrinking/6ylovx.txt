Don't think I've been sober for a month straight since I was 18 now am 28. .Quit smoking pot 3 years ago when I met my now-wife. Turns out that was easy compared to this. .I never thought I had a problem until the past year or two. When I realized that wanting to kick the habit wasn't enough. .I've tried to quit roughly a dozen times now. I had ten days until two days ago. .One day I'd like to have developed the discipline to be able to drink when I want to and stay sober the rest of the time. But for now I'm convinced that idealization is hurting more than helping. ..It's not how much I drink. Frequently it would only be two drinks a day. But the average creeps up and it would turn into 5-6 drinks for several days in a row. It's been like that for years although when I was younger I'd also have those 20 drink binge nights. ..I'm in Finland. No local sub. It's hard to know what help I might need or where to get it. Therapy would help a ton and I've reached out to several but I have yet to find one that I can afford. ..I know I've got some mental health issues but I'd really prefer to get a few months of sobriety under my belt before trying any medications which is why I'm looking for a therapist and not a psychiatrist. I think my problems are mainly anxiety-related not clinical depression or bipolar or worse and I want my body to have a chance to balance itself out without becoming dependent on something else right away. Does that sound like a good idea?..Even though I don't drink tons or ever get blackout drunk the first few days are killer every time I stop. And every time I relapse and stop again it seems to be worse although I think this time it's worse just because I made it longer i.e. got cleaner. But it's like my brain is on fire with irritability and anxiety got awful stress headaches and then it melts into depression. You guys who've gone before me does this sound like par for the course? ..With my background and things I've experienced I can't overstate how much I think talk therapy would benefit me. But in a foreign country the options are limited and of course the main issue is financial. I'm not sure how to make progress on this. I've wondered about therapy done over the internet but the money problem is still there even if that option exists. ..Geez this is quite the word vomit. To anyone reading it thanks. I'm just writing because I feel like it's the tiniest bit of productive positive action I'm capable of taking at the moment while trying to deal with this low mood. ..Got to go pick up my toddler from daycare in a bit. I want to be there for him so bad. I'm a good dad but I know I can be a better one if I put all this shit behind me. I'll be less impatient less irritable less self-centered have more time for him (and my wife). ..And thank goodness for my wife. Sticking by me. She doesn't drink at all thankfully. She doesn't understand what I'm going through but she would do anything to help if only I could figure out what it is that I need help with. ..Glad this sub is here. Visited it a while back but wasn't ready. I'm so ready now. I know this badge is going to help. ..

Writing this and acknowledging your issues is already a great start. I'm unfamiliar with the Finnish health system but Nordic European countries usually have a lot of options (at least it seems so). I wouldn't immediately dismiss a psychiatrist I don't have mental health issues and see one (just saw her 20 minutes ago) but I see her in her capacity as a therapist (no medication just talking). The help she has provided me is immeasurable. It might also be helpful to have a long conversation with your wife about this. This sub is fantastic no judgement and a sense of personal accountability keep coming back.I won't drink with you today. Wish you the best. 
Glad you're here!
