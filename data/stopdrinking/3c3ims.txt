I'm currently stuck in a shitty albeit temporary situation with my child's other parent staying with me. He spent the morning throwing things in my face that I had done that have been less than optimal (sleeping a few days away). I am not excusing myself it was because I was hungover. Something I'm not going to do again. ..But the thing is that I am a much better parent than him. He has done the exact same things multiple times but not hungover. He just ignores basic parenting/housecleaning/normal adult duties in general. But he loves to pick fights when I am feeling good. ..I realize how I sound like a crazy bitch but I'm upset. I'm not a better person than him I just struggle with not drinking around him. ..The thing is he seems to go out of his way to pick fights with me when I am doing well. He complains about my lack of energy drive etc. when I am drinking but I think that he likes it. He likes having something to hold over my head. It means I'm more willing to let him stay. So he shoots me down as soon as I start getting my shit together. Like I said I probably sound crazy but obviously there is more to it than that and none of my friends/family like him because he is insanely manipulative. ..Sorry for the rant but I needed to get this out before getting on with my day which is going to be fantastic. Fuck drinking I am not waking up tomorrow 30 and hungover. It's going to be hard though so I am going to check in again tonight. Time for a fucking fantastic day. ..Edit: I am no way shape or form saying that I'm perfect or better than him this is just my struggle this morning.

You can do it! He's abusive. He needs to go
You're playing a dangerous game by setting a goal for how long you won't drink. What happens if you do drink? It turns us into pretty hopeless people when we do that. Why not just stay sober for today? Instead of never being hungover again just don't be hungover tomorrow.If you drink you drink and it's not the end of the world...You also need to own it. I hear a lot of blame in this post. Get a sponsor and work the steps seriously.
