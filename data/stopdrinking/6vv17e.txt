I've struggled with extremes for a long time. I had to be the **best** at this one thing achieve at the **highest** level have the **most** attractive girlfriend possible.....The list goes on and I suspect many of you know the drill. The longer I'm sober the more I'm learning that moderation not with alcohol but in many aspects of life is bringing me a greater deal of happiness...It might sound silly but striving to avoid extremes is helping me feel like I'm healing. I've learned to practice patience and I'm much slower to anger. I can empathize better with those around me and am able to see much more of life now that I'm not clouded by the delusional drive to be the BEST!!! Lol it's kinda funny looking back - I didn't go to MIT I'm not a MD I can't run 100 meters in less than 10.00 seconds and I'll probably never write a book blah blah blah...And that's okay.. I'm learning that now. There's a certain beauty to normalcy. I'm proud of my normalcy because it's helped me dig down and unearth bits of who I really am. I'm finding qualities I like about myself things that simply weren't visible when I was drowning in alcohol...It's a simple thought but it's true. Funny how clich s are clich d for a reason - because they're flat out right. I'm still learning and I'll continue to learn. Not going to drink tonight and take steps in the opposite direction.

Well said my friend. I remember feeling like a dick at my own Christmas party. The next morning actually... naturally. ..Normalcy can be a sobering thought..I'm banking on it. ..I'll not drink with you today. .
Share those feelings too keep going!
Sounds like me. The constant struggle to be seen as the BEST and MOST SUCCESSFUL and tell the most INTERESTING STORIES has made me very unhappy. I've calmed down a lot about those things in only a couple weeks off drinking.
Sounds like you've got it sorted.  I won't drink with you today.
Yup I'm my own worst critic but I'm working on it.  I'm super open minded and empathetic to others but not myself.  I'm always addicted to something but before it was a healthy addiction working out and eating right.  It's like playing wack-a-mole.  Once I have control over one thing another pops up.  Balance is difficult.  ..Thank you for sharing
