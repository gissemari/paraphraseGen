Happy V day y'all! ..It's been a few weeks since I've made it to a meeting and it's not like I've been struggling or anything but I feel guilty for not being at my home group this morning. I've been doing really well... I landed my dream job (no joke) after a couple months of anxious unemployment and my relationship has been great. I have been eating hella healthy and feeling awesome. ..But like I kinda fell out of contact with my sponsor and just haven't been going to the fellowship at all. I do go to meditation at Refuge Recovery once a week and hang out on SD daily but I'm starting to question my relationship to AA. Don't get me wrong- I actually love AA... I really like speaker discussions and I keep my chips in a super visible place that make me proud each time I see them-- but I feel like the pressure to "work the program" and like call people and give out my phone number is just not me-- at least not right now. I have a lot of support in my life and can talk to those close to me about what I'm going through and for once in my life I feel like I am NOT being an emotional burden on everyone around me. I really value the community aspect of knowing there are so many others out there like me but I'm not feeling the need to share all about it all the time. It's the first time I'm NOT an open book- and I really value that. ..I know everyone's program is different for them so I just wanted to get all that off my chest. I recognize that becoming a dry drunk is a slippery slope. I don't intend to abandon AA forever but I do feel guilty for not having shown up for a while is all. ..Happy to be clean and serene on this gorgeous Cali day! <3

That term "dry drunk" is just another one of those derogatory labels AA throws around..Hey it sounds like you are doing great and do not need the programme right now. I think that is good news..I don't think it is right for people to be made to feel like they are on a slippery slope just because they are not working the AA belief system..Those steps are pretty slippery if you ask me..Congrats on all your good news!.
I'm feeling somewhat similar these days.  My sponsor is out of town for another eight-week trip to a small island where she's incommunicado (her second such in the year and a half she's been my sponsor) and even though I'm making it to at least a meeting or two a week--one of which I chair--I'm not feeling the urge to reach out in person so much.  I'm not feeling guilty just like I'm in a more dormant period...I love having SD as a "backup plan" when I'm in that mode because I certainly do check in here every single day.  I love AA too but I think people who are naturally introverted sometimes get accused of isolating when I really do need my down time!  I can see where it could be that slippery slope though.
