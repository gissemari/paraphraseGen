I'm 22 and I'm currently sitting in a hospital waiting room because I've been vomiting blood all day after a night of heavy drinking. I've struggled with depression most of my life and alcohol has always been my go to coping mechanism. I can't keep doing this to myself. I want to stop drinking more than anything but I've always failed when I've tried. I'm hoping this is the last time I'll be in this position. I'm hoping that this is an expensive but necessary wakeup call. I'm hoping posting here will give me the extra motivation to succeed thanks.

Good luck friend. I believe in you
I'm glad you're getting medical attention that must be so scary. I'm 25 and I checked in to the hospital on December 25 and it's the best thing I've ever done for myself. Been sober since still taking it a day at a time.
Good luck! You can do this and I'm rooting for you!
G luck!
