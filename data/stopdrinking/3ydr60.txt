I am having the worst Christmas ever. Relapsing and ultimate regret. I need to figure out a support system..... Trying to go about this alone does not work. :(otgyyy

Are you able to get to an AA meeting? Or do you have any sober friends you could hang with? Sober supports are an essential part of my sobriety. I'm staying sober today - want to join me?
Online support is here until you can get to a meeting. Let's stay sober tonight and tomorrow. 
When I came back from relapse I found my first steps back were [Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) Let's walk them together!
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off! You got this. Look for the learning experience and start moving forward. You're a good person and don't forget it.
This can be the last time you experience these feelings...I wish you tunnel-vision on sobriety and courage.
