Eight months into sobriety today. No lapses no relapses. Feels good to clock 2/3 of a year. They say if you can stay sober for a year your chances of going to the grave an addict drops below 50%. A couple of things I've noticed in the last stretch of recovery:..  Daily exercise is up above an hour and makes me feel great;..  Finally kicked cigarettes for more than a month;..  Got a yoga mat to become more regular with my practice;..  Started taking a multi-vitamin even if it just gives me a mild placebo effect it's worth it;..  Haven't missed a daily meditation for more than 40 days longest straight yet;..  Giving an encouraging comment to someone here is one of the most important parts of my day...Still a way to go yet till the odds come my way but should the gods smile on me I'll have fair wind all the way to the three hundred and sixty-fifth day.

Excersize was a game changer to me as well. SD as mine main support as well. Finding a new hobbies and re discovering the old ones too. I have to admitt that the last 10 months in recovery was more fulfilled than last 2-3 years of drinking. Everything is possible if you want to make it right. Good luck keep pushing! IWNDWYT!
Way to go southeralps! I'm happy for you. IWNDWYT 
Congratulations. That's awesome. IWNDWYT  
Thank you for this post. It's easy to slack off on the healthy mind habits. I believe that keeping up with those habits keeps us away from the more hiding/ alcohol behaviors. 
MEDITATION FOR THE WIN! IWNDWYT. And I will be meditating with you today. Consistency and balance are two of my biggest values and I loved reading about your journey.
