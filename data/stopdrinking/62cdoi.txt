It was like nothing triggered it. I just needed to get some chores done and it was extremely hot. Someone else (so it felt) drove me to the liquor store to buy the 12 pack I used to drink then we left. I had my first can but still..it didn't feel like me. ..Until it hit....I did my chores while drinking and god did I miss my alcohol. I walked to a friends later and we had a few shots. This guy is a very good friend and knows that this really was my only night drinking in another long while. ..Something about it all was just different. Yea I blacked out near the end of the night nice and safe in my bed as my friend dropped me off and I didn't make a fool out of myself. ..What I think is yes even though I enjoyed drinking that night I didn't enjoy it that much and really don't feel the need to drink again. Hopefully I can make it to a year this time dammnitt lol. Day at a time. ..I had work the next day and I went but my boss said I looked like shit and should go home. Since know one knows I drunk they all thought I was actually just sick. That was nice. I know what alcohol is like and I know how bad it is and can get ya anytime. I feel by relapsing I've given myself more knowledge and tools for the brain to stay away from the shit...Love to all. Need to change my badge :( I'm day 2 sober now.

I got to 10 months once. Then I relapsed. For 4 years! and my drinking was so much worse after that it seems that my drinking problem didn't really start until after my relapse. Obviously I did have a problem before (or why would I have quit for 10 months) but I don't  remember it being nearly as bad as the last few years (I'm nearly 2 months sober now). My point is be careful.
Relapses can and often do teach us something we needed to know.  Like you I learned that alcohol causes me damage and I just don't want it to be part of my life.  One other thing I noticed is that even *IF* I manage to just have a few my physical and emotional balance is thrown of kilter for a week or so.  So even IF I could moderate the value of having a drink does two things: a) Puts me at risk of having a lot more than one  b) screws with my body for days afterwards.  So if your relapse made your own personal relationship with alcohol more clear then it wasn't necessarily the end of the world.  But I would advise from my experience that you'll need to be 10x more vigilant for a while to come if you're not to fall right back into the alcohol cesspool.
