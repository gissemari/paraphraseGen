I've posted here and there in the past and had fleeting attempts at being sober. Over this year though it's been the frequent cycle of binge reset my badge repeat...Still ever searching for the hows/whys and best ways to better improve myself as I try to stop drinking. I realized that my mindset and perceptions of life are totally skewed and has been a major factor. I hate my job it's true - I tend to blame a lot of my relapses on the seemingly never-ending massive stress. My family situation has been strained so badly since my step-dad passed away a little over two years ago and my mother is not doing well - so that gets lumped into it all. In fact in general I really find I overall hate life and myself...This has led me to over the years developing this mindset that drinking provides me the only moments of respite from the all encompassing misery. That despite the hangovers after a weekend binge or missed days of work I still work my ass off and those moments of respite when dealing with particularly bad times somehow makes it "okay"...I found my brain going through these thoughts over and over last night as I was fighting massive cravings on a Friday night after another horrid work week. I wanted nothing more than to go to the store and scoop up some liquor despite the fact that I had responsibilities to attend this weekend...I had ended up looking at some pictures from about 4-5 years ago where I had a period of time that I was doing very well had lost a ton of weight was exercising regularly. Started feeling even more sorry and mad at myself for messing that up but realized that I have to do something about this mindset and perceptions I've set up for myself...The depression and general unhappiness in my life has been something I've had for some time and has only gotten worse over the years. However I realize I've done nothing but reinforce that as well as reinforce the bad habits of binge drinking because "well at least I get one night of relief"...So last night I cooked did on call work as it came in played some games and went to bed. Woke up this morning to the first sober Saturday I've had in a while now. Mulling all of it over made me realize that the only way I'm really going to succeed at this is to consciously get out of that old mindset and change my perceptions...This is nothing new and surely fairly obvious but for me I see that though I've wanted to stop drinking in the past I let that old mindset and way of thinking remain in the background without keeping it forefront and center and challenging myself to actively change it...Wall of text I know but I needed to get this out this morning as I felt a bit of an "A-HA!" moment.

Sounds as if you are designing a master plan and it looks to be very practical.  From what I read you know that alcohol is making everything worse.  It's not relieving  your stress causing health issues preventing you from thinking and acting appropriately.  Once I realized stress is unavoidable has to be managed and alcohol only makes dealing with it worse I was able to move on with my life.  Good luck and stay strong.
