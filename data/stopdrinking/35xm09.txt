My last post was about my relapse which ended in the back of a police car and a DUI.  My court date isn't for another 6 weeks so I do not know all of the consequences yet.  They have already suspended my drivers license for 90 days and this is the toughest thing at this point - getting around.  Luckily I work from home so this isn't too bad......In the meantime I signed up for a 5 month outpatient program (I'd like to do inpatient but I cannot afford it).  We meet 3 times a week for 3 hours at a time get drug and alcohol tested etc.  I really don't know what else is involved but I figure it cannot hurt......My attorney says this will look good when I get to court but that really isn't what I am doing this for.  I just want to stop altogether.  I had 7 months last year had lost 40 pounds was going to AA and was feeling great.  Then I lost it and had several relapses culminating in my arrest 8 days ago......So I am doubling down on recovery.  I want this so bad.
