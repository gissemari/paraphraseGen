I'm not sure what i'm asking for i'm probably just venting but! I injured my leg yesterday and as a result I can't walk or drive. Which means i can't walk/drive and can't sneak a cheeky alcohol purchase.  As of now i have a half a bottle of wine to last me for maybe a few days? I'm very anxious about not having any wine for a day let alone a few days maybe a even a week... I guess i'm asking for support or advice. Not having enough alcohol for the day gives me massive amount of anxiety and the anxiety drives me to drink and the cycle continues.... people in the same situation of no alcohol = wanting to drink how did you cope? what were your distractions from urges? Thanks guys &lt;3

Thia may be a blessing in disguise. Think about what will happen if you can't get more wine. You won't drink which will cause some anxiety but the day will pass and so will the anxiety. Take this day by day try to keep yourself busy with TV movies or any other hobby that'll get your mind off drinking. IWNDWYT!!!!!
I can feel your anxiety and sending supportive thoughts your way. Perhaps look at this as a short-term situation. Just for today... don't worry about where you'll get alcohol tomorrow. Just focus on today.
