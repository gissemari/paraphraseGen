1 hour down 4 or 5 more to go...approximately 40% of pancreas and spleen need to be removed to get rid of the tumor...Struggling with anxiety and emotions today...Stay sober my friends. ..Mouse..Edit: he made it through surgery. The tumor itself was about the size of a quarter and has been sent for testing. He had a hernia that made it difficult to get to the pancreas but doctor was able to take care of it.
