Today is day 10 on this journey to get back in control if my life. This is the longest I've been sober in six months so it feels pretty damn good.  It's also nice to not have my skin look like complete shit.  But I'm still really struggling with working at night. I work in a restaurant so a lot of my job is done at nighttime. I'm fine all day but when it's time to go home I really want to drink. The 15 minute drive back to my house is this battle of wills between what I know that I should do and want to do which is not drink and between this monster of desire that's telling me to drink. Stop at the store buy a bottle and go home. Everytime my brain is like you can just have a shot or two off the bottle and that's it it'll be fine. But the truth is everytime I've given in to the craving under the illusion that it'll just be a drink or two I end up mashed. I don't want to drink today and I'm not going to but jeez I'm tired of having the same conversations with myself in my head. Anyone experience this?

Yes on my way home from work I constantly have to do will myself not to go to the store for that bottle of wine or six-pack of beer. If you're like me you got into the habit of "unwinding" with a drink or two (or more alas)...I've tried to distract myself by different things: coming here to s/d drinking La Croix in a wine glass watching Netflix calling friends on the phone- the list goes on. Hang in there- they say it gets easier!
Oh yes I know the witching hour well. It actually started ten minutes ago for me. That's why I'm here - reading and eating chips (blood sugar boost before I make dinner). I started using a visualization technique to help me get through the day. In the morning before I get out of bed I think about how my day is going to go. I look forward to my breakfast and coffee. I think about how my work day is going to go and what I'm going to have for lunch. I visual how I'm going to deal with the stress of interacting with that one coworker who is sure to push my buttons. Then I think about my drive home and what I'm going to do in the evening. I don't think about how I'm going to miss my drink: OMG it's so beautiful out I deserve a G&amp;T in the backyard before dinner except now I don't drink and the evening is going to suck. (Spoiler alert: if I have that G&amp;T then I'm not eating dinner - I'm drinking most of a bottle of gin and a few beers to boot and then I'm going to lose my shit on that coworker when I drag my hungover ass into work tomorrow.) I visual how I'm going to unwind with my extra-fancy mineral water and ice and how that's going to be enough to get me through the evening. At lunch I visualize the evening again. And in the car ride I look forward to my mineral water. It's all a stupid trick of the mind and I know that but somehow it works for me. ..Also I think a lot about avoiding HALT - Hungry Angry Lonely Tired. If I'm any one of those things then there's a good chance my resolve not to drink is going to crumble...Great job on 10 days! Take care of yourself you deserve it.
