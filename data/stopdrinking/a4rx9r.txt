I'm wondering if anyone here has BPD like me and struggles with drinking. The research isn't pretty. I'm wondering how people cope with BPD emotional instability without drinking or using drugs. Thoughts?

Hello I'm not BPD but have struggled with depression and drinking for many many years.  I can absolutely say that removing alcohol from my body's chemistry has in a way starved and weakened the demon of depression.  I'm not living in rainbows and singing disney songs but my emotional turmoil is MUCH less turbulent without ethanol in the mix. ..
