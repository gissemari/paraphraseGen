I got off work this afternoon came home and began cleaning the house....Four hours later I'm wrapping up the vacuum cord throwing dirty rags in the washer and preparing for an epic shower to remove cobwebs and general funk from my hair. In a little while I'll walk down to the little Chinese place up the street for a bite before a girlfriend joins me for some artisan ice cream and Netflix....Life is so different sober. This time two years ago I'd already be hammered by 9:00 pm and wouldn't have done a single predictive thing all afternoon. I'd be sadly shoving a greasy pizza down my gullet and slugging back my umpteenth rye....But not tonight. The old me would have thought this kind of evening was boring as hell--I mean I *did* wash my seashell collection that sits in a jar in the bathroom and was collecting too much dust--but the victorious motivated *sober* new me is so pleased. This is so satisfying. ...I hope everyone just getting started knows that it gets so soooooo much better. I hope everyone struggling finds the strength they need to lick this bitch of a disease. And I hope everyone has a lovely Saturday evening!...

Nice! ..I would have been at a bar being miserable with people that I didn't really like. Then I'd drive home having a panic attack the whole way that a cop would pull me over. Then I'd probably send a drunk text to a guy I had a crush on that would make him mad and he'd show it to everyone at the bar and they'd make fun of me...Then I'd eat the rest of the greasy pizza I brought home Write some drivel in my journal about how I hated my life and had no friends and sleep like crap. ..Instead I cleaned read texted with a friend made some cucumber/mint/ginger tonic and started a shrub (macerated fruit that I'll add some vinegar to tomorrow to mix with tonic) walked felt some feelings that needed to be felt and I'll go to bed happy as can be and sleep well. ..Congrats on your good day! Clean seashells are indeed something to be proud of! 
Were there three seashells?..;)..In all seriousness that really does sound like an awesomely satisfying Saturday. IWNDWYT!
Thanks for posting you made me smile   
Awesome night and post. Especially the joy and satisfaction in something as simple as cleaning your seashells. That and your awareness and enjoyment of it is awesome.  
I hope you enjoyed a wonderful dinner thanks for posting
Well done getting through your Saturday and you woke up in a clean house. In my soberiety I have taken to diying like a demon. I have the energy and the money I would have spent on booze to buy tools and wood. I think we send a message to our subconscious that all is good by being active creative and productive. if you had spend your weekend boozing how different would your Sunday be. .What dread would you have been waking up to
Sounds like an awesome day. This **Old Me / New Me** is a great exercise...**Old Me:**  .I would have woken up late hungover. Eaten some terrible takeout for lunch. Felt awful anxiety about my actions from the night before. Called around to check in on people from last night. Then organised a "Sunday Session" where I'd have more beer and pizza until I left to stare at Netflix until I crawled into bed to end the wasted weekend after (maybe) texting a quick goodbye to a friend leaving the city...**New Me:**  .I was up at 7.30am to donate blood. Attended a cafe breakfast with an (also sober) friend to make plans for writing new music and hiking took the motorbike for a spin in this awesome weather helped my Mom with her computer over lunch. Then off to the recording studio to listen to my former band lay down a new awesome track at the studio completed online psychometric tests for an exciting new job submitted coursework for an online certification then farewelled a relocating friend in person with clarity gratitude and authenticity.
That sounds like a wonderfully productive day. IWNDWYT
