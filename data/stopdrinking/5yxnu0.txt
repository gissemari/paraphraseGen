And then relapsed and I did It again... when I was sober I ...I felt better  slept better  was a better dad and husband and created so much more positive energy rather than the opposite .(which on the weekend happened ) alcohol doesn't fix problems rather just masks it I know this and you prob do also !! .now I want to look forward to next week rather than backwards so in a weeks time I will be sober 1week.. .Ive just gotta look ahead and believe !:)

Yeah alcohol masks and eventually makes things worse.
Stick with it... ... you obviously know the benefits of sobriety conceptually... now time to put it into practice! You got this!!!
