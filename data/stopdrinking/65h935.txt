Today I've been sober for 104 days which is by far the longest I have ever been sober. Quite honestly I don't know how I've made it this far. I attend AA but get no enjoyment or satisfaction out of the program. Tonight I was thinking about relapse and happened to stumble across an article about this community so I thought I'd give it a shot. I am new here and new to reddit so please bear with me here.

Huge congrats! So if AA doesn't do much for you what does? 104 days is a great streak so you're doing something right. I relapsed last year after 3 months sober...I thought that since I went that long without too much struggle I could try moderating again. Totally failed. But I'm back again. I won't drink with you today.
Hi..I've not done AA but I find regularly reading here and posting a pledge every day really helps me. ..There's also "this naked mind" a free book download in the sidebar that helped me a lot. 
Welcome to a great community.  Lots of support on here for old hands and newbies alike.
Welcome! You have found a place filled with hard-earned wisdom. With people like you. All of us I think are seeking. Seeking help or seeking to provide it to others. I have found comfort here and think you will too...I won't be drinking with you today!
Welcome aboard   this is a great blog for support and inspiration. It has no judgements  go to the main page and request a badge that lets you count the days of being sober. Great tool I will not drink with you today but I will enjoy a cup of coffee with you  
I've been to one AA meeting this time around (my longest sober stint). I'm on here several times a day. Welcome.
