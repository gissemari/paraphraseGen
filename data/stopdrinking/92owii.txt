Brief history time: Started smoking pot at 18 turned into a constant need to escape reality started drinking at 20 after that I met a lot of toxic manipulative people that messed me up. My best friend hung himself I was almost murdered on 3 separate occasions managing to get away each time. Peppered throughout my life have been numerous bad psychedelic trips I've also been cheated on by almost everyone I've ever dated. I was struggled to stay employed for 2 years during that time I had a really bad psychotic episode and my hair thinned out a lot.  ...Fast forward I had to move back into my parents house I drank a lot to numb the pain and my family treated me like dirt wouldn't let me sleep sometimes I would get locked out of the house for no reason. There's a lot that I don't have time to write about because I actually want people to read this and give advice.  ...About me: 26 years old fairly bright (or used to be) internally angry and distrustful. I force myself to go out in public every day even though I can't connect to anyone. I drink a lot of milkshakes. Genuinely funny dude have decent friends but I have the sense that everyone is really hurt and doesn't treat each other right.  ...I'm living in a room in an apartment finally. I'm 268 days sober it hasn't even been a year. I've had chronic tension headaches for two years that I used to remedy by drinking. I can sense that some of my mental sharpness is returning however I can't seem to rid myself of fear over everything. No one treats me with real respect except for like 2 people I know. My family is toxic and unsupportive so I can't turn to them for anything (my mother drinks two bottles a night)  ...I'm committed to being sober and never want to go back to drinking and smoking. I am lonely and I can't connect with people or trust them. I feel like the genuine me has been completely lost and won't come back anymore. I live in constant pain and mental fog that I just pretend doesn't exist. People around me begin to turn on me and leave when I tell them how painful things are so I pretend they are not. I don't have any social media accounts since I quit drugs and booze.  ...I feel angry tortured and inhuman. It hurts so bad to be flirted with. I don't have anything except coffee to take the edge off. My mental sharpness has taken a nosedive and the thing I want most is to get it back but concentrating makes my head and neck muscles stiffen causing my headache to get worse.  ...What do I even do from here? I love music I want to be loved but I feel so alone and misunderstood. I feel a kind of alienation that I imagine most normal people are too sheltered to understand. I want a girlfriend but no one in my age group is going to date someone who is this broken and jealous. Girls my age want to party or they want stability and I have neither of those things.  ...I just want someone to hold me and tell me they aren't going away. Maybe I don't even want that. I just want the pain to stop. Someone tell me it gets better that my brain will keep working to normalize itself.

Let go of the past and worry about today. I can't change my past but I have full control of the present and future. Great job with your sobriety. This is a marathon not a sprint to happiness. I have cut the people out of my life that don't support my sober lifestyle. That's all I can do. Again great job you are doing the right thing. IWNDWYT
