I went to a meeting my first. SMART. I don't really know what I expected I was positive but I also was guarded. Turned out to be really great. I was among people who understood this I didn't have to say a damn word. I'm going back next week maybe this time I'll speak up a bit or the week after. It's been a rough few relapses over the past months sober 2 days so far right now. Here's to a new attempt and the support I've long resisted.

Glad you enjoyed the meeting.  Whatever it takes...
Glad to hear it went well- keep fighting the good fight.
