I've been in a couple of tricky situations and seen it through without drinking. The worst one was one of my family insisting that they would be ashamed of me if I didn't drink a toast with champagne at a wedding...If I'm ever tempted to drink it helps to remember that I only ever want one drink but I know that when I do drink I drink until its gone. I never ever wanted the 20th drink in a session but that's where I always ended up. So when I look at one drink I remember how shite the 20th drink will feel that usually puts me off...The crappy stuff that blasts through every life is still crappy but now I know that as long as I stay sober I will have the personal strength to deal with it. Being sober is just emotionally much more effective I still have to process stuff but I don't hide from it by drinking. ..One of the best side effects is that I'm richer. I'm not going to be a millionaire any day soon but I'm better at my job I earned more and I don't spend $200 a week on stuff that made me sick...Having lost my brother to addiction (suicide) I know that the nightmare scenario can happen to any one of us. So please if you're wavering or if you've just relapsed pick yourself up and go again. We've got your back. ..IWNDWYT...&amp;#x200B;

Congratulations!!    and thank you for the wise words. I'm the same as you: I have no drinks or I have all the drinks. There is no in between. There is no moderation. I am enlightened! And we rock on....
