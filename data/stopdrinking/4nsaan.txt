My good friend will reach six months of sobriety this week. He's in his 50's has been a lifelong drinker and works in an industry (casino) with significant social pressure to drink. When he drinks he gets blackout drunk. There's no moderation for him...He lost custody of his son last year. The final straw was when his son (early teen) asked him not to contact him anymore. My friend stopped drinking on his son's birthday in December. ..I've known him for about six years. He's struggled off on on during at period. More off than on. This is currently his second-longest stretch of sobriety--his longest being 9 months. He's currently lost about 60 pounds and is doing great. He started going to church and immersing himself in new productive hobbies...My question to the stop drinking community: Is it appropriate to celebrate six months? I was thinking of getting a cake and inviting a few sober friends over to celebrate. Is this a good idea? He's doing great and I don't want to mess anything up. But I also want to acknowledge the incredible progress he's made.

I think this is a lovely idea. Six months was an important milestone for me and I'm sure your support and encouragement would mean a lot to him.
You bet that is a great milestone and encouragement is almost always helpful.  Things sound like they are really beginning to change for him as they should be at six months.  It may be getting more complicated for him as his focus transitions from not drinking to living sober.  You are a true friend to be concerned.
Great idea! He's worked very hard at his sobriety why not celebrate? Ooooh I hope my friends do the cake thing for me to lol :)
