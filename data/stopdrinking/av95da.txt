Being a long time disturbed fan I knew the more hard rock and basically workout music in high school. This song though is perfect for what I'm going through and I think others can find inspiration from it. This is my first post here as I like to lurk but I was so touched by this I couldn't not share. ..https://youtu.be/t4382UVl0oc

love this song. It's been my jam for a while now.
Oh man Disturbed used to be my jam! I'll check out the song when I find some earphones. Thanks for posting and keep fighting! IWNDWYT :)
Thank you so much for sharing this.  Totally inspiring.  Been sober since Jan 1st myself.   IWNDWYT
Great song. My favorite stop drinking song is  the prisoner  from Iron Maiden. So glad we don't have that ball and chain anymore.
Then check out the Sounds of Silence by them!!!.IWNDWUT but I will turn it up!
