*I will explain in another post how this out of nowhere visit came about after I had been ignored for the last 10 days.....*..We had a whimsically fantastical ordinary laughing lovely game playing ordinary hugging photo taking exploratory time together. Three hours of blissful love filled Mummy/Daughter time! Dress ups chatting to each other while cooking showing off dance moves &amp; laughter pride in accomplishments pouting because there was no ice-cream smiles because there was lots of tickling bossy girl moments been ignored moments words tumbling because we both had so much to share. Just love &amp; pride empathy &amp; us - something that nobody will ever be able to take away!..Now is cry time but pride time as well &amp; time to absorb the love &amp; hugs &amp; celebrate that she does want to spend more time with me :) That regardless of what others are saying about me our bond is still strong &amp; real. I love you Darling *Little Quirky* Girl for every grain of sand on every beach in the whole world    ..By the way this will be the first time that my princess has left (ever usually an excuse for relapse) &amp; I haven't gotten drunk &amp; I also will not be having any cigarettes...... When I can get through tonight &amp; wake up tomorrow sober &amp; smoke free I am going to be so damned Proud of myself!!!!
