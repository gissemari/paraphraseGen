Good morning friends!..I had a really bad time with feeling paranoid last night - to the point I deleted my main reddit account (moment of silence).  This morning is day 3 for me this was the account I had initially intended to use for support in this sub but I guess will just end up being my regular account.  I had a strong feeling someone I know IRL found my reddit account and all I could think to do was delete it.  I'm kind of bummed about it but you know what?  I didn't let it make me slip up.  I'm sure it sounds super freaking stupid but this is the kind of thing that I would drown and drown in beer.  ..Not last night I just stuck with those yucky feelings and was present experienced them as they were.  Did I NEED to delete my account? No... probably not.  It was still a stupid and rash decision but I'd rather delete my account than delete the progress I've made.  Day 3 has always been a struggle for me and I know once I get past today it will get easier.  I appreciate all the support that this sub gives and am looking forward to steppin' out in the sunshine sober AF.  My skin is looking brighter less red and I didn't wake up hungover.  In fact I think I'm going to get some yoga in this morning before my kids start running around.  I'm thankful for this safe place to share the struggles and joys of finding our paths through sobriety.  Thanks friends!

Learning how to deal with bad feelings was tough as I normally drank them away.  But I like having emotions more than I like just being blank and hungover and miserable all the time.
