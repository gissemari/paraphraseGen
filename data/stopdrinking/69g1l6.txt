I hit my one year mark in February. My sponsor was the first person I spoke to in the first AA meeting I ever went to. She told me yesterday that she relapsed and kept apologizing for it. But I'm not mad at her not even a little. I felt sad for her but happy that she is alive and still willing to fight for sobriety.  .  . But suddenly I feel lost like I've lost my anchor. It's like all the work we did together every personal thing I shared with her was all for nothing. And she's kind of the only person I really connected with in AA so I don't know how to talk about it with anyone else.  .   .She even talked about finding me a new sponsor. But what does that mean? Do I just start over? Do I tell this new person everything all over again? I told her I'd find one and not to worry to focus on her own recovery.  .  .I don't have the urge to pick up so I'm grateful for that miracle.

I'm sure She needs your support now.  One of the most rewarding parts of AA is actually helping others.  Nothing is lost you move forward :)
Oh wow. All the work you've done together isn't invalid now. She was able to help you to this point... maybe you learned some skills that you can now use to help her? I've never been to AA so I'm not sure of how it all works. ..It always shakes me up when I see someone with much more time than me relapse. Alcohol is a sneaky bastard. We can fight it together! I won't drink with you. 
Don't think it was for nothing - it was for you and thats why she was sponsoring you.  As long as you still stick with it she still has your success to give her encouragement.  Good luck hang in there.
