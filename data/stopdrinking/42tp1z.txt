Never thought someone would say those words to me. I had arthroscopic knee surgery today and they had to knock me out. In recovery I came around in like 30 minutes and they couldn't believe it. They said that I was such a light weight that the drugs didn't have as much of a lingering affect and I didn't need a ton to keep me sedated. ..I know it has only been 37 days for me but I guess my tolerance has changed. When I had the same surgery a couple years back I was in recovery for 2 hours. ..As a side note... I'm not concerned about the relapse possibility with the pain meds. I've never been a big fan of taking those for very long because they cause nausea and it's not a high that I enjoy.
