Have no clue the number of day ones I have had.  I lost track.  It's so ridiculous and I can't figure out why I am repeated doing something that I know is bad for me and as of late is now truly affecting my life.  Nothing crazy happened in the past but the last few weeks things at home have been tense bc if my constantly relapsing. I truly know I can not drink.  Been listen to Rachel Hart's podcasts and like them a lot.  I'm ready to start February sober like I started January....except don't give up this time on day 7!!  Happy sober Friday.  Appreciate u all as I am very alone in this journey I feel.  Partly bc I don't want to share with SO.  Or fam.  Embarrassed of myself I guess. Anyway I will not drink with you today!

I haven't disclosed to my fam either though I'm quite sure they've known about my alcoholism I'm the only one stupid enough to think I hide my drinking well and it's very much shame and guilt. ..Ive been considering local AA meetings maybe it's something that would benefit you as well? Who you disclose to is up to you but no one should have to feel alone in this...I will not drink with you today. :)..
I'd say the fact that you feel really alone and that you're embarrassed (but maybe it's more ashamed) has a lot to do with how many day ones you've had. ..This community is great but I'm also talking a lot to my friends about giving up alcohol. I've told my family too. I'm happy to say that all of them have been 100% supportive. Most people who drink to any reasonable degree know that they'd be better off if thry didn't. And those who don't care about alcohol don't care if you don't drink it. ..You might well be surprised if you reach out.
