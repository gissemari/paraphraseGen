Yeah recovery is not easy but worth the effort.  Have you sought out a support group such as AA SMART or Life Ring?  For me the face to face Life Ring meetings and being an OP in a rehab group is what it took to keep me sober.  
Sounds like you were Hungry Angry and maybe a little Lonely after your husband left 3 of the four letters of HALT. Next time you feel like you want to drink try eating something instead. If that doesn't work meditate. If that doesn't work go for a walk. Eat some ice cream. Come here. Anything to keep yourself distracted. The good news is that hopefully you've learned something about what triggers you from this relapse and you can use that to do better next time. You can do this! IWNDWYT!
