I feel tired. The past three months have been wonderful. So much has been accomplished and I experienced a new zeal of life. But now I just want to rest. I want to stop thinking. But that will lead to relapse. I am so tired. I sleep fine and I don't mean that. But man. I just wan't to relax and I feel like I have done enough but I can't. I need some help or advice. I'm so tired.

It sounds like a tough place.  What kind of help or advice are you seeking?  What are you tired of?
Have you taken a moment to actually appreciate your achievements so far? Drink a glass of water take a few deep breaths look at yourself in the mirror and be proud of yourself. You're doing great...And I know the feeling you're talking about. The idea that it'd be ok to just say 'fuck it' and give in but you're relearning life without drink. It's a lot of work and it is tiring but also invigorating and new. ..I don't know if the tired feeling ever fully goes away. I went 6 months before and felt incredible. I need to get back there. Don't turn back now because you're tired like I was. It's not worth it. 
I think by what you are saying is what I call consciousness fatigue. It's one of the major relapse triggers for me and probably one of the major reasons I started drinking heavily in the first place. I have to conquer it myself so I don't have answers for you. But for me awareness of it knowledge of it  even learning from my enemy will give me power over it. Perhaps one day I can even flip it on it's head and make it useful. Just some thoughts. ..All the best.
