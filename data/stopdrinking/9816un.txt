Please excuse my whiny post I just want to touch base. So I reached 232 days this year and was feeling on top of the world. Then we take the family to England for vacation in June. Still all good for the first ten or so days minimum pressure from friends and family to join them in a drink. ..Then we went to Dublin. We went to the Guinness Brewery for a tour. I had a pint of Guinness. I had three more the day after. Then I tried to get back on track and was a bit disappointed that is lost my streak. ..Since then it's been more of a struggle. I'm not drowning I'm not back to doing what I did before which was swimming in beer and wine with a tequila chaser. It's just that I've created a world where at the moment it's too easy to have a drink. A beer here or a glass of wine there. And it's dangerous...I'm not easy with this and I'm not being totally honest with myself or my spouse. It's because even though I only have one or two and not everyday I still want to drink it all. It's still on my mind constantly and it's still wearing me down...At 232 days I was so proud but that one pint seems to have opened a door to a fake world where just an occasional drink is ok.... It's not ok. What do I do now?..Love y'all...

Don't be so hard on you. We are humans it happens. As long as you pull yourself and continue everything is ok. 232 days are not lost you have them you know that you have been sober all this time and how good you felt. You will be OK start your streak again and go one day at the time. Be honest with your family and ask them when you hang together to avoid such kind of places. It can be tempting in early sobriety.

Thank you for being honest.   I would just start over and do what you did on day 1.   Don't look at it as a failure but part of your personal journey towards sobriety...I can tell that you gained insight about yourself and your struggle just by reading your post.  
  *I still want to drink it all. It's still on my mind constantly and it's still wearing me down.* ..This is what makes me want to stay sober.  I'm tired of this.  I want to get to the point where my life isn't so consumed by alcohol.  It's not just the drinking part - it just takes up all my mental space...I really like this post.  It might help:..

It keeps me honest.  It's magical...Hang in there - you'll figure it out.
232 days is fantastic! Think about the healing your body experienced. It's still all there available for you. You have proven you can do it. Reclaim your headspace and don't look back. Iwndwyt
