About a month ago I (28F) was having constant thoughts of suicide and my anxiety had become unmanageable so went to a new psychiatrist...I expected to be prescribed some anti- anxieties and be sent on my way but she refused. Instead she advised inpatient treatment for alcoholism and referred me to an addiction specialist...Fast forward to Thursday night after an evening of heavy drinking arguing and another panic attack I decided to be done with drinking. My hangxiety on Friday was the worst it had been in a while and I was tearful all day. After another unsuccessful meeting with my psychiatrist I decided to just do what she suggested as it was clear she wasnt going to give me any medication...I have been to 2 meetings since then and have made a few connections with women I met there. I was feeling really positive about it yesterday and even told my fiance my intention to go sober...However I have woken up this morning in such a foul mood and all I can think about is drinking. I'm on my way to the gym to kill some time but I just feel so thirsty and I cant stop thinking about having a drink...I'm so disappointed that I have gone from feeling so positive and looking forward to a life of sobriety yesterday to feeling resentful pissed off and desperate for just one drink today...I don't know what I am going to do but I have lurked on this sub for well over a year so thought I would share in case someone feels a similar way or can relate and share some advice...Thanks for reading.

Honestly I begrudgingly went to rehab and I was pissed of ass hell and thought it was going to suck.  It was actually fun as shit.  I was 30 at the time so similar age.  It really reminded me of college just minus the partying and I really liked it.  If your current life situation like job/responsibilities would allow for your to do inpatient I say do it.  For me at least I don't think getting sober would have been nearly as easy and I'd go again in a heartbeat now that I know what it was actually like and not what I thought it was like.  ..Regardless off that though your mood will most likely swing from positive to negative happy to sad etc a bunch for a bit.  It took me like 3 weeks sober to finally balance out mentally.
Ride it out and it will pass. The best thing someone told me when I first got sober and was experiencing the  hangxiety  you're describing is  you never have to feel this way again.  And it's true. You don't have to feel that way ever again as long as you don't drink. Keep busy. Go to the gym go to a meeting go on a walk etc. It will pass.
