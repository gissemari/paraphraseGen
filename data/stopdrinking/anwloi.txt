I would love if my badge was still accurate I put in for a reset because I lost my way for the last 3 weeks.  My wife and I are moving at the end of the month and it's gonna be expensive.  I relapsed a few weeks ago and I just realized that it cost us what little money we had in our checking account until we get paid on Friday.  Thankfully I had an account i could pull money from to avoid overdrafts but fucking hell I feel like a jerk...  ..I'm not discrediting what I did with my ~70 days before relapsing.  I know I could have powered through that intense craving I had but I didn't and now I'm going to start again.  So now I'm hung over at work probably going to start feeling really crappy in a few hours...I'm not going to drink today.  I don't feel the motivation like I did the last time I quit but I can't wait for a convenient day again.
