Life is a difficult proposition and it can be very tough. It can be even tougher if we have been using alcohol to remove the pain temporarily and then decide to stop using it. The pain can come on strong a fast and this time unmediated by our former chemical blanket...What you are doing is a struggle and you should be proud of that part of you which has decided that to bear the pain is worth it in order to be a better person. ..I send all of my support and love to those that are coping with life today without alcohol to get them through. May you have peace in your day.

Today is my first day. Thank you for these kind words to start me on my way.
Someone said recently "Be kind to all sober folks. They've lost their best friend." ..Amazing that we can go through today without the support we used to get by self-medicating. It's not easy but incredibly rewarding.
