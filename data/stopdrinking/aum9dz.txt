I'm struggling guys.  The problem for me hasn't been the "not drinking" part... it has been the rediscovering myself that I had been burying in inebriation for much too long.   I am discovering that I am very lonely.  I don't know if I am depressed or not but there is something wrong.   I have been having problems sleeping because my mind is just working overtime trying to sort through all the things in my head.   I am usually pretty content being alone and doing my own thing but I feel like nobody really knows ME.  I don't even know if I know myself!!  I feel like I have nobody I can talk to.  ..The longer I am sober the more I realize that I am in a lot of pain mentally from past relationships and friends leaving me.  Also in my my current relationship where I feel I have been let down when I really needed her.  I feel like I can't trust people because when ever I do they just let me down abandon me fuck me over whatever.   My parents divorced when I was 15 and that was a big shock for me and I felt like I was torn into two trying to balance the both of them.  I am naturally introverted and discovered drinking when I was 17.  When I started drinking all of a sudden people wanted to hang out with me outside of school invite me to parties etc.   Before that I usually spent my Friday nights watching X-Files or playing games on my computer.   I started drinking and I was wanted included.  I think I drank to be included and wanted for awhile and then as bad things started to happen to me I would drink to suppress these feelings.  I did so for years.  Pure self-medication.  I am now 38 years old and (i dunno what i'm at exactly) 7 months sober?  It is all coming flooding out at me like a tsunami and it is destroying everything in it's path.  In this case it is just wreaking havoc on my mind.  I don't know how to handle it.   I am listening to a lot of music to occupy my mind so I am not overwhelmed with the constant mental bombardment.   I feel like everything is crashing down on me.  ..I am not going to drink because I now know that doesn't solve anything and is only prolonging and compounding the problem.  I need to face this but FUCK is it ever hard.  ..&amp;#x200B;..What are some suggestions on how to deal with this?  I think I need to get in touch with a psychologist to talk this out.

I honestly know how you feel.  I think trying out some therapy is worth the effort.  I plan on doing it myself soon.  While I know it's hard having a fragile sense of self at times it's also an opportunity for introspection.  It's an opportunity to evolve.  There is nothing wrong with working on yourself to become a better person.  Don't be intimidated by it...embrace it.  Best of luck to us both.  I think we are probably both worth the effort.

Morning -- your last sentence is spot on.  Find a therapist that you trust &amp; talk it out.  Go in the first meeting with specific points you'd like to address.. that way you're not just "wasting" time with overhead questions...Good luck to you -- this is a great supportive forum to be a part of! 
&gt;I think I need to get in touch with a psychologist to talk this out...I think this is the best answer!..Personally I found getting regular exercise to be kind of like quitting drinking - it affected parts of my life I had no idea were connected  mainly my anxiety and success in refocusing negative thoughts. Do you have a physical routine?
Sorry to hear you're struggling. I have found a lot of helpful direction in books such as [The Power of Now](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002361MLA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1) and [A New Earth](https://www.amazon.com/New-Earth-Oprah-61-Awakening-ebook/dp/B000PC0S5K/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=a+new+earth&amp;qid=1551108010&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1).  These two books are written by Eckhart Tolle but follow many of the precepts of Buddhism. The goal in these books and similar is to show that thinking (and over thinking) are objects of consciousness just like any object you perceive outside yourself. You can escape these thoughts quieting them and appreciating the present moment (the only time that truly exists). *Past relationships friends leaving current relationships trust abandonment* etc. are vividly acute but are only products of thought and don't exist in the present moment.... I find these ideas comforting as they allow me a pathway to break from the endless and incessant clutter of thinking thinking thinking....
Therapy?.Maybe AA for the fellowship?

I can relate to this! Drinking seems so helpful to this introvert - until it didn't. Psychotherapy has really helped but most of all just being real and honest and vulnerable with people. That is so hard for me - I'm still trying to hide all the time. But when I let my guard down a bit good things happen and I find some connections. Thanks for sharing this.
Meditation has helped me in finding myself and working through my issues I need to get back into it. It can be difficult to get into it's takes time and practice and it's hard at first but you slowly get better at it and it works wonders for me.
