I posted back on /r/needadvice a few weeks ago. Someone suggested I'd come around here...At the time of that post I stopped drinking I have since relapsed heavily and have been binge drinking for almost two weeks. I've realized I'm out of control again. I was sober for almost 3 weeks...A bit of history I had gastric bypass surgery back in 2005 I was always a chubby child and when I turned 18 under the constant pressure of my crazy ex-girlfriend. I went through with it not even fully prepared for the trauma that comes with that kind of decision. The major physical alteration to my body had a profound effect on me. To be fair I was warned before hand that there a connection between this surgery and substance abuse. Because people can't eat the way they used to it's very common to replace the unhealthy eating habits with other habits such as alcohol and/or sex or other drugs. This was never a concern to me as I was very straight-edge. I never and still haven't 99.9% of recreational drugs out there not even pot. I was 320 pounds and I got down to 155 over the most depressing 10 months of my life. ..Returning from my medical leave of absence I went back to college to study Mathematics for Sciences minor in Computer Science but I was a different person. I suddenly was getting looked at and invited to parties and even hit on. Despite this I never wanted to drink because I felt I didn't need to. I didn't have my first drink until I was 20 some girl convinced me to just have a cup of wine to try it. I found out later she laced it with peyote (I don't know why). It was one of the strangest experiences of my life. Even after that I would drink socially and it wasn't a problem. I met my future wife and we were pretty serious...My focus in my studies started to decline. I eventually failed out. The problem was really I started to feel my choice of degree wasn't really what I wanted to do but I didn't want to change majors because it would require paying more money for another year of courses. I went to a therapist to discuss my depression and lack of focus and she suggested that I'd at least see a psychiatrist. I did and I guess when you hear lack of focus in study you naturally just prescribe Adderall which he did...I took it as prescribed over the next year or so and it did help my studies but what I didn't realize was that I was slowly getting addicted to it. Convincing myself I needed it to do well. At some point I really needed to finish a project and I justified the first misstep and took some extra. After that it just became easier to do it. I also proposed to my ex-wife in this time and we moved in together. She was always supportive of my studies and told me that as long as I was working on my degree she'd pay the bills because I just lost my job. The pressure was on more than ever to get my degree in a field that just wasn't working for me. The insomnia started the Adderall didn't help. The more I fell behind the more Adderall I felt I needed. Parties continued my ex-wife liked to have one once a week. It wasn't until I failed out that I started turning to the bottle. I also straight up started abusing Adderall because I needed it to get back on my feet. I immediately enrolled in another college a strict technical school. I made it through one semester with passing grades but the next semester I got lost in my hobbies. I did most of the semester but just gave up at the end. I just didn't go to the finals hand in the final assignments and to this day I've never followed up. I seriously don't know what the status of those credits are I didn't even tell them I was not going to show up anymore. I started lying to my wife about attending...My wife would go to work and I'd pop a few and literally not know what to do with myself. I would end up getting so up that I was desperate to come down. I think this is when drinking became a problem. I would start drinking whatever bottles were left from the parties. My wife saw my problem forming (it didn't take long for her to realize I wasn't going to class anymore) but she didn't know what to do. She tried to approach me saying she's worried I'm developing a drinking problem but every time she did I would either ignore her shut down or lash out. Eventually she stopped having parties at our apartment and started going out with me to like Karaoke and stuff. It would be harder for me to abuse alcohol at a bar since everything was on her tab. She was right as by this point everybody suspected my depression was leading me to a problem but I surprisingly didn't drink while we were out. I didn't want to be the guy everyone was silently judging. Not to be the guy who everyone thinks is an alcoholic acting like an alcoholic...My insomnia had gotten so bad I was lying awake straight through the night. People were telling me that I might think I have insomnia because I don't have healthy sleep hygiene. I attributed it to the Adderall for a while but after I lost my health insurance for a few months as my wife got a new job I went cold turkey for a half a year. It helped me in feeling physically tired but I was still not sleeping my mind was wired with guilt panic anxiety fear and wondering how I was going to pay almost $60000 dollars in student loans for a degree I failed to get not sure if I should get back into school or get a job. I was locked up in negative emotion. During the day I was like a zombie. It was becoming weeks at a time where I would be lucky if I got three hours a night. At this point my drinking problem was still few and far between. I don't know if my wife really believed me when I told her that my drinking was getting better or wanted to believe me since I really only drank if it was available never going out to get it myself every so often letting it get too far. After a night out where I had just two drinks we went home and I slept better than I had in months waking up fully refreshed and energetic. I had taken just about every remedy for insomnia on the OTC market but I just didn't feel this rested in a long time. I felt good about myself until that night where the same sleep problems cropped up again. Defying my better much better judgement yet again I went out after my wife fell asleep but this time bought the biggest bottle of rum available and started drinking it with one goal in mind until I blacked out. That way I could finally get some sleep and I would do this every night if I had to if it meant I could sleep. Yes I understand this wasn't rational AT ALL but my blind determination to try to get healthy sleep (blackout drunk isn't healthy sleep and I knew it then too) had resulted in my  selling my soul to the devil . I drank maybe 8 shots in 45 minutes but as I started to get really drunk I suddenly had a realization that if my wife saw this bottle in the morning she'd be worried and a bit pissed off. Getting drunker by the second I took the bottle having a whole bunch left found a 2-gallon milk container we had just recycled washed it out dumped the rum in it hid it all the way in the back of the cabinet behind the sink and threw the empty bottle down the trash compactor outside then passed out on the couch. Time for me from that moment on was a haze even the days I wasn't drinking I was just stuck in depression...Days turned to weeks which turned to months and literally years following the same pattern of  hide the bottle . Over the course of time my wife obviously had become aware as our money was missing she had found bottles I was drunk emotional most of the time. When I wasn't I was hung over or just staying up all night. She tried confronting me got friends and family to try to reach out to me even begged me to get help many times holding on to hope we could still have a future together that I could still get my act together and we could have a future but I kept on insisting that no one could help me. Everyone acts like removing alcohol from your life will suddenly fix all of your problems. I knew that wasn't true I still know it isn't true. What I didn't want to realize then was that even though removing alcohol from your life doesn't magically fix all of the problems in your life it isn't doing anything to help them it's only making it worse. Funny how trite this sounds but now it makes so much sense like I was only listening to the words. This was mid 2010 to late 2011. I had stopped caring about my health my wife's feelings my friendships and my family. I did have moments of clarity sober weeks and even temporary jobs however It came to a head in early 2012. We were alone on new year's eve in our apartment. We had usually spent New Year's among one of our family's or had a get together but  she was afraid to go anywhere or do anything. She felt she couldn't trust me at a party she didn't even want to have friends over because I had become so socially reclusive I had stopped talking to friends or trying to socialize. She was afraid if she left me alone to see her family she'd come back to me dead from an alcohol overdose she was afraid of that every morning as she left for work. We watched the New Year's celebrations and we would usually kiss at midnight but this year she just cried. She mentioned that she didn't even have a resolution this year because there was no point I was going to have the same problems as last year this time next year. I didn't know what to tell her because I didn't realize how much I was hurting her depressing her for years on end at this point and she saw no end in sight. So I secretly resolved to do anything I can to get a steady job I guess cleverly avoiding the issue of Alcohol and depression by telling myself  In order to keep a steady job you have to be sober and not depressed.  ..It was good and sober for about 3 months I found a job as a cashier at a shoe store making minimum wage it didn't do much to boost our income but she was ecstatic that I was at least getting out every day and doing something productive. I didn't feel productive though I felt useless. She had a job paying more than twice the amount I was making and I hated myself every day because I felt I was a  minimum wage cashier  and felt she deserved to be married to someone better. When she met me I was studying to be a mathematician aspiring to be a teacher. I felt she was placating me for my inadequacies and she had settled on some one other than the person she fell in love with. I tried to put on a happy face but I still couldn't sleep. I didn't want to get comfortable there. Again the demons attacked. It didn't take long before she started to notice I was uncomfortably restless. I used to say that we don't have a future if I don't get a better job that I'm wasting away hours at minimum wage I was going to be stuck there for years and how was I supposed to find a better job if I was working 10 hours a day. She tried to convince me that it's just temporary and we were still getting along with just her salary and urged me to keep at it until something better came along. The conversation kept happening until she got so angry she just told me to quit if it was making me so miserable. I knew I shouldn't even at the time but I did convinced I could get something better. I haven't since. I slipped into bad habits and even picked up Adderall again after I found out my brother was using it and he left me keys to his apartment to watch his cat. Needless to say he was upset to notice his whiskey and prescription had been somewhat depleted. My family thought it was inconceivable that I would be a person that would steal someone else's prescription medication. ..She was right New Years 2013 wasn't very different from 2012 but still somehow we were together. In 2013 I got worse. I was hospitalized I drank so much I think I may have had a seizure but I'm not sure. I woke up in a hospital next to my father  a very distraught wife and mother-in-law. Her worst fear had come true she had come home to an unresponsive me and called her mother first who was a nurse at a nearby hospital because she didn't know what to do. My father came sometime later. She wanted to know was why am I continuing to do this to myself and our marriage. How doctors told her that people with my surgery are much more susceptible to the effects of alcohol than normal people because liquids are absorbed near instantly. My BAC was .34. The doctors deemed me mentally unfit and put me on a 72-hour mental health lockdown because I refused detox violently but I wasn't making any sense. They tried to get me to go to a 30 day program but I insisted that the drinking wasn't the underlying cause. I am drinking for an emotional reason. It was a waste of time to cure the symptom instead of the cause. I kept on insisting that there was something else wrong with me. I ended up being in a worse place. They decided that if I indeed was feeling the way I was describing I needed to be observed for 13 days in a chronic manic depression/schitzo-active-reactive/schizophrenia unit. This was truly a place I didn't belong the people there were actually hallucinating not all there or had other compromised perspectives of reality. It made me feel like I was being a baby when I was complaining about not feeling right in my major or my job. My wife drove the 15 miles out of her way every couple of days to see how I was doing and bring me comic books. She was staying with her parents because she was so depressed over the whole ordeal she couldn't be alone in our apartment. I saw a calendar with the date I noticed it had been a year since I quit that job. I eventually was discharged with a litany of prescription medications (lithium doxepin seroquil). This time was hazy but I ended up back in a similar two week mental health hospital under similar circumstances about a month later she would visit me daily after work. After I got out of that I relapsed almost instantly and my wife told me she didn't know how much more of this she could take. ..In a moment of clarity I agreed to do the full 30 day drug-alcohol rehab program. She didn't really call she said she was spending time catching up with old friends and I should focus on myself instead of being concerned with how she's handling her depression. I came out with a fresh head and our anniversary coming up soon. I wanted to do something really nice so I did a few odd-jobs and saved up a nice amount of money to take her on a nice date and a nice hotel. I surprised her at work and brought her to the suite where I had asked her sister to get and leave her something nice to wear for our trip to the jazz club. It ended up being a great night and she had a great time. We got back and she was exhausted and promptly fell asleep. I tossed and turned for a while but I couldn't sleep. I decided to take a walk avoiding the bar. I did pass a liquor store and before I knew it I was back upstairs with a pint of vodka. She was still asleep. I didn't drink it even open it. I just put it in my bag and eventually dozed off a few hours later. I woke up to angry sobbing and clothes everywhere. She couldn't even get words out she just was holding the bottle in one hand sitting off the side of the bed half dressed. She was trying to let me sleep in because she knew I had sleeping problems and she thought she'd pack my clothes. When she found the bottle she just broke down knocked over the folded clothes holding the shirt she was just about to put on in one hand and the unopened bottle in the other. It took me a while to bring her out of it. She told me she thought I was getting better again but she was wrong that she's always wrong. She started that I was testing her if the date was my attempt at some sick joke to destroy whatever was left of her spirit. I tried to explain that I didn't drink any but she just held that it was a matter of time. ..A few weeks passed and I remained sober I was picking myself pack up and I was convinced I was off to a better year. She seemed to recover and we were having better times happy times. We adopted a cat and I was making money here and there. A few more weeks passed. No drama on this I relapsed yet again. I was regularly drinking albeit not to such a heavy degree. The strange part is that she didn't seem to care much after she found out. She knew I was drinking on a regular basis but didn't seem to care. She kinda walked around like a zombie when I was drunk and acted like her regular self when I wasn't. Her oldest sister had her first baby in California so she wanted to take two weeks to see her nephew and if I would be have to be okay on my own. The weird part was the way she said it was ominous. She came back and told me that she needed some space. We needed to be separated for a while perhaps a good while. She had made arrangements to let the lease expire and move into a bedroom with a friend and pay her rent under the table. She wanted our marriage to continue and was very insistent on starting couple's therapy. Before I knew it we were moving out. She had hopes at first that if we spent some time apart but continued to work on our marriage that we could get to a better place and move back in with each other. During the second session She told me she made up her mind...It's been almost 10 months she started off trying to be my friend but it became harder for both of us. Eventually she sent me a letter saying that leaving me was the hardest thing she's ever done. Our communication is on a need to know need to ask basis. I've been taking it hard. On and off binge drinking I spent some weeks tutoring but when the spring session ended I went right back into it. I stopped in May for almost 3 weeks but picked it up heavily yet again. I've stopped again because I feel I've taken it too far and here's where I am again. I woke up this past friday with a hangover and haven't had a drink since...They say that you won't feel you need to stop until you've hit rock bottom or until you have nothing left to lose. Over the past decade I haven't just lost my wife. I look in the mirror and my hair is significantly grey for a 28 year old I've gained back 100 pounds (mostly from calories in alcohol alone) my muscles are weak my teeth are riddled with cavities and hurt after I drink my mind is a disorganized wreck I find it hard to have passion for anything my employment status is non-existent and my family doesn't always feel they can trust me. Most importantly I have lost respect for myself. This was all in the hopes of trading some of my values in the hopes of buying one more day of unsustainability...I've been waiting for something to happen to me if I keep things the way they are every day something is bound to happen eventually. Waiting for a day where I would suddenly find my calling or the addiction would somehow sate itself forever. I don't want this substance in my life anymore. I'm an alcoholic and I'm not so great with other drugs either. ..Let's see how long I can continue to keep them out of my life. ..**TLDR: Woah this was supposed to be A BIT of history not a memoir! I'm happy to be a part of this sub. I just hit post before I could go back and see how long it was then change my mind about putting it out.**..**3 days sober after 6 years of drinking**
----------immediate responses--------

Good to hear.er yowza! Not as bad here . Knock on wood. But have those crazy negative thoughts. I'm only drinking green tea milkthistle vitamin b and a multi. I'm gonna look into daily vit. Crossing fingers.
Welcome VitaminP3. Glad you're here and reaching out. Part of your story really touched me:..&gt;I've been waiting for something to happen to me if I keep things the way they are every day something is bound to happen eventually. Waiting for a day where I would suddenly find my calling or the addiction would somehow sate itself forever. ..This will never happen in my experience. I am in my 50s. I waited for more than 30 years (with some breaks) for things to get so bad that I would have no choice and I would have to stop drinking. Waiting for sobriety to find me. ..It never did and it never will. I had to decide I wanted it to go find it and pursue it. ..Things will never get so bad that you don't have to make a choice. Those who don't continue to use alcohol indefinitely or until the die. The thing that is "bound to happen eventually" is nothing better. ..My suggestion would be to decide what you want to do. How you want to be and live. And then take the next step that you can take **today** towards that goal. Usually that means simply find a way not to drink today whatever it takes. Simple but hard to do. ..So you haven't had a drink since Friday. What is your plan beyond that? I ask because I simply stopped many times without a plan other than "No drinking." That plan always failed. Sometimes after a few days sometimes a month or two. (At one point I didn't drink for some years but circumstances were different.) ..If you don't have a plan--don't beat yourself. But perhaps you'd find it useful to start thinking about what's next in really concrete terms--what will you do tomorrow? Find a counselor? Find a meeting? Make a doctor's appointment? ..I think it's great you're here and sorry for the rambling thoughts. I hope there's something of use to you here.
