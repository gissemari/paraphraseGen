Hi all. I slipped on 17 days in the fall and it's taken me a while to get back here. This week's been rough too. Sudden death in the family work is getting crazy taking time off for the funeral Thursday. Just rough all around haha. But I guess when it rains it pours...I don't have a meeting to go to or anything like that. Just looking to you all for some accountability in a strange time. No alcohol in the house and I'm in for the night. Not gonna drink.

Good for you get through tonight and chances are you will feel better tomorrow. I won't be drinking with you today.  Plus is there anything better than waking up without a hangover - no anxiety no headache no nausea no sense of impending doom - and being ready to face the day?  
Life is gona throw shit a you but havin a drink will only make it worse tommorow. Sorry for the death in ur family but keep ur head up ur doin well stayin off the drink. I wont hav a drink wit u today.
Keep balancing on the tight rope. I feel you it's hard as shit especially where you are. Don't stop.
