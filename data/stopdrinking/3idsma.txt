Good morning from New Zealand! Today I beat my own personal best. The last year has been a string of sober runs - rarely any further than two weeks but a few pushing 30 days - punctuated by relapses of one night to several months. My badge is correct today though and I'm feeling good...Last week I cleaned out a cupboard that I've been avoiding for a year because it involved making decisions about which things to keep. I *enjoyed* clearing it out and it turned out to be a simple task which I completed in a couple of hours. Symbolically it felt good to clear something which I hadn't managed to achieve in any of my earlier forays into sobriety - something new - but I also marvelled afterwards at how incredibly easy it had been. Making the decisions hadn't put any strain on me and reflecting on this I realised that I've been thinking more clearly for a good few weeks at this point. ..My thought processes feel clearer but the quality of my thoughts also seems to be improving now. By that I mean that the **vile extrusions of alcoholic grandeur and hatred** are no longer spewing forth - and I mean that in humour but I'm also utterly serious. Alcohol was turning me into a revolting person outside and in. Hoping to ultimately drown the filthy worm I was at my core in liquor I'd sloppily project all my nastiness onto the innocent people around me and was really coming to believe my own bullshit. ..I think this recognition of my own thought patterns has been the only real benefit to my rollercoaster episodes of the past year. I didn't 'forget' that I'm alcoholic or believe that I could moderate fuck no. Each time I went back out there and drank anyway because I'm a selfish addict and I had a lot of time to *analyze* the shit that goes on in my body and my mind when I expose them to ethanol. None of it's pretty and I'm glad I'm learning it...I kinda feel like Jekyll and Hyde - subtract alcohol add exercise and vegetables and voila! I actually seem to be a pretty good person. At least there's potential here. Sober I don't believe any of the crap I used to think about other people or even about myself and the thoughts are coming less frequently in the first place. I've had time to pour love onto the people I care about which is the thing I enjoy the most. Sober I'm reasonable and giving - a single beer and I'm in 5th gear towards the slimy cackling witch I'll become if I don't stop. But I feel like I have a golden ticket here another chance and I'm not convinced I deserve it so I may not get another if I mess it up. No more no thank you.

Congratulations on the month! It's amazing what happens to your body and your mind when you stop regularly ingesting an addictive poison...
Yay NZ!  Have an awesome day!
