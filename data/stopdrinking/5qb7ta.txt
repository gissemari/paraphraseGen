Was stiffed by one of my employers today removing hours from my substitute work felt so angry and there's nothing I can do about it. ..I was briefly thinking meh...I don't drink that often anymore 3 times in over 90 days...so who cares right? Well - for some reason I was quickly reminded of that it never gives me any thrills anymore heck...an alcohol free energy drink gives me more buzz than 4 x strong beers does and no side effects except being WAY too awake for way too long I'd take that any day over the numerous side-effects alcohol NOW give me like sleepless nights sweat bad smell psoriasis slow movement illogical thinking dumbing down reality lack of focus lack of sharpness saggy body feeling way older than I am etc. ..So that was actually easier than I'd have it before. Before (when I tried quitting hence the RS3 3-resets) it was easier to relapse because I still remembered the warm-buzz alcohol ONCE gave me. It didn't during those 3 relapses not even once in fact it only gave me severe pains and ALL of the side effects and NONE of the buzz makes it so much easier to remember how bad it really was...

I'm also getting better dealing with unpleasant and angry emotions.  Before the slightest thing would result in Fuck it! I'm getting wine.  In the last 2 months I've handled all sorts of annoyances and bad days. ..Not drinking with you today!
