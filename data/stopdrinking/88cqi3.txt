Hey everyone just a quick check in. I'm not here very often anymore. I'm still sober and enjoying life a lot. I'm running (not fast) and having an overall better health mentally and physically. I tried drinking one time and couldn't finish the glass of strong booze. It tasted and felt like poison. In my drinking days I could easily empty a bottle by myself. I also quit smoking and did stuff that I kept pushing off for years. To make a long and boring story short I'm doing great. I never thought living like this would be possible for me. I'm even developing a social life. Hurray. I'm not the person who does or achieves great things and dramatically loses weight/changes jobs or get a degree but I had a lot of small sparkly changes since I quit drinking. I hope to give a little bit of hope to the ones that are struggling here. I went through similar shit as you do and read the posts of people with 2+ years sober thinking that would never be me. And now I'm there too. The memory of hangovers is fading. I remember the feeling of regret guilt anxiety and despair as I drove to work with very strong wine breath. But the memory is fading. I was thinking about that in the car on my way home having actual plans for the weekend instead of looking forward to unlimited booze for two days. And that's why I write to you people here now. Some people have helped me and supported me here without them even knowing it. I hope this post can give a little bit of hope and motivation to someone too. Lots of love and strength from the other side of the ocean.

This is wonderful. Thanks for the uplifting message. I know I can never hear too many times that sobriety works.
Thanks for this bella great post to read at the beginning of the weekend :) also  your comment in the comment section about the standstill for over a decade was very reassuring to read. I feel the same..i'm an adult at the point in life as if he just graduated or so it feels like. Its a scary feeling and gets me down every once in a while so posts like yours are very welcome....happy cake day ;)
