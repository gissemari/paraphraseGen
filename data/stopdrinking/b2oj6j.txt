Hi all.  Saturday night was my last night working at a bar.  I had been there for 3 years. I was going to taper for two days but didn't want to drink another day so I poured my beer down the drain.  Drinking has been a long and slow unraveling and disconnection from anything and anyone I love in my life.  Pretty much piece by piece I just stopped caring about anything or achieving any goals and I started isolating myself because I was super embarrassed at the manchild I had become and the desolation of my life.   I hate when people ask me the simple question "so what have you been up to lately?"  because the answer is invariably "Not much of anything."  The truth about what I had been up to was simple: I had been waking up at 2-4pm every day after having a bout of 3 hours of insomnia in the middle of my night's sleep.  Then I would ride out whatever degree of self-loathing and anxiety I had that day and could hopefully make it to the store for a sandwich.  Some days I was too anxious and hungover so I just wouldn't leave the  house and wouldn't eat. But when 10pm rolled around I would buy my drinks then veg out watching whatever garbage on Netflix by myself. I would drink til 4 or 5am and sometimes have to make a second trip for more beer.  Especially in the last 3 months this ritual has become completely empty and joyless and drinking felt like a duty that I needed to fulfill because I was worried I would have withdrawal symptoms. Of course on the weekends when I would drink I would drink more heavily to the tune of 8-10+ drinks a night. I do have to admit that drinking when it was fun was just when I was around friends and talking shit or talking about our problems sincerely to one another.  I really hope that I can foster deep connection with people again as I've lost touch with practically everyone in my life. ..&amp;#x200B;..The past two weeks have been some of the worst of my life.  I knew that my final shift was coming up at work and I mostly just laid in bed making a plan for my suicide. The suicidal thoughts were more powerful than I've ever experienced and I just had to let them play out in my head for hours until they lost their grip (usually when my hangover relented). It really felt like the only answer in the moment and I was suffering too much to care about any suffering my family or friends might go through as a consequence if I successfully committed.  I'm not currently struggling with those thoughts as hard thankfully though I am vigilant and almost expect them to return at some point. ..&amp;#x200B;..It's amazing but I still am unsure about committing to not drinking forever. However I am certain that I want to take a very extended indefinite break from alcohol (at least 6 months maybe a year) see how I feel and assess from there. Another thing is that I know know know  I never want to have a daily drinking habit again.  It will get out of control. ..&amp;#x200B;..Other than that my life is truly bereft and empty now. I'm now unemployed confused about my direction without motivation and without reliable social support besides my mom &lt;3.   I'm starting from fucking nothing and I have to build a completely new life.  ..&amp;#x200B;..Thanks for reading thanks for your support. I will not drink with you today...&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
