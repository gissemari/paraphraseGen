It might be my imagination but it seems like in the past few days there have been a greater number of posts from people struggling relapsing recommitting anxious or generally feeling bad...For those of us in the US three major holidays are coming up in the next few weeks. Travel family cooking shopping old friends work parties - or loneliness - all of these things mean more stress...The days are getting shorter and because of the time change many of us have an extra hour of darkness in the evening...If you're feeling bad remember than you can be affected by outside factors and not all of it comes from inside your head and your own personal history.
