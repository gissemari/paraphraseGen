Hi everyone!..Doing my daily check in. It helps keep me tethered to me recovery and I am grateful for the accountability that the group provides. ..I went to an AA meeting last night and felt better for it. It was a *Grapevine* meeting which is the AA magazine sorta like a sobriety *Reader's Digest.* I'd never been to a *Grapevine* meeting before and had no idea what to expect but it was really good. We read one of the stories in this month's edition which was by a woman who had long term sobriety but continued to struggle with workaholism long after she quit drinking. Afterwards people shared about their reactions to the story or just about what was going on in their life in general...I really enjoy reading other people's stories about their recovery. It's helpful for me in a way that just reading abstract generalizations about recovery is not. And it was interesting and helpful to hear what other people took out of the story because they have a different life experience from mine and a different perspective...I appreciated that the story was largely about the struggles she experienced after getting sober. I relate with that a lot. I know how to quit drinking and doing drugs but I'm shaky on the next steps. I don't know how to deal with life. And I don't know how to deal with work and career stuff either. So it was helpful to read about that and hear other people's comments...Two of [my daily readings](www.recoveryreadings.com)this morning were highly relevant and helpful for where I'm at today. I've been letting other people get to me and getting worked up about situations that are outside of my control. The reading from  The Language Of Letting Go' was about having healthy relationships with family members and practicing loving detachment when necessary. The reading from  Daily Reflections' talked about how emotional distress is a warning sign that we're doing something that we need to change just like how physical pain is a warning sign from our body. ..It was helpful for me to read those and remember that I am in control of setting my own boundaries. It was also a good reminder that I can choose to detach from people who are acting in ways that is distressing to me and that I always have the freedom of response. I can choose how I respond in any given situation and I can determine my own level of involvement. No one can get me involved in their drama unless I let them. ..It was also a good reminder that when I'm getting upset it's a sign that I need to do something differently. I don't have to keep engaging in old relationship patterns or behavioral patterns. I can slow down become mindful of how I'm responding to the situation and how that feels and I can think about what **I** want. How do I want to be in the world? How do I want to interact with others? What do I want to invite into my life? What do I want to keep out? ..Instead of blindly reacting to situations slowing down enables me to be present and to choose my response. It allows me to make choices about myself and my life. It prevents others from pushing through my boundaries and it gives me the opportunity to change my behavior. It's not something that comes naturally to me. I still let my brain detach and race ahead like a hamster wheel spinning while I get myself all worked up. But I am learning and the more that I slow down and stay present the more that I am able to deal with my life...Which all sounds very Zen but it's a work in progress. I have been smoking cigarettes again the past couple of days. It's not great. I feel like I'm making excuses for myself around that and I don't want to make them here. It is what it is. I still have progress to make and things to work on. But I'm staying sober and that gives me the opportunity to do that. ..And speaking of making progress in life I've gotta buncha shit to do so I will leave you. I hope that life is finding you all well. Thanks for being here. I am grateful for the SD community...Ginger_Sprout Out.

Thanks for the post.  I'd only heard of _Grapevine_ in passing and forgotten about it.  The recoveryreadings site looks pretty awesome as well!  I find your writing is great too.  This post made me feel calmer somehow...This is the first time I've seen one of your posts.  I see you have more from the past.  I'll check 'em out and keep an eye out for future posts.  Thanks!
