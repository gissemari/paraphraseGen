20 days. I'm so happy to have reached this point. For the first time in forever I'm in Donegal alone in a house with alcohol and I am present in the moment focused...Life without alcohol is so so much clearer. I have to stay true to this path...This is the most supportive community. The stories   the successes and the struggles   keep me motivated every day. Thank you SD!.

Well done - I'm  20  today too - you've got this and I won't be drinking with you today ....

20 days here too and totally agree...congrats and IWNDWYT!
Keep us updated!      now we're curious how your writing goes .I will not be drinking with you 
I'm AOK and the writing is going well thank you...I was helped by a brisk walk along the beach in the wind and the rain earlier. Above all I've stuck to the plan: 100% focus to beat this...I'm possibly here until Tuesday will make a decision tomorrow...I've proven to myself however that I can do a Friday Saturday and Sunday on my own with alcohol in the house and stay true...I will not drink with you today!
