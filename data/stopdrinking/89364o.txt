Today I got extremely depressed because I'm kinda going through hell. And as I was determinately headed to the store for gin listening to music I saw a busker who I heard perform Led Zeppelin last week.. so I put down my headphones to hear what song he's singing. ..And WOW what a coincidence.. it was the song which made me stay strong and confidently rethink my life during the first 2 days of sobriety...It is a bulgarian song from the 90s about a heroin addict who lost everything and is seeking forgiveness from his friends and family right before his death. I instantly remembered my darkest memories caused by abusing my type of poison (alcohol) and decided to give him the money that I was about to spend destroying myself...Here's a modified english version if you want to hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrnHUKOkV5w..Thank you as well SD &lt;3 I will not drink with you today!
