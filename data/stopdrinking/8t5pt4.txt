It's the second day of summer and I'm going to do my best to make it a SOBER and awesome summer. 91 days left before fall hits. The last time I had a sober summer was back when I was 16 16 years ago...I have been debating on setting a length goal because in the past as soon as I have hit that goal I have relapsed shorty after. I suppose I can always reevaluate the goals as we get closer to completion...Summer is always my favorite time of year I wish everyone the best in their journey :)

Sober summer YES! Actually enjoying the mornings instead of hating the sunshine because you have a hangover? Sounds good to me!..I haven't set a length goal. I debated doing one year but worry if I do that then I'll start drinking again when I get there. I already know I can't moderate and so far I love sobriety so I see no reason to look back now. Thinking about quitting "forever" is definitely daunting but like everyone else I'm taking it one day at a time. IWNDWYT!
I'm totally IN!!!! 
This will be my first sober summer.  Looking forward to it! IWNDWYT
