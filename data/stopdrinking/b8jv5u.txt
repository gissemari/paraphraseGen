Just for today I will not drink. Simple words sometimes difficult to fulfill. My demeanor has always been thinking into the future reliving the past and rarely giving enough time in the moment. In years past I would make resolutions of sorts around self improvement go to the gym walk everyday learn new songs learn to sing learn to cook. Each endeavor I would set out on I would find myself filled with good intentions and ultimately not complete to my true satisfaction. I would then rehash the past and be judgemental and critical of myself for failing to achieve my goals. The cycle would continue resolve once again look to an end goal and become distracted or give up...Wash rinse repeat...Coming here and committing to a single 24 hour period to not drink has taught me it doesn't have to be the only thing I can commit to in a 24 hour period. Over the last several weeks in committing to just one single day I have found myself paying more attention to those moments in the day...I start my mornings reading your struggles achievements joys and heartbreak and seeing it here and the resolve to commit for just one more day to be mindful even from hour to hour minute to minute shows me a path I have denied myself. ..Continue onward I am walking with you on this one from a distance or maybe right next to you who knows. Thank you for continuing on this journey with me.
