Hi everyone!..[Yesterday I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bpmhrk/alcohol_was_how_i_selfmedicated_my_ism/) about the last time that I got sober. I stopped working on my recovery and I relapsed because I didn't know how to deal with life sober because alcohol isn't my problem alcohol was my *solution*. ..I wanted to follow up on that post because things are different for me this time around. I still don't know how to deal with life exactly but I'm learning and I don't miss having alcohol and other drugs available as an escape. And I know other people with long term sobriety who feel the same way. They talk about where they were at when they first got sober and where they're at now and how things have changed. They've grown. They've built a better life for themselves in sobriety. They're happy in their own skin. I can feel myself getting there and I can see that if I keep going it will keep getting better...I want to preface this by saying that the path that I've found to a better life in sobriety is not the only way. I had a vivid memory this morning of the first time that I hit bottom. It was almost nine years ago. For the first time in my life I was ready to talk about my struggle with alcohol and ask for help. ..I went to my first AA meeting and I put together 30 days of sobriety for the first time. I didn't stay in that place of readiness and it took me four more years of trying to manage my drinking to get back there but I got there for a moment at least...What I remembered this morning is that in that moment of clarity I reached out to the two people I knew who were open about being alcoholics and who were openly sober. I'd completely forgotten about this but I told them that I was  pre-alcoholic  and I was worried about where my drinking was going. I was *fully* an alcoholic at that point I just wasn't drinking out of a paper bag on a park bench. But like I said it was a start...Looking back what's interesting is how similar their response was. They lived in different cities and they'd never met each other but they were both very kind. Neither one gave me any feedback on where I was with my own drinking they just talked to me about their own experience getting sober. ..One guy said that he went to AA at the start and found it helpful but then found a different spiritual path which has helped him in his sobriety. He was at least ten years sober at that point and he's still sober. The other guy unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago but he'd been sober several years when I spoke with him and he stayed continuously sober for the rest of his life. He wasn't a member of AA. All of this is to say that I understand that there are other ways to do sobriety that lead to a full peaceful meaningful life. ..I couldn't find that path on my own. I tried. It didn't work for me. I needed help. I got on here and that helped a lot but it wasn't enough. I started doing some serious therapy to deal with some past trauma and various childhood things and again that helped but it wasn't enough. I'm a smart person with a decent work ethic. I'm  resourceful I'm good at figuring things out. And eventually I realized that that wasn't going to be enough. ..It seemed increasingly unlikely that I was going to figure out how to make sobriety work for me on my own before my addiction killed me. So I got help. I went to AA and accepted for the first time that I needed it. There's other recovery programs. I checked out SMART. I checked out Refuge Recovery. There are people in both of those programs who have also found a path to recovery that works for them. But for whatever reason I knew that AA would work for me and so far now that I've committed to it it has...I wasn't crazy about going to AA. I'd had one foot in the door before and found it sorta beneficial but nothing earth shattering. I come from a very religious household and religion was not a positive thing for me growing up. I had a lot of problems with the Higher Power thing. I thought that the main benefit of the program was the social support. And that's important that's definitely part of it. ..But the main benefit of the program I'm finding at least for me is the program itself. Working the steps with a sponsor. Trying to be of service to other alcoholics in small ways when I can. Accepting that I need a power greater than myself in my life and accepting that I don't have all of the answers for how to run my life. Working on acceptance in general. All of that stuff it's somehow making me happy. I feel peaceful. I feel contented. I feel connected...So there's many ways to build a good life in sobriety. This is what's working for me. I'm glad that I didn't settle for just not drinking that I actually took action to get help and to build an active and meaningful sobriety. The difference is night and day.
