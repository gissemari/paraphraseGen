Woo-Hoo!  I'm approaching the one month mark. I think 5 weeks will be a record since I started this experiment last year.  I'm still struggling with get up and go.  I forced myself to go turn garden plot with pitch fork and pulling out grass roots.  I must admit it feels good when I'm done I'm sore.  I just wish that I would of gone earlier so I could of stopped earlier and I didn't waste time and energy procrastinating.  I finally went at 6pm and worked until 830.  Still have another 6 hours of work before I can even plant. I won't drink with you today.
