For whatever reason today I just wanted a drink after work first time I've had a real craving I did not drink that much roughly one shot in the bottom of a glass after I drank it I didn't feel the slightest buzz just sadness it was like falling back into a pit that I had worked so hard to get out of I know it could be much more worst but I honestly feel like slamming my head into a wall any advice on dealing with this?

I can't give you any advice other than to say: you're here you're back. That's a good start. We all have slip ups. One day at a time friend...I will not drink with you today.
You could write down exactly how you are feeling right now. Put it in your wallet. Next time you want to drink pull it out and read it. 
First remember that you did make it 40 days sober that alone is a huge accomplishment...I don't know if you had the alcohol still in the house but if you did that is why we suggest that you get rid of it because sooner or later it will tempt you...
