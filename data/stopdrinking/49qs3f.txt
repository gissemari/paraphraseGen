I had 15 months of sobriety up until September of 2015 when I walked off a job and drove erratically to the liquor store.  Immediately I returned to drinking 20+ beers a day (morning -noon -night) drinking at work driving drunk and destroying my finances...Today I woke up and said enough is enough. I want my sobriety back again and the good life I once had and I am prepared to fight for it...I enjoy reading everyone's threads/posts.  Lurking here has definitely helped me take this first step.  Tonight is going to be water coffee a healthy meal (no more McDonalds) some television and back to my AA group.  ..Edit:  On day #2 and I'm feeling incredibly better.  Reviewed the baby steps when I got up. Didn't sleep too well but it's going to be a physical day at work today and should help put me to bed pretty easy tonight.  Going to hit another AA meeting after work and check in with my group up there. Thank you so much everyone for all of your support!

Welcome back! I like your plan and your attitude.
So glad you made it back because many don't. One day at a time I wish you sobriety!
Welcome back and keep posting to let us know how it goes.
I came back to sobriety after a 7 year relapse--previously I was continuously sober for 15 years.  After I came back I returned to doing a regimen that I had learned a long time ago that I call [the Baby Steps at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.
Congratulations on your decision. I wish you well in your fight to live a sober life.
Great move !  We're  all rooting for you  !
be careful cutting yourself off without medical assistance or a strict taper.
Welcome back!
I think "fighting" for sobriety is a great way to put it.  It is work but worth every ounce. 
I am glad you are back! Welcome home. 
I too came back after a six-year relapse (9+ years sober).  Welcome back.  I read on another post yesterday something along the lines that relapse does not have to be an option.  I'm holding that one for myself this time.  I won't drink with you today.

Welcome back. Sounds like you have the beginnings of a pla.
Welcome back! My story is almost yours letter for letter. It's been a few months but I'm getting my groove back and you will too. You've made a great decision keep it up!
Welcome back and wish you the best. Be well and hope your detox goes smoothly... 20+ beers daily is a lot by all standards... I'm pulling for you. Keep us updated
Congrats my friend. It's got to be incredibly tough to find the courage to break your routine. You can do it!
I ain't going back to day 1.
Welcome back man!..This is helpful for me to read right now.. I feel committed to not drinking right now but posts like this show me that things can shift back toward relapse not matter how far down the sober road you get...It really is a day-by-day thing; we can't see the future...I hope things go well for you this time 'round!
