I've been sober 5 weeks.  Been out to some music and social events at bars a few times totally sober and feeling more connected to people but the experiences just seem boring now.  It's not a struggle not to drink or get stoned or do coke but I truly find myself thinking  this is pretty boring .  Even tonight where I used to be excited to go out to do karaoke every week it just doesn't interest me.  I'm taking this as a sign that the bar scene is just not for me anymore.  I feel great and very much in control of my life at this moment and had to share that!..

5 weeks wow!  That's great!   And yeah there's a lot to do.  I started doing 5k races they're wonderful co-ed people are happy to be there big ones have "finisher medals" just to finish the race I have my first one and I can see it right now.  IWNDWYT.
I'm done with the Pubs too(UK) can't believe the time I've wasted doing absolutely nothing worthwhile.Im 65 and a lifetime drinker.I now see them for what they really areplaces filled with good excuses to get drunk!Its not the ConversationKariokeMusic or even food that made me keep going back.Just a good disguise to allow me to get drunk.I am done with it.IWNDWYT
