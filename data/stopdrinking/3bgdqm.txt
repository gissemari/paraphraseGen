So as many know I relapsed on Friday. Consequently I was really hungover on Saturday and took sleep meds and slept for a total of 14 hours into this morning Sunday. ..I made a mistake and thought I didn't work at one of my two jobs this morning and almost got fired. My manager is furious. I work in radio so if I don't show up live content doesn't air and consequently we could lose a client and thousands of dollars...Now I can't help but realize I probably wouldn't of slept so long if I hadn't of drank how even though I still haven't drank since I would've been up earlier and able to know I was working. I maybe would've been more alert to when I worked. ..To make this more ironic I went into my other job later and got a raise. Said I've been amazing and improved in my mood and work ethic. Goes to show. You reap what you sow. This is the first mess up I've had in 6 months and I know it's correlated to the one time I drank. So there you go. Alcohol sucks. I'm not drinking today.

Congrats on today! I'm new to this but I'm learning that all you can do is learn from each mistake. 
&gt; Alcohol sucks. I'm not drinking today...Amen to that. Coming around to a certain degree of bitterness about alcohol has really helped me turn the corner on "wishing I could drink". Right now drinking is about as attractive to me as hitting myself with a hammer. And still the little voice shows up now and then to keep me on my toes... "hey you really want smash your foot with a hammer. just once wouldn't be so bad...".
