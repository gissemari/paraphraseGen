I think it's day four sober for me. I'm trying the steps and everything else I can possibly think of after over a decade of drug and alcohol abuse. treatment therapy love and even wilder off the wall coping mechanism. my mom's a nonfunctional alcoholic and that's been my whole life. Those are my earliest memories. as a preteen I had already lost my religion and burned it into my brain that she was dead to me and if I ever became even remotely like her I morally had to kill myself. I've tried several times and been hospitalized three times. After my latest relapse I can't pretend like I'm happy or that there's hope or everything is okay. The only reason I haven't killed myself is I'm terrified after all the failed attempts. I just can't. For the longest I just hoped maybe this time I won't ever have to wake up again. Not even love for the brilliant beautiful people in my life can shake this. It's occurred to me before and subconsciously driven me but it's just one of those epiphanies you have for the thousandth time every time you're in week one again. I'm dead to myself. not that I think I'm capable of doing anything about it but accepting this is cathartic in the way accepting my mom was dead to me all those years ago was..I'm okay with being a zombie. I want to go to a zombies anonymous group instead of aa. I hope I don't relapse again but I have no doubts that it's delusional.

You're not a zombie.  You're a human being who can absolutely do this.
