Hey everyone. I've been sober for nearly a month and in the past my sobriety didn't make it to a full month. I think drinking compounds my issues and makes me very anxious and depressed and as that subsides then I feel more comfortable and confident that I can drink again and that I was just stressed out. This time I don't feel like I want to drink but I am starting to forget how difficult getting sober was and exactly how bad it felt. I've heard each time you relapse the problem gets worse and it's even harder to quit next time. In my experience that has been true. Does anyone have any suggestions other than AA (which I am considering but not 100% comfortable with.)
