Hey SD.My first week of stopping drinking has been going really well. I'm hopeful for the future and I feel so much better. I think I'm in the pink cloud phase. Today I was hanging out with an old family friend. We used to hang out and day drink last summer. The subject of alcohol came up. I said I was taking a break (that was a white lie I'm quitting for good). But I found myself in a discussion about what types of alcohol I like/don't like what drinking games I like to play and just generally reminiscing about my past drinking. I'm really freaked out by this. I don't like hearing myself discuss alcohol as if I'm going to pick it up again next weekend. I also found myself sad that I'd never play a drinking game again. I think this is a sign of a potential relapse. I don't want to go back to where I was. I don't have any intention of starting again. I'm moving to Florida soon and I intend to start going to meetings when I get there. I have a chance for a fresh start. This forum has been a huge help to me. Thanks very much SD. You guys rock! I will NOT drink with you today.
