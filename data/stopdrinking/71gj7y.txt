I've been doing a lot of research about gut bacteria and the role it plays in mental health. There seems to be a link between gut and relapse. Any thoughts?
----------immediate responses--------

It is entirely possible the little critters in the gut are actually in charge and we are unwitting tools to whatever ends they have. Or perhaps not...I do know that my digestion was awful drinking and things are much better now. I eat some Greek yogurt every day and I try to keep in mind the fermented foods like sauerkraut and kimchi.
Since alcohol is a carcinogenic poison and rots the major organs it touches like brain esophagus liver kidney pancreas and stomach it makes sense it might F with the flora.  Alcohol is a great solvent and paint remover but has no healthful benefits when ingested by humans.  Anything that is so fatal in blood alcohol concentrations of four tenths of one percent should not be drunk.
What's the link??
I've done a ton of research on this.  The gut flora not only makes a boatload of enzymes and nutrients we need it also makes 90% of the feel good chemicals seratonin and dopamine.  They are not made in the head. Alcohol interferes with most cell processes in the body.  I'm not drinking with you today.
