This is my second attempt at sobriety and the furthest I've made it so far. I wanted to say thank you to this community as reading both the triumphs and struggles here has been tremendously helpful. These last 2 weeks I've been feeling better each day only focusing on not drinking. Today I'm going to the gym (for the first time in what seems like forever) to start adding some more productive activities. Thank you again to everyone here and IWNDWT!

Congratulations and brilliant news on two weeks. Breaking it down and focusing day by day is the way to go I'd say and enjoy the gym :)..Not gonna drink with you today :)
Two weeks is pretty awesome if you ask me. Plus you get a really cool looking badge.
Congratulations!   And good for you choosing to spend your new time and extra energy in a positive feedback activity like going to the gym...
