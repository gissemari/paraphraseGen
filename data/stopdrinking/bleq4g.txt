So after [a terrible Saturday evening fail](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/bkzrq0/recounting_the_bad_times_like_last_night/) I had a second work event on Sunday. (And my work events are always swimming in booze.) Not only did the event feature multiple tequila stations for tasting high-end tequila but also endless pitchers of freshly made craft margaritas. Certainly the deep remorse and embarrassment I felt about the evening before meant I came in with particularly strong intent to avoid drinking but still... quite a lot to have to resist. And then the bartender failed to show which meant that yours truly ended up pouring drinks for two hours! It would have been natural easy and acceptable to have my own margarita (or three) while serving them up for the other attendees. But I didn't! Once I made it through the first hour I felt so happy about not drinking that I held on to that happiness. It doesn't erase my Saturday screw-up but at least Sunday was a success. And reminded me success is possible. I needed that. Feeling a little better this morning. ..Thanks for listening. This sub is currently the only place I have to really share about this struggle. I appreciate it so much and am grateful for everyone else sharing their stories. Makes the effort feel a little less lonely.
