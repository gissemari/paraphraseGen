I feel so stuck. I was a closet alcoholic for ten years. Drank almost a fifth a day and my wife didn't know about it in the slightest. We didn't even keep alcohol in the house. Then one day on a family vacation I imploded and told her about my addiction. I had about four months sober then relapsed over and over again for the last year. Thing is she thinks I'm still sober. I don't have the heart to tell her I've been lying to her all over again for the past year but I can't do this without telling people so I'm telling you guys.

The weight of my secrets felt too heavy to carry without drinking. Getting honest was liberating. I had a therapist and went to AA meetings. Having support made sobriety easier and more fun. 
Not going to lie really tough one here. Only you know what's truly best for you...However I know the weight of the secrets became too much for me. Coming clean was really tough - no doubt about it. But it took such a burden off me. Now I can be honest about the ups and downs with family and friends and that's a huge advantage for me to stay sober.
There's an aphorism I take seriously: "Resentments will make me drink; Secrets will kill me"...Honesty starts with me being honest with myself.  ..I hope the best for you!
Be honest with her. I bet there is a good chance she already knows...we're usually not as good at hiding it as we think we are

How do you hide it surely she can smell it on you? She must already know and is deliberately turning a blind eye.
Like anyone of us it will help you a lot to stay sober from today onwords . I will not drink with you today and wish you to stay strong.
