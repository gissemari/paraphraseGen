I enjoy coming back to this sub to see how long it's been since the last time I'd given in. Everything has improved. While confrontation used to end up turning into a days-long struggle I can now recall facts from days ago and say what it is I want to say without losing my train of thought. I am now able to come in on a Monday and pick up where I left off on Friday. Or yesterday for that matter. I digress. Clarity such a simple thing. Thank you all for your support...-simply existing

Thanks for sharing. I'm looking forward to days of clearer thoughts. The few times in the last year that I've given myself a couple of days off from drinking I've been amazed at how fluid my thoughts become again with just a little recovery: one of many good incentives to quit entirely.
Clarity.  Cool.  Thanks for sharing.
