16 days in and i feel pretty good. I already am catching myself feeling too confident like my many other relapses. ..The new perspective I have this time is I read a "the recovery book" and it described recovery in 3 stages red yellow and green. The thing that shocked me was that the red zone lasted over 16 months. That's a year and a half of extreme caution and putting my recovery first before anything else. In the past I felt ready to move on around 1 to 3 months. ..This time I'm not changing anything at least until I find myself with a year and 100% confidence in myself.

Great choice great advice! Great job man!
Overconfidence when it comes to this can be a killer. That's what got me last time too..... Good job on you 
The only other time I quit I felt very confident at 22 months. That's the longest I've been sober in 20 years. I will remember the red zone and stay in it for 24 months this time. I read on here someone say that they are 'allergic' to alcohol. I think that's a good one! If I drink it I will die. It's a good thing to tell other people about yourself end of discussion. I live in the Pacific Northwest; most have allergies to something around here..... Stay strong! We can do this!
