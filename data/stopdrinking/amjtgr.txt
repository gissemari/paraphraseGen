I relapsed again but instead of going it alone I got myself to a meeting. My trap was always I'll stop on the first of the month then I'd fail. Then I'd say okay Monday is the day and then I'd fail. Then the 15th of the months then on this day and then on that day. And I always failed...You know it doesn't matter when I stop because any day is the perfect time to stop drinking. I have gotten myself a sponsor and I have planned out meetings to go to. I started feeling like stopping by the liquor store and tell myself "Monday is the perfect day to stop." But I didn't. ..It's the definition of bargaining with my life and allowing insanity of repeating the same action and hoping for a different result to rule over my actions. I ordered a pizza and I'm staying on this sub until the cravings pass...So if you are wondering when a good time to stop is I'd say now is the perfect time to stop...Iwndwyt

Did you ever do "Well Labor Day is 2 weeks from now so I'll quit after Labor Day."? ....or insert any Holiday.......You can do this. Enjoy the pizza. Watch good movies. I'll check back in here up till 10PM eastern US time.
Good for you. Meetings saved my life. Keep us posted. IWNDWYT
