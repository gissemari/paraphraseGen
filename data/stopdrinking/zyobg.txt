29 yo female not a binge drinker or necessarily an addict... However. I really really need to quit so I can beat depression. But I can't! It's mostly social occasions and/or anxiety that crush my best of intentions. Where can a non addict go for abstinence support? I don't feel like I  would fit in a recovery group...

Can you explain your situation a little more? Not being able to stop on your own is questionable. ..[Are you sure you're not an alcoholic?](http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=1860&amp;cn=14)
I have a history with depression so I feel for where you're coming from.  I recommend hitting up an AA meeting.  Any Open Discussion meetings are a great place to talk vent and get advice.  They can be intimidating when you start but I suggest speaking up and just say "Hi. I'm pollomazatelco.  I want to stop drinking.  I just want to listen for now."  Go for a week or two.  If the meetings don't help a Detox center might be helpful.

Hi pollomazatleco. Welcome...I think you're in the right place. We don't really put labels on anyone but the goal of the group is to help anyone who wants to control their drinking not just necessarily alcoholics...How long have you been drinking at your current level? Is it just peer pressure and anxiety that beats you when you try to abstain or are you having other troubles with it as well?..The best way to break a habit is to put a new one in its place. Once your new habit is in place long enough your old habit won't have the same appeal. I agree with Your2ndupvote that you should try to get 30 days of not drinking under your belt. A lot of people find that period to be good for a sober perspective...There are plenty of sober habits you can replace your drinking with. For starters staying out of bars is a big help. You might also start exercising - that seems to help a lot of people. Finally keep talking to us. The sort of support you get here can give you a real boost in trying to keep your commitments...I wish you the best. Please check back with us and let us know how it's going. I hope you're able to meet your goal and get your depressing back in check. Don't hesitate to ask for help whenever you need it. That's what we're here for.
