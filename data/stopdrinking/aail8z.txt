I wonder if anyone else here is in the same boat I've struggled with substance abuse since I was 15 (currently about to be 21)...But I wouldn't say I have a "drinking" problem per say more a substance abuse issue. I've never had tremors or any sort of physical withdrawal from any drug but just staying sober in general is the problem. I don't care what it is (weed and alcohol have been the main substances I've abused) but I feel like I need something. It's a brutal cycle: I'll abuse one substance until it gets to be too much then I'll switch to another one and then back to the original. ..This makes it very easy to trick yourself into thinking "hey I can stop drinking at anytime I don't have a problem"...but then it's just supplemented with smoking and vise versa. Just spending these 10 days sober have made me realize just how out of control my substance use has gotten. It's so sad drugs/alcohol have literally become my best friend. If I'm feeling shitty and somebody asks to hang out id just make something up like "feeling a little sick just going to go to bed early tonight" then proceed to go back to my room alone and black out or smoke myself into a coma. ..Idk I just wanted to get this off my chest maybe there's others in this sub that feel this way. Just the two posts I've typed out on this sub have been a massive help in clearing my head...On a more positive note I'm 10 days sober which is probably the longest I've gone in at least 3-4 years...let keep it going!

It sounds like you're on the trail of addiction. It is a progressive path. I'd google the stages of alcoholism and/or drug abuse. End stage alcoholism is getting f'd up alone. I didn't have withdrawals until deep in my cycle like decades although I did have the occasional hangover. When you get the shakes and hallucinations then you know you are in full blown deep addiction. Keep down that trail and it can kill you. Also I've known addicts in their early to late twenties who have died from their addiction. It can kill at any time anyone rich or poor regardless of race or anything else...Cognitive dissonance is a real explanation to why people stay addicted when they know something is wrong. Lots of good books like This Naked Mind that go into detail about addiction. Denial is a strong word on why folks don't get help.The addiction is filling in a void. Have to figure out why you use and create a plan to solve it. You might need a total reset in life...Lots of good reading on the internet about addiction and the path of self destruction. The more you become knowledgeable the better equipped you will be.
I can totally relate to this. I never had benders. Never even had withdrawal worse than general hangovers. And yet what mattered was that alcohol was getting in the way of everything I wanted in life. Once I had a drink I didn't get shit done and often behaved poorly. And oh the shame those things brought which made me perpetually down.   I could not see things clearly until I had some sober time. I've found this to be true with every spell of sobriety I've had. .
