30 days ago I was 2 days shy of 7 months of continuos sobriety when I relapsed on two Xanax I accidentally found (then purposely stole) 2 pills and took them that night.  That started me on a 30 binge of lies sneaking using blacking out.  .Thursday and Friday I was stuck in my addiction with a syringe and dilaudid and thought I was doomed. My husband was off Friday and Saturday night so I started and went through withdrawal this weekend. .Today was a very long day even tho I was graced with 12 hours of sleep lastnight and woke up at 11:00 today to find a text from an AA friend asking me to help clean the meeting room at noon. .I did that. Then I came home and watched the constant rain took a bath read a book went to coffee shop up down up down.  Went to an AA meeting and without knowing it I sat down next to my using friend.  Blah blah blah. I was to be over there around 10:45 tonight but...at 10:35 I texted the person and let them know I wouldn't be there. .I'm sober clean and looking forward to hopefully another amazing night of sleep. I'm so proud of myself for actually asking a power greater than myself to keep me clean tonight to just stay home.  I will feel so much better about myself and about life in the morning.  .Thanks friends I'm sorry for all the rambling. I don't post often. I was catching up on posts and I feel blessed that stumbled upon this awesome subbreddit
