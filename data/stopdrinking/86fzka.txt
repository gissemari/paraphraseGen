Am now 43 days sober after running myself into the ground through drinking and smoking for 9 years and ending up in hospital with severe asthma and flu...It's been - erm - interesting! It was really tough at first but the cravings are getting much easier (I'm not smoking either cos if I light up I might as well just cut out the middle man and just phone for an ambulance...) The alcohol has been the one that I have struggled most with. Some days I have clung on some days I have just put one foot in front of the other and waited for it to end and some days I have felt pretty good and can see glimpses of a life that is better...I'm now back at work and have been discharged from the chest clinic my lungs are back to normal and I'm doing swimming riding and walking the dog...I just feel incredibly lucky! I'm going to meetings have a sponsor and the support I have from SD has been amazing. It's the first thing I look at in the morning and the last thing I look at before I go to sleep. Just checking in and posting really helps!..I wake up rather than regain consciousness I don't have the 3am horrors I can brush my teeth without retching I'm taking better care of myself - before I didn't feel like I 'deserved' it - what was the point when I was just messing up my body anyway... Like trying to paint a crumbling rotting wall that's falling over anyway. And I was always going to stop drinking - tomorrow - which never came...I can give lifts to my children be relied upon I have started to socialize more instead of isolating myself to drink I'm no longer effectively under house arrest from when I pick up my supplies on my way home from work because now I can leave the house in the car to go places. I no longer spend my day obsessing about what I will drink when I will drink why I am drinking when I swore I wouldn't a few hours earlier...I have crossed so many lines when I have been drinking it's unreal - I feel ashamed when I think about it. And I'm starting to realise things about myself that I'm going to have to look at at some point in the future...The obsession is starting to lift but I still don't feel comfortable in my own skin at times - like I'm waiting for something to happen or don't quite know what to do with myself - usually in the evenings - it is easing a bit though.....Overall I'm pretty excited about things...And yesterday I booked a skiing trip for me and the lads - we go next saturday!..I'm so looking forward to it - as are the children! It'll be great to spend time just me and kids in the snow ( they aren't small - they are teen and 20) and a good laugh  ..It will be the first holiday as an adult that I won't be drinking and the first for 9 years that I won't be considerably pissed...I'm just a bit nervous about what it's going to be like? Oldest lad doesn't really drink which is good and he knows I have stopped and is supportive without being interrogative. Youngest lad is 14 and I'm a single parent so have no SO who drinks which makes it easier...Does anyone have any tips or advice? (Or moral support or a kick up the arse) I will be phoning my sponsor whilst out there.....I'm nervous - but also very excited!..

I'm happy for you!  Sounds really exciting and having the kids along can be a boost for you to be super responsible and be the role model!  I just had to remind myself sometimes that under no zero zilch ANY circumstance would I allow myself an excuse reason or loophole to drink.  It's worked so far   .And I'm still trying to figure out how it is you fit your house in the car.I will not drink with you pony!
