I can't even say I'm fully sober yet. but I'm trying and I know it will come soon. but it's 7:28am on a SATURDAY and I'm getting ready for a 8am yoga class. I'm 34 and the majority of my life I wasted most mornings being hungover. I used to struggle to get to a 930 am  class usually just to sweat out booze and be so jealous of all the people who are truly healthy around me not just trying to detox.  I am grateful to feel good this morning and start my day doing something I love.

That's awesome that you're hitting a yoga class. I'm on Day 1 again too and I'm too sick to do anything but sit here. I have plans at Noon that will have me all over the city so I guess I'm resting up for that. But I feel like shit. I wish I could bottle this shitty feeling and release it a little every time I get the urge to drink. I won't drink with you today. I'm grateful I get a chance at a Day 1 again but I never want to go through early sobriety again. Good luck to all of us!
Sounds like a good plan. I remember being in my 30s not wanting to waste any more time to alcohol. It is amazing how that time slide into another 15 years of wasting time to alcohol.
"So jealous of the people who are truly healthy around me"....use that. Even if it is negative motivation. I posted yesterday about a time in my life where I dreamt of a life I'd never have. You're doing that. Dreaming of what you think you can't have. You can have that life you can be that person. If you like yoga live it for a little while.  Be that healthy person you've always wanted to be. I will not drink with you today and enjoy being healthy 
I hope that's me! I'm not fully sober but I'm trying. I love taking classes on Saturday mornings. Today I'm hungover.Bloated and depresses. I'm not drinking tonight.
