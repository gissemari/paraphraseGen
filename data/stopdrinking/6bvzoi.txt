This is a crosspost from /r/dinosaursinrecovery because I think this message belongs here too. This sub is as responsible for my ongoing sobriety as the Dinos are and I hope I can inspire someone to stay with their journey...I was a fresh faced University student an athlete and all around popular guy. Life of the party some might even say. I drank my way through my first 2 years of Uni and I knew that I probably drank more than I should and certainly way more that most people I knew. One night before the Christmas break we were all out partying and being rambunctious and during a bit of horseplay I pushed a girl I knew. I pushed her hard enough to knock her over an empty table onto the floor. Of course we were all hammered and she and I and everyone else thought it was hilarious...Inside me something changed...That New Year's Eve I swore I wouldn't drink for a year. It was to be my penance for putting my hands on a woman something I swore I would never do in a violent manner. I was 21 years old. I spent the rest of my years at Uni as a residence staff RA and Don volunteering for weekend shifts so I could work the doors and watch the drunken idiots come home. Countless nights of watching people fight cry puke and hurt themselves convinced me I had made the right decision...I had never been able to have "just one beer" that's not a thing for me. In fact looking back over the last 27 years I think it's pretty clear that I don't do things by half. My obsessive personality has been a help in so many ways and when focused appropriately it can be a real asset. But when it comes to addiction I am and always will be an addict. I am now addicted to healthy pursuits finding different ways to modify my eating habits and fitness regimen but I always make sure I have something to obsess over...This sub has been a real eye opener reliving the struggles that I went through the pain of cold turkey quitting and the doubts and fears facing a life without alcohol. All I can say is that it has been worth it. My journey started with a decision and dogged determination to stick with that decision. I became proud that people thought it was weird that I didn't drink. I was proud to be a first string varsity rugby player that went to the beer ups and drank diet coke it was amusing after a while. I still get quizzical looks and oddball questions whenever the topic comes up. Yes I got married and celebrated the birth of my child without alcohol. Yes I have been the designated driver for what seems like forever it's something of which I can be proud. The bottom line is that even for those struggling with addiction of any kind it is possible to leave it all behind. Your journey may start with a decision it may start with a forced hiatus it may start with a promise to a loved one but whatever it is you can do it...One day I stopped. I never looked back. I regret nothing except the actions that led me to quit...Today I am proud of myself. Thanks for listening..

Congratulations!  When I first quit i mused that if I saved $10 (the price of a cheap bottle of wine) for every day I quit at 1000 days I'd have $10000.  Hope you celebrated doing something special. 
Wow 10.000 days is insanely impressive   You are an inspiration.
