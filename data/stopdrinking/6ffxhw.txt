I am 33 and have drank quite heavily since my early teen. Recently my drinking has got me in a lot of trouble. My Fiance left me I totaled my car and was lucky no one got hurt but legally I am in a lot of trouble. The past 6 months have been sobriety for a week or two then a relapse. I know my triggers but I live with all alcoholics so it is always around. I relapsed last night but I am starting sobriety again. The hangovers are horrible and I have a lot of anxiety. I suppose I am just looking to part of a community were sobriety is important.

i was 35 when i got sober.  in the 2 years leading up to that i had a gf leave me because of my drinking a roommate ask me to leave and some major f ups at work.  i tried a number of different ways to quit but none of them involved help from others.  it wasn't until i went to treatment and then alcoholics anonymous was i able to string some time together.  i can't stay sober on my own.  i need real life connection with others in recovery to have a chance.  i've learned to live a happy contented sober life.  
Welcome. You can get a lot of support and understanding here. It will be easier to face the music sober.  There is always a bright side.  No one got hurt.  This too shall pass.  I won't drink with you today.
Thank you both. .
