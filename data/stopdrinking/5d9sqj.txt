I'm posting this in this Reddit and my alonon one because I want to go about things the right way and I know people from both sides of the topic can be helpful in this matter. My fianc  was 65 days sober a doctor halfway through that sobriety made the big mistake of putting him on librium for his anxiety and when it was time where he needed to come off the librium we were put in a position where we had to do too fast of a taper and he was struggling after being completely off it the last few days combined with a lot of other large stressors last night he relapsed hard he eventually said he downed 300+ ml of straight vadka in less than half an hr. He is also on lithium for bipolar and the combo of this did not make for a good night he did several really bad things while he was drunk and we ended up going to the hospital out of fear that mixing the two the way he did was making him toxic. Fast forward to this morning he's still under the influence from that and he's feeling pretty regretful from the relapse which with his personality makes him sarcastic defensive and at times verbally aggressive but he doesn't remember the things he did while intoxicated I had to physically restrain him at one point last night before the E.r so I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do and not do in this situation not just over the fact he relapsed but what do I do with the information of last night do I inform of what he did while drunk cause I'm afraid with the way he tends to think that in his head he would use the negative feelings from all that as reason to drink again instead of reason to NOT drink again but at the same time I worry that if he doesn't know that it won't be enough of an impact/deterrent I just don't know the right time to talk to him bout it. And how can I show support in the right way without overdoing it I know that it's his journey and about me focusing on me but I also know how crucial support around him is.

This is just me and others will probably disagree but... I wouldn't come at him with what he did last night until he's sobered up and ready to talk about it himself. He knows he messed up and he's probably already prepared himself mentally for the onslaught of anger and disappointment from you and family etc. Hence the defensiveness and sarcasm. 60 plus days is a huge accomplishment and I've personally seen how hard it is to taper off of prescription drugs. He likely didn't feel like himself and it's hard to keep your goals straight when you don't even feel like you. For now I would just be caring and let him know you're there for him. I would be relieved to know I still had someone on my side if I felt like everyone else was just going to be disappointed in me. When he sees that you still care and are offering compassion he may be more like to discuss the details and work forward. I dunno that's just me. Best of luck to you. I hope he feels better soon!
