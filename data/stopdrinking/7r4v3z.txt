Hello everyone! Since I'm not able to get into the chat room as often as I would like I thought I'd start writing some of my experience in my first full year being sober. Through this journey I have had a lot of help from this reddit and it has been a major resource/tool to help me stay on track! This one will be short because I just want to get this out of my system and will put more effort into it the next few days. ..I'm obviously not a doctor or have any licenses in the medical field. I took forever trying to get better because I failed to seek any assistance and figured I could do it on my own. Spoilers I couldn't. I've learned that the opposite of addiction is connection. ..One of the ways that I had found this subreddit is by realizing that I needed to connect with people who relate to my situation. Speaking to my friends and family who didn't have any clue on what I was going through wasn't helping me. I would go to them and explain that I thought I had a problem and they would laugh and reply with "No please don't stop drinking! That will be so boring!"  ..My brain: "Yeah that would be boring holy shit I'll lose my friends if I quit." ..Rationalization: 1 Me: 0 ..Through my experience it was necessary to find a community that could help and luckily I found this place. ..So if you're struggling now keep coming by. Keep reading join the chat the people there are amazing and can assist you. But the key to any of it is to listen. ..The next section I'll talk about my routine for self-care and what I fail and keep retrying to do to stay on my path. ..RESOURCE SECTION PLACE!..The TED talk that I learned about the opposite of addiction is connection is from Johann Hari. Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong. ..I think it's important to check it out and hear what they have to say. It opened my eyes to the need of personal connection. YouTube has the video I'd link it but I don't know what the rules are on links. ..Have a wonderful day and stay strong!.

Thanks for sharing this. Good words. I am looking for connection and SD has been a great start! I need some connection IRL too but I'll figure that out in time.
Congratulations on Your impending Sober Solar Circumnavigation!
