I feel like this sub is really helping me stay on track. I just read my older posts and comments with this account. For the past 2 years sometimes when I felt cornered by my own thoughts and behavior relating to alcohol(ism) I resorted to r/stopdrinking. These posts show there were previous attempts they show I've relapsed for months at a time. BUT. What they don't show is that I drank less everytime I started up again and with the exceptions of some unnecessary peeks of sudden drunkenness (showing I won't ever be in control with alcohol) I've been slowing down in general and after my last hangover that had just passed exactly 7 days ago I realised I've been slowly crawling out of that mental state. This doesn't mean I've somehow magically cured myself but I do think I've crawled out of it in such a way that it doesn't seem that bad or that hard to not drink at all. Even better: it feels like what I should be doing. It feels right. I don't feel like I'm depriving myself this time. I want to feel healthy do well at work enjoy my brainspace get drowsy off some tea. Things that actually feel good. For real. For longterm. Thank you r/stopdrinking. .IWNDWYT
