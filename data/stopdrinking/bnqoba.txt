I woke up today on Mother's Day clear headed and sober. My kids rushed in to hug me and couldn't wait to give me their cards and projects from school.  My husband took them to get me breakfast and now I am reading in bed (my request when they asked what I wanted to do this morning). In years past I would have likely woken up with some level of hangover and then hit the mimosas hard - seeing Mother's Day as an excuse to start drinking in the morning. Not that I didn't regularly drink in the morning - just that I could do it in public because it was a special day. Then I would proceed to drink the day away and further numb myself from my family. Probably pass out early evening after being kind of a shit mom all day. Today I am asking for what I want. I'm taking the morning slowly and I've booked two exercise classes this afternoon. In between I'm going to go visit the lemonade stand  for moms  that my girls are putting together with my husband. I am so grateful to be sober today. And I'm not taking it for granted. Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there and much love to all of you that struggle through this day - whatever your reasons. Shine on sober friends!
