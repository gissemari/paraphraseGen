proud to say that i didn't backslide after it and i haven't had a drink since! i've gotten close but turned the other way instead and i'm just really excited about it! in the past i've never been able to resist a good relapse as i'm an idiot with no self worth or self control but goddamn it not this time

Good on ya mate!
Sounds like you have self-control and focus to me!..Well done!
      
I have never ever been able to keep a relapse short.  Good for you
Good work! I hope I can be as resilient as you someday. I usually fall hard when I relapse.
Good job!  ..Now get up in the morning and say "I do not have to drink today."..There is just no "one" since *'One is too many; a thousand never enough.'*  Having a support system with others in recovery plus remembering those phrases has kept me sober so far...
Well done!  And guess what?  You do have a bit of goddamn self control...just look at the past week.  :)  Keep it up.  
Good work. Keep it up!
Goddamn it you're doing this sober thing!  Right on!   
congrats! there were times where i'd say 'just one' and a couple days or weeks later i'd say 'well since i only had one maybe two won't be so bad' and then i'm right back into the same terrible cycle. 
I did just one glass of wine for almost 6 months every night. Cleary my moderation won. Until I clearly relapsed on month 8 and now I think I can't moderate
