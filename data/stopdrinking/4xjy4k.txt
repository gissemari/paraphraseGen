Hey r/stopdrinking.  I have been absent a lot lately however I hope to rectify that moving forward.  I think it's important...Lately I have been noticing two things: complacency and hostility.  I have been drifting away from meetings.  As of today it has been 3 weeks since my last meeting.  Whenever I go to my local meetings I get filled with these fillings of hostility and resentment towards the other members for innocuous meaningless shit.  Like annoying habits cross-talk etc. etc.  I am concerned as this was the same pattern I exhibited before my most recent relapse.  And although my sober time has been getting longer and longer between each relapse I think it reinforces the point that just because you stop drinking does not mean you are sober or living a healthy lifestyle.  Something about the way I was living in my sobriety pushed me back to the bottle.  Or I was allowing the drinking mindset to creep back in.  I feel a deep terror in my stomach thinking about waking up in the hospital but will that last forever?  How long until that terror fades and I forget?  I'm beginning to think complacency is killer.  ..I woke up this morning with plenty of things to be grateful for.  I drank coffee and worked on a puzzle.  I played a little Alien: Isolation (which is really fun btw) and then went to the lab to do some work.  I would have NONE of that if I was drinking.  But this is an easy fact to gloss over as you get some distance.  I need some grounding sometimes.  A pride check so to speak.  ..I'm rambling sorry just wanted to write this down before I forget.  And maybe somebody has some experience with this.

I had a recent time where I experienced palpable Rage directed toward family members. I didn't know what set it off but decades of repressed Anger was the source. Some deft step work over some seemingly innocuous shit involving my sister and our jacked up family dynamics solved like 75% of the weight of Dark Rage that bore down on me and I mopped the rest shortly thereafter. I told my Sponsor the whole story and he just about cried; highly emotional shit. Anyways I traced this crazy anger back to her and I discussing some family trauma we had never touched on before. It set something off in me like a crack in a pressure valve. I had to act before I cracked. Seriously I was feeling nuts but I knew it for what it was.
