I actually did it - no alcohol all weekend and I want to thank all of you for the inspiration to get that done. I was outside playing with my kids all weekend (a six year old and a three year old) and haven't exercised so much in a long long time. My arms are sore my legs are sore but I feel amazing. ..I think the linchpin for me was having my mother and father over my house for Halloween. My dad is overweight from poor diet and it scared the living daylights out of me how out of shape he is. Hearing him breathe heavily due to asthma and the excess weight was scary sad and all the other emotions in between. I have gained so much weight from drinking and the binge eating after a few hours of said drinking and I realized that if I keep going the route Im going Im going to be him. ..I have a long way to go but I want to tell anyone who is struggling that its possible to get through the first weekend. Its the little victories like this that make me feel like this change could be real if I want it to be...Thank you SD!

After a while it felt to me like the weekends actually got longer.  Basically I stopped trying to fast-forward them in my head to get to the part where I started getting drunk.  Turns out all of that family time I was trying to 'get through' was awesome.  And when I went to work on Monday I actually felt rested.  Congratulations on your NDV and I won't drink with you today!
I am stoked for you!  My weak spots are 5pm everyday (the witching hour) and weekends.  I celebrate getting through the weekends sober with chocolate!..Congratulations on your family weekend -- I'm so glad you are enjoying the time with your little ones.  The memories I have of things like playing catch in the backyard with my dad or baking cookies with my mom sort of everyday things are the best!
