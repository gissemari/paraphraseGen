I thought I would share my experience with using Naltrexone under the Sinclair Method.  For the past 27 years I have averaged the rough equivalent of 5-6 liters of 100 proof liquor per week and drank most every day...About 80 days ago I got a prescription for Naltrexone (50 mg tablets) and began taking one tablet before drinking.  Gradually I began to be able to moderate my drinking and to go days / weeks in between drinking sessions.  Now I am even able to say no to offered drinks when I am not drinking... something I have never done in my lifetime...Now I am only drinking when I go out to dinner with friends I have stopped going to bars for marathon drinking sessions and I do not drink at home...Surely I can't say that I am done with my recovery.  Nor that I have no risk of relapse.  However I am extremely satisfied with my progress and have the most positive outlook of my future that I have had in a very long time...It's not a miracle cure and I understand it's not for everyone... but I encourage anyone who wants to moderate their drinking to consider it.

That's great that it's helping you moderate. I would guess you take it for as long as want you want to continue drinking?..I've always been curious about this - since Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist and therefore takes away much (all?) of the high from drinking what is left of the experience? Is there any "kick" left to it? ..If yes do you think it's so little reward that long term moderation will still work? If no what is left of the experience to enjoy (given most of the taste for alcohol bevs is acquired and not nautral imo)?

Congratulations...One should ask...WHY was I drinking anyway?.
Congratulations and good luck; you may want to try 0% beer or apple cider for those social events
