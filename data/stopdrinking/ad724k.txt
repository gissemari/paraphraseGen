So I've decided enough is enough. I posted on here a few days ago and got some great advice. It's becoming more and more apparent that my reasons for getting sober aren't actually reasons but just excuses. Nothing can justify struggling to keep food down waking up with that feeling of dread about the night before lying and the cost of keeping this up. ..Here in the U.K. we do something called Dry January. A lot of people do it for charity or to just claim the benefits financially and health wise. So if anyone asks  Why are you not drinking  this is my reason. Yesterday was my 25th birthday and I plan on making this year a little different. ..It's been a while since I've said this but I will not drink with you today  ..https://alcoholchange.org.uk/get-involved/campaigns/dry-january

Happy birthday! That's a nice gift to give yourself. .I hear you on the justifications to keep drinking.  I've made so many excuses after drinking myself sick... so that I could drink again.
