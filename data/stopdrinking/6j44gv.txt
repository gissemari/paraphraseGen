It's peaceful I dont have anxiety where I have to account for my unpredictable behavior. I have quit enough times before where I know what attempting to moderate leads to. I moderate successfully for a few weeks or months I become convinced I have drinking under control. Then I start to binge I get worried but im deep in the cycle of drinking so I keep on then a really scary binge with with real life consequences occurs where I come back to SD pledging sobriety and swearing off drinking. .I honestly am done with the cycle I actually talked to people about my drinking and really faced the reality that sometimes life sucks. Life isnt a party it never was. The fact that religion exists is proof that humans are trying to find a reason for life the reason behind the struggle and the meaning to it all. The story of a man getting crucified resonates with 2 billion people even if you dont believe it the numbers say something abt this life; Life is a struggle and you need your faculties rather than numbing it and causing more problems on top of it all. .anyway hey everyone have a nice day lol

I heard a good Buddhist story. Everyone gets shot with one arrow. That's life. The rest of the arrows are self-inflicted. 
I can relate to alot of that. Moderating has never worked for me long term. Alcohol just isnt worth it anymore! 
And some people probably pretend to believe it when deep down they really don't. "Tiger got to hunt. Bird got to fly; Man got to sit around and wonder 'why why why?' Tiger got to sleep bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand." -Kurt Vonnegut
