I had cravings and I finally gave in. And damn it totally wasn't worth it. .Alcohol now tastes bad to me. What I used to drink all the time now just disgusts me. It was really weird because I didn't expect to have that reaction. .I had three drinks. I was about to drink my fourth but then threw it down the drain. My sobriety has helped me realize I'm depressed and drinking just made it worse.I had a headache. Alcohol exacerbated the pain..I fell asleep at a reasonable time and now I'm awake at 3 am with chills heart palpitations and feeling suffocated. ..Y'all. This ain't worth it. If you have cravings you're going to be struggling. Sobriety gave me good sleep mental clarity great health. Take it from someone who gave up too early when I should've been stronger. I guess I'm back to square one. IWNDWYT.
