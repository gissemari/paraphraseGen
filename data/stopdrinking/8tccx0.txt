I had almost 60 days earlier this year but have been on a cycle of relapses since April. I end up sober for a few days but then go back to binging. ..I'm having a hard time remembering how I felt during those 60 days.   I mean I remember feeling good but I can't really remember appreciating it. ..I am going to commit to 10 days and take stock on how I feel after. I'm pretty much writing it out for accountability. Thanks for listening. ....

Good luck! I started with 30 days and now I am holding out until I loose 20 pounds. Hopefully I will just keep it going but I take it one day at a time. IWNDWYT 
Keeping a journal is a great way to preserve those feelings. The brain likes to trick you into forgetting how great being sober feels. Strangely enough memories of drinking and being drunk when you are sober always seem better than the reality.
One day at a time is all it takes. I will not drink with you today.
