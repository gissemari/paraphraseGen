From the outside I (22/M) have strong sobriety. Going to meetings chairing a meeting this month and talking with my sponsor actively. But a little voice in the back of my head is saying  you're too young for this sh*t you don't have to drink but you can definitely smoke weed. ..It doesn't help that I recently cut off a relationship because I have been craving getting high with this person far too long. In the conversation he told me  I may stop drinking eventually but I don't see myself ever stopping smoking. Is smoking completely off the table?  And this question baffles me. I want to smoke way more than I want to take a drink but isn't this program about so much more than simply stopping? Isn't it about wanting to grow better myself and live a life free from mind-altering substances and needing to escape?..As a member of AA I am doing what I'm told and reaching out to fellow alcoholics. Throughout all the frustration I also wanted to leave a post here and see if anyone can relate. ..Most importantly I will not drink with you today. Thank you for reading.

Addiction whack-a-mole. It's easy to justify a toke here and there. After all it's not booze! But weed is just another way to numb out-in my opinion. I oscillated between weed and booze for years before deciding I wasn't going to use these substances to float away. Weed made me unmotivated anxious broke inattentive lazy and just as willing to engage in risky behavior as booze was. For a lot of addicts it's an addiction like any other.  
I struggle with this so much. I have spent a lot of money on weed but it's mostly brought me so much joy and good sleep. I'm trying to keep it to after 7 pm right now. I feel like comparing the two substances and lumping them together is crazy but I'm very new to all of this. I will say that sometimes when I get too high I feel the need to drink to calm my anxiety so thats something to consider....
