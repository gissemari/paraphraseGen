This weekend I will be around a lot of drinking. I went out last night with 6 girlfriends and they all had drinks and I didn't have one single temptation or feeling of being left out. It's strange my one and only struggle is with my husband.  Even when I'm around my family and they drink I don't care and I'm not tempted. My husband has quit 100 percent with me this time around. He is a very casual normal drinker but in support of me our house is AF and he hasn't drank at all. We have a weekend long reunion/ Christmas party to attend.  I'm sure he will have a few this weekend and I'm ok with that...but my lizard brain says...wouldn't it be fun...Well I come back with all the answers of why it wouldn't be fun and the list is long. I love my husband and we have fun together alcohol won't enhance something that really doesn't need to be enhanced...I learned that when I tested the waters 6 months ago. I have a plan backed up with a plan with that plan backed up with more ideas. Lol it's like I've over packed my sober toolbox for this weekend. I'm going to enjoy the countryside wake up early and sit by the river while the dogs play I'm going to try my hardest to enjoy this side of the family and I will 100 percent absolutely not drink. I've got this!  Happy sober Friday everyone . If you have any parties that you can't get out of this weekend make sure you over pack!!!!
