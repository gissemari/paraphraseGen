Long story short and without getting into too many personal details... October was a rough month for me. I was tempted to drink many times but stayed strong. It was a struggle at times but I feel so much more empowered by it! I'm so proud of myself that I was able to overcome the obstacles with a clear mind. Just felt like sharing. Have a great day everyone! :)

Congratulations! That's so great to hear! (Not that October was rough just that you got through it ok of course!)
Welcome to November it's proud of your strength in making it through October and so am I! 
That's fantastic! Again not that you had a bad month - but that you actively chose not to make it that much worse. Congratulations!
You got this!..I had a bad event happen in Nashville last year.  Next morning when I work up... I decided I had enough. I told myself I would go a year without drinking and did it.  ..It was tough the first 90 days.  ..Now I just don't indulge like I use to and stay away from Fireball!..
