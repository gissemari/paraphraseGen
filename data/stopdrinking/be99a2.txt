First off I want to give credit where credit is due. Without Reddit this sub and the redditors that inhabit it. I would not have ever made it past the first week. This sub is a priceless resource in maintaining my sobriety. Not only do all your successes and failures allow me to learn about this challenge and allow me to reflect on myself. It simply allows me to know that I am not alone in this and that the benefits of sobriety far outweigh the discomforts. For that I am forever indebted to you all to continue to post here in hopes that my successes and struggles will help someone out there. Even if its just one person. That being said many of you have actually messaged me saying you enjoy my posts and requested that I update with some reflections on my current situation. However I replied that I was holding out until 90 days but I just realized I will be on a cruise heading to the Bahamas. So below I'm going to post a few things I've come to know or experience in the past few weeks.   ..- Sobriety is not a magic bullet that will make your life constant sunshine and rainbows... I'll say it one more time for the people in the back. SOBRIETY IS NOT A MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE CONSTANT SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS! but...Sobriety will elevate your emotional constant mitigate mood swings and allow you to be ten times more level headed thoughtful and equipped to deal with the bullshit that life throws at you. ..    I feel like I'm writing this right now because I feel like this is a major misconception about sobriety. Well at least a major misconception I had. I thought when I stopped drinking everything was going to be perfect and everything was going to fall into place. But that just isn't the truth.. The truth is you're not going to be running at 100% 100% of the time. That just isn't normal. While your emotional constant will be much higher and you do have more energy you will still experience the normal dips in energy and mood. Your negative ass co-workers that were miserable before you stopped drinking will still be dreadful to deal with You'll still have to deal with the daily grind of work You'll still have to pay bills and deal with unexpected expenses. But you won't be hungover and you'll be so much more clearheaded and emotionally stable when shit does suck. Basically when you stop drinking you'll still have all the problems that weren't directly related to drinking but you'll be way better off to deal with them. ..        Why stop then if your life is still going to be a dumpster fire anyways even though you'll be clearheaded and emotionally stable right?! Well I have a million reasons relating to this exact topic. But for the sake of readability of this post and keeping your attention I'll name my top one that I have noticed...      I'll start with part of the last sentence two paragraphs up.  I said "Basically when you stop drinking you'll still have all the problems that weren't directly related to drinking"  If you read into that sentence You'll realize something beautiful about it. You may still have a bunch of issues when you stop but NONE OF THEM will be alcohol related! No more being hungover No more drunken mistakes or embarrassment No more breaking the law while under the influence no more detriment to your health so much money saved. The list goes on and on but basically what I'm getting at in a nutshell is the act of not drinking will immediately improve your life whether or realize it or not. You will not be working from a deficit. Life is hard enough as is without starting your day in the hole. If someone told you you can immediately improve all aspects of your life while not spending time or money would you do it? Of course you would! ...- Making the decision to not drink has compounded into multiple good decisions. ..The above has held true for me at least. Since I've quit drinking as I've stated above and in prior posts. There is a mental clarity and focus that comes with sobriety that cannot be achieved with booze brain. It allows you to look at your own life and be objective about it and in turn allows your to really see yourself and things for what they really are. While you're drinking your priorities are way out of line and your focus is literally out of whack (occasional blackouts and impaired thought processes). That being said I found for myself and I'm sure this experience isn't unique to me at all but you find that you've been neglecting a lot of parts of your life that you would have never realized were neglected.. Two major examples below...Decided to start working out and eat healthy again...Holy fuck this one is huge. I would have never been able to do this while I was drinking for many reasons. Mainly because while I was drinking I was always hungover (try exercising hungover..). All the empty calories just hindered any of my goals so basically I was going for no reason. I was super inconsistent due to the fact that even if I managed to not drink for more than a day I would spend the weekend getting shitfaced and not want to go back to the gym until midweek because I was so hungover. Even if I was killing it in the gym I was eating like shit because I would never meal prep. I would sleep like shit every night because I would stay up late drinking and fall asleep drunk. On top of all of that I just never really had time to hit the gym or meal prep because any spare time I had would be spent getting drunk!..Now that I'm sober I get to the gym 5 days a week minimum because I have the time. I get up early in the morning and do some cardio before work. I meal prep twice a week to make sure I am eating right. I haven't looked and felt this good in ages. I don't think I've ever been this lean before. My fianc  definitely has noticed which spices up things. Women and Men have been noticing which is flattering. I feel incredible. It would have never happened if I had been drinking. ..I'm enrolled in College again. ..When I was drinking I tried to go to college because while I have a good job I could make so much more money if I had a degree but ultimately that failed after two semesters due to the fact that I didn't have the tenacity or focus to keep it up. Part of me felt I was in over my head. I was more focused on going out to the bar and partying. ..Now that I'm sober I realized I am more than capable of doing it I just lacked the focus originally and the time due to the fact I was always drinking. ..- Everyone has noticed something has changed for the better even though I haven't really announced I've stopped drinking!..I've gotten more compliments in the past three months than I probably have in the past 5 years! People definitely have also been acting differently around me in a much more positive way. People definitely notice consciously or subconsciously when you start making good choices in your life..I think this is largely due to the fact that when you quit drinking your health improves which in turn improves your mood and appearance which improves the overall vibe you give off....Outside of the above obviously quitting drinking can hold its challenges otherwise there would be no alcoholics in the world. That being said one thing I've encountered that I've personally found particularly challenging has not necessarily been the addictive pressures of not drinking but the social pressures. .While I've never had an instance where I've had someone be outright rude about my abstinence I've had a few instances where I've been out with friends and I've had people be pretty insistent that I have a drink and if not interrogate me as to my reason for not drinking. Generally in these situations my defense has either been to say its for my fitness or to outright make a joke about it. These situations haven't really been hard to navigate largely do to the fact that I haven't even been craving alcohol. I've generally been dancing around telling anyone that I'm done drinking forever outside of my fianc . The troubling  few instances have been where I've had family members and people close to me that I don't necessarily feel comfortable explaining my abstinence to say stuff along the lines of "It's been forever since you've drank!.. How long you going to keep this up for?" etc etc while other family members and close friends have been intuitive enough to realize I'm probably not ever going to drink again..  I don't really know how to handle these situations yet because I don't necessarily feel comfortable explaining the complexities of alcoholism and being a sober drunk to someone that has no understanding of it or even an understanding that I did have a drinking problem to begin with  yet every time the question comes into play the askers have been more and more persistent. Not really sure how to deal with this...I'm open to advice there! Hope you guys enjoyed reading this!..IWNDWYT
----------immediate responses--------

When you get on your cruise check to see if they have  Friends of Bill W  on their social calendar. These are generally open 12 step meetings which may help you if you find yourself needing sober people to talk to.
That post is very inspiring. Judging from the number of posts I  have  read about what to say  about not drinking  there is no correct answer. For me I  just say I'm on the wagon.  I sometimes  say I am waiting for everyone to catch up to me.  But we live in a booze soaked world . I think there are a lot more of your acquaintances with drinking problems than you realise
