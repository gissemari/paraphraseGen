I'm getting 30 days this time. I had over 20 in July. Almost 14 until last Thursday. Relapses have been short but I'm tired of them. I've felt weak anxious and brain fogged for the last two days. It's finally starting to break...Still I'm making progress and I hadn't been making progress before July. I'll remind myself of my most recent lessons today: ..Coffee- don't have too much.  Coffee can lead to agitation and agitation leads to wanting depressants. One small cup in the morning is fine. More will lead to feeling irritated...Complacency- after a full week I start to feel great! Anxiety is non-existent consistent gym waking up easily sleeping well. This is a new one as I never used to make it more than 4-5 days. You're not out of the woods after a week! I quickly forget there ever was a problem. Seems obvious but our minds will do their gymnastics... I need to spend time here every day to remind myself...Anyone else up for 30 days? One at a time...&amp;#x200B;

Yes! I want 30.. and hopefully then some. I know what your mean about your mind doing it's gymnastics. This is what I think happens to me too.. so this time I am coming on here 5-15 times a day as required! It's definitely helping me stay vigilant and not forget why I need sobriety.. good luck mate.

I am very similar to you. Even on day 2 after 17 days of non drinking.  Getting my gym time in everyday consistently killing it is such a great feeling way better than what alcohol can do for you...&amp;#x200B;..Im down for 30 and beyond..&amp;#x200B;..IWNDWYT
