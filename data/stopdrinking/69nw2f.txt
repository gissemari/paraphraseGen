Managed five days but drank on Saturday. It's Sunday morning now and I have a hangover. Today will be what I call a 'zero day'--basically I do nothing but struggle through. That's the longest I have been alcohol-free for years. I enjoyed my week. Can't say I was suddenly overflowing with new-found energy. However I did do a couple of things that otherwise I might not have bothered to. I started to feel a bit like a me that I haven't known for a while. I am encouraged to go for six days (or more) this week. It's too hard for me to decide I will never drink again but I need to break the cycle whereby it's normal to drink too much very frequently. I have to take it one day at a time being resolute to dodge the point at which I expose myself to the opportunity to drink e.g. stopping at the supermarket on the way home etc.

One day at a time. Nice work on 5 days in a row! You can do it!
Five days is a great start. I'd encourage you to try some new activities or visit some new places. Doesnt have to be anything major for me just taking a walk in a different part of town or driving a back route home. So far I get what you mean about the new found energy lacking but what I found is more of a calm state of mind. It will be worth it each day you get further from the last drink. you'll get stronger and you'll feel proud of yourself as you flair grows. .
