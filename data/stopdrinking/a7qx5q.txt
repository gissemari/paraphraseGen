Not drinking today.  My struggles have been alcohol but to a larger degree porn.  Such a struggle and sometimes I feel like God must love me because I refuse to give up.  I've taken to putting on soft music and lighting a candle and copying a Psalm it's a soothing activity.  Today was Psalm 7 and I watched myself write "Judge me O Lord according to my righteousness according to my integrity".  My integrity is BAD.  Alcohol and porn have both been secretive.  Pieces of my life all around me keep falling apart stress is very high.  As I watched myself write that I wondered if God will help me with peace if I can actually work on my integrity harder.

Same here. We are here together with God. 
&gt;I wondered if God will help me with peace...Luke 6:37 -  Do not judge and you I'll not be judges.  Do not condemn and you will not be condemned.  Forgive and you will be forgiven."
The good thing is that the Bible says that God is for us not against us. His desire is for us to have a future and hope not destruction. Just continue to press on and fight the good fight
