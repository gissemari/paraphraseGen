Hello all! I have read *This Naked Mind* and just finished *Girl Walks Out of a Bar* yesterday. I really enjoyed *Girl Walks Out of a Bar* because it talks about her personal struggles and thoughts more than just a "don't drink and here's why..." book. ..Any suggestions for me?

Blackout by Sarah Hepola
There is a huge list in the side bar - https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books..I've read nearly every memoir Amazon sells on alcoholism - Drunk Mom is a good one.  
I don't know if it's okay to do some self promotion but I just put my book up on Amazon -- http://a.co/hHY9cUq. I talk about how I used running as my tool to stop drinking. ..Another memoir I enjoyed was Dry by Augusten Burroughs. 
I'll check it out! Thanks. 
10% Happier by Dan Harris  not specifically about not drinking but helps with the causes for our drinking. Funny and well-written too.
