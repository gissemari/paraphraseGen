&amp;#x200B;..I don't have a lot to say tbh I just want to make this sort of as a reminder to myself of what I'm committing to. The reason for the 2 years is I cannot comprehend quitting forever even though logically i know I need to. I am hoping that will change through the next 2 years though.  I am absolutely sick to death of how shitty alcohol makes me feel the next day and all the stupid things i've done while drunk and am ready to change right now. I also hope anyone else who is struggling can find the strength to make a change. "cheers"

Even committing to one month was too hard for me to consider. Now I have 2 months sober for the first time in over a decade but I'm still taking it one day at a time...You can do it I will not drink with you!
I'm here to tell you that it's possible no matter how weak you might feel in the first days/weeks/months. Also you don't have to make a decision on  forever  right now. In fact you never have to make that decision. When you get to 2 years you might feel that this is your lifestyle now and you're not fighting anymore to make the decision not to drink.
