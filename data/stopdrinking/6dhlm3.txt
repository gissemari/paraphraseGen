So here's an interesting turn of events....I met a girl and went to visit her in Poland got drunk had a fight ended up in hospital now I'm lying here in her house been in bed for 2 days....What have I learned yes I shouldn't drink and yes I should stay away from relationships can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want one anyway so much hassle...btw the fight wasn't with her some guys so I look worse for wear...

Yep.  I've broken the no relationships within the first you too and relapsed as well.   Chalk it up as a learning experience and get back to basics.   Worked for me.  
That's a shitty situation you have there in Poland.  I'm sorry to hear of your troubles and I hope you get right back on track with your sobriety.  You now have additional "data" to draw upon whenever you feel the urge to drink as do I because you posted your story.  Thanks.  I wish you a speedy recovery and I will abstain from drinking with you today. 
I'm glad you're back; many don't make it. It sounds like you'll be ok and that a few bumps and bruises have helped you learn. Stay in touch!
I relapsed after 7.5 months and I know the shitty feeling. Just start over immediately and get back to what worked for you for those 7 months. I won't drink with you today.
You only drank once in 7 months. That's amazing. Just keep going and don't look back.
Welcome in Poland. You learned something you will be wiser next time. 
Well proud of you for being on the thread. I know this sucks but it sounds like you're choosing to take away insights from this situation. Best of luck and I won't drink with you today. 
Well good job at getting back on the wagon.  Hope you're not hurt too badly.  I will not drink with you today.
