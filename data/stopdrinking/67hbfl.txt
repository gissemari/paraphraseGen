So I have been sober for 22 whole days. It feels good to know that when I go to bed at night I will only be "normal groggy" in the morning and not "hungover miserable." In terms of cravings I never really had them but I did have habits. Glass of wine at the end of the day. Beer out with friends. I know because I am new to this racket and was a normal/almost never drinker for the last 20 years that no one cares if I drink or if I don't. (In my experience only other people wrestling with their own addictions make a fuss if you don't drink with them.) So I don't feel social pressure to drink. The thing I struggle with is never being able to leave my own head space. Never being able to dull the edges again (and I have a lot of edges people!). As a type A workaholic it's hard for me to relax. A glass of wine was good for that. Sober is great but I am sort of bummed I can never be a normal drinker again. Sigh. Yoga and meditation it is. And maybe kickboxing. :-)

I hear ya....I feel the same way. I wasn't socially drinking and there'd be no pressure on that end. It's overwhelming at times to think my brain will always be "on". I've found swimming &amp; the sauna afterwards helps me turn my brain off. ..I also try to remember that in the end the booze was causing most of the stress....not helping me dull it. I am bummed that I crossed over that line of being a normal drinker. But at this point it's like cursing the darkness. There's just no point. I won't drink with you today!
