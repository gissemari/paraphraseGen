I seem to have really mellowed with my attitude to relapsing and I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing.  When I started trying to quit I would seriously reprimand myself for drinking and see it as a huge failure and I think that I needed that to get me to stay sober at all.  However when I did relapse I would go into a self-destructive spiral of drinking really heavily and feeling really bad about doing so.  ..But now I have gotten mostly sober and I no longer drink in every single situation where it is possible but occasionally I will relapse and when I do I will usually drink everyday for 4 or 5 days - not crazy reckless drinking just drinking steadily more than most would but not as much as I used to.  And then I get sober again and I don't feel really awful for having relapsed just a bit disappointed. And the biggest motivator now is that I look back on the relapse and can see the contrast of what I did when i was drunk and what I would have done better if I was sober. ..Is this a good development or is this attitude likely to make me slide back into full blown drinking? Probably your advice will be "whatever works best for you" but anything more concrete would be nice.  ..Summary: Should I be really hard on myself for relapsing or more relaxed

I'm pretty sure that I would die an alcoholic's death if I got comfortable with the idea of relapse. I have no illusions about my condition. Right or wrong it seems to be  working for me.

Do you want to quit drinking?..Are you okay with relapsing...do you know it's inevitable? Have you given up? How do you safeguard yourself? Are you in a program of recovery?
I believe the moment I took interest with this subreddit indicated I may have a problem with alcohol. The **Alcohol Assessment Test** linked in the sidebar gave a prognosis. Answering any of the questions other than Never No 1 or 2 means I am not a responsible drinker. Scoring Level 4 the most severe level is supports the notion that I must never drink again. Most recently I thought I had moderation on lockdown but unsurprisingly got worse and worse...&gt;...when I did relapse I would go into a self-destructive spiral.....You've touch the death spiral before you watch out when playing with fire. Just because life is allowing a moderate drinking experience right now does not mean ol' Mr. Spiral won't just let himself back into your life.  ..
I don't know you and thus can't comment on your situation personally.  I am happier without drinking.  I refuse to go back tk who I was.  My drinking hurt me and those around me.  I lost a wife to drinking.  She was a saint that put up with it for years until I broke her spirit.  So if drinking is what you want go for it.  For me drinking was only negative from my first drink to my last.  You will only find your path within.  Only you know hat is right for you.  Best of luck in your search for answers.
