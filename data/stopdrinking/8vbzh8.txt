Hi all...early days for me (again) and if I wasn't visiting the site and reading all your struggles and successes I might of given in tonight ...purely because of habit - nothing happening just the urge to absentmindedly fill my evening with temporary relaxing of a glass followed by hours of regret.  I won't have a glass thank you for sharing your experiences good and bad they really do help.

Thanks for your support earlier on. We have nearly got through today! I have done very little but rest today so sad to be missing out on the lovely weather. Let's keep strong and hope tomorrow will be better for us. 
Congrats on two days down.  Keep on keeping on.  IWNDWYT
