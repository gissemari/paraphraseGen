I've been here before. I've done this before. Best I ever did was 190ish days. The last relapse started like any other. A sip here. A drink there. A binge because it's vacation. A 3 day blackout bender because it's my birthday. The last one was while I was alone! I'm so tired of feeling sick and being stuck in my head thinking about drinking. Being a zombie at work. Not knowing what I want out of life. I have been reading  Alcohol Explained.  It makes a lot of sense. It's a relief to make the decision to just stop. I'm want to celebrate NYE and go to Vegas sober. (Trip already planned) Honestly I don't know if I even believe that but I really want to. It's just such an odd thing to even consider at this stage.

Welcome back. ..I like to keep in mind the sunk cost fallacy around things like your Vegas trip. It's easy for me to get caught in "well it's planned and paid for" but that money is already spent whether I go and risk another episode or not...Right now my sunk cost issues surround an old truck I can't seem to part with. I keep making the decision to put more into it based on all the money I already put into it which is dumb I know but somehow I find it so easy to forget.
There is plenty of other things to do in Vegas besides drink.  So much cool stuff to see Lake Meade Hoover Dam Mount Charleston........
