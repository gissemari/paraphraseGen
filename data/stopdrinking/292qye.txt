After a very successful 8 year career in the United States Navy I have decided get out. The choice basically came down to family or Navy for me it wouldn't be possible to truly dedicate myself to both...This it seems has also become my decision between drinking or sobriety. .I'm currently on separation leave from the Navy and am getting reacquainted with civilian life. While the transition hasn't been easy alcohol was making it even more difficult...I've stopped drinking because if I chose my family over the Navy than I need to choose them over the booze. When I drink I am a ticking time bomb and if I don't stop now and something catastrophic happens (DUI ruined relationships decreased health and lowered motivation) I would ALWAYS look back to the moment I relapsed and wonder why I EVER started again...Stay Strong and Stay Sober r/StopDrinking.

Thank you for your service; now let's get sober together!
Welcome BluePatriot. When you say you can't truly dedicate yourself to both the family versus Navy it sounds like a difficult choice but one you can live with. When you say the same about dedicating yourself to family versus booze that sounds like a no-brainer. Good that you can see that so clearly. ..What are your plans for stopping if that is your plan?
