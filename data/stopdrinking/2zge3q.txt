Woot Woot Wednesday! Happy Hump Day folks! And even better from our perch on this hump we can see the awesome /SD group in the March Madness tournament! We can win prizes and stuff! [Join the /SD group here - and GOOOO sports teams!](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2z6qt3/join_the_sd_group_in_the_2015_march_madness/)..But for now let's hump it out. Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below. Let's talk about it!..**Triumph**: I've been rocking the whole "being a functional contributing adult" thing lately. I'm doing some important volunteer work helping out some friends in crisis and still managing to perform well at work each day pay my bills clean my house and brush my teeth. It's humbling to remember how hard (read: impossible) this was for me 8 months ago. I'm enjoying living a life full of win right now because of my sobriety...**Struggle**: See above. Sometimes when I'm a roll of good things I try to sweep the bad things under the rug thinking I'll just deal with them later. Even though so many things are going well in my life there are things that aren't. And I still have to deal with them. And I still don't necessarily have the tools to do so. This is where therapy and friends (and /SD) come in. 7+ months of sobriety didn't erase all the maladaptive behavior patters I spent ten years reinforcing and it does me no good to pretend otherwise. So I'm working on that this week. ..**General Chat**: How was everyone's St. Patrick's Day? Like a lot of us the day wasn't very special for me in the past mostly because I drank at absurd levels every day of the year. It's nice to pass these milestones sober and add another brick to my sober wall. . .So how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

**Triumph:** I'm *finally* getting my home network sorted out. I can now start a movie in the livingroom through my watch when on the toilet. I'm a techie so that's completely useless but very nice. Over the years I've collected loads of gear but never had the drive to set it up. In the same vein I'm very far into cleaning my apartment. Further than I've been in years. I have other problems in life besides drinking but giving up on the bottle gives me focus to deal with them instead of chasing the next buzz. ..**Struggle:** I feel completely drained of energy. From my usual schedule I've increased my activities by around tenfold. Didn't take much since I wasn't doing much gone from 10 minutes of activities a day to around 2 hours spread over an entire day. I'm also struggling with my own efficiency. Having been in high-stress jobs I compare my efforts to an efficient machinery operating at and demanding 100%. When I give my all it still seems like laughable little even when I know there's more to my situation than mere laziness...**General Chat:** Well I did chat to my mothers cousins husband the other day. He used to be a general about 10 years ago. He retired due to a major incident his wife who was a major retired so he took out early retirement. Other than that nothing much. I'm focusing on sorting out my house at the cost of being social with the few friends I got or generally going outside. A self imposed exile from the world if you want. Pretty much sleeping eating cleaning and procrastinating...I like cleaning it gives me near instant gratification.
uh oh... [guess what day it is???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwrstxuicZk)...  ..[It's join the basketball  pool day!](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2z6qt3/join_the_sd_group_in_the_2015_march_madness/)..woooWOOOO!
**Triumph:** this is the longest I've been sober in at least 3-4 years of feeling helpless to stop. Feels great!..**Struggle:** I cannot focus at work. I thought this would improve but I just can't stay on task lately. Part of it is that I get paid to be creative and I've had a creative block since before I quit but man. Its bad...**General:** I'm apartment hunting for the first time in my life. Why are some of these  managers so hard to get a hold of?!
This is my third March Madness thingy. I have no idea what I am doing. ..**Triumph** Semester is less than a month away from completion. I love being in Toronto!..**Struggle** 8 assignments 8 exams in the next month. FML...**General chat** Coconut bubble tea. Love.
**Triumph:** I'm almost at three months of sobriety! I've been more mindful more spiritual and more in tune with the world around me. I'm working hard to stay positive! ..**Struggle:** I bought a bike on Friday and it was stolen on Monday. =( But I didn't drink and that's what matters. I can't see my therapist until next week so that's rough but I'm dealing well. ..**General:** Members of AA how many meetings a week do you go to? I only go to one and I'm doing alright in my sobriety... Am I  doing it horribly wrong? Does it matter as long as it's working for me? 
[deleted]
**Triumph:** Waking up sober every day...**Struggle:** I dunno everything is feeling like a struggle lately. I'm hitting a rough patch. I don't even know what's going on exactly ... I just feel emotionally explosive like at any minute I'm about to either burst into tears or start screaming at someone. Except I'm a very reserved person so I don't do those things and it's been sort of festering for several weeks now. My therapist suggested I make an appointment with a psychiatrist and I found this very upsetting. I know how immature this response is but I just feel like ... why do other people just get to be happy and normal? ..**General chat:** Yesterday was my 32nd birthday. I had a nice day spent a few hours at the gym relaxed at home with the dogs went out for a fancy dinner with my girlfriend. I expected that we'd encounter a lot of public drunkenness but I think my fellow Chicagoans may still be recovering from Saturday.
**Triumph**: After a bit more than 2 weeks of daily drinking I can finally embrace my intelligence again and give full performance in college. One big group project an essay and a test have suffered from my drinking but I am finally getting back on track. ..Besides that I'm also back at a healthy diet and exercising daily again. ..**Struggle**: I'm seeing this girl and kinda jealous when she's doing stuff with this one guy whom she had feelings for in the past although she told me she doesn't have feelings for him anymore but she has feelings for me. They act really close-ish and stuff but he acts like that with every girl in my peer group even though he has a girlfriend. I'm not sure if I'm being an idiot there or not. ..**General Chat**: Ups and downs really feeling good and confident with myself also looking forward to going to Belgium with my college class next week. Kinda depressed right now. ..
**Triumph:** I am killing it at life lately.  I am doing good sobriety work good therapy work reaching out to people helping people and being social.  i am also just generally saying YES more.  And I am making amazing fucking jewelry in my class and I am loving every second of it...**Struggle:**  There's some shit going down at work.  It doesn't directly affect me but eventually it will.  Not sure how things will play out but my SOP is to be nosy pry and selfishly try to manipulate nay and all happenings and conversations so I look the best and stay the safest.  This time I am going to try to mind my own fucking business and just do my work and be the awesome person I know I am. But FUCK this is not my nature and it is HARD. ..**General Chat:** I do nothing for holidays.  My kid was the only one not in green and when they showed him that the milk was green and the toilet water was green he was all "Um.  Why?  That's gross." I dunno I am calling it a win.
**Triumph:** Tomorrow I will be 30 days sober very close to beating my record. I've managed to make it this far. .**Struggle:** Can't shake the feeling of being angry towards my sobriety. I don't know why but I get mad about the fact that I can't drink. Doesn't shift my determination just makes me act bitter sometimes which is hard to watch. Physically I'm pretty banged up right now. Things aren't really going well in general for me from being stressed and tempted out of my mind some nights to my mother being ill and my best friend suicidal. This has been such a hard time for me. ...**General chat:** Nothing to report for St. Patrick's day stayed sober. Went to dentist and then went to the doctor. Turns out I have a strained ligament in my groin which hurts a good deal. Due to stress levels I cried for a bit and then ate ice cream samdwiches and proceeded to fall asleep. 
Triumph-made it through a really busy week Wednesday-Wednesday. Got another one coming..Struggle-serious issues at work at home everywhere. I would so just love some peace..General-Was glad to get through St. Patty's day sober as well though I just always used it as a drinking excuse..
**Triumph:** I'm doing pretty well being present and centered. I'm not on an emotional swing set more like a rolling road...**Struggle:** Relationships. My wife is tired overwhelmed stressed out and angry. I'm not the cause of *all* of it but I do receive all of it. Pointing out the cognitive distortions and total bullshit in what she says doesn't help. Being quiet because anything I say is wrong doesn't help. Stepping up and doing more does helps but slowly and not obviously. Rant over.....**Chat:** Anybody got suggestions for resources on communicating better within a relationship? As far as St Pats my wife will only eat meat well-done so I felt my corned bison was a little tough last night.
**TRIUMPH** - Paid off Husband and I's credit debt last week!! Debt Free is awesome!! Had an amazing SOBER date at Jakes Crawfish. Very Romantic Very Awesome..**STRUGGLE** - Having surgery next week on my hand 5 pins / 8 screws and a plate. Having horrible amounts of pain as of right now.  2 of 4 kids are sick at home with croup. ..**GENERAL CHAT** I'm overdosing on baked home made chicken wings right now. nomnomnom
**Triumph:** Most of the snow has melted and there has been some warmer temperatures!..**Struggle:** I'm sick AGAIN. I've had some brutal colds this winter...**General Chat:** St. Patricks day was spent in bed sick for most of the day and at a training course at the Red Cross last night 2 more weeks until I'm a full-fledged volunteer!
Triumph - still employed and doing things ODAT :) ..Struggle - Birthday Blues/ Old age crisis ..General Chat - Went to a new meeting last night due to change in job last year.  Trying to find meetings close to work that I catch on my way home. Need a sponsor.  Haven't had once full time since moving to Texas and the steps are calling out to me "It's time."  St Pats dinner last night was at 8:00 so PB&amp;J and bed for me! 
Triumph: Paddy's day sober and I live in Dublin.Struggle: My Dad had a heart attack yesterday.General chat: Corned beef
**Triumph:** 4 weeks today!  I'm feeling very good about that. I've lost over a stone and I'm feeling good in general...**Struggle:** Went to the dentists yesterday - I have to have 2 fillings. I bloody hate fillings. ..**General chat:** All these bastards on GTA who keep joining the heist and then quitting as soon as the session has launched are making me want to start drinking again!!! /s
What's up everybody!..**Triumph**: Things are going well for me. No job yet but there are a few opportunities in the works. I absolutely crushed my first presentation to some potential investors. Felt good to get some positive feedback about that. My team would never have let me do something like that when I was drinking I was always the liability. Now I'm the go-to guy for these types of things because I'm sober!..**Struggle**: I am going out this Friday with some of my old coworkers and the rest of them are already planning to get drunk. Although they know and accept me not drinking I'm already nervous about a slip. I think the fact that I'm nervous is a good thing but also shows me that I need to stay on my guard. Thanks to SD I am already forming my plan: Dinner with team hang out with them and then get out before they get too sloppy drunk. ..**General Chat**: Filled out my bracket and for the first time in my life I am actually excited about collegiate basketball. GOoooooo team(s)! Gonzaga over Wisconsin to win. Yep. We need at least 5 more people to [sign up](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2z6qt3/join_the_sd_group_in_the_2015_march_madness/) to be eligible for the "best sub" prize. Let's show 'em how SD represents!
**Triumph:** I've gone three days the third day was St. Patrick's Day.  At first I thought I'd lock myself in but I did venture out to go to a fitness class which I enjoyed. (For those of you who might think I wouldn't walk into a bar sweaty haha incorrect.) I came home. ..**Struggle:** The urge to "reward." As I talked about in my post last night I feel like my brain is trying to trick me into drinking by telling me either that I deserve a "reward" for "being good" or that since I've gone a whopping three days without booze I must not really have a problem.  It's hard to reason with myself but I keep telling myself that my "reward" is my sobriety and all the good things I know I will accomplish with it...**General Chat:** SPD now that it's over seems pointless- and I'm part Irish and Catholic. My St. Patrick's Day was just fine with no booze. And I know today I'm much happier than I would have been had I went out drinking so I'm happy. ..Edit: formatting
Triumph: I was sober yesterday woke up sober today going to bed sober tonight. ..Struggle: Had some real terrible inner-voice self loathing today. My relapses are followed by suicidal thoughts. That's what it was Sunday today it was just more of "you're a piece of crap" record on repeat. It took a while to shut up. I kept calling it a liar. Weird huh?
**Triumph** It feels good to follow through and do what I say I'm going to do. I'm on a winning streak with that right now - all because of the work I'm doing on my sobriety...**Struggle** Tiredness and excessive consumption of diet soda that may possibly be the lamest addiction ever. But it may just be a phase. We'll see...**General Chat** Fat cat update: Since we got him two months ago he's lost .6 pounds - down to 16.6 lbs from 17.2 lbs. He's quite a large cat structurally but he's still got a pound or two to lose. I'm very proud of his progress so far though!
Triumph: Still sober! Even though this week is really stressful and the temptation to check out/have a 'mental vacation' on the booze bus is definitely there.  Not gonna drink but feel like I want to. ..Challenge: Between drinking and quitting I am way behind on time-sensitive financial stuff (not taxes but I'm behind on those too!). So I'm super stressed out and feeling like a fuck-up for not being more proactive.  It's self-created but I absolutely know that it'd be worse if I was drinking. Being an adult is a huge learning curve and I'm struggling with it right now.  I don't want my old lifestyle back I just want to check out for a 'night'. But I don't trust myself. It feels like sobriety boot camp this week. I kind of hate it right now but I know it's saving my ass. ..General chat: really into Fair Trade Chocolate lately. Theo Chocolate out of Seattle. Delicious!!
