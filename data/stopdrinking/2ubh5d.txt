I recently came upon two years of sobriety.  I owe so much to the posters and commenters of this subreddit - I don't post much myself but reading the regular stories of success and struggles have really helped me consistently reaffirm my new sober life and given me strength.  ..I went out to dinner with a group of people last night after a big job interview some I knew but most were strangers. in the past I would have jumped on this as an opportunity to drink to crazy excess justified by any number of reasons.  I very likely would have made others extremely uncomfortable all so that I could feel 'more like myself' and ok talking with them.  But one of the things i've found is that I don't need that alcohol to 'be myself' and that I can have a great time even in new/uncomfortable situations without booze. That is a gift...it just keeps getting better. thank you.
