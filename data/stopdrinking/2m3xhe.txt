I am going to i.o.p. in all of twenty minutes but figured I would make a post really quick. I am struggling with a huge amount of anxiety because of my legal trouble associated with my alcohol abuse. Tomorrow is a big day in court for me and the not knowing about what will happen is destroying me inside. I'm struggling with sever anxiety and for anyone that doesn't know... anxiety can be a very serious issue. Just as serious as depression or any other mental illness. ..For anyone struggling with serious depression or anxiety since they quit drinking get into i.o.p as well as AA SMART recovery etc... it will help. IDK what I would do without it. I really don't. ..Wish me luck. I need it.

Good luck!  I wish you the best!..I am confused though...is your badge wrong or are you headed into IOP already sober for a while?
Good luck!
Yes I have been in this situation.  I went to court almost 4 and half years ago not knowing if I was going to federal prison for 2-5 years.  I ended up going for 5 months.  At various points I was torn up inside--but I did not drink.  Not one time in all that time.  Not once.  And as a result through it all my life got better.  
I feel you. Don't project. Worrying about the future causes anxiety. Usually what you think is going to happen doesn't even come to be. Can't change nothing so deal with 1 day at a time. Good Luck !
