This is the outline of how I transitioned from sober being unimaginable to how I wanted to spend the rest of my life. On day 1 I accepted I had a problem and decided that I needed to stop drinking for *a while*. So I used that motivation to make a **plan** and to start to put it into action from day 1...**The Plan**..1. **Accountability** - I told my husband and doctor of my intention to stop drinking from TODAY...2. **Disposal** - I poured out my half-empties dug out all my empties and took them to the recycling - symbolically getting rid of them from my life...3. **Substitution** - I stocked up on herbal teas and a month's supply of sparkling water...4. **Distraction** - I decided to game read and watch Netflix to take my mind off things building up to occasional walks...5. **Mind work** - I used [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Problem-Drinking-Books/dp/1845291123) that had some cognitive behavioural tools to work through. A [cost-benefit analysis](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/library/Tools_and_Homework/Quick_Reference/CBA_Worksheet.pdf) was the most helpful tool in keeping me connected with my motivations for quitting. I read up on addiction and alcohol problems especially browsing /r/stopdrinking...6. **Diet** - I started with oatmeal for breakfast on day 1 a tradition I've kept up ever since. I resolved to eat well: plenty of greens and some protein not to over-eat or under-eat...7. **Rest** - I needed a lot of rest so took it easy and went through the motions of sleep even when sleep itself evaded me. I practiced a simple relaxation technique focusing on my breathing relaxing each part of my body from toe to head and back...Those same principles got me through the first four months I built upon them tweaked them to fit. I just wanted to put as much time between me and my last drink as possible so knuckled down to not drinking one day at a time. I set an initial goal of 30 days with stretch targets in the back of my mind. As 30 days approached I extended the goal to 60 90 120 days.  ..---..Whilst my actions led my sobriety the most important changes were the ones that happened in my head:..* I identified and exposed all my excuses for drinking for the lies that they were...* I accepted that drinking was my coping mechanism and needed to use alternative better ways of coping...* I continued to build a mental wall between me and drinking. ..* I didn't know how long I was going to quit for but I did know I just wanted to keep going and avoid relapse: I didn't know when/if I'd find my way back to sobriety I didn't want to go through (potentially worse) withdrawals again I didn't want to damage my wall...* I adopted a one-day-at-a-time approach and as part of that I wrote down 5 gratitudes and acknowledgements to keep my spirits up to notice the rewards of being sober and to help me recognise the small steps forwards I was making...* I reflected on the phrase ["It's easier to keep a lion in a cage than keep a lion on a leash."](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2k2nug/abstinence_is_easier_than_moderation/) and eventually put aside my designs on moderation...Once four months had passed I had gained confidence in my ability to live sober and accepted that being a non-drinker was necessary for me to lead a decent life. After accepting my sobriety I set about building more variety balance activity and things that matter into my life building it bit-by-bit into something worth holding on to..

This is great. Thank you.
This is brilliant thank you...
&gt; I reflected on the phrase "It's easier to keep a lion in a cage than keep a lion on a leash."[4] and eventually put aside my designs on moderation...I've always thought this was the most apt answer to the question of the possibility of moderation.
Congrats on your sobriety! I have a similar plan but need to apply Ulysse's bargain. I've noticed you don't  mention AA or anything similar. I'm living in a remote location and do not have access to external support am I understanding you've managed to get through alone (with doctor and husband) ?
This is FANTASTIC!! God I love this series!
Solid. 
On cell so short response-..Thanks for the great post. Love the lion quote. Never heard it before. Always thought I could be a moderation guy. Ah well :)
I love the idea of a gratitude journal. I am now 7 days sober and this post really helped! Thanks! Congrats on your sobriety and sharing your ideas.
