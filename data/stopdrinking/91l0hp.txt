Greetings sobernauts! So glad to be with you here on this sub. I have just completed my second sober day. Been reading posts on here which are so helpful. Went for another long walk this evening and I am ready for another restful night. Sending best wishes to you all especially those of you struggling today. IWNDWYT. :-)
