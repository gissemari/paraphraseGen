Okay so I relapsed.  HARD...I went to AA and I left to get really drunk.  And then stayed that way for a few days.  Until this morning actually...It's not that I forgot how hard it was to stop (that was only a week ago!) or that I have issues with what people are saying there... the entire situation makes me want to drink **so bad**.  ..The intensity of my cravings was finally going away and I felt great until I started going to meetings.  They got worse so I went again.  They got worse.  So of course I went again.  Multiple meetings a day.  Meeting people in between to talk about it.  Every new meeting people dropping off the "Welcome to AA!" pamphlets people wanting to talk to me about Step 1 and signs you're an alcoholic obsessing about it in spare time cancelling work to make sure I was staying sober learning about addiction.....And I don't know if it's the right thing for me to be doing or even healthy...It's not anyone in AA.  They all have something I don't have (sobriety) and I can't believe I would be special or different from them in any significant way.  They're all really supportive (in their own way. definitely some are better than others but no one is malicious at ALL) and very rarely has anyone made me feel unwelcome.  ..There's a few things about AA I'm not sure of: recovered versus in recovery the term alcoholic life having to be unmanageable in order for someone needing to get sober alcoholism as a disease...  ..I don't think me not knowing what I think should matter (the point is that everyone is there to help each other stay sober right?) but every meeting I've been to it's all I've been "talked at" about.  It's so well intentioned and I would probably do the exact same thing if I found something that worked.  No one is doing anything wrong and it must be a problem with me.  I know I'm not special and that a lot of the things I'm unsure of are very common issues...I want to go to in-person meetings and I want to make sober friends but more than anything I want to be sober.  I'm not sure that it's a healthy place for me to be right now and that really fucking sucks...So I'm restarting my counter and avoiding AA until I feel really stable about it.  They might be right about some things and they might work for some people... but for me today the most important thing I can do to guarantee I don't drink is staying away from that entire situation at all costs...I hope some day I am in a place where I can go.
----------immediate responses--------

I have heard several people say AA meetings became triggers for them. Some were in long-term sobriety and had enough of the repetition of message and the never-ending loss of members (old and new). Others didn't like the message from the start. But there was also a group who bristled because the message and the people hit too close to home...Alcoholics are generally great at isolating pushing away hating any authority figures and numbing emotions. Getting sober can be very uncomfortable but this discomfort can be very important for healing and a strong sign of what is needed. I'm not saying any of this applies to you but I would carefully examine the motivations for wanting to avoid meetings. For example is it simply what they are saying how they're saying it or is it what they're saying implies you need to do. I know I get very irritated and want to avoid people when they start "prying" too much about my life emotions and what I need to do to turn things around but they are probably right that I need to deal with them.
**The debating society was STRONG in me too.**..It made things much harder than they had to be. It argued about your issues and Godgod what do I understand????  and much more..... I too slipped and slid in the beginning - mostly because the debating society would not shut up...A prime character defect of mine is **don't tell me what to do**  developed it at two years of age never lost it.  ..To me the steps are the heart of the program and my recovery.  Drinking is really only discussed in the first step.  You might try step meetings where the focus is on the recovery (which to me is never going to be past tense as it is ongoing)  ..You might have some words with the contrary cuss who is floating around in your head  ..my belief is that if it can work for the agnostic special snowflake who was me - it can work for most everyone...good luck stay in touch
The thing about early days in recovery is that I needed to focus on is simple action not my deep thinking.  I make a deliberate conscious decision not to drink every morning--alcohol is OUT as an option all day no matter what happens good or bad.  I'm not going to rationalize and claim that someone else talking about recovery or getting sober in an AA meeting triggered me to drink--if I did I'd be calling BULLSHIT on myself because frankly that's all that that is.  Furthermore I wouldn't be using my relapse to rationalize not to go to AA or other recovery meetings because that would be supreme BULLSHIT.  People in my AA never sit around romancing drink or drinking if I had ever heard this in the nearly 30 years that I've been in and around AA I would have called the Central Office and suggested that maybe that meeting should be de-listed I certainly wouldn't have sat there like a bump on a log not objecting.  ..We get sober I got drunk.
Those are all really normal feelings.  You should find out simply what works for you.  If you take a break from AA meetings try out some professional help like therapy.  Try a new meeting or two or a different fellowship all together.  ..What works for one person won't necessarily work for another.  Those definitions you are pretty hung up on it sounds like.  To be honest for me it's all semantics.  It's irrelevant.  There are many things in the rooms I disagree with and that's ok.  The point is you need to do something different that works and keep looking until you find what it is for you...Good luck my friend.
I spent 2-3 months trying to quit before I managed 171 days.  I was lucky to string 2-3 days together in fact.  Between my wife and therapist I felt like all anyone wanted to talk about was abstaining from alcohol.  I was frustrated especially with my will power.  I was truly in a spiral...I count AA among a list of recovery tools essential to my sobriety.  That being said the absolute number one most important factor in my recovery is recovery.  If attending AA made me drink I don't think I would go.  Then again I strongly believe that if you scale down AA to the essentials working the steps with a sponsor is fundamental and everything else is supplemental.  If meetings make you drink skip the meetings but I would strongly encourage you to seek a sponsor and work the steps before you right off the program.
I also get triggered by AA meetings although only occasionally not all the time...Restlessness and irritability are huge drinking triggers for me. There are things about AA -- the program itself the people even the damn rooms and all the fake needlepoints! -- that irritate the crap out of me. It took me a while but I did finally figure out that if I go into a meeting already highly irritated or am on the verge of a highly irritable/restless state I will want to drink. So I don't go. I've also been known to walk into a meeting and then walk out if there's someone there that I know will start to irritate me the moment they open their mouth. I have also politely excused myself out of some particularly touchy meeting topics...I also have what I call my AA-meeting threshold. If I hit that threshold by going to too many meetings I start to become restless irritable and jaded by the whole process. Your schedule of meetings and other AA-related activities would have exceeded my threshold a long time ago...I keep showing up to AA because I genuinely believe in many (some?) of its principles enjoy many of the people that I meet there and want to stay sober. Also because it's free and easily accessible. You may simply need another program that better aligns with your own views on your recovery. Or a less intense AA program. Who knows? It's your recovery.
