For a while now I've known in the back of my mind that I struggle with alcohol. I can identify the cycle: go a few days or weeks without it feel comfortable to have just one beer feel depressed drink to feel better repeat repeat sober up start again...Today I felt sad. I haven't had a drink for a week and I went to buy some gin but stopped myself. And I'm proud of that it feels good because I know that stopping drinking for good is something I should do. But here's the thing: I really really don't want to...If you offered me a beer right now I would say yes. I don't know what else I could do to make myself relax (which as someone who works two jobs I really need to fucking do once in a while.) As a fairly logical thinking person in most regards this doublethink really angers me. ..What do I do? Is there a way you can turn yourself off the idea of it? Make it less attractive? Forget the taste of drink or associate it with something repulsive? Because just stopping is something I can't imagine myself doing even in the distant future

I just had to focus on the day. Day by day. I didn't *want* to quit... but it was killing me so I kind of had to. After enough days (like a 3 months worth) I started thinking about wanting a drink less and less. Now? You could not pay me enough to start drinking again because I know exactly how tough of a struggle it was to get free. Once I was free from the bottle there was no looking back. ..I know it's not the answer you're probably looking for... but it takes time. Sobriety has taught me patience is incredibly important. I didn't have *any* when I started this journey so it has been quite the lesson. ..Viewing alcohol use from the outside these days gives me motivation to stay dry. I don't like seeing my friends lose the light in their eyes over the course of the evening. Hearing them bitch and complain about hangovers highlights just how fabulous my mornings are now. Every. Morning. Just in the past few months I've known someone who has died of cirrhosis and another person who fucked up his career by getting a DUI. I don't have to worry about that shit ever again. ..That peace of mind and clarity is priceless to me. Booze has no place here anymore. In time you could be free too. Stay strong. I won't drink with you. 
I didn't/don't want to either. I absolutely love it. But when I drink even half a beer after a month of sobriety the thought of drinking and the craving bug me every day some times before I open my eyes some times every hour of the day. This binds me makes me unfree and I can't live with that. It breaks me as a person. Therefore I have to break up with my love. An unhappy breakup. So why will I make it? Because the longer I stay sober the less I miss drinking. After a few months sober I don' miss it at all. And that's when I just can - not - think  just one .
