Three times this month I've gone three days sober only to relapse the fourth day. Well I'm tired of fucking up tired of making my girlfriend miserable. If I make it four days it will be the longest in 6 years. If I make it 2 weeks it will the longest i've been sober since i'm 12 or 13. One day at a time all or nothing. Here I go.

Every single time you have relapsed has helped to get you to where you are now. ..Be kind to yourself and use the kindness to get you through the tough times which lay ahead.  In between the tough times you will feel stronger. Let that strength feed the kindness. Let the cycle continue. ..You got this. ..Friend I'll not drink with you today. 
One day at a time has really helped me... soon you'll be stacking up days like it's nobody's business. You **can** be stronger and you will! :)
