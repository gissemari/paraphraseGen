The plan was a concert. So as my boyfriend was buying the tickets I drove to the liquor store and got a six pack a bottle of vodka and some cigs. The usual night out pregame. ..Fast forward. The concert ended up selling out so he went to the gym. I called my best friend from home and we talked about old times and I drank a beer. I found myself chugging to hurry and drink before he comes home. We hangout he tells me to have fun. So I go back to the balcony finish my beer and drive back to the liquor store. Crossing my fingers it wasn't the same cashier. It wasn't. I got another six pack and some more cigs. ..I even ordered some random snack food and MORE beer. I end up throwing up for a while and he put me to bed. I have been non stop vomiting for 4 hours this morning. Now I'm in bed next to the love of my life (I hope I didn't do anything stupid last night) crying. ..This post is a reminder to me and all those struggling it's just not that fun to drink. I will not drink with you today

Ah the old buying alcohol to drink for Plan X but Plan X falls through but we drink anyway. I know that all too well. Be kind to yourself and push on.
I will not drink with you today.   
Good on you for admitting it. Those who share their stories gives others a needed reminder that it's ALWAYS an option to drink in times of enjoyment as well as difficulty. Stay strong the disease has less than 24 hours to beat you today. You have that same time plus everything you did prior to yesterday to stay sober. Win today. Nothing more nothing less.
