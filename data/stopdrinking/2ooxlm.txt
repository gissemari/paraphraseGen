So yesterday I struggled with an anxiety attack which are a trigger for me. Got through using the coping strategies I learnt here - Thanks guys you're awesome. Good news woke today feeling amazing. It's going to be a good day I can feel it. This sub is amazing and so supportive. I will not drink today and I hope wherever you are you're have a good one as well. Stay strong :)

Can you elaborate on what helped you during your anxiety attack?
Glad to hear it was a good day! 
Yikes panic attacks and chronic anxiety played a significant role in my early sobriety.  All I can do is to encourage you based on my experience that sustained sober time really improved all of these symptoms.  I haven't had anything close to that sort of issue for some years now.  Good luck.  Keep doing what you're doing.
