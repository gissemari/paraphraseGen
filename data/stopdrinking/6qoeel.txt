Hi friends. I was so happy with my progress 3 whole weeks without alcohol and drugs. But sobriety didn't solve the major problem I have: depression. ..I've been struggling with it since my teen years but just a couple of month ago I was brave enough to admit I have a problem. I've been going to the psychiatrist and she put me on meds and I'm feeling a bit better...The problem is I'm having nightmares every night. Every single night. Every day is the same: I lay down to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night after dreaming of being robbed beaten rapped possessed left alone etc. It sucks...Saturday I woke up in such a terrible mood crying my eyes out and couldn't control myself. I had whiskey and mead for breakfast drank until I passed out in the morning...Did it make me feel better? Well maybe for the first 5m but I felt like shit afterwards. Like I'm a real failure. And guest what? All those suicide thoughts I'm fighting so hard to keep away from my mind are back. These disease is a bitch. FML...Well nothing else to do except get back on track.

I have been there before. I almost hate to sleep because of the nightmares. I'm going to try journaling and meditation as I think it has to do with my anxiety...I too have struggled with depression since my teen years and congratulations for making the choice to get healthier! It took me years to see a psychiatrist and therapist...I will not drink with you today.
Not a doctor but should you report suicidal thoughts to your psychiatrist immediately? Is that a thing they need to address immediately?
