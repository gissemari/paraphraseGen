Today marks my 536th day of total sobriety from alcohol and other drugs...In years past it was sometimes a struggle to find time and money to enjoy my passion motorcycles. Between wasting money on nights at the bar junk food while I was drunk or hung over and drugs to feel better little was left to spend on my hobby...This is my first post here after lurking for a year but today when I went to buy $500 worth of new gear impulsively and change my oil and do a tune up without worrying about money or having the time to do it rather than laying in bed hung over it occurred to me how much easier sobriety has made it to enjoy my hobby...Have a nice weekend everyone and enjoy your hobbies and passions.

Wow congrats!
Liked that book. Great for you.
Hell yes!  That is a Triumph for sure (if you'll forgive the pun).  I love having the money the time and the energy for hobbies again.  Congrats. 
Sweet...What do you ride?
Great post amazing book congrats to you and thanks for the reminder of the book adding it to my list to re-read. Hugs
My favorite part about getting sober is come summer I can finally truly enjoy my passion for cars and bikes. I feel sick to my stomach all the years and weekends I wasted drunk and hungover instead of actually enjoying my weekends at the track or working on my car.
