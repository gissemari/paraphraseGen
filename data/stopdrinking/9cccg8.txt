I drank Friday night (2 beers over the evening didn't feel any buzz but definitely had disrupted sleep) and last night (enough to be tipsy/intoxicated but not drunk/very impaired or hungover). ..despite the fact that I intend not to drink at all (aside from potentially moderately on special occasions... sometime in the future) I don't see the last two nights as a failure - more a tool I can use to better understand my relationship with alcohol. I'm learning that I struggle with obsessive thoughts as much as booze itself and consciously choosing to drink a moderate amount felt healthier - in that moment - than dealing with the thought loop all evening. I didn't feel the need to get drunk and my 'fuck it' switch never flipped... probably because I was making a conscious choice rather than drinking out of anger/frustration/boredom etc. ..that being said the last two days have reaffirmed my desire not to drink. I definitely sleep better I don't sweat as much my mood is improved and my anxiety is greatly reduced when I'm consistently sober. ..I was in a great mood on Friday and having disrupted sleep after drinking meant I was tired and overwhelmed on Saturday. I was consumed with worrying about missing the 'opportunity' to drink last night (if you drink now you'll have Sunday to recover but if you put it off and want to drink on Sunday you'll feel shit at work) whereas the reality is that I feel I wasted my Saturday night after having a very productive day beforehand. ..so a badge reset but a valuable one as part of a learning curve. I won't drink with you today.

Congratulations on not going off the deep end. I'm glad your research trip ended safely.  Many stories i've read here start with only one or two or just for today  and end a month or a year later.  .I will not drink with you today!
