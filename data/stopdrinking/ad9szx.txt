That's why I read William Porter's *Alcohol Explained* the first time at about 90 mph.  So much of what he says was spot on for me I just gulped down his words...I just finished rereading it at a much slower pace and I concentrated more on the discussion of why we relapse (Fading Affect Bias causes us to forget how bad things really were when drinking) and why we cannot stop drinking once we start (we are trying to eliminate the anxiety caused by our body's release of stimulants that are responding to the depressant effects of every drink.)..There is so much more to his book and I'm simplifying the above explanations but just wanted to share how important this book was for me...Such an eye opener and an important tool for those who want to stop drinking...&amp;#x200B;

Agree!  Every one in this sub raves about This Naked Mind but to me it wasn't nearly as impactful as Alcohol Explained....although the two books compliment each other very well.  I also loved Kick the Drink by Jason Vale.  These three books are my trifecta of sobriety.
Freedom is good! Good luck to you!
