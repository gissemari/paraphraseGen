Considering going it this time without AA and trying different attitudes/mindsets. Any tips?

Here's an excerpt from a book I've found to be very helpful enlightening even. Just a book not a program but it's a far cry from AA: .. It is time to reflect logically on why you did and perhaps continue to do things that are destructive to yourself or others. It is time to begin refuting the false reasoning that keeps you stuck in anger frustration and despair. As we stated earlier there are always perfectly valid reasons for all of our behaviors. By the end of this book you will see with great clarity that in every situation you were indeed innocent at heart and at every step of the way you did exactly what you had to do given the circumstances you were facing.  *from* **The Tao of Sobriety** *by David Gregson and Jay S. Efran Ph.D*..I haven't finished this book yet but it's really good. You might want to check it out. 
Whatever works for you is the best path...I know for me the connection and support from people in the meetings were essential to my success...If I read your title I infer that you wonder if there is a correlation between attending meetings and drinking.  Is that your hypothesis?
