Although only 23 days on my current streak I've drank less over the past year and a half than at any time since I started (at around 14/15; now 30)...Currently it feels like time has slowed where as before it felt like life time was accelerating as every year passed...My weekends in particular have become so much more fulfilling. No more chest pains from anxiety tingling skin after a heavy binge or fogged walks to clear my mind and ease my panic about bad decisions. ..In this year I changed jobs too which really helped my happiness and have started to prioritise my desires over my social expectations but it's just the start. I slipped up a few weeks ago and a few weeks before that so need to remain vigilant. ..What's working:.1. Dry people dry places.2. Support of my fianc e.3. Video games.4. Exercise (no everyday day-just a few times a week for now)..5. A better job.6. Accepting that some friends might be lost (not happened yet) or that they will change themselves..7. Food and lots of it..8. Tea and coffee (ad infinitum) and particularly making coffee with a cafeti re or buying it out..9. Sleep.10. Accepting the need for rest.11. Accepting my introvert/ambivert tendencies and through Susan Cain's book 'Quiet' and respecting my need for some 'me' time to recover from a week of intense work..12. Seeing Novak Djokovich talk about how he recovers from matches with family exercise reading and good food. I used to go out Fri and Sat then struggle through the week and repeat. Did my mental health no good at all..13. Avoiding taking the news and hysteria around it too seriously..14. Thinking of 'Fuck the Zero'.15. This sub of course and all of you!

I love Quiet. It made me feel like I was normal and valued especially when introverts tend to be encouraged to be different. Which is where the alcohol came in for me.....Anyway insight is the first step to change. You can't change what you aren't aware of. Even if you had slips you know what is working and what doesn't so that is admirable! Congratulations on what you've achieved thus far.
