I didn't think I'd ever make it through one xmas sober let alone a second! Remembering those first few months of sobriety lately it's overwhelming when I take a step back and look at my life today. I worked my ass off to get here but I didn't and couldn't do it alone. My AA family is amazing and you all are amazing. Will be thinking of you all may you all have a sober holiday filled with gratitude. For those of you struggling your asses off don't give up before the miracle happens!

Nice post....glad you are a part of this community!
Thank you and Merry Christmas
Nice one! I just stocked up on San Pellegrino water and sodas for tomorrow. Told the family I wasn't going to be boozing and so far it seems OK.
This will be my second consecutive Christmas spent sober also! Thank you for reminding me of how much I have to be grateful for. Merry Christmas!
Hey it's my 2nd too!  Feels much easier this time around congrats on yours!
