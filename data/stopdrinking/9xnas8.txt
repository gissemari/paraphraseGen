Hi everyone!..Just a quick check-in I've got a to-do list longer than my arm to get through today. Yesterday I was going to reach out to sober people I know because I haven't been doing that as much lately. I texted two people. It's a start. I've had a busy couple of days and I'm feeling stressed. I'm realizing that I probably do have more time to talk to people than I think I do but my natural impulse is to withdraw and I'm struggling to remember that reaching out will help...Change takes time and regular effort. The  Daily Reflections' [reading for today](http://www.recoveryreadings.com/dailyrecoveryreadingsNovember16.html) starts with  Maintaining my spiritual condition is like working out every day planning for the marathon swimming laps jogging.  It's a good analogy and timely for me. I'm a week into getting back into a regular gym program. I'm reminding myself to keep building regular steady work into my schedule. I can't start straight away at an intense level and maintain it but I also can't use the normal small aches of change as an excuse to quit. Small and steady is the way to go. I just have to keep doing it...Today's reading from  Twenty-Four Hours A Day' reminds me of why I'm doing all of this.  My life didn't make sense. It was full of broken resolves and frustrated hopes and plans. No wonder my nerves were all shot. I was bumping up against a blank wall and I was dizzy from it. A.A. taught me how to get organized and to stop fighting myself. ..I'm not quite there yet but I am learning. It is however an uncomfortable place to be. I know that my old ways of thinking and doing things don't work but I haven't yet gotten established in a new way of living. Today's reading from the Adult Children Of Alcoholics/Dysfunctional Families (ACA) daily affirmations book  Strengthening My Recovery' touches on where I'm at.  Between the familiar dysfunctional attitudes and thinking and emotional sobriety there can be a period of waiting in the spiritual hallway. Even here there is an opportunity to grow in patience tolerance and self-acceptance.  ..It goes on to say that as we keep going to meetings and working at our program the pain lessens and we find strength and encouragement to continue working. Finally  with hope and love in our hearts we encourage others in their passage  which creates meaning out of the experience...One interpretation of my reluctance to reach out to others for support when I'm under stress is that my addiction wants me to isolate. Isolating and drinking (and later smoking weed) went hand in hand for me. It went from being a social lubricant to a way for me to retreat into my own little world. I was looking for a sense of connection and relief through drinking. Reaching out to others threatens that whole dynamic...A different interpretation is that relationships have historically been uncertain quantities for me. The reading we did at the ACA meeting last night covered a lot of ground and one of the things it talked about is how children often project characteristics of their parents onto their ideas of God. I've never stopped to think of my childhood idea of God before but basically my childhood God was cold indifferent unpredictable and punishing. So yeah. ..I've carried over a lot of ideas of relationships from my childhood that I'm now addressing through support groups and therapy but it takes time work and building new experiences with consciousness about what's happening to create change in my understanding of myself and the world...But change is happening. The Higher Power I've found in sobriety is vastly different from the God of my childhood. My HP isn't interested in controlling or punishing my HP is supportive and gently encouraging. My HP now has empathy for me and understands that I need to live my life make mistakes and sometimes struggle with things in order to learn and grow. I'm my own person I'm responsible for myself and my actions but I also have the support and power of my HP to draw upon. It's a much more loving concept of a divine power and it's also a degree of faith that I haven't had since I was a kid and had no idea that I would ever find again. Of all the places sobriety was going to take me this is one that I never would've guessed. ..My other daily reading from  The Language Of Letting Go' really spoke to me about where I'm at. It talks about accepting difficult experiences as part of life and not using them as proof that life is inherently bad. It also talks about the power that we have to face our challenges and how feeling helpless is a belief and a trap...*We can change our attitude we can change ourselves; sometimes we can change our circumstances.*..*Life is challenging. Sometimes there's more pain than we asked for; sometimes there's more joy than we imagined.*..*It's all part of the package and the package is good.*..I'm so glad that I'm not running away from the pain and challenges of life right now because that allows me to make changes to myself my attitude and my circumstances. And it allows me to experience joy which can only be found through being present. Escape through intoxication means escape from everything the good and the bad...I hope that you all are well wherever you are on your journey. Thanks for sharing...Ginger_Sprout Out

But the meetings I've gone to just don't seem to deal with that at all.  Ginger how are you experiencing the changes via AA that help you make changes that lead to new patterns?  I'm stumped!  I've got the no drinking thing down and I've got relatively good self-care patterns but facing my habits of not completing goals or projects just doesn't seem to change.  I'd love any feedback you have!
