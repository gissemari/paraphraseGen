Some of y'all talk about how you get up at 5:00 am now refreshed. I can not seem to do that. In fact I seem to sleep more heavily without the booze. I struggle to get up before 8:00 am but I know I wont have that creeping hangover. ..Part of it is probably because I stay up until 12:00 of 1:00 each night but maybe my body is still adjusting. ..Anyways I'm happy :)..Happy Friday

Some people are night owls.  If that's working for you then good!   I'm just glad to wake up without a hangover without dreading being alive.
Same here I was never a morning person. If I have to get up before 7am my mood is lethal LOL especially before coffee :-).Enjoy your sleep &amp; hangover free mornings!!
It may come :) at first I sleep very very heavily but as my body readjusted to sobriety my energy came back and I started bouncing up at 5.  Took a couple of months!
Sleeping problems is one of the main reasons for my drinking. It's easy to sleep when your brain is numb and doesn't have the ability to chatter keeping you awake. I've noticed that after Day 10 of abstinence my sleep becomes deeper and I hit that nice REM state more often. Just that fact is another reason why I'm trying so hard to gain control of this problem as I know that not binge drinking long term will FIX one of the reasons I began doing so in the first place.
I'm not a morning person either. I struggle to get out  of bed at 7 am! I can easily sleep in late even when I'm sober...
