I've been putting it off for a while now and have had a few relapses recently so I figured it was time I got serious. I was at a meeting tonight and they do an announcement asking for people willing to sponsor raise their hands and I seen a guy I was thinking about asking do it. Just messaged him and he said he is looking forward to sponsoring me. Really excited about working with him. You don't get help if you don't ask.

Well done! Getting a sponsor in early sobriety was the best thing I could've done to keep my fragile sobriety intact. Going it alone never worked for me in the past. 
Good on you for reaching out. It's always worth trying a different way when the current one isn't working. 
Best move I made in sobriety too. Well done.  
Nice! After 3 weeks of going to AA I finally asked a potential sponsor to meet me for coffee tomorrow. I'm really looking forward to it. 
I rebelled against sponsorship (what do those old bastards know anyway?) but eventually I was broke down to a place where I needed help. My sponsor answered a lot of questions and has helped me not with advice but with being sober and telling me what worked for him. ..It's been a pretty good thing. I also do therapy and had an addictions counselor.
