14 days and I was a coward amd couldn't deal with my issues like a normal person would. I went out with a purpose to drink. I called a friend who didn't know I was sober and went out and got trashed. I feel horrible and anxious. I don't get what possessed me to do it.

You could try doing a [Cost/Benefit Analysis](http://www.smartrecovery.org/resources/library/Tools_and_Homework/Quick_Reference/CBA_Worksheet.pdf) to help you see what may have swayed you to go out drinking.  It may also help deter you from doing it in the future...Look it's not the end of the world.  And it could be a positive thing if you learn from it.  You could request a badge reset and start again.  14 days is pretty awesome.  You know you can do it now and next time it won't be as hard -- hopefully..

So you elected to get trashed because you couldn't deal with your *issues* like a "normal" person.  The end result of which is you now feel anxious and horrible.  Reflect on that.
Start again then friend.  Picking yourself up and starting over and not giving in now is the first step towards victory.  14 days is awesome and they weren't wasted just because you drank again.  Each of those days was worthwhile to be sober and you can have another 14 such days and many more starting today.

You're in a fight and you just took a punch. Keep fighting...Feel bad about it? That doesn't help but now you know to watch out for that right hook. ..You got this--keep learning and moving forward. What you're doing is hard and imperfect. 
Don't stop trying now! Never give up!
A bad case of the jitters was probably necessary.  Good luck.
Time to dust yourself off and get back up. Try to assess exactly what triggered you and prepare for it next time around. And next time try calling a friend who knows you are sober when you feel crappy! Most importantly do not beat yourself up!
