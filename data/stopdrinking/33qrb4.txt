I had a relapse two weeks ago..Sent me into a day long psychosis and week long major depression. It's Friday and I'm trying to curb the craving by posting here. I started seeing a psychotherapist to get to the bottom of this issue. My next appointment is over a month away so I've been building a deck roof to keep my mind clear. So. Bored. Dull. I need to buckle down and learn to be interesting funny and fun without the booze.

Have you considered anything beyond therapy? Group recovery meetings have helped me a lot.
I second /u/KetoJam have you considered going to a support group meeting like AA or SMART? They're basically free and available pretty much every day of the week. You don't have to go to them forever it might help you get over this initial hump.
