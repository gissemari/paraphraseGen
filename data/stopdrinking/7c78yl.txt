I related to everything that was said. It was amazing and such a relief. At first I was confused and struggled with if I should even go but I'm glad I did. ..I won't be drinking with you all tonight.

I'll never forget my first meeting - it was so many feelings - humiliation fear embarrassment joy acceptance peace and many more! I'm so happy that you found relief. Wishing you well on your sober journey.
