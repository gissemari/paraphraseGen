Happy  St. Patrick's +1 Day' everyone; I hope everyone had a great day. In any other year I know I'd be feeling awful today: suffering with a hangover struggling to recall what had happened the day before and all round feeling awful but it's not any other year...75 days ago I discovered r/stopdrinking thanks to an article in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/01/hangover-from-hell-that-made-me-give-up-drinking-alcohol). Inspired after reading the article I took the plunge and embarked on Dry January. It was hard...I've tried before to stop drinking but I've lacked the willpower. The difference this time was finding this community the nicest group of people on the internet bar none (pardon the pun!). I've made many many friends here and I wanted to thank you all...I never thought on 1 January that I'd be able to get 75 days under my belt and be hosting the check-in and it's all thanks to everyone here and focusing on taking it one day at a time...I'm looking forward to hosting the check-in this week and meeting new friends. So here goes my daily pledge: **I will not drink with you today!** Good luck everyone have a great Sunday!. .---. .*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart but we're here together!*. .**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**. .I'm pledging myself to not drinking today and invite you to do the same.. .Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.. .It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours lets not drink alcohol!. .---. .**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!. .What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.. .**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.. .**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.. .---. .This post goes up at:. .    US - Night/Early Morning  .    Europe - Morning  .    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night..A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar...---

I will not drink today. I have to study for my Spanish exam so not even tempted.
Morning from the UK!  I can't remember how I came across SD - I know that I lurked for a while whilst still drinking before I stopped. It's been a huge source of support for me - it's got me through the last 39 days!  Like having my sober pals in my pocket - I haven't been sober this long for 9 years!!   So Thanks guys!! ..Going out in snow with dog for a while then going with ex husband and children to a curry buffet lunch to celebrate big lad coming home from university. Feel quite chilled today. Hope you all have a great day! ..I will not drink with you today

Good morning.  Not drinking today 
I will not drink today.
I didn't drink in Aus with you today and I won't tonight!
Since discovering SD it has been an inspiration to me to carry on this time and i fully intend to continue.  Checking in each evening helps me so much on this journey as the evening and weekends are the hardest for me!  Thank you all for your stories and advice! I will not drink with you today! :)
Count me in :)
Good morning I will not drink with you today 
I joined reddit a year ago today JUST for support on my journey to sobriety. I made it 9 days by myself but you all walked beside me for the other 365. ..THANK YOU. I couldn't have done it alone. &lt;3
I will not drink today.
Hey SD! I'm not drinking today. Have a lovely Sunday!..Shout out to our u/mrmurphyltd for hosting this week - thank you for your service! :).
Snowing blowing don't feel outgoing. .Cold old some lies we've been sold..Better fitter want to go-getter..Winning grinning even some thinning..Winking thinking today there's no drinking...Check in for Sunday and a little poem. I think my double espresso was too strong ;). Hope you all have a great day and nobody is reading this with a hangover and even if you are that you use every tiny piece of advice or slice of story that you can relate to here to help you make the choices that you want to.
I will not drink with you all today!
Good morning allnot drinking with all of you fine people today. I will being doing my favorite things today napping. Slept like crap but not hungover so mark one in the win column 
A productive ish weekend so far  so I'm just about to put the coffee on before everyone else is up. I like my quiet time in the morning. Love to all and I will not drink with you today    
Thanks for hosting /u/mrmurphyltd :) ! Coming to the winding down part of Sunday here after my most social weekend since Christmas - guess I finally feel confident enough to let myself out of the hermit cave. Also came here after reading that Guardian article - gosh I didn't even know reddit was a thing! SD and the brilliant Team Teetotal has been a life-changer. Bless xx ..Didn't drink over the weekend won't drink tonight and won't drink with y'all tomorrow either. :).
No chance I'm drinking alcohol today 
On my way to the gym starting my Sunday fresh. Happy hangover free Sunday everyone!..In for those who are new or back today will be your day one. You van do it!..I will not drink with you today.

I had an awesome sober weekend.  ..IWNDWYT.  Goodnight peeps.
Thanks for hosting.  IWNDWYT. It's my wedding anniversary as well. Looking forward to celebrating  it with some club soda. 
I will not drink today!
Good morning fellow non-drinkers! I didn't have an especially challenging St Patrick's Day. SO &amp; I aren't into crowds and stuff. I was feeling badly for folks around here for whom it's a big part of their culture/favorite time of year etc. For me it was a low-key day of gym chores reading and lots of ice cream eating. ..Happy to spend another day not drinking with you all. *Raising my coffee cup*  Happy Sunday!
I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT   
Not drinking today.

Thanks for the check in u/mrmurphyltd! I think it's so cool that you and many others found this sub through a resource outside of reddit. It's a special place that really can change lives I know it helped me change mine. I'm very happy to join everybody here in not drinking today!
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today. 
4 months today! Omg - I need to get on the computer to see my number 4. How good does it look?? I will not drink with you today!!
Good morning! Its crazy to think how a year ago today i was probably on some friend's floor passed out drunk in dirty clothes. Not today! Sober healthy clean 7:36am with a coffee and a smoke watching the sunrise. Worth. It.  .I will not drink with you today!
I feel like things are actually getting harder as I go and the novelty of not drinking wears off...that said I will not drink with you today. Starting my Sunday off with a nice coffee with cinnamon in it and a hot bath. 
It's sober Sunday...I'm having some struggles...Self doubt re: career future competency etc.. ..I seem to be eating my feelings lately having gained &gt;10 lbs. Ugh...And after expanding my social circle somewhat I find myself being _annoyed_ by the people in it more often than not. ..I am aware of all these things and am going to address them one at a time.
I will not drink with you today
Good morning! Not today. I've got too much to do. I will however have a cup of coffee.    
I think I'm coming down with a sinus infection which is no fun but at least it's not a hangover. I will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today just as I have not for the last ONE THOUSAND DAYS!!!!!!
No! I will not drink today.
Day 4. Very happy I found this sub.
No drinking for me today!
Good morning SD. It was a long 16 hour shift yesterday but I'm happy to be home now. I'm with my lover my bed. Thank you for hosting DCI /u/mrmurphyltd you're a fine lad!

I will not drink today
Three weeks down many more to look forward to! I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today!
Hope everyone had a safe and sober St. Patty's Day. I will not drink today!
I will not drink today.  Instead I'm leaving on a spring break road trip with my wife and 2 boys.  Saguaro National Park spring training baseball (go Rockies!!) Sedona and Grand Canyon.  Sober family time is the best kind of family time.  
Back to day 1 for me. IWNDWYT.
I am not drinking today.  I have to work on my landscape painting cook ribs thank God walk the dogs and watch NCAA basketball.  Thurston is glad Im getting back on track he's taking me to Brandywine Valley in May to tour the mansions and gardens.  Yay me...Blue Bell Mint Chocolate Chip as a reward for avoiding the wine...IWNDWYT...~Lovey.....
IWNDWYT  
I will not drink today.
I will not drink with you today! I commit to that. 
Yesterday was just another Saturday for me and didn't even really notice that it was St. Patty's Day. I spent the day with my kids got my taxes taken care of and had a relaxing night at home. I wasn't even invited to a party or anything which is fine because I would have said no. Maybe I'm just becoming an old geezer. I will not drink today.
I won't drink with you today.
First sober birthday since I was 15 (that was 16 years ago)! I'm actually really looking forward to it. I will absolutely not be drinking with you today. 
Holy Shmokes!..Didn't think I'd be here at day 13/14 today. Yesterday's check-in was dubious ("I want to not drink and I will do my best...")...All it took was a shift in my thinking. I needed to think of St. Patrick's day as a "mini-challenge" on my 28 day no alcohol journey. Yes I am  just doing 28 days for now. Until I do 30 then 45 then 50 then 90...you get the idea.
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today! I will read instead.
Just for today ..I will not drink..I will.....- Nourish myself with reading meditation and food.- Slow down during my day and keep things simple .- Greet every person with the kindness of a long lost friend.
Thanks for hosting u/mrmuurphyltd...I won't drink today!
Same as me re the Guardian article and 75 days. IWNDWYT! 
Will I stay alcohol free today?..Yes I will not drink with you all today
So grateful I found my way here! IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
I will not drink with you today
Morning all! Headed to a belated birthday brunch and for the first time in a long time I'm more excited about the food instead of the drinks. I will not drink with you all today!!
Count me in!
I will not drink with you today - nor did I yesterday. No green beer hangover. Lol. 
Wow I actually stopped drinking the day before St. Paddy's and then didn't immediately relapse. And I didn't like hide away from it either: damn I was in the Loop! in Chi! On St. Paddy's day! And I didn't touch a drop! About a week ago I thought I had lost all power to not have a drink daily. Wild...I'm not drinking with you all today! Best wishes!
I will not drink today!
My phone's acting up but if all goes well I'll have a fixed phone and a new cat...I will not drink with y'all today!
I will not drink today.
Spring Break is almost over my daughter goes back to college today.  I've had a great week sober with her we've done so many things.  That never would have happened before I quit drinking.
I will not drink today no matter what.  Drinking brings me nothing but misery and regret.  Every.single.damn.time.
Not today. Not today. Not today!
Happy Sunday everyone! Sure feels great to wake up with lots of energy 
happy Sunday. I will not drink with you today
Despite the horrible drinking dreams (I'm sure stemmed because of st Patrick's day) I made it through sober and happy. I will keep it up!! 
i will not drink with you today
Wont drink with you today
18 days today! I'm enjoying my second cup of coffee playing with my dogs and going to play xbox today. I've been on prescription meds for GERD for 5 years and I am going to make an appointment with my GI to start tapering off bc I haven't had any symptoms since I cut out bourbon/alcohol. For the longest time I couldn't drink coffee (my first love before I started drinking) and now I can with no issue. I will not drink today except for more coffee! 
Good Morning! I will not drink with you today :)
Happy Sunday! Feeling great this morning. ..My husband and I are taking our kids to meet up with my parents for a pancake breakfast at a maple sugar farm.  ..I'd never have wanted to be up by now and getting the kids ready to go if I we're hungover today. I love being sober!..I'm not drinking with you today SD! 
Thank you for community. ..Hanging around other people drinking was a new test this weekend. To my surprise I had no desire for alcohol. I still can't believe where I'm at today and that I honestly feel like I'll never drink again. IWNDWYT   
After not drinking yesterday I feel too good and have too much to do today. Also that quality 8 hours of sleep was niiiice. IWNDWYT
Two weeks for me and my first sober St. Patty's in 13 years. I will not drink with you today.

Big family event today but I will not drink. Happy Sunday! 
Won't drink today!
No plans today. Wait one plan: don't drink.  ..Happy Sunday everyone!
Not drinking today.
Hey it feels good not feeling like shit! Yesterday was tough. Snapchat was full of what I used to do...EVERY Saturday. I laughed to myself though cause I just thought  that's going big? That's a normal day!' But that's exactly why I am sober now. AA was a relative success and it helped me focus on staying sober the rest of the day...I will not drink with you today! Two weeks let's fucking go!!!
I will not drink today.  2 weeks!
Checking in. Things got out of control again the last few days. It always does. I am so looking forward to a good sober night's sleep tonight and clear head tomorrow I will definitely not drink with you today.
I've been at square one before and I can do it again. After drinking last night I've realized I need to take a more active position in my sobriety. I will not drink today. 
Work trip to New Orleans starts today. Got my plans A B and a bunch more. It's gonna be productive and fun and I'm not going to drink with you today.
Hard to believe it's been 7 days of actively trying to be a better person.  Feeling fantastic. IWNDWYT 
didn't drink yesterday and won't drink today
IWNDWYT!!!!
checking in!
Haven't been here in a while but I'm sure glad that I'm still riding the sobriety train all through the holiday weekend! Choo-choo! ..IWDWYT
I will not drink with you all today!
It was so nice waking up without a hangover. Lets do it again!.I will not drink with you today.
IWNDWYT!! Lately I've been struggling with myself.. not actual cravings but my mind being  you SHOULD WANT TO DRINK  and then some weird internal battle where I want to want to drink (what the...)  .. I don't know how to explain it .. so awkward and I hate it! 
I will not drink today. 
My first St. Paddie's in years that I haven't gotten totally obliterated. In my sobriety I'm so hyper aware of alcohol all around me. My Instagram feed full of drunk people and green beer. Sometimes I catch myself getting angry and thinking  DON'T YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET SOBER HERE?  ..IWNDWYT.    I'm excited to buy myself a delicious meal on UberEats and not feel bad about it because I didn't spend hundreds last night on booze and drugs. 
I will not drink today.
I will not drink today. 
   ..I ended up hugging the porcelain throne last night while vomitting. I was having some serious beer cravings between the great weather holiday and March madness. I decided to squash them by making a late evening sushi run. About a hour later I was sweating heavily and felt queasy. I am guess the sushi was bad but at least once it was out it didn't leave a hangover. ..Have a blessed day everyone. 
I will not drink today Sunday no matter what happens good or bad.
had a drinking dream last night. was so glad to wake up this morning. it was so real. ..i will not drink with you today. 
I will not drink today!
I will not drink today
I will not drink with you today. Making the most of today.
Someday is not a day of the week. ..I know what right thing to do...I will not drink with you today!
Checking in ..I will not drink with you today.

IWNDWYT. Mom still hanging in there. Hope she finds her way today. So hard to watch. But I am not drinking!
The no hangover mornings will never get old! I will not drink with y'all today!!   
Not drinking today!
Last night was my first big test and I passed!  I won't lie I had the itch a few times last night but checking in on SD helped tremendously and I overcame that evil little voice.  Today I woke up sober and with an absolutely crazy amount of energy so I've been getting a head start on spring cleaning.  The sun is shining and birds are chirping IWNDWYT!
I will not drink today! I will treat my body with kindness and build up my health to get over this awful flu! Happy Sunday. To all those who stayed sober through st.pats and all of those who have just arrived at this sub I am so PROUD of you &amp; I will not drink with you today!
IWNDWYT  
Day 9 and feeling pretty good. It is going to be a stressful week starting a new job while looking for a place to live but I know drinking will only make it worse...I will not drink with you today.
I w n d w y t

I will not drink today. Went to my first meeting in a looooooong time yesterday heading to another one this morning.
I will not drink with you today.   
Good morning from the Ozarks! I'm off to tend bar I bet I'm slow because everyone is hungover from last night. Nice to meet you My physical congrats on 75 days! Tiwndwy!! 
I've got a slight cold that started kicking in last night. I'm giggling right now thinking that I would have tried to "burn it out" with booze in the past. Feel better than I did last night. Didn't even think about going out. The Last Jedi put me to sleep hehe. IWNDWYT
I joined reddit only for this group it's been worth it you're all great!..IWNDWYT.
Thank you u/mrmurphyltd ! It will be a pleasure not drinking with you today!
Not drinking today. Shitty cold come back. Earache. Headache. 
I caved and had two beers yesterday. I went for 61 days and had a bad day Friday and had pretty bad cravings all day Saturday. I sat and looked at my beer for a couple minutes and ended up drinking it and ordering another.  Now I have to start over again. I am so ashamed. IWNDWYT
I won't drink today. 
Yeah  not today too nice out. 
Sunday night here in Australia...I made the weekend without drinking!!  ..I believe in everyone here! You *can* hold back from drinking. 
Checking in! I will not drink with y'all today!!! Tomorrow is my 90th day. I'm excited to get past that statistical hump that says if someone makes it this far they are far more likely to go a full year. One day at a time though. 
I will not drink today. 
Morning all I will not drink with you today x
SO grateful! I almost made it through a full season. It will be my first sober one in over 35 years! IWNDWYT!!!
.Sunday Funday! But with my own fun. I've already found a lovely new coffee shop a 3 min drive from home walked my dog around the hood there and actually went without headphones and listened to the birds. Now I'm full of coffee going to clean up hit yoga cook for the week and probably take another walk later. I'm so grateful that I don't feel the post Saturday night fog of nausea and shame today. It's ... just really fucking special. I won't drink or smoke today.
Made it through. IWNDWYT.
Congrats to everyone who didn't drink on St. Patty's! Feels great knowing a lot of people are waking up to terrible hangovers and I have a beautiful Sunday to do whatever I please. I will not drink with you today! 
Good morning kind folks. Been a week since I contributed my good will to this amazing space. I will not drink with you today. 
Definitely not drinking today! 
Not today.
Not hungover today for the first time in probably a decade. IWNDWYT
I will not drink today even though lately that is all i want to do. Im stronger than tgis :)
I will not drink today.
IWNDWYT. Gorgeous day out! Think I'll see if my Weber is ready to come out of hibernation!
Will not deink today. 
Checking in. 
Good Morning from the Pacific Northwest. Thank you for hosting Mr. Murphy! I look forward to the week with you. Won't be drinking tonight.
IWNDWYT! ..Thanks for hosting the post-St Patty's Check-in u/mrmurphyltd! You are right when you say this is the nicest group of people on the internet. I had an awful week last week where I relapsed and I posted at about my worst moment (not drunk but hungover from a few days off the wagon) and the support I received was amazing and I have not had a drink since. I'm supremely grateful for that. Happy Sunday to all of you!! :)
Last night I opened a bottle of peach pecan bourbon and smelled it. That little devil in my head was screaming. I told myself to just go to sleep and wake up sober on Sunday. IWNDWYT
Waving hello to everyone :)
Can't wait to not drink with y'all on this fine Sunday!
Heading to a gathering of extended family  always makes me a bit anxious for some reason but I will not drink with you all today!
Not drinking today or the next 24 hours!
I can't believe I made it through St. Patrick's Day! And while my husband and friends drank beer I drank cranberry-sodas. Hurray! Today feels so much better not being hungover. Proud to have made it to Day 11. IWNDWYT. 
Good morning everyone! Wish you all happy healthy Sunday! I will not drink with you today. :)
IWNDWYT 
Had an anxiety attack last night and feel like my body is knotted to pieces this morning. But I will not drink with you today! 
Pretty sure I haven't missed a single check in here yet.  To another day not drinking with everybody here!  Cheers with spinach orange beet juice   
Not hungover!!!! Gonna have a fun day I. The snow:) IWNDWYT 
Im so sad and heartbroken been depressed and obsessed for 3 months now... Drinking destroyed my relationship and made me lose the love of my life. I stopped drinking 18 days ago thank god cause I would probably be at ER or jail right now. I wont fill the huge hole in my heart with alcohol today.
Good Morning from Birmingham Alabama a great morning here just go back from a motorcycle ride it awesome not to be hung over especially after St. Patrick's day always seemed to drink more that day I think it was some sort of law or something. . Thanks for the morning sign in I always look forward to these to start my day on the right path. This is an awesome site and has helped me start and be alcohol free for almost 80 days one day at a time. Enjoy the rest of your day all and peace to you. 
I will not drink today.
Gotta love waking up after St Paddy's day and not feeling like crap! I will not drink with you today. 
Happy post St. Paddy's Mr. Murphy! {{waves from NY}}. I also joined reddit just for this group after lurking for a bit. I am astounded by the kindness of everyone here. ..Today is going to be a good day; I have EIGHTY FREAKING DAYS *and* I'm going to see Black Panther today!! Happy Sunday to all and I shall not be partaking in any booze laden festivities today! 
Starting over again....drinking is such a beat down....will never understand why I go back to it....praying for will power....won't drink today!!.
Woke up refreshed and sober...to a missed call from jail from my brother. He also has a problem drinking got arrested drunk trying to fight a cop a few months ago and by some stupid stroke of luck they dropped the charges. Now I fear he has squandered the opportunity I don't know what he did to land himself back in last night but it's probably his 5th drinking related arrest in less than that many years. Maybe this is what it will take for him to really try to quit. IWNDWYT. 
I feel really weird in that my urge to drink is not as strong. I'd still love to have a drink. but my urge is much less. Its weird
I won't drink with you today

Congrats to everyone that made it through yesterday. .To anyone resetting I'm proud your back you got this!.As for me starting back at my ols job that caused a relapse last summer but stronger than ever with much more support! So IWNDWYT!
I'm trying to catch up on work. My newborn is laying next to me. I put some lullaby music on youtube and glance at the comments:.&gt;for those reading the comments while you wait for them to fall asleep you're a wonderful person and i wish you love and the best of luck  ./whocutheonions IWNDWYT
No hangover Sunday I will not drink with you today! 
I will not drink today. 
I don't have a Guinness / Bushmills hangover for the first time in years. Those were the absolutely worst ones. I will not drink with you today!
 Celebrated  St Paddy's by going for a long Nordic ski having a lovely inexpensive ($15 total! - if we'd ordered drinks it would have been triple that!) lunch at a new restaurant with my wonderful boyfriend then we met mellow normal drinker friends for dinner (each nursed one beer for the entire dinner). Had a few things on the to-do list that I didn't get to but that just means taking care of them today and not 3 weeks from now like when I was drinking. ..IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you all today!
Good morning I will not drink with you today.
Just two weeks ago I had to have a bottle of wine to find the motivation to clean my house on the weekends if at all. Today I picked up a stray sock and two hours later I sit here with a nice fresh home and a mango LaCroix. I can't wait not to drink the rest of today!!!
I will not drink with you today! I'm sitting here enjoying a cup of coffee in St. Louis!
I will not drink alcohol today no matter how the day goes no matter if my mechanical mind and/or the devil tells me that I can or I should.
I will continue not drinking with you today.
Happy Sunday. .I will not be drinking with you today and I will never drink again and I will never change my mind. 
I will not drink today! 
Not drinking today. Got a sports match today and the team usually drinks after. Planning on buying a nice tasty sports drink to enjoy following the game. 
Howdy. Thanks for hosting. I won't be drinking today. Tally ho!
Day 1 I finally decided to stop lurking and take action. I will not drink with you today!
 
Had a vivid drinking dream last night and woke up thinking I needed to change my sobriety date to St. Patty's. I felt horrible until I realized it was a dream. I've had many drinking/using dreams but none other than last night's were able to convince me I'd relapsed. Freaky shit! ..Today I am so so fucking grateful to be 99 days sober and 36 days clean. I will not drink with y'all today!
Day 38. Nothing better than waking up on a Sunday after saint patricks day not being hungover. It really is a motivator!
I will not drink with you today and if I'm tempted I'll post here call someone or get my ass to another AA meeting. Because I don't want to deal with this early sobriety thing again. No no no. 
Haven't felt really needy about the Sunday check in for a few weeks until today. I just had that feeling like it's time to start drinking but instead I'm checking in to say IWNDWYT 
I will not drink today.
Best part of St Patty's Day is cheap cabbage at the grocery. My chickens love it. IWNDWYT.
I will not drink with you wonderful folks today! Hooray the sun is out!
Feels great waking up not hurting from the night before. I think I can get used to this. So with that mindset I won't be drinking with you today.
Sign me up for another drink free day with all of you.
I will not drink today with you...
Happy not to drink with you all today!!
Day 21. Life still sucks but at least I have three weeks. ..IWNDWYT. 
Good morning SD. Monday here in Aus and IWNDWYT.

I won't drink again today! Unfortunately my body still feels really tired and fatigued but I'm chalking that up to recovery. 
I will not be drinking today! :)
I'm new here- I've got to start somewhere- I will not drink today no matter what!  
IWNDWYT!

Not drinking with y'all today.
5 days of not drinking and working out and I feel much better!  Will not be drinking today. 
I'm drinking hot chocolate and browsing Reddit not too long before bed for me. IWNDWYT!
got myself a sponsor! went to pub hopping with friends on St. Paddy's and didn't drink! It was weird and I won't make it a habit but what a weekend :D IWNDWYT
IWNDWYT
We got this. Not today.
I will not drink with you today! 
Yes that article was a game changer for me also - but you &amp; establishes that already! I'm one day behind you. My hangover on Jan 2nd was met with this article popping up on my feed. I read it. I was disgusted with myself and enough was enough. Thank you to everybody here who kept me going for the first 2 wks. The support has changed my life - I never expected this to work for me. 
Back to square one...carrying on drinking is no longer an option I suffered yet another small stroke two days ago. I am told I could have a major or fatal one at anytime. So I will not be drinking tonight.
Grateful to have made it to day ten again. Not drinking again today.
Unfortunately resetting my badge again...I will not drink with you today.
Made it through a St Patty's celebration today!!! I will not drink with you today my friends. 
11 weeks today!..Hope you all had a fab weekend. Turns out my  cravings  for alcohol on Friday were hormone related which is a relief. Feeling loads better today and looking forward to a sober week ahead.
I will not drink today

&gt;Happy  St. Patrick's +1 Day' everyone; ..St. Patrick's Day Part 2: Sober Boogaloo. IWNDWYT! 
This Sunday I woke up at 430am made my way over to Brooklyn and ran 13.1 miles back to Manhattan along with 25000 others all before 10am.  1hr 53mins at age 47.  Felt great.  My left hip is a whole pile of pain right now but somehow it still feels satisfying...It feels so good to be on the subway going somewhere to so something positive before 6am on a Sunday morning instead of being one of those stumbling home only 2 hours earlier with the only achievement being able to outlast the "amateurs" out on Paddy's Day.
Hate that I checked in so late but I promised myself no drinking today and so far nothing! I will not drink with the rest of you great people today.
Stumbled last night but standing back up with a bloodied nose and declaring IWNDWYTDY!!
Quite late today but I did not drink and I will not be drinking!
I will not drink today.
Good evening everyone. I'm recovering from an awful night where alcohol literally tore apart my friend group. We all yelled and cried and fought with each other like nothing I have ever experienced before. I dumped the remainder of my bottle of wine down the sink at the party before getting a ride home. ..Today is day one for me. I've been to this sub in the past but I had never fully committed to quitting. But after witnessing whatever the hell happened last night between the people I love the most I've never been more sure that this is it for me. 
14 days here    Two weeks feels good ;) IWNDWYT

First  holiday  I spent NOT drinking and I couldn't be any more thankful I woke up without a nagging hangover. I have made it 41 days and I'm not about to slip up. I'm proud of you all that made it and the ones who have decided to turn a new leaf. You keep me motivated! 
I will not drink today. I can't remember the last time I drank. Maybe in the last 90 days and it wasn't in excess. 
IWNDWYT!
I will not drink with you today

I did not and will not drink today.

I have been in rehab for 14 days and alcohol free for 13 days (came in after a few)...I'm struggling with cravings due to PTSD flashbacks and nightmares. Its difficult trying to find alternative ways to self-sooth. For now I'm basically abstaining because otherwise I'll be kicked out. .The Valium is helping for now but I'm unsure if I'll be strong enough to abstain once I leave in 1 week. .
Late check in but I will not drink for the remainder of the hour.  And then I will choose to not drink into the next day.  Best!
