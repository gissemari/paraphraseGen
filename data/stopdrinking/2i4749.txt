Finally gave in and admitted to myself I am powerless over alcohol when drinking.  I get it alcohol you win.  Thing is I feel light a great weight has been lifted off of my chest.  I feel though as I am in control now.  Is this just a moment of clarity?  I know I can not moderate and have made up my mind to not drink anymore.  Hell I'm planning on attending an AA meeting this coming monday.  Something I have scoffed at for years.  This forum has made me realize I am not alone in this struggle.  Thank you everone for your support.
