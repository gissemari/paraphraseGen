I made sixty days two days ago. I felt I should make a post. I am proud of myself yes but I have been a bit hyper-vigilant about PAWS. I don't want to underestimate the reality of that obstacle. While every day has been better than the days of drinking and drugs my mood has been a bit of a rollercoaster. I have gotten into the (good I think) habit of remembering to label unpleasant mood swings as symptoms of PAWS. But I also struggle with knowing when I should actually go about the heavy lifting of learning new ways of dealing with negative emotions in a non-drown-them-out sort of way. It is my understanding that that is the more constructive way to build an enduring and rewarding sobriety. I have begun journaling and I believe that's been a good way to let feelings out into the world. I hope I can build that into a solid habit. Plus it should help with my writing which is an interest of mine. ..I should mention that I read many of the posts on here and I want to take this opportunity to tell you all that I think about you and believe in all of you. I take inspiration from you and hope the very best for you. I really hope you all have wonderful days of sobriety. IWNDWYT!!!

Great news!! Well done! 
Congratulations! I really like the way that 2 in your star looks. ..I will not drink with you today
It's all about new good habits...When drinking there was only ... drinking...But in the good stretches of my life there was always something to keep me occupied to get up in the morning and look forward to or to wait until the end of the day to get back to. ..Work school projects fitness ... whatever. And that was my habit at the time...I'm looking to find new habits right now myself.
