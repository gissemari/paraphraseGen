My girlfriend doesn't drink at all and never has so she doesn't have a lot of sympathy for the hungover dickhead that I am sometimes and I'm sure the significance of me giving up the booze is a bit lost on her...Despite that though she knows how much I look forward to a beer or 6 on a warm afternoon and how it helps me to relax so she has done a tour of the local supermarkets to buy all the different lemonades she can find to replace that afternoon beer. Very lucky to have her and would struggle without her support...It's Saturday night here in Australia the second most difficult night of the week for me but I'm not drinking with you tonight.
