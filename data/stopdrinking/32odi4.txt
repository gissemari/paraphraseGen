And i dont think i can go another day. My SO and i are having a rough patch. And it is 150% ny fault. This is what im best at. Fucking up the things i love. ..Im really struggling. The only reason im not drinking now if i were to be brutally honest is the stores arent open yet...Fuck. This is gonna be a long day.
