I've heard it mentioned on Reddit (they love their recreational drugs here) as an alcohol alternative. It is basically powdered alcohol gets you feeling drunk without the hangover purportedly. I'm feeling curious about it. I'm sure using it would count as a relapse though.

Anything that mimicked getting drunk would count as a relapse for me. I'm pretty lenient when I see people posting on here about casual MJ use I don't personally think it's a big deal (though I don't smoke) but doing something specifically that "gets you drunk"...seems different to me. I'd avoid it personally.
It would definitely be a relapse for me. Curiosity about drugs always got me in trouble. 
I think I'd have to ask myself if I wanted to be sober or just a non drinker. .I know myself. Delusion and denial are the lifeblood of my addictions. .Swapping out substances won't get me to where I want to be. .Ask yourself where you want to be. 
&gt; It is basically powdered alcohol gets you feeling drunk..I would consider it a relapse.  I don't want anything that even resembles what nearly destroyed my life.  That includes "NA" beer too.
I have no interest in trying this in particular the potential for addiction and withdrawal alarms me especially knowing my predisposition for addiction...It took me a while to adjust to living without using a substance to alter my mood these days I'll go for a cycle ride instead.
