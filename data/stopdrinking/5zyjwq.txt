It's the first LGBT chemical dependency and mental health treatment facility in the US in Minnesota. It was my first and so far only time in treatment...I arrived not knowing what to expect. I met plenty of people and it was my first time in a long while being surrounded by a bunch of queers. But I made friends avoided the people who seemed like bad news. Struggled. Cried...I learned a lot there and in a really sad way I miss it there. I wish I could live there. ..Anyway. I won't be drinking today. Just gonna reflect on where I've been.

I'm sure you can go visit? Lots of people needing a friend
I wish there were more places like this everywhere... as well as more efforts in queer community to maintain sober spaces...Bars and clubs have been so foundational to queer and gay identity and community... and in some places bars and clubs are the *only* spaces we have. ..I won't be drinking with you tonight.
Oh. Dear. You sound like you need a good long . squeeeze to you! Keep your chin up kid. I wont drink with you.
I'm glad you found the help you needed there. I'm sure experiencing rehab together makes for some serious bonding. ..I'm reading *Dry* by Augusten Burroughs and that's where he went I'm sure you've heard. ;) ..I won't drink with you.
