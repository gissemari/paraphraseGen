Hey everyone. .Thought I'd post my monthly sobriety post seeing as today is 3 months sober. The past two months have been extremely up and down buying bottles of gin just to have them sit unopened and eventually being given away. But I noticed a pattern every day I'd wake up after buying a bottle and not drinking it I'd feel relief relief that I didn't fuck my own sobriety up for the sake of drinking for one night (which would have turned into so many more). ..To anyone struggling the path of sobriety is as rocky as can be but it's also something you'll be proud of even in the struggle. Keep going see what wonderful places it takes you to. After all life is much better when you can actually take things in with a clear head. ..Hope you're all doing well!
