I stumbled upon this sub yesterday and made a frustration post. I was not in a good headspace last night when I made the post but felt a lot better getting my thoughts out on paper. I had a pretty normal day at work today despite not really sleeping very well but I did have a hard time focusing in my cube. I was thinking about the things I'm grateful for and the things in my life that I'm proud of. I'm pretty hard on myself most of the time and it makes me anxious so I drink to take the edge off then feel more anxious later about the drinking rinse repeat. So I want to write out all the good in my life so I can get my thoughts out in a more coherent way instead of having thoughts bouncing around my head. So this will probably be a long one so apologies. So here's my list:..&amp;#x200B;..\-My wife: Last year I married the love of my life. She is the most important thing to me. I definitely out kicked my coverage with her because she is a beautiful person inside and out. She is such a constant source of encouragement for me and her just being around makes whatever problems I'm going through at the time so much easier. She also takes care of me. She grows herbs for me to use in meals. She does most of the cleaning around the house including laundry. There have been times where she's spent hours cleaning the house and folding clothes while I'm sitting on my ass drinking watching sports or playing games. And she has never once complained. She deserves a better husband who doesn't become an unproductive slob on the weekends. I cannot imagine my life without her...&amp;#x200B;..\-Family: I'm really lucky in this department. While drinking is pretty ingrained into my family's lifestyle with my dad being full Italian I know that my family will be very encouraging with my decision to not drink at a family function. My in-laws are great people too and would also be very encouraging. The only fear I have family wise is my brother. We get along just fine but due to reasons not related to my drinking we've kind of grown apart over the last year or so. The one thing that we do together regularly is brew beer. I actually have a batch fermenting right now which I do want to bottle and just give to him. I just don't want to lose that with him because without it I feel like we might grow even further apart. Other than that I have a very solid support system...&amp;#x200B;..\-Friends: I recently moved back to the city I went to college in and it has been such a great thing in my life because I'm close to a really good friend group I made while in school. They're also a very supportive circle who would never encourage me to drink if I'm out with them socially. One thing that we try to do monthly is play D&amp;D. There was a few month stretch where I would almost have to force myself to go to the session that we plan a month in advance (have to because scheduling around 6 adults is not easy especially when one lives out of town). I wanted to spend all of my Saturdays drinking and watching sports and I almost left our group recently because of that. I haven't told them that specific reason and I'm really ashamed of myself for even thinking that way. Alcohol should not be getting in the way of spending time with my friends especially since we've had our D&amp;D group for about six years now...&amp;#x200B;..\-Professional life: I'm very proud about my achievements in my career. I basically flunked out of the university I went to freshman year. My parents told me that if I want to go back to school that I had to pay for all of my living expenses. So I moved back to the city the university I went to and started working. I became a self sustaining adult at nineteen and I grew up really quickly mentally. During that time I went to the technical college down the street and worked five to six days a week at a pizza place in one of the nearby suburbs. While in technical college I was able to raise my GPA high enough that the university accepted me back in after a year and a half. Refocused I got through the next two and a half years of nonstop school to get a STEM degree. First job was in a new city that I knew one person. I was laid off nine months later and that's when my binge drinking started. I eventually found work in another city and moved in with my now wife. Then I switched companies moved back to my university's city last year. I currently have three years of experience in my current field and I perform pretty well at my job. I've yet to have a review that wasn't glowing. Work is therapeutic for me because I have an incredibly hyper active brain that I have a really hard time tuning down. Work lets me focus on solving problems and releasing pent up hyperactiveness in a healthy way. It does a better job at it than drinking will ever do. I'm also tired of being known as the "alcohol guy" at work. That's extra motivation for me to keep it up...&amp;#x200B;..\-Hobbies: Two constant hobbies throughout my life have been watching sports and playing games. While these hobbies do have their benefits I'm using them as an excuse to drink. I want to have a beer while watching the game. Or I want to have a few drinks and get lost in a Civ game or Stardew Valley. No more. I want to enjoy these things again without alcohol. Actually alcohol erodes my interest in both of these things because the drunker I get the less I'm paying attention. I've also taken up cooking within the last couple of years. But yet again I've fallen into the trap of drinking while I cook especially if I'm using alcohol as an ingredient. This particular situation will probably be a struggle for me because I love to use wine in a lot of European based dishes I make and will probably have an issue finding applicable substitutes. But I don't think using alcohol in cooking is worth the risk. That one glass of wine I pour after I deglaze the pan will be finished very quickly and then shortly after that it'll be the entire bottle. It's quite shameful really that I can't properly do a hobby I enjoy without tainting it with the desire to get drunk. But these hobbies are a good starting off point and they help me escape boredom fairly easily...&amp;#x200B;..I guess the whole point of this post was to show myself that I have a lot to live for. I don't want any sort of substance to come in between any of these things I just listed. And these are just the big things. There's a bunch more about my life that I truly enjoy. Seeing it in writing is a helpful reminder to me for when I feel down which I know will happen eventually. So to my future self because I know you're in a bad place right now reading this post remember that alcohol will not fix your anxiety. Period. It will suppress it temporarily but it will come back worse than ever because of the guilt you will feel after the fact. At this time you are not in a fit state of mind to consume alcohol. You have a wife that loves you family and friends that support you and a lot going for you. Please when you read this post whenever that may be make the right decision and do not get that bottle of red. You can do it I believe in you.

Very well said!
I am still associated with the brewery I worked on building last year.  I talk to them about the beer and the equipment and toss ideas around.  I don't drink it is all and that's gotten to be (mostly) ok with them.  It's not impossible to have a hand in brewing the stuff after we quit is my story.  Anyways best wishes out there I believe in your absolute right to a more satisfying life and I hope your dreams come true.  I won't drink with you.
