I posted this about a month ago:.http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2u99px/my_most_successful_relapse_ever/..**TL;DR** - Staring on Jan 1 I made it near a month without drinking; relapsed. And then the next day I felt really positive about my success going forward...Well I wanted to come and say that a month later I haven't relapsed again. There were times it was really hard but I used my first failure to remind me why it's not worth it. (Also I started budgeting finances and with my income I really can't justify the cost at all)...Thank you for those that dropped in to say kind words. I'm optimistic about the future. My next goals are going to be to start eating healthy again and to cut caffeine (I kind of let these things go ignored while I focused on quitting drinking). One of the biggest reasons I started drinking was that I have a bad back - it would go out and I would be so upset I would stop going to the gym and self-medicate with liquor. Thanks to this I probably gained 100lbs in the past 3 years. I feel like I can finally get a foothold into turning that around...Thanks again and good luck.

Good work! I relapsed after my first month. As you'll no doubt guess I'm glad I came back to the sober life too. After a few months clean I bought a rice cooker and started eating a lot of brown rice. I also bought a lot of dried red/black beans to cook on the stove and mix in with the rice. Lentils also go good with this stuff. Beans/rice make a complete protein and are easy on your guts. I cook some spicy salsa into chopped up grilled chicken and toss that in the mix. Makes a lot of healthy food for cheap. Try it out. ..Ginkgo Biloba is a pretty good alternative to coffee/caff. Works by increasing blood flow to the brain. Might help.
