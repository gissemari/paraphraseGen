The common theme in all my alcohol-related dreams is rationalizing the relapse...Last night I dreamt that I had a bottle of wine and I'd "only drink one glass" cause "it's not as strong as the liquor I used to get fucked up on" then I drank a second glass then a third one. The wine tasted sweet not bitter like the wine I used to drink entire bottles of in a single night. I don't remember what happened after that...I don't even like wine. The only reason I used to drink it was cause it went down easier than spirits and I could get myself blackout on a bottle of that + a thing of liquor and the stuff I used to drink was cheap $10 red wine...Are these dreams trying to tempt me to relapse? Get me to move on from my heavy drinking past? Or am I getting them for another reason?

For me booze was such a central part that it was only fitting it would seep into my subconscious and dreams. Thats probably it. Also now that you're quitting it is really on your mind and therefore in your dreams. I'm not a dream doctor just a regular guy. 
I have had a few dreams where I'll be drinking and then halfway through suddenly realize what I'm doing and feel so so bad.  I attribute it to my perfectionism and the fact that I am very focused on staying sober.  Such a relief to wake up and realize it wasn't real.
My dreams are all about forgetting that I don't drink and then feeling terrible the next morning for accidentally screwing up.
