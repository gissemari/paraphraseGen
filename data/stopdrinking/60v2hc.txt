Hi everyone. My name is Kris and I'm totally new on Reddit..I never considered myself a real alcoholic. I like to drink I really do. Every day every ocasion. A good conversation with a friend a nice dinner with my girlfriend before visiting a match of my hometown soccerteam I'm sure you know the list..The thing is I don't know if I really had a problem with alcohol. I asked myself probably 100 times. The past 7 years I drunk heavily from time to time. The last 9 months excessive. Most days a bottle of whine and in the weekends a lot more. Also I began to take anti depressants medicine since I'm struggling with depressions last year and a half. Of course I knew I wasn't suppose to drink during this medication but I didn't want to quit. .Until the 26th of Februar. Prior to these days I was a couple of times blackout drunk (normally I need a lot to go drunk I prefer the happy mood after a couple of glasses) and I wanted to stop to save my relation and to figure out who I am without booze...So I quit. ..And I feel terrible. .The first two weeks I dreamt about drinking alcohol every night. .No euphoria not feeling better not happier or healthier. Sometimes I don't think about alcohol but man I need a drink so badly...Thanks for reading! I really could use some support......

Anyone who says this is easy is full of shit. I also loved to drink. It was my favorite thing to do. Feeling that whiskey take over and envelope me in a cloud of haze that blocked reality. Honestly if I could have kept at that phase I wouldn't have evee quit and would have drank myself to an early death. The problem is we never stay at that phase. It evolves into blackout or excessive drunk and hammered shit brain in the morning. You just have to lock the idiot brain away and not listen to it. You will get through it. It sucks it's hard and sometimes it feels so daunting that it is overwhelming. It is worth it though. It is totally worth it. ..I will not drink with you today. 
My depression was at an all time low right after I quit drinking. I was mad at the world and sad AF for the first two months. Things started to get better in the third month. ..I know it's not what you want to hear but it takes time. Kind of a lot of time. It's really great and worth the effort. I'm feeling happier than I ever have in my entire adult life! My depression has almost disappeared! I'm tracking my moods to see how that goes but at this point I feel like my depression was alcohol induced. ..Hang in there. I won't drink with you.
