I posted yesterday; I am still struggling. I ended up drinking again. I am so goddamn angry with myself. Now it's another 7am freak out due to anxiety from binge drinking. I am sorry I couldn't stay sober. I will try again today. IWNDWYT. Please wish me luck. I know I can do it thanks to this awesome community.

You got this!  Can you make it 1 day?  Wishing you luck and we will all be not drinking with you today :)
Yesterday is gone! Let's just not drink today.   start fresh. Don't be too hard on yourself. In my experience if I'm too harsh and mean to myself I end up saying screw it and drinking. I Think about how i can better not about how i messed up. Good luck! You got it. 
I'm with you. I will stay sober with you today
Hi! I keep giving in too. It's taking me a long time. But the time between each failure keeps getting a little longer and the failures seem less out of control each time and I drink less each time. I'm not giving permission to myself or anyone else to drink! But I am taking comfort from my small steps and victories because they are giving me confidence that even though I can't seem to pile on the months like other people each day or week that I don't drink is exercising my sobriety muscles. I wish you luck stranger and I will not drink with you today. 
Hour by hour..i am not drinking with you today. 
It's now 6 hours since I woke up hating myself again. I'm still just waiting for this self loathing day to be over. I will not drink today so I don't have to hate myself tomorrow.
After a few badge re sets I'm back again and IWNDWYT 
Just think if it takes an average of so many times to quit you are getting there! Keep trying!!
Never give up.  Today is a new day!  IWNDWYT
