So cracked a year. Didnt look back. It was a great weekend. Battlefield double XP the Austin Formula 1 GP lots of cleaning done. And best of all the birth of my first born is a couple months away. Glad I got that 15ish year monkey off my back and its not something that should affect my future son's. I'm ever vigilant though I understand the struggle so it's not like I'm posting that thinking I have nothing to worry about...Life is good. To those new to quitting or thinking of it. It does get easier every day is the first month as hard as it seems.
