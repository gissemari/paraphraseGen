So I had a lot of work to do something does not worked out as planned long story short it was not a great day by that I mean yesterday. So one bottle of Havana Club and one bottle of Sprite Zero (gotta save those calories...ehm). And "Oh you poor little man you haven't had single drop of alcohol in like half a year it's fine for one time". It's not fine not for the cause and not for me....I obviously drunk it all what I bought through the evening and I had never been so drunk in my life. First think I hate about it. Like I almost could not move tinnitus screaming in my ears and through out I did not feel that release of any emotion which I intended to suppress with this shit. Never happened before and this was pretty much my daily dose for one year. I was like "WHY?" but that's not the end of it. I have hard time fell asleep and slept for like 6 hours instead of 8 (big deal for me) and that morning hangover. Even with today's morning I have never have a physical hangover just emotional feeling bad have elevated anxiety* depression bad feelings. And this all is now 10 times worse then ever before. Never again after this because it costs hefty amounts of money then you have to drink it (which did not taste exactly good) and finally it didn't do shit to elevate my mood. I really don't have intent to drink alcohol in my life anymore after this....*having GAD since my 24 (now 27) which is why I started to drink in a first place. This is not an excuse it works unfortunately.This rings true for many people I have met with same problems but only for short period of time then it make it worse by the morning or when you sober up so you need to have/buy another drink you become emotionally dependent quite fast. I was an abstinent before that so I don't have any friends from any school I studied because I didn't want to drink and being push to drink and all of them have their drinking gatherings quite often but I found my own friends so whatever. Even after some time with that being taking cared of with doctor I haven't really stopped with Alcohol and then some horrible emotional state arises...relationships 'n stuff...so I started to drank even more and that was about a year ago. I really could not do anything like all the possibilities in my brain was blocked and one thing which was left was to drank an alcohol. I wasted year of my life. For anyone with anxiety reading this and not really started with alcohol in large doses throw your bottle out of the window and get to your doctor and get a subscription for you-know-what. W/D from it could kill you yes but so does alcohol W/D and on the top of that it does not destroy your body and most importantly you will live like a normal person not like a drunk looser....Please excuse any mistakes I've made in the text since I am unable to concentrate on anything which makes being non-native English speaker quite a challenge.

I call this "research"!  I have been through some research over the last few years.  I have been mostly sober for the last 5 years but I have had some short stints where I researched.  The research always ends the same way.  My life always ends up worse in some way.  The dark clouds always descend upon me.  I am almost back to 2 weeks after my last research stint.  Feeling great.  Maybe just maybe my research is done.  I feel like I have collected enough data now.  I know though that after some more time sober my lizard brain will want to experiment again.  At some point I will progress past that and hopefully stay on the path for good.  Wise people have told me it will happen and I believe them.  I wish you well!
