So I've struggled with alcohol throughout my adulthood.  I seem to have a pattern of going on benders coming to grips with what I've been doing cleaning up for a couple of months then going back to drinking slowly. ..I am a functional alcoholic. ..I've done AA and I was sober for 18 months.  When I was in AA I went to meetings but was not interested in working the steps.  ..I want to get completely sober now and don't know where to start.  I am thinking about going to the doctor and possibly enter a rehabilitation program.  I want to go to a program where I can still go to my job and could still be with my family but I don't know if that's best...I've thought about going back to AA...I'm in Chicago BTW.

Welcome. It's a wonderful idea to find a treatment program. There are out-patient ones available. You will learn a great deal about alcoholism and yourself. It will make it much easier to get started. Working the steps in AA was critical to my personal growth and recovery. Give this support group a second thought. Keep an open mind. You're in a different place now than you were before. Good luck.
