Just dropping in to wish everyone a wonderful Sane and Sober Saturday. Life is good despite our struggles!  Today I choose to be the best version of myself.  Alcohol no longer has a place in my life.  Without alcohol I'm free to be me.  Going to lace up my shoes and take a long mindful walk by the water.   Have a wonderful Saturday. .IWNDWYT.
