I've been struggling the past couple of years at work I'm so embarrassed about how my behavior has impacted work. I'm on my last warning. No mercy is left. Just found out the boss who has given me these chances is now moving on. I'm just sad/embarrassed/ashamed about thinking about what he will say to the new boss about me. I'm around 14 days or so not drinking. Man I really want to tonight. I WON'T. Posting on her before I go home to remind myself that I pledged to not drink. No matter what goes on today I wont do it. Can others share with me what they may have done to help repair work relationships?

It seems like your outgoing boss is a fair person so sharing your sobriety (not the struggle part) and asking him to help you create as much of a clean slate as he thinks is appropriate might be good. Could put it in the context of the support he's given you over the years thanking him and implying thanks for a final bit of support in allowing you the opportunity to prove yourself on the merit given the changes you've made...something like that.  
Congrats on 2 weeks.  It's is so freeing.  I saved $896 and a lot of time.  Keep on keeping on!  I won't drink with you today.
