I've been having dreams lately which feels weird. I don't remember having a lot of dreams when I was drinking...This one was about relapsing and it was so realistic when I woke up I was really convinced I had done it until I remembered everything I had done the night before (none of which included drinking.)..Man it was terrifying. I woke up at like 4am and then i went back to sleep and had another dream about relapsing (in a different scenario.)..Don't really know why but I felt like posting this.

Drinking dreams are a good sign for 2 reasons...1). if you are dreaming that means that you are finally getting some sleep. I never dreamt when I was drinking because I passed out rather than got natural sleep..2). it means that you mean business because the horror of drinking is in your subconcious which is where it should be. That way if you are ever caught off guard you'll automatically recoil at the thought of a drink...I started to sleep properly about 2 or 3 months after I sobered up. I've had a few drinking dreams but none for about a year now...Good luck - keep doing what you are doing as it seems to be working..
