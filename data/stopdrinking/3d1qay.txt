I've always had mental health issues for as long as I can remember. .I went from being an anxious child to an increasingly depressed teenager and now I am currently an insecure adult who can't function without being medicated in some form...This insecurity I feel currently is largely due to the weight I've gained during university . I'm not grossly overweight . I still consider myself attractive . But I feel suffocated by fat  all the time. I can feel my fat growing  moulding and turning me into a morphis blob . .I have been trying to loose this disfiguring Weight. I have been eating better and trying to quit drinking.  My plan to lose weight has been working slowly and I am not happy with my progress . I know I've lost weight but I seem bigger ...Today I am really struggling . I had planned to eat nothing today which is something I do often . I realize this isn't healthy but it works faster than eating 1200 calories a day .Anyway  I really messed up today by eating some cereal and a breakfast wrap ...Now I just want to disappear . I want to go grab 4 bottles of wine and just drown my fat ass in alcohol. I know my self deprecating attitude is pitiful . I know my lack of confidence is repulsive but I just hate myself.  ..More so today than in a long time . I have come to the conclusion that my alcohol abuse is a symptom of some much bigger issues. .The liquor stores around my house close at 5:00 pm and I just need to hold off another 30 minutes . .Help please . ..

As someone that struggles with his weight the regret of all the calories consumed from alcohol would be reason enough for me to resist. Hang in there it gets easier and it gets so much better.
It is said that alcohol is but a symptom or our "disease."  Personally that was true for me but amazingly after I undertook to stop drinking (which I did via [the things I describe at the Baby Steps post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) my underlying mental health issues were much improved.  In other words I was able to ACT MY WAY INTO better mental health.  Bill Wilson one of the co-founders of AA describes in the book Alcoholics Anonymous aka the Big Book that he had access to the leading mental health and addiction specialists of the day (1920s-1930s) and that self knowledge did not keep him sober.  So /u/MenstrualJackson we are not alone.  ..Good luck to you.
It's now 5:03 pm  I made it . .Thank you to those who commented and kept me distracted  sincerely . 
of course there are underlying issues that's why quitting drinking is not the end of the problem...And as a medication for said underlying issues alcohol is absolutely the wrong drug....
