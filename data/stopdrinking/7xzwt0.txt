Yesterday was really hard.  I've been struggling in my relationship my job is not fulfilling and I've moved so far away from every person I know that it would literally take days of driving to see a familiar face.  ..But I made it to today without drinking.....And it's 8:30am and all I can think about is how can I figure out a way to sneak a drink.... I know how much I would regret it.  I know that it would mean lying to the man I love who has been so understanding and supportive even though I've been making things difficult. .. It would mean starting all over again... and my mouth is still watering and I'm still trying to rationalize why it's ok to go take a break from work right now and walk across the street to the liquor store and pour a couple shots of vodka in my water bottle.

Vodka in the water bottle at work isn't normal. People like us can't drink. It's really not an option. Once I removed drinking as an option I found it much easier to stay sober.
&gt; all I can think about is how can I figure out a way to sneak a drink..This was running thru my head constantly for the first few months. I was pretty pissed during early sobriety and I felt like if I was going to feel so shitty what was the point in being sober?! Any ways like you I knew I'd regret it. I'd have to start allllll over my husband would be crushed my self-esteem would crumble even more.... so I didn't drink. And I didn't drink for so long that one day I didn't *want* to drink. For real! Like a light bulb switched on. I could finally see that drinking was making my life miserable not sobriety. I just read on SD the other day: **sobriety delivers what alcohol promised.** ..Sure it's still tough some days but now that I'm on the other side I can see things in a way I never could before. *Now* drinking seems like the **least** effective way to help myself feel better. It takes time to learn new coping strategies... I didn't have ***any*** before I got sober. [Reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/books) has helped me with that a lot. Early sobriety is uncomfortable but it is temporary. Stay strong. I won't drink with you today.
