I've got a nasty cold. And it couldn't have come at a better time: my SO just went out of town which is a major trigger for me (come on just one who would know?). I dropped her off at the airport this afternoon and now I'm in bed sick with *absolutely no* desire to drink. Lucky me!..It may just be a total coincidence. But you know how in Freudian psychology they say you never actually make a mistake that it's always something subconscious working its way out? I've been worried about the possibility of relapsing while she's gone for a couple weeks now. Maybe my body   perhaps just worn down by the stress of a potential relapse or perhaps pulling a clever psychosomatic trick on myself   let down its immune guard just in time. I imagine little soldier cells going "Mayday! Shut the system down repeat shut it down!"..When you get sick you're body's always telling you something. Sometimes it's really simple like eat better and wash your hands often. Sometimes it's more complicated. Whatever the case I'm actually feeling grateful for this nasty cold. That may be a first!..I will not drink with you all today. :)
