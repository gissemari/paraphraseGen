I began the binge on Friday night. I went out with my girlfriend and her friends. I literally don't remember anything after a certain time. I woke up Saturday morning with hair of the dog called off work and kept it going. I blacked out at 9ish PM lost my 300$ phone (that I still haven't found) and hurt the one person in this shitty world that I love more than myself. It was today that I made the choice to get back on that wagon and face my problems instead of running to the bottom of a bottle to deal with them. Learning to cope with my personal demons will be one of the single hardest things I do but in the end it'll make me a stronger person.

How long had you gone before relapsing? If anything this sounds like a great reminder as to why you stopped. 
I recently started too it feels so much better good luck and IWNDWYT
I've found that if you stick with this community stopping slowly gets better. It can challenging at times because I feel like I let these awesome folks down when I do lapse but the truth is even though I still slip often it's nothing like it used to be. To give an example I used to drink at least a full bottle of whiskey plus some beer every weekend. Since I've started posting here a lot of alcohol to me now is more than a couple of beers. It really put my drinking into perspective. If you stick with it eventually you'll become the sober person you want to be. Just got to keep on going.
