I recently discharged from rehab and believed it was the best thing to happen to me. I moved away from Seattle because I knew I would relapse with my old friends and came to this new state to continue outpatient care...Today is just really difficult. My anxiety is through the roof and I find myself asking  what is the point why am I doing this?  I don't understand what I am doing...I have put my life and faith all into this fellowship and moved here. I'm just having second thoughts if this is all worth it. Everyone had bad days but I am having a terrible one. I feel so alone.

You're not alone. Call your sponsor if you have one. 
Have you tried meetings outside of rehab? You are doing this because you were a hostage and now you are free. Early recovery is tough but totally worth it I promise.
Hiya. Sorry you are feeling alone. It will get better and easier. We are here for you at SD. IWNDWYT:)
I feel you... 
"what am I doing?" "what is the point of this?" Those are questions I've asked myself so many times you're not alone in feeling that way. You mentioned faith and although I don't have a ton of faith myself it helped me to have faith in the process and the idea that things can get better. Spoiler alert: they do.
