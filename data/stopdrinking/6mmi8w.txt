Good morning. I just joined this morning but have been checking this thread out for a week or so. Both my husband and I struggle with drinking. He drinks everyday. I will too. I am tired of it. I try not to drink but then I am around him drinking all the time and it is just really hard. As  I am sure all of you know its hard to be the sober person around a drinker. ..I could really use some tips on how to stay strong on not drinking while around him. I know he wants to stop too so I am thinking if I can just set the example it will help him but how can I be around him when he is annoyingly drunk all the time?..Thanks so much!
