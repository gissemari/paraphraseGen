Lost my job on friday. Nothing to do with drinking just a temp contract that wasn't a good fit...It's gotten bad. Like as bad as it was when I had the withdrawal seizure. I've been drinking about 3 handles of 80 proof Burnett's vodka a week. I feel like shit my guts are rotting and I'm going down a dark path...Got a prescription for librium to avoid the possibility of seizures. Gonna do things differently this time. Gonna see a counselor and go to a SMART meeting still unsure about AA. I'll figure that out after the SMART meeting on Wednesday...I'm waiting for the librium to kick in right now I've got the shakes and chills right now and pretty uncomfortable...Thanks guys. You helped me stay sober for a month last time but it's clear that I need more help than this sub alone...I requested a badge change today is day 1.

I'm so sorry you're in such a state. You'll.Feel better once the Librium kicks in. Thanks for posting. It helped me today
Awesome. I'm 48 hours in. I've also had to bring out the big guns this time. Meds under doctor supervision and a therapist. Support groups alone weren't enough. Good luck to both of us!
