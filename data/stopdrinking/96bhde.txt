It was exactly 10 weeks ago at the tail end of a sloppy work trip that I chose to stop drinking. ..Earlier this week I made a thread outlining some of the struggles I had with overcoming the desire to drink on a business trip. ..I am happy to say that I made it through unscathed and feeling so proud of my resolve and good choices. ..I have an hour and the half in the terminal but I know I will not drink with anyone tonight especially myself. .
