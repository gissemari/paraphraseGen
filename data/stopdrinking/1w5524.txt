Hey....... Today marks 1500 days sober!!! I'm very pleased!!  I'm also fully aware that my relapse is waiting for me just around the corner. When I was in rehab they shared that we have a 35% chance of staying sober for five years. Alcohol is a formidable opponent and I always keep that in mind. ..But for me...for today....YAY ME!!!!!!..Good Luck to my fellow addicts...Now on to 2000
