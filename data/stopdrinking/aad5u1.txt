I started a new job a bit over a month ago and this is my first job while being sober. I didn't really think it would make too much of a difference honestly. I never went to work drunk or anything and I always did a decent job but I was not what you would call dependable all the time. Plenty of mornings getting to the office late or working from home because I was so tired and hungover I couldn't face the commute or the people at the office. Lots of sick days missed meetings and deadlines slipping but never enough to really cause a major consequence. And I had that reputation but managed to laugh it off like any of it was acceptable. Like 'hey I'm not getting fired so this must be okay'. But it wasn't and I'm sure I put added stress onto those who ended up picking up my slack on those days when I didn't show up. ..But things are different right now. I'm here every day early or right on time working late when needed making all the meetings helping out where I can and just doing good work. Just doing what I'm being paid to do and apparently people notice that shit. One of my co-workers' wife is expecting a baby at any minute and he asked me if he could add me to his meeting schedule to fill in for him if he isn't able to make it because he knows I will show up and he can count on me. It sounds like such a small thing and it probably is but it feels really good to be thought of as having it together enough to cover for someone when they really need it.  ..Anyway I just wanted to share a positive experience that I believe is directly tied to my sobriety. Thanks to everyone here for being so kind and so inspiring and truly helping those of us that are struggling. I hope you all have a lovely day and a lovely weekend and of course I will not be drink with you :)

Feels gooddoesn't it? I can totally relate.  I show up do extra work and make myself useful instead of being unreliable and marginal.  Congrats!
Thank you for sharing! It's such a credit to you that others recognize your dependability  .
