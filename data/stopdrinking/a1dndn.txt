Today is day 3 of being sober after a week long bender.  It was a relapse.  I had 2 months sobriety after a stint in the er for detox.  I had to go again last sunday.  This was my third time through withdraws and trips to the er.  Im tired of this shiit. Let the days keep comming.

Sounds really similar to my story. It's pretty amazing how confident you can feel while you're doing great and how humble you can feel after relapsing.
