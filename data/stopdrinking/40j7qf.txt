I relapsed again this weekend. Got bored and somehow convinced myself that the only way I could have fun would be to drink. Dusting myself off and going to try this again. Get sober attempt #3. I know I can do this. I refuse to let alcohol have this power over me. Sober me is someone I really like. Drunk me is someone I don't really like.

Glad to have you back! 
What is going to be different this time?
unfriend drunk you
There are like 10 day one people today! Welcome back
It's not uncommon to need a couple kicks at the can  but the more time you can spend being the person you like the happier and more successful your life will be.  We're pulling for you!!   
I'm right there with you. I can't seem to get it but I don't want to give up. Anyway gotta keep trudging along
It's okay to fall while learning to stand as long as you get right back up.
