Here nursing my last bottle and struggling with the concept of it being gone. Booze has been my best friends since I can remember. I don't know how I am actually going to do this.

I had to stop putting alcohol in my body no matter what. I had to get thru the withdrawls cravings and emotional swings. I had to get support and never look back. IWNDWYT
You touched on how I felt. Alcohol was a great lover and I didn't want to quit. We had such good times together and I could do things with it that would have been difficult without. Who would want to leave a great relationship? ..Except that it wasn't so great. Alcohol helped me make consistently bad decisions. The worst things I've done to others and myself were done under the influence. It was beginning to effect my body in negative ways. ..It's easy to remember the fun parts of a relationship especially with a lover as dynamic alcohol. Part of the quitting process was grieving for a lover I could not be with anymore...one I desperately wanted but would be my doom if things continued.
