I hit 200 days sober today. (Flair is a little off)...There's this feeling I get. I don't know what to call it. Peace maybe? It comes over me when I think about how I never have to feel like I did back then if I just stay sober. I never have to wake up wondering if I've finally done permanent damage to my body/relationships/job/soul. I never have to feel like there's a fucking inevitability to my drinking and self destruction. Not any more. Never again. ..Just wanted to say a very sincere "Thank You SD". This place is my support group and I come here every day to listen to you wonderful striving courageous people tell your stories. Thank you...And if you're struggling just know that it's possible to quit and it's absolutely worth it. It's worth the madness of the first few weeks sober. It's worth the missed nights at the bar with friends. It's worth it. ..Peace friends. Lets not drink today. ..&amp;#x200B;
