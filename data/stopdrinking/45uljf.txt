Good Morning/Afternoon!    .      .*Theme*: Acting as if..**"We are what we pretend to be so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.     .  [Kurt Vonnegut] (http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13719-we-are-what-we-pretend-to-be-so-we-mustl)**  .   .*What I get from it*: .There are so many versions of this piece of wisdom out there.  I find this one empowering.  I can't always be responsible for my thoughts but I get to decide how I act.  Whenever I was in the grocery store during my first month of sobriety it was a huge struggle to stay away from the booze aisles.  La Croix shared an aisle with beer so I would have to consciously avert my eyes.  I probably didn't seem like an alcoholic to the cashier since I wasn't buying any alcohol but if someone could have looked into my mind they would see how strong a hold alcohol had on me.  Same goes for how I treat others.  If I override my impulses and act like a considerate person I slowly notice how I can help other people at work/in my personal life.  Usually by just acting right my thinking becomes right too.  I can be a better person by just pretending to be one.    .I realize this quote is pretty similar to one from last week.  Will mix it up tomorrow. ...Have an awesome day all!

Two thumbs up for Kurt Vonnegut!
You are a terrific quote curator! ..Thanks for taking on this service position that /u/KetoJam and /u/i_noticed_you did so lovingly and with such dedication before you. You've taken up their mantle with thoughtfulness and sincerity. 
so good! thank u/larry_sellers
Thanks for the post
This idea isn't about faking it lying or being disingenuous. This idea helped me a lot. I was directed early on to do things for others that were contrary to my nature. I did dishes took out trash cleaned house etc (all of them daily). I cooked breakfast for my family on Thanksgiving even! These "actions" changed how I felt about caring for my family. Over time I have found the action becomes part of my routine and part of my way of thinking. No longer contrary to my nature. I don't always do it perfectly and I am no saint but each day I choose to do the next right action is a day I am working towards a better version of myself. Happy Monday!
this is a much more eloquent translation of "fake it til you make it." like when I wake up feeling crappy I put on some really nice clothes and pretend that I'm a successful businesslady who kicks ass at work. then eventually I *become* her and forget about my cramps or exhaustion or whatever...when I was drinking I romanticized the dark emo artsy life. it was more interesting (???) than being stable and collected. thrilling almost. in a way I pretended to be that girl for so long that I became her and lost touch with many of my positive desires and characteristics...sobriety is showing me who I really am all pretenses and substances aside. my healthy behaviors (which were buried pretty deep) are becoming the norm...thanks for this great quote.
I love this quote.  There's a self-awareness exercise I've done with people called "I pretend."  ..* I pretend I'm not angry when I am.* I pretend I'm happy when I'm not.* I pretend to like people when I don't..I have to be very mindful of my "pretends" because they generally make me less authentic.  Being sober for me is about stepping more and more into the me I want to be all the way around.  I guess I do have some "fake it until I make it" pretends but  I'm at least trying to be mindful of them and consciously (as opposed to unconsciously) act my way forward into my better self.
