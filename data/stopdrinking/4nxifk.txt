First off today is only day two of deciding to be sober so I haven't really talked to anyone other than my husband about it (which went amazingly well he disagreed that I have a problem but supports me in wanting to not have drinks in the house for a while). So today I went to my mothers house for brunch and on the way out while I was gathering my things she asked me if I'd like to play a video game with her when I get home that we have been trying to complete for a few weeks. I agree and she tells me to grab a bottle of beer or vodka from the corner street on the way home because its more fun playing with me when I'm drinking (its a scary game and alcohol gives me confidence to kill zombies lol). I told her ok and just kinda brushed it off then on my way out she tells me to not forget to get beer a few more times. My mom doesn't know that I've been struggling with beer lately and I don't want to have to admit to her that I think I do have a problem actually so its not like she's trying to screw me up. It's just how we play that game. But now I'm trying to justify drinking because my mom told me to and I don't want her to think somethings up and all those mental gymnastics I do when I want to have a drink. I know I will not be drinking today. But man its amazing to see how much justification I can come up with for drinking. I didn't notice it before. ..I will NOT drink today.

Congratulations on not drinking. I was lucky I could be open with my family. It's nice not to have to hide. And I got the same response.. you don't have a drinking problem. But I was drinking 2-3 glasses a day and that's too much for me. For those people who I'm not ready to tell yet I think I might make up an excuse. Weight loss or antibiotics seem to be excuses that people use a lot.
