**the test**...3AM on a Friday morning and I'm just biking home from a long day downtown. Last year I couldn't imagine doing this kind of physical activity once a year. These days I'm doing it just to get around. I'm fascinated with the scale and potential of my days - the people in them. There seems to be this gentle invisible hand that guides my healing spirit through the maze. So long as I don't torture myself the world doesn't seem to torture me...It sometimes all seems too good to be true and it makes me nervous and suspicious because in the past when anything seemed too good to be true it always was a lie of some kind. I didn't want my reality to be anything smaller than I was making it out to be. I hoped my mind wasn't building imaginary foundations for it to be taller and mightier than it was. The truly promising nature of how far life has come can only suggest that maybe - just maybe it gets even better...I'm amazed at how quickly things can change for the better if you really work for them. Only a few months ago I was overweight mentally handicapped a high- blood pressure ridden adult child at the fair sipping on warm vodka from a plastic bottle trying to gauge how drunk I needed to be to maintain my calm during the flight of an intense ride. This year I was looking forward to going back to the fair off meds and booze so I could really feel the rides. Everything in the world seems to have gotten more real...I visited my doctor after a good couple of months off my mood stabilizer and antipsychotic. I noticed a slight increase in the general volume of life and my passions. I sat in the chair and tried to let him know that I'm okay that I've made a decision now not to drink. I didn't make any promises about the future but for now I had decided not to drink. Sobriety had eliminated the need for psychotic medications. It had lowered my blood pressure. I'd lost weight. I was stable... So.  He said.  I will continue to be available to you should you need to call and make an appointment. But if you do not call I will assume the best...It was then that I realized that in all of my attempts to take care of myself by seeing doctors the best thing they can possibly tell you is that they don't need to see you again.  Ok. Wow.  Not needing a follow-up appointment was a good thing in this situation... The only prescription I have for you is an exercise I want you to do ten times a day.  I nod enthusiastically and follow his instructions.  Have you ever heard of PYB exercises?  I shake my head.  Well this is how they work. You extend your hand out forward with your palm up.  I sat there with my arm stretched out in front of me following along seriously.  Raise it straight up above your head. And then smack yourself behind your shoulder.  ..By the time I finish doing the motion I realize he has a huge grin on his face.  Huh?  I ask... Pat yourself on the back.  My doctor said...So this is what sanity feels like. It's steady and calm a little bit uncomfortable and slightly nauseating when you drink too much coffee. The process of digesting the change that has happened in my life has only just begun. I aim to make living more bearable in general to get through the difficult days to make way for the best most precious moments. The time really has come to not just make some serious changes but to live them. I have made a decision about alcohol in my life and I have to live that decision daily....I went to Toronto for the Young People's Conference. My childhood friend Portia had just moved into a fantastic apartment right in the downtown core. I didn't think I could sit and listen to panel discussions and speakers on addiction all day and night so I circled a few events and decided to plan little excursions into the real world throughout the day. I never got too far. I ended up attending every panel and speaker I could. I listened to some fascinating stories and met new people   the people on the kind of journey I'm on in tune with my frequency...Then I left before the  sober rave  began and walked down Yonge street with my headphones on in awe at all of the rising construction and the feeling of big city life. I'd lived 6 years in New York City but this was a new kind of sensation. The lights the traffic and the people were a little too overwhelming. When I finally got to my friend Portia's apartment building I had come to realize I may be having my first panic attack in sobriety. This didn't scare me as much as it used to because I knew I was taking good care of myself. I knocked on the door to her apartment... Come in!  She yelled... Hi wow nice place!  I spoke politely but quickly desperate for a wave of calm... Hey  Meet my friend.  I don't remember her name I just remember wanting to be alone and lie down. I walked into the kitchen to pour a glass of water and there on the counter was two bottles of flavored vodka and tasty mixers. It was the perfect medicine for my present state of un-ease.  Do you mind if we drink ?  And now I was being asked for permission to drink. How did I get myself into this situation? Should I call for help? Should I just run?.. I don't  I don't care I'm not like that. Drink do what you want. Enjoy. I want to be fun. I just need to sit down for a second. I don't want to alarm you but I think I'm having some kind of anxiety attack.  Being my childhood friend I felt familiarity and I felt safe around her. .. I know what that's like  Do you have like clonazepam or something?  The last thing I wanted was to reach for a pill bottle when life felt a little off. It was my chance to handle this naturally. I sat down and curled up on her couch head to the pillow. Her friend smoked a cigarette out the window next to me. All of these chemicals everywhere in this  real world' .. No I'm just going to lie down here for a minute. Don't mind me!  I was trying to have a panic attack as politely as possible. How Canadian of me...Portia and her friend whispered something to each other about me but I didn't care. .. Listen We're gonna go out. I'll stay at her place. Here are the keys. You can have my bed. Sleep well.  They left...They left me alone in a beautiful apartment overlooking the skyline and the CN tower's light show with two open bottles of vodka and a bathroom full of relaxing medications. Is this a test? I really do think to this day that it was a test. After a few minutes my mind quieted and calmed to a normal state. I was exhausted from the long day. I treated the booze like it didn't exist. I poured a glass of water and sat it next to the bed. I enjoyed the beautiful view for a few minutes. I did this new thing where I thank the universe just for existing and allowing me to exist in it. I fell asleep. ..When I woke up the following morning I went straight to the shower and straight out the door. I locked the door on that opportunity and tossed it on the receptionist's desk. I walked into the street and into another day of living. That's what I call sanity. I didn't pat myself on the back too much for it..	.Part 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/180xlq/personal_story_on_my_struggle_with_sobriety_in/..Previous Part: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/19m43i/four_ounces_of_courage_part_7_authenticity/..

Fantastic.  I love reading your posts.  Thanks for sharing.  And it sounds like you handled a potentially bad situation very well...Keep it up!
Great story and the best part is that it's true. Yes I think you passed this test. But there will be others. However this is at least a few bricks in your foundation for recovery. 
Thanks for sharing this it was just what i needed today.
Awesome.  Facing down two open bottles of vodka.  Man you aced that test.
Great great story. So do you think that your anxiety was related more to the people around you rather than the presence of the substances? Could be a clue there.
Nice story thanks for sharing. I would just love to have a friend in a big city to visit sounds like a great journey to go on. I suffer panic attacks too and it seems like you handled it very well! Well done dude keep it up.
