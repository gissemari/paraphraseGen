This is the best sub. I can truly say everyone's support here helped me make it this far and I am not turning back. I went to my first AA meeting today and got even more support. It's such a relief to finally communicate with people who understand my struggle.

Congratulations on Day 4!
Good job! IWNDWYT!
Congratulations!!! Those first few days were a real beast to get through!!! Congrats on big 4 you rock! ..IWMDWYT!!!
You have all the power necessary to do this.  You can do this for seven more years! How do I know this? ..&amp;#x200B;..Because if you did 4 then you can obviously do four again. Then that will be eight. Then 8 will be easy. Yo got this. Let's chat again in 4 days. 
Keep crushing it!
It's really something else when you realize that you're not alone in your struggle. There's a weight that gets lifted when you find a group of people that just "get it". I know I find strength in places like the AA rooms and here I with you well on this new chapter in your life and IWNDWYT.
Be strong   you can do one more..IWNDWYT 
First week is tough!  Add 1 more day!  Weekends are triggers so try to keep busy.  IWNDWYT 
Barely counts and helps you develop skills for the hard days. Way to go! 
You got it! Get through today and you'll be almost through the weekend. Plan some no drinking activities: movies hikes coffee etc. 
Keep it rolling buddy!
