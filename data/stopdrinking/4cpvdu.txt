----------immediate responses--------

On day three of sobriety Grateful to experience the sun today...it's so much crisper and clearer when not hungover. I'm grateful too for this community and for all the people who have helped me through so much suffering. It feels good to take back my life and be in control while at the same time admitting that I'm also powerless
I'm thankful that I can remember what the damage drinking can do to my well being and able to make it day by day 
I'm thankful for a lot. I spent so much time in alcohol-induced hazes trying to bury my nonexistent problems and celebrate nonexistent victories that I never stopped to appreciate what I had so I'm going to try and contribute to these threads as much as possible and start a new good habit. :)..I'm especially thankful for my fianc e the best person in my life. When I laid it all out on the table and told her about my problems with alcohol she didn't judge or accost me. She took all of the wine out of the fridge and poured it down the drain while she listened to me talk. When I was done she told me that she loved me was proud of me for making a change and would support me in any way that she could (including not drinking at all around me). That kind of unconditional love and support isn't always easy to come by and I'm thankful that I have it in my life.
Thankful for bikes good weather coming friends and family a good job. 
I'm grateful for the warmth and support and kindness and openness that I've discovered in the recovery community both here and in AA meetings. It's really true that the [opposite of addiction is connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg). I trusted alcohol to deal with my emotions. I didn't trust people. That was a really bad decision - it turned out I needed to be doing exactly the opposite...I'm grateful also for the untapped well of kindness and enthusiasm and reliability I've found within myself after I took alcohol out of the picture. I suit up and show up am early to meetings share make friends make the coffee clean up afterwards. I still can't believe it but last night when I got my 90-day chip at my home group (a women's group) some women were sharing about how I've become an important part of the group and they really appreciated my presence. I was just overwhelmed. My first instinct was to think they must be wrong I must be fooling them really deep down I'm not a good person. And then I realized that I'm a much better person when I'm sober. I'm grateful that I'm finally getting to grow outward in a positive way rather than just letting alcohol warp me and turn me inward into my own fears and resentments.
Today....Today I am just thankful for today. It's my 33rd day alcohol-free a week after my 33rd birthday which I celebrated with fondue and soda water. I think this is a good day :)
I am thankful to be sober and alive...I am thankful for my sober community. Between SD and meetings I have fostered real connections with real people.
Just thankful be alive and to have come so far in sobriety...I have never forgotten where I was prior to 9/16/15. I was in the Mariana Trench and now I'm safely above sea level able to get things done. One of the things AA groups emphasize on is "progress rather than perfection." I have certainly seen the progress over the last 6.5 months. I saw some good friends for the first since being in recovery and they were amazed at how I looked and said I don't look like the unabomber anymore. Also being able to help someone out who is within their first few days of sobriety I it gives me incentive to not fuck my sobriety up. ..Glad to be 197 days clean and sober and DON'T DRINK!
Wow what a beautiful compilation of thanks. Really thankful for this community to be here when I needed it the most. 
I FINALLY had a great sleep last night instead of wandering around the house like a ghost. It's another gorgeous sunny day that I am going to enjoy fully instead of wallowing in self-pity defeat and sickness. My head is clear and my energy levels are slowly returning. The million and one little things that seem so all important when I drink just don't matter today. I am so glad that when I found a full bottle in the house yesterday I turned around locked it up and walked away...that was a close one.  I am very grateful to be learning to live not just hanging on to stay alive largely due to SD and all the insight and wisdom I have read over the last few days. Thank you all.
Oh WOW that was awesome!!  Gave me shivers.  Great idea /u/finally_woken.  I am grateful today for you.  I am also thankful for the couple of sober friends I have who keep checking in with me a girlfriend who can discuss my sobriety needs and support me on this journey and my health and opportunity to grow and succeed if I want it.  And of course massive gratitude for this community.  I'm not sure I'd have made it this far without you guys!  Big love from Colorado.  xxxxooooo
I'm thankful my loved ones gave me a second chance and are actively supportive of my efforts to quit drinking. I'm thankful I didn't fall too hard and am now getting up better than ever.
I'm grateful I'm getting through this stressful week and haven't reached for alcohol :) 
I'm thankful for my wife and my parents who were the ones to sit me down and help me understand that I wasn't just killing myself (physically) but everyone else around me (emotionally). It wasn't just my problem like I'd been telling myself...it's everyone's problem. With their support and the support of everyone in SD I don't feel isolated anymore. I'm thankful for everyone in SD that shares their stories every day. The ones that are remarkably similar to my own. I'm not alone in this. 
I'm thankful for laughter. I have had more genuine full-bellied laughs these past few months than I've had in a long time. I'm beginning to see the comedy in everything again and I'm glad that I can laugh at myself.
Over three weeks in and I'm thankful I had the willpower to say "ENOUGH" and give my body this opportunity to reset. I'm thankful for you all for all of your positive and encouraging support! I'm thankful for waking up each morning healthy and able to face the day with clarity! I'm thankful that YOU are making a difference too! Toasting my coffee to you! 
I'm thankful for good friends who don't need to take shots on barstools just to have a good time with me. yesterday my best friend and I had coffee and a heartfelt talk while staring at the bay. we met up with another friend and his toddler and chased that bundle of joy around a kids' playground. then I had pizza and sasparilla (!) at my favorite joint with another friend who is also trying to "cut back." the support and warmth I've received during sobriety are so humbling. I can remember every single word of our amazing conversations. people warned me my social life would change but I didn't realize it would strengthen relationships like this. 
I'm thankful for this sub and the amazing people here. I truly believe I never would have made it without you...I'm thankful for my RL friends and family who have been supporting me through this. I never would have made it without them either...I'm thankful that I'm no longer craving alcohol and am able to see how much better off I am without it....I'm thankful that I made it through the rollercoaster of emotions that was my first 6 weeks of sobriety and passed my internships (2+3 weeks)...And lastly just because I'm feeling like writing something really corny I'm thankful there once lived a man named Siddharta Gautama today better known as the Buddha and for the countless people who have handed down his teachings for 2500 so that I can read them today. Getting into Buddhism has helped me get a much healthier and more realistic view on what I should expect from life and I think it has and still is making me a better person.
Went to the dentist today... I'm grateful for not having any cavities.
Thanks for putting that post together.  There's a lot of good stuff in there!
Today has been really hard for me and my partner. A couple of years after getting together eight years ago we were moving into our own place and were unable to come to an agreement about dining room furniture. In frustration my partner wanted to go to the humane society to pet the animals. I agreed and we went there...When we arrived a rabbit was in a pen at the front and was really curious and interested in us another was quietly yawning off in a cage on a table. She was interested in getting him so we went home researched and came back. This time the yawning bunny was in the pen with the curious bunny. She hid off in a corner a lot and let him explore ahead of her. The shelter had a two for one deal on cats so we asked if we could apply it to the bunnies. They talked with their manager and agreed largely because rabbits are best in pairs and the quiet ones are tougher to adopt...For eight years we've taken care of them with some minor medical hiccups here and there but they were largely okay especially the quiet one. Last night the quiet one had a seizure. We ran her to the vet who thought this might pass then suggested to keep an eye on her. This morning I had to drive my partner to the airport but we discovered she wasn't eating or drinking. I sent my partner off on her trip and brought the bunny to the vet. At 11:20 the vet called and let me know she passed...I haven't had a lot of death in my life. Largely because I've lived far from my family and these two were the only family pets I've had. I've had other sad experiences but usually alcohol numbed them and I got through. When my grandparents passed it was sad but alcohol numbed a lot of it and they were far away. ..I'm a couple weeks into sobriety and this has been hard. I've cried all day which I haven't done in years. I'm grateful that I can feel this and not bottle it up and away like I have other sad experiences. I'm also grateful for my bunny who as much as she was pretty fearful and kind of avoidant was kept from being killed in a shelter and we got to experience her. ..I'm working through grieving and it sucks but it's good to feel; it's good to be sober.
I been restore to sanity over the first drink. Drinking isn't a option today. There is a solution if you work it.
I am thankful for the most amazingly difficult eight months of sobriety. I am thankful for hot running water and not having to sleep in my vehicle. I am thankful for a steady income and the wealthy of love with my friends and family (including my pup).
