I've struggled with alcohol and substance abuse since I was 19 I'm 26 now. For a long time I never bothered to quit or cut back on my consumption but in the past year I've gone 6 months without drinking which was the longest since I was 19.   .Now in the past 2 weeks I've drank 4 times including tonight. I haven't been able to find peace from my demons my mistakes my traumas anything. Without alcohol I feel like a pathetic excuse for a human and with it I feel like myself. I don't know what that says about me but I know it's not right. I still live at home too and my parents watching me descend into this hellhole has taken its toll on them as well. Seeing them every day makes me feel so god damn guilty that I'm not a better son or even a better man. I know I can do better I don't really know what keeps me in this rut. I have ideas but there's nobody I can talk to nobody who really cares or would empathize or help. I really don't know what else to do now. I'm on a waiting list for a mental health facility but who knows how long that'll take to finalize. I don't know who I am without alcohol I don't like what I've become because of alcohol and yet I love alcohol. I feel awful.   ...Sorry for the rant.

AA meetings are filled with people who will listen and empathize.

I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
