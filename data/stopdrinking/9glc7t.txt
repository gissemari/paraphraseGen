I have been a steady drinker for years. My social life revolved around drinking all of my relationships involved drinking or a drug of some sort. It took time but I cleaned that aspect of my life up: no drugs  no toxic relationships. The drinking stayed however...At this point I am 31 years old. I have a year left towards an EE degree. I still cannot stop drinking. Years of substance abuse has left me with a very intense depression and anxiety disorder. The drinking exacerbates this I know but I can't stop. ..My drinking is affecting everything in my life. I am skipping classes that I should not be skipping. I am lax on homework and studying because I am drinking. My hands shake constantly my stomach is always upset. I begin every morning vomiting up bile in the shower. And worst of all suicidial ideations are creeping in. ..How do I break this cycle? I have had a six month stretch of sobriety before I know that all it takes for me is a day or two sober to realize the change. I just struggle to reach that one day sober mark. Some days are 51-49 drinking vs not drinking. Others like today are 90-10. Does anyone have advice to get back on track?

Hey it sounds like a Dr would be a great place for you to start so they can help make sure you can detox safely and work with you on the depression piece too.

For me I couldn't do it alone...I had a ton of support (doctors counselors meetings SD etc.) and I felt much more comfortable knowing that I wasn't alone; I met and interacted with people who have 'been there and done that'. Feedback from old timers? Priceless...Any chance you can see a doctor?.
