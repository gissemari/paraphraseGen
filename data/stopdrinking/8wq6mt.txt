I apologize that this will be long but I need to type/write to get this out because these feelings are totally fucking with me. ..My bio mom (BM) and bio dad (BD) had me when they were 19 years old. They had a shotgun wedding  but not long after I was born BD split. BM met an AMAZING man the man who raised me and who is my "real" father. ..To put it mildly BM is a total piece of shit and she split after a few years. Cheated on my dad total alcoholic (the only thing I inherited from her - thanks ma) liar manipulator. I have no contact with her as of 6 years ago when I banned her from my wedding. ..Before BM split she and my dad worked together to get BD to sign over his parental rights so my dad could adopt me. Thank friggen g-d otherwise I'd have been stuck with that trainwreck of a mother. ..I have never ever had ANY contact with BD. After I turned 18 I did have some contact with his parents (my bio grandparents). They were quite old and it turns out my dad  and grandmother kept them updated about me through letters and pics as I was growing up. My dad/gma felt that it was unfair to them that they basically lost a grandkid because of their kid's decisions. We didn't have a long time together because I only got in touch with them in 2002 and they both died in 2005. ..Due to basic human curiosity I've googled BD's name over the years tried to figure out what I could about him - he has basically no social media presence and I have not learned really any more about him other than his address. As I didn't want to contact him I never searched for more. ..Today my dad (who raised me) called me and said he received a message on facebook - which I'm not on - from my biological aunt; the sister of my bio dad. He struggled with whether or not to tell me about it because he wasn't sure how I'd feel but decided I should know - she was getting in touch because BD died last week. ..When he told me I had literally zero emotional response. Unless you count feeling bad for my dad because I know he struggled with telling me. (Not because he didn't want me to know; because he didn't want to upset me). Honestly there was a part of me that felt relieved as I was always kind of worried he'd show up on my doorstep someday. ..So...alllll of this to say I'm struggling really hard right now. I don't feel like drinking but I'm feeling really fucked up right now. I don't care he's dead/I feel like I should care (even though I shouldn't?). I feel bad for my dad (the one who raised me) for having to be the one who had to deliver the news. ..Part of me wants to get in touch with his family that I can because he was only in his early 50s - what if his death is something genetic and I need to worry about it? ..I just don't know what else to say and I don't know where else to talk about this until my AA meeting at 6:30am tomorrow.

Hang in there kiddo. I think the man that raised you is fine.  ..IWNDWYT 
I think all those feelings are natural and normal (and still a lot to process). Relief kind of caring not really caring guilt over not really caring all of it.  I too have bio family and real family and have experienced some deaths and a similar range of emotion and non-emotion.   Sending support and understanding.
