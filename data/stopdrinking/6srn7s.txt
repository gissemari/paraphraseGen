hey just thought I would introduce myself. I have been lurking here a while and just wanted to thank you all for talking about your issues with drinking because i have been a few months without drinking I worry that in future i will use the same excuses again to start drinking...i.e. 'i can handle it now' 'i will only have a couple every now and again socially' 'i wont be a toolbag when i drink' 'whats the difference when you already drove most people away with drinking habits'..Reading your guys posts and comments really helps me remember why I shouldnt think that next time will be any different than last time. My living situation is about to change (moving in wiht someone who does drink and shouldnt as financially I really have no other option) and I will probably be on here more often for chatting and help reminding myself im not alone in my struggle. ..Thanks guys keep up the awesome work from a lurker..
