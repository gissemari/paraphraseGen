----------immediate responses--------

Woo-hoo!  Congrats on the new wonderful relationship!  That's great...Triumph: Life is great!  We're getting more and more Spring-like days allowing me to go outside and play tennis.  Even though my wife is stressed out about things it feels good to know that I'm not one of her stressers.  I feel great physically.  I feel solid in my sobriety: I am simply a non-drinker...Struggle: None..General chat: We're getting 20F temps overnight tonight... What's up with that?.

Snow storm seems to be missing us.  Not sure about trip to prison tonight though as  rain may freeze and do not like to drive on ice. That kind of stunt was easier when drunk and wheeeeee!..Life is good now if I can get going on the novel that is really constipated...  
Triumph: almost two weeks!.Struggle: felt like drinking and smoking last night.  I don't even smoke.  What's up with that? Alcoholic brains are awesome at remembering college courses when you least expect them to with regard to dopamine releasers.  .General chat: going camping this weekend.  Never been without a bottle or five of wine in tow but I told my gf and we are going to bike and cook up a storm. Looking forward to it!
**Triumph**: Went through some major emotional stuff yesterday with*out* the urge to pick up a drink!!! W00t!!! Instead journaled went to a meeting and let the sun hit my face (because apparently it's a good for you drug ;) ).**Struggle**: Keeping up with homework work sleep and my somewhat-of-a-social life without going completely crazy. .**General Chat**: I'm *so* glad I discovered this sub. I seriously just want to post here all the time. I may be going a little crazy with it but loving the opportunity to!!! ..Congratulations on your wonderful relationship!!!..I was actually wondering about relationships in *early* sobriety or whether many relationships stem out of AA meetings and mutual sobriety. NOT that I'm considering it but I've noticed some people in my home group that seem....*ahem*...closer than others. 
Triumph: I don't feel dead inside and I've achieved a few things today...Struggle: I have a mountain of things left undone that I need to sort out...General chat: Thanks for this helpful forum. It helps me to see that I'm not the only one. It gives me strength..
Triumph: Made it to an AA meeting last night right after work even though I was exhausted and didn't really want to go...Struggle: Really bitter mood for the past few days. I am trying to let go of the little things that normally don't bother me but I am worried I am just suppressing my anger rather than letting go of it. I'm physically and emotionally spent...General chat: Thought I had finally found an available therapist that could work with my crazy work schedule but now she's stopped responding to me...feeling a little let down.
Triumph:1. I'm sober .2. My 14 year old daughter got accepted to the "creative writing" program of our local but nationally recognized high school for the arts!  Struggle: Nothing as of right now feelin pretty good. General chat: Why don't you guys all come down to sunny Florida? We've been here 16 years I could never go back to snow! It's paradise!!!
Triumph - Intense feelings (anger sadness) cropping up this week.  People/events from my past crossing my path and/or my mind and see below.  Have gone through all kinds of ways to deal with it and *not once* has drinking crossed my mind as a serious option.  Every time I've thought of it it's been like "Yay that I don't feel compelled to drink poison on top of everything else."  I feel very FREE...Struggle - Friday I will be filing a serious lawsuit against the university where I completed an MAT program (but was denied a diploma and teacher certification.)  During my previous career as a lawyer I've filed several lawsuits and defended many more but this is the first time I've ever filed one with myself as the plaintiff.  I regard lawsuits as a last resort so I've used every possible option to resolve the matter without going to court.  The wrongdoing is extremely clear and so is the motivation (bias based on sexual orientation).  I feel angry and sad and somewhat puzzled that the university has chosen to stonewall me and force me into court.  But I am slowly learning how to stomach feelings of justified anger without turning to binge drinking as a crutch...Chat:  I got some serious motorcycle riding in this week!  That helps!
Triumph: I'm six days sober since my slip-up. I was afraid I would immediately fall into old patterns again but so far so good!..Struggle: I'm a teacher and almost all of my seniors are late with their research papers. I'm not sure if this gets worse every year or if I'm just getting old...General chat: A glitch on my cell phone caused me to believe it was 48F this morning so I walked to work. It was actually around 20F. I wondered why I kept seeing all that ice:D
Triumph: Rode about 100 miles so far on a new road bike i got last week got in 36 miles yesterday before the snow today (Ohio).Struggle: Senior in college and found out I have to stay another semester.General: Ready for spring
Went to my first AA meeting with a longtime friend this eve. Came out happier for it. Feel very positive
Triumph: i ended a relationship one month ago and this week i finally let it go. I saw her and talked to her and i'm ok with it not a single feeling of sadness! I see our pictures and i only find them cute and remember the good times nothing more no more regrets no more anger no more anything!..I don't think i had any downsides this week. Everything is ok.

Triumph: That seemingly lifelong self-loathing feels like it's dissipating. Today I caught myself thinking that I am awesome... this is never a thought I would have entertained in a million years. Starting to really feel like I love myself for what seems like the first time in my adult life. Or really life in general...Struggle: Hmm things are going okay. I guess a struggle is that I am only at 18 days sober after relapsing and do not feel proud of this number. Also need to work on being more in the moment. Feeling tired a lot.. is it okay to be *this* obsessed with sleep? 
Triumph:  37 days sober and feeling so much better mentally..Struggle: Cannot stop eating sweets since I quit drinking..General chat: Anyone have any tips on how to stop eating ice cream and chocolate?  I never had this big a sweet tooth before!
Triumph: Going to rehab tomorrow!!!!!.Struggle: I'm pretty scared!!!!!..See y'all in a while.
Everything is awesome that's all.
