Good luck to you!
There goes my hero.
That first proclamation makes it feel real...iwndwyt 
I won't drink with you today! Life is pretty sweet on the other side of all those wretched hangovers.
Be the hero in your story...We are all rooting for you. Come back often!!
Let's get it! I messed up bad a couple days ago as well but a few days sober in I can tell you I already feel much better. I'd say that my first day sober I woke up with like 300 percent anxiety and now it's down to like 30. From past experiences it takes about two weeks for anxiety to go to 0 waking up. Anyhow the most important thing is that once the shame guilt and embarrassment goes away and people forgive and forget you gotta keep on not drinking. At that point I check in here and read new stories daily as I can relate to just about any of them. People forgive and forget and after that you gotta drive yourself to continue staying sober. This community is great
