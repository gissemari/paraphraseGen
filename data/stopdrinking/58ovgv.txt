several days in and i still visit here at least a couple times daily. struggling to find a cohesive idea to post about for myself so i havent been but the fallout has largely subsided and i made a potential bad situation employment wise into a great win. focusing on being happy and sober and that is working but while this sub is a great first layer of support and mindfulness my wife is skeptical and thinks it is a shortcut. dont know if or how to respond to that. i go to aa weekly but i just like going and listening. mybwife wants me to proactively tell her about the meeting after i go but to me there usually isnt any groundbreaking share or anything that i can tell her about - theres just a value in simply gling there and seeing people that im not sure she understands. she wants me to have a deisgnated day wherein i share with her how my week has been which is supposed to help her hear about things without having to ask (she hates having to ask in general). i worry that i will lose the value i get from aa by having this 'homework' where i feel i have to bring her some piece of information. any ideas here? not drinking today obvi.

Kudos for 16 days!..Why not suggest that she go to Alanon meetings a support group for friends and family of alcoholics? See /r/Alanon. Then she would have a better idea what you are experiencing...We need to be patient with loved ones who are really scared we're going to drink again. We don't know what we've put them through when we were drinking. So if sharing with her is reassuring try to do it. Or go out to eat or to a movie--have a date night. Whatever we can do to make our loved ones less fearful we are going to relapse is well worth the time and energy...
I think it's actually a wonderful idea to sit down and talk with your spouse once a week. We really should do it more often! Maybe you could just talk to her about how you're feeling find out how she's doing make plans for the upcoming month...I think as alcoholics a lot of us isolated and closed in on ourselves so our significant others feel like getting to know us again which is certainly a good thing...better than having them leave us! Best wishes.
