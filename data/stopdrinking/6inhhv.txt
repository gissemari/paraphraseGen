There is a saying in 12-step rooms that problems with money and sex are the main causes of relapse. How are you dealing with these challenges? ..I left a 15-year relationship and moved across the country last summer. Six months ago bought a house which used up most of my savings. I'm self-employed and not earning as much as I need to. And I've started a new relationship. It feels like a lot! Any thoughts about how you managed money and relationships without drinking?

I've been reflecting on the role drinking has played in my life over the years and I realized that I often started drinking regularly when a relationship was going south. Instead of facing that fact or confronting my feelings or leaving or whatever needed to be done. ..I also see that drinking caused the problem to be magnified if only bc it was avoided and thus festered. I think fear kept me from confronting things. A lack of confidence in myself. ..Sometimes I'd be with a jerk and drink to ignore that fact. Oy. Of course the roots of these issues go way back...I wish I could've told my younger self that drinking will not make things easier or solve anything. I don't know exactly what I will do next time these types of issues arise except that I WILL NOT DRINK. ..This probably was not helpful! 
I am more broke than I have been in several years. Due to a cross country move. I am downsizing where I can; cell phone thinking about a smaller condo etc. and trying to find innovative ways to lower my costs and look for a better paying job in my field- my company is notorious for underpaying. ..I just got out of a short lived abusive relationship. As fucked up as it sounds- I miss him. I have been re-enacting these crappy choices in men my whole adult life. I am reading "Healing the Shame that Binds You" and I am going to my first Adult Children of Alcoholics meeting tomorrow night. I attribute my poor choices in men to having an abusive alcoholic father. I am staying single for awhile while I pursue my healing journey. ..For the first time in my life I was able to walk away from an abusive partner despite caring deeply for them. Normally I stay in hopes things will get better. They never once have. This is progress. ..I won't drink today.
