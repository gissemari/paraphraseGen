42 days today and I'm traveling for work and there's literally booze everywhere. And it just happens to also be my bday week. I go to get a Mani/pedi and the "waitess" comes to take my drink order while I get my spa pedicure. I know that AA says not everyone drinks and it only seems that way but nah I feel like MOST people drink. It's a culture thing more than anything else. I struggled to say no but I did say no thank u she kept pushing and I kept saying no and no'd myself out of even getting water lol.Then I went to dinner and my friend drank and I struggled to say no again but I said no and sat there drinking (and enjoying) my Virgin strawberry daquiri. I haven't had one of those since I was a kid and it was just as good as I remember it. Temptation is everywhere but my greatest temptation I face is from within. ..That's all. .Good night

I hear ya it does seem like booze is everywhere...like people can't be normal without it...But you my friend are doing fabulous! Keep up the awesome work:)
Happy birthday! The weirdest place I encoutered alcohol was at... My gyno. They have wine there and offer it multiple times during your visit. Way too many drunk people in that office for it being 10am.  
Good job. I'm earlier in my journey and really dreading going out to dinner with my friends again. They all drink so much.
