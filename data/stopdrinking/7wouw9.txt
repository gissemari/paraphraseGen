I made a post a few days ago and went to my first AA meeting. I thought that I just had a problem with alcohol abuse but it's been 3 days since that first day of sobriety and not touching alcohol has been a much bigger struggle than I thought possible. I realize I am an alcoholic but I plan on staying a sober one!..To day 4 of the rest of my life!!

3 days is a great start! I think you'll find that with enough time there will be days where you go 24 hours without thinking of alcohol. It happens to a lot of us. Just saying it may get easier! Stay sober!
It gets easier honest. Fuck the diet out of the window and eat some cheese or ice cream if you like. The only thing you have to worry about at the moment is not drinking. 
Me too. Welcome to the group of people who have a manageable chronic disease called alcoholism. No shame it can be managed and lead a normal life jyst like anyone else. Good job congratulations on opening upnit took 20 years and ablot of vourage i admire andvrsspect your honesty. Keep at it it really pays off! Iwndwyt
