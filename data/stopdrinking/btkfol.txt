So it's day one once again. I relapsed after 10 days Saturday. Now I'm finally sobering up shaking and depressed as shit. ..I checked my phone I'd gone on a message rampage and phoned my ex begging to talk to him to which he didn't even respond. ..Just wanted to vent

You can't get to day 2 without day 1... don't beat yourself up it's all part of the same journey. This time shoot for a whole month..And delete your ex's number!
Glad you're here...Looking forward to hearing more about your journey.
I was 11 days then back to day 1 just as things started to feel better. I hate alcohol let's beat it together.
Hey I know that feeling. But I also know the power you have over that feeling because you're right back here with us for another day. Don't worry about ten days or twenty just focus on today and you've already made a great decision to come back here and not drink with us. ..I'm happy you're here and I will not drink with you today!
Don't beat yourself up. New day...I've relapsed more than I've drank....But it does not stop me trying. My longest time off was 3 years
Not sure my comment made sense....But basically never stop stopping...
Going through the depression as well. Good luck iwndwyt.
