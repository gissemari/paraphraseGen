But the real challenge lays in day 9 because that is payday. The few times in the last 6 Years that I managed to make it 3 or 4 days the temptation demon whatever is always so overwhelming once I get paid...I have a good feeling about this time. I've been forcing down good food eating chocolate when I want and am keeping my apartment clean (which in my case is both SO important in preventing a relapse and also so rare and difficult)..Everyone! I will not drink with you today!

I enjoyed seeing money in the bank.  That helped.  A lot!  Cha-Ching!!!! 
We  re always here to help. I understand what you're saying. Just keep saying no to alcohol 1 day at a time 
Great job! I am on day 7 as well. IWNDWYT.
Treat yourself to a nice meal. Perhaps a nice steak or whatever premium food you prefer
