I'm sitting here sick to my stomach and disappointed in myself. I had gone 35 day's without drinking and relapsed today. I a bought and drank 2 pints of Mike's harder lemonade and am sitting here very disappointed in myself. I'm on naltrexone and had been doing very well I barely got buzzed and it wasn't fun and I'm already feeling like crap. I'm not going to go buy any more just going to lay down and try to go to sleep really early. Thanks for listening hopefully I'll make it longer next time.

You're on the right path. It didn't all go perfectly for me either. There were lots of false starts and hurdles. Eventually I joined AA and that has been working well.
That's almost a tenth of a year!  Not a bad test run.
I'm sorry you're struggling. As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
