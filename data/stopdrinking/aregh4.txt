Hello to all!..&amp;#x200B;..What to say? I have been on this board for approximately seven months. Initially it started out as an interest or experiment to truly see if it could have any effect on my constant efforts to ditch the booze for good. As time has gone by I have become truly humbled by you all. Yes there has been drawbacks and struggles and the occasional relapse. However in the present day I am a month and a half sober with a clearer and much improve outlook on where I am going. ..&amp;#x200B;..It is fair to say that I love you guys. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do. Every single one of you are incredible and I wish you luck in kicking alcohol's ass!  ..&amp;#x200B;..I will certainly not be drinking with you today!!!

I couldn't have written it better myself.  Even at day 2 this is how I feel.   ..I started this journey in July.  I'm a completely different person.   I've had my ups and small downs but over all I've changed my life. ..Thank you for this post it hit home!..IWNDWYT ..
