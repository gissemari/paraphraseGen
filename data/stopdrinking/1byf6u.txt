I'm fucking up in school and I'm really becoming apathetic. I keep telling myself I'll take a break from drinking but it only last 5 or so days. I know I shouldn't tell myself that I'm done for good because I'll just get upset when I relapse but I haven't even been able to make it a week. My roommates often drink and just seeing them drinking makes me so thirsty. I think I've got some underlying anxiety/depression issues that I've been self-medicating with but I just can't drag myself to therapy or a specialist. It's a vicious cycle that sucks a lot. . .And every time I see my /r/stopdrinking badge it's just a reminder that I didn't actually make it..

Are you going to AA...You know you can stop for a while on your own; get help on the days you can't stop on your own.
