**Theme**: Friendship...**Quote:** ."Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another:  What! You too? I thought I was the only one." - C.S. Lewis *The Four Loves*..**What I get from it:**.For me my drinking career was an isolating one even if it didn't start that way. By the time I had sobered up I was desperately confused and twisted and turned upside down and felt horribly and irrevocably *alone*. Between AA meetings and the wonderful posts here in SD I felt shock (and then amazement) that other stories other people's words mimicked my own. At my highest moments I began to find myself making deep and meaningful connections with wonderful people that I love and am loved by. At my lowest it has offered me hope and way out of the isolating self-hatred and cynicism. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that SD helped save my life. From the Check-in to everyone's shares I find that in reading your stories I hear my own. ..It is that kinship and recognition that has kept me finally away from relapse and reintegrated me into society and a world of human relationships. ..Have a wonderful day everyone!

We all have so much in common!  If I'm open to others a world unfolds!..(Love C.S. Lewis)
