Hey all 50 days. A few days ago my very close friend had a hart attack. He is fighting for his life right now in the ICU. I am not drinking. Not happy or proud of that at all I just feel deeply sad and anxious at the moment. Life keeps slapping me in the face. Drinking won't help I know that I have no cravings. I just wish life could be a little bit kinder to me sometimes. I've lost so many people including my own husband a few years ago.  I know everybody has struggles an horrible things happening but sometimes I just don't get time to breathe between funerals of really really young people. Life can be so cruel. I hope my find survives and I hope I can keep the strength myself to not give up hope that someday life HAS to get better for me. Thank you for reading I hope I don't come across as a whiny person. Sorry if I am. IWNDWYT

I'm so sorry it is tough right now.  I've lost a lot of people in my life in a short period of time...my mom and dad died two months apart.  I know how hard it is just to keep going.  ..You should be very proud you are sober. Sobriety gives me the strength to face what life throws at me. I'm sending positive thoughts your way! Congratulations on 50! IWNDWYT 
Big hugs Cato.  In a really difficult situation I'm sure it really matters that you can be present and there during this time.. it must also be frightening for him and I have no doubt it's good for him to have a friend like you around.  In the midst of tragedy and fear there may also be great peace and strength.  Courage friend.  I won't drink with you today too.
