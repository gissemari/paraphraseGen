Well this girl I'd been hung up on for ages has started dating someone else... no one to blame except myself and alcohol. .I'm at work struggling to concentrate after hearing the news only been here 3 weeks and they probably think I'm an emotional mess felt so low overshared in hindsight I'm so stupid

That sucks about the girl but if it was me I'd maybe try and look at things from another angle. If she's seeing someone else that would be one less thing to distract me while I concentrate on making myself better. Remember you're still in early days of sobriety and your emotions are probably going to be all over the place. Focus on you. Be selfish dammit...As for what the people at work think? Meh. You've only been there 3 weeks they're opinion of you is still in the infant stage. There's plenty of time to show them the real sober you...Hang in there. There's always hope!.
Nope.  Not stupid.  Struggling.  And that makes you human.  Keep on keeping on friend.
