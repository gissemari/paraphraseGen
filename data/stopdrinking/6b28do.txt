Longtime lurker rarely a poster.  I made a post about a month ago stating my intention to quit again but I was withdrawing and didn't make it through the day.  ..Today (Saturday depending on your location) marked my 14th day of full sobriety.  Being that my 15th day started about 40 minutes ago my phone app tells me I have 360 hours of sobriety.  My most recent relapse lasted about 4-6 months and so 360 hours in a row is the longest I've strung together since sometime back in November.   ..Anyway I just wanted to share my progress so far with a community that I've come to greatly respect even with this being my first real post here.  Reading your posts is kind of like meetings in between meetings.  Thanks for being here.
