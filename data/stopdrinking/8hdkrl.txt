So here I am I'm on my last few sips of a drink I only found this subreddit recently and have been watching on the side wanting to cut back but finding it hard. I'm not sure why I drink at this point just drink to drink and enjoying a mild buzz. Like many of us who have struggled with drinking I am tired of looking at my bank account and looking at things I could do and can do but can't because I'm wasting it on alcohol let alone the damage I'm doing to my body. I would really like everybody support in this I'm going to keep everybody posted but from here on out I'm going to take a long break at least on drinking it's not that I'm looking to quit completely it's that I'm looking to take a long break and then be able to moderate it so that I can only have one or two drinks once in a blue moon on special occasions. Is that reasonable or should I just quit completely.

I found for me abstinence was the answer.  My sojourns into one or two here or there ultimately led to full-on  backsliding.  I choose to forgo the drinks to avoid even the possibility.
&gt;I'm on my last few sips of a drink right now...As outlined in the community guidelines we ask that you only post when you have not been drinking. For this reason we had to remove your post. But we'll be here tomorrow if you want to come back then.
