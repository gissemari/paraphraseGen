I'm struggling with my spouse's drinking. Trying to figure out what to do about it...She quit smoking pot when I stopped drinking and pot was more her issue so that's good...But when she drinks - which is somewhere between 1 and 4 nights per week - I just don't like her personality very much. Sometimes she's all lovey dovey which she's not when she's sober which makes it feel disingenuous. More often she's a little sloppy with words and ideas (doesn't remember things doesn't understand simple stuff) Often she's argumentative and stubborn and irrational to boot. Recently she's started staying up late and watching TV despite the fact that she doesn't sleep enough during the week which feels pretty self-destructive...The hardest part is that almost everything I described are specific complaints that she had about me while I was drinking. ..I can't figure out how much of this is just me projecting my own shit onto her and how much is legitimate complaints that I can ask her to work on. ..So I thought I'd reach out here for help...Thanks y'all ..

My SO still drinks....I have been going over to Al-anon for help.  I can only control myself.   I don't think I project onto them I think I see their behavior clearer. ..IWNDWYT 
I don't have any advice to offer but just posting to let you know I'm thinking of you. Best of luck :) 
My SO still drinks too and I absolutely hate how he behaves. It brings out his worst traits -- he's provocative self-aggrandizing and worst of all pushes alcohol on others. Not me -- not since I quit drinking -- but he's caused several binge drinking parties in our apartment. It makes me miserable. ..The only thing I know is that I can't do anything about it. Because I was there myself not too long ago. :/
Who is "they" you are referring too?
