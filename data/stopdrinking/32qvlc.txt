I haven't drank but I may as well have. This 10 days sober. My relationship has fallen apart because I lied about me relapse which has resulted in getting sober again...The consequences of my drinking have made me untrustworthy to my ex whom I share an apartment with. So I have been sleeping in my car the last week staying with a friend tonight...This is what made me want to share today:.I gave into my frustration with the situation and went to an old flaw of mine (anger). I was talking to my ex about me moving out and I made it spiral out of control. My lying devastated her so why am I the one who's angry? I wish I could answer that. She went through a very violent sexual assault about a year before we met and started dating. And the case is finally going through the legal system now almost 3 years later. So on top of that stress I added finger pointing at her for excuses why I drank this last time and why the relationship fell apart. I burned a bridge with a woman I would've been lucky to even call a friend. If there's a lesson for anyone reading this remember just because you stop drinking your flaws defects and shortcomings don't disappear. I have lots of work to do. And I feel the lowest of the low right now. I'm not going to drink today. Thanks for listening

Thanks for sharing. I hope you find some peace soon. I'm having lots of luck with AA I would recommend seeing if there's a meeting near you tonight if you haven't already given AA a REAL try.
