I struggled yesterday too not because of thanksgiving but because I have an agitated hamster running around my head trying to convince me that the solution to all my problems is to go and get drunk...IWNDWYT

Haha great visual! I will not drink with you today :)
The hamster is lying.. iwndwyt
I just didn't go because I was hungover and I didn't drink and I won't drink today.
I tried returning mine to the pet store and was told that all sales are final. Grateful that they had a hamster muzzle on sale. My hamster is still there and will probably live for a long time...maybe forever but he gets much quieter the more I tighten the muzzle. Stay strong! Peace
Its that freakin squeeky hamster wheel that needs lubricating. Never enough alcohol to stop the squeek - just not a good lubricant. Sigh...... Not feeding that little rodent today. IWNDWYT
Agitated hamster well put!
