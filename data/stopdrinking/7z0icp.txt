I'm definitely reaching here but watch the lord of the rings trilogy and imagine the one ring as alcohol. A lot of the internal struggles about the ring can be translated to alcohol. Minus the whole world domination aspect it seems fairly relatable. As far as bilbo passing his burden to Frodo with Frodo carrying this affliction with him and it weighing him down and eating away it his soul everytime he puts it on and the character of golem becoming completely consumed and decaying into a twisted grotesque reflection of his former self and how all men even those who believe they can control it are subject to the same fate.

Yes. I have noted that. I feel exactly like I have this terrible burden to carry that separates me from the rest of the world. And like the rest of the world is just as obsessed with my precious as I am.

I would say the parallels between the one ring and addiction are spot on. IMO it was a deliberate metaphor Tolkien had hoped to illustrate.
Hot bananas what an awesome parallel!
