A few weeks ago during a happy hour after work someone made a light/humorous comment about what really makes one an "alcoholic". I can't recall the exact context of it but my response was that it's when drinking is no longer fun. ..That's where I am now. Actually that's where I've been for the past 10 or so years but it's currently even less fun that it used to be. ..I quit drinking for a few months back in 2016 and it was a really great time. Since then it's been an on and off struggle (or not a struggle just caving in to the desire) to stop drinking. Right now as I write this it's what I've found to be the magic hour when I switch from saying "I'm never drinking again" to "it'll be okay to drink tonight." So I'm posting here to make it a concrete and public declaration that I'm done with drinking. Acknowledging that it'll be a big change and will be challenging at times I'm ready to move on to the next clear-headed phase of life.

I love your declaration.  How did you do the few months back in 2016?  New phase new fun right?  IWNDWYT
I will not drink with you today!
Almost 3 weeks ago I hit that stage. Awake at 4:30 in the morning after drinking close to 25 beers and I hadn't passed out. It was at that point I said no more and here I am today. Sober and a lot happier with life..IWNDWYT.
Awesome. Glad you are here
What a great idea to make a formal declaration. I am here for similar reasons and have similar trains of thought. I will not drink with you today!
Congrats. I'll happily not drink with you today.
