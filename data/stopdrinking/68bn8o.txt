I had almost 60 days which is my longest sober time since I came out of rehab in 2011 and supposedly to most have been basically sober since then. However that isn't true I stopped doing as many crazy things when drunk but I think that this last winter I drank more than I ever did in my life...The light at the end of the tunnel is that after drinking 9 beers Saturday and 3 for breakfast Sunday I have managed to make it this week without starting back up again. It couldn't have if I hadn't reached out to a good friend who kept messaging me during the week with motivational material and to let me know they cared...I felt it coming for a long time. The past several weeks I realized that I spent a lot of time a day angrily criticizing myself and saying some absolutely horrible things to myself sometimes out loud in public. Even when I was doing nice things like making some cake for my friend's birthday party I kept telling myself that I was a pathetic loser. Last Saturday I felt miserable all day binge-ate drove past the beer store and drove around for an hour and finally went back and got a case of beer. It felt really good making my bad feelings go away temporarily. The next day unsurprisingly I felt miserable and I finally told someone how depressed I have been. Getting that off my chest felt great but by midweek I was miserable again. I went to the gym but have spent all day today otherwise idling and napping...I want to be able to express my emotions and feel good WITHOUT getting intoxicated. I am really miserable at my place of employment (toxic attitude dingy conditions) and I plan on moving midsummer but even that seems ages away. I want to leave sober. I realize that beyond not drinking I have a long way to come but I'm happy to be here almost a week sober again.

Having a face-to-face support system made all the difference for me. I never could have stayed sober without a therapist and involvement in AA. I'm glad you're back. Hope you get the support you need.
