Seems like a great way to set up relapsing constantly with an all or nothing attitude. Why not learn control and moderation?

This notion of 'learning' to drink moderately is a common one but it fails to take into account how alcohol and Alcohol Use Disorder actually *works*... Alcohol is a drug which is *inherently* hard to moderate for many of us because of what it *does* when it interacts with our brains.....About 10-15% of the population has an addictive nature... we are predisposed to finding mood-altering substances like alcohol *particularly* rewarding and addictive because of genetic/epigenetic and other factors compared to the average person who can take or leave them.....Sticking to 'none' is a lot easier with the right knowledge tools and support!..Have a read of some of the [oodles of posts about moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=moderation&amp;restrict_sr=on) on r/stopdrinking (also a good support group!) and you'll notice that it usually ends up going the same way... *not well*.....All the willpower 'rules' and good intentions in the world don't change the fundamental chemical interaction between alcohol and a brain with no 'off switch'.....People who *can* drink moderately do so without much apparent effort or even thinking very hard about it... it would simply never occur to them to keep drinking once they start to feel tipsy because their brain tells them they've had enough.....For folks with an addictive nature in contrast the first couple of drinks lights up the brain's reward and pleasure centre like a Christmas tree and triggers the compulsion to have another and another and so on......Relapse isn't a *requirement* either......Hope that helps!..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
For most of us it's simply impossible. No one asks why someone can't just moderate cocaine or heroin or even cigarettes - it's an addictive drug. There's no such thing as being moderate toward a drug you're addicted to. That's been the experience of huge numbers of alcoholics as evidenced by countless stories of failure or success for a while followed by failure. The nature of addiction IS all or nothing...So if faced with drink nothing or horrible consequences including death - personally I'll pick taking nothing. I too tried moderation (several times) and it didn't work for me. 
If you are willing to teach us how it is done plenty of people will be willing to learn. The only way I have heard of is to take a pill and follow the Sinclair Method if you are up for that...Have you learned a better way to do it?
Great question. I think it's because some people are more prone to addiction than others so it doesn't take much to send an alcoholic back down a slippery slope to substance abuse. The alcoholic develops a tolerance and can't catch a buzz each time with just a  moderate  amount but they can get there with more alcohol. For many alcoholism is a disease they are genetically predisposed to so moderation is not a method of  control  that works for them. Instead they  control  it via total abstention. So they actually do learn control and often try and try a method of moderation first then opt for a method of total abstention. 
Because it's not a skill set. You can google the science of addiction if you want to understand how the brain and body changes with substance abuse and dependency. Brand new pathways must be built in order to compromise the addictive feedback system and re-enable the governor but the old addictive pathways remain and can't be continuously inflamed with the very substance that created the distortion.
