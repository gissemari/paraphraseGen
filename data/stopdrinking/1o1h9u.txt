Back down to two days after a long two week binge. It definitely needs to stop for good this time. And this time I'm going to work on changing everything. Restarting my workouts eating healthy. I had a very hard week before my relapse. A close family friend died suddenly at 49 and my great grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. That was when my cravings got out of control. In my last drunken state I called my grandmother. I learned a lot about my family. Several alcoholics and drug addicts. It's time to forge my own road and not follow there's.

When it rains it pours no?..Good on you for re-deciding to abstain re-turning to /r/stopdrinking re-setting your badge and continuing on your journey. I hope that *when* I relapse I will have the strength to do the same. Thanks for the inspiration.

Restarting workouts and eating healthy might not be enough.  At least it wasn't for me.  Try to find some sober friends too :)
