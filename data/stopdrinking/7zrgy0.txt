So I'm a nye quitter through jan my smoking increased as I abstained from my nightly wine. 8 days ago I quit the cigarettes too with the help of flu. It's totally changed my dynamic with quitting drinking and it is suddenly really hard. Any advice to getting over this hump

Hang on. I couldn't stay sober without help. A therapist and AA pulled me through stressful times. These resources gave me the tools to build a sober happy life. 
For me the first two months were a bumpy ride with different issues running relay. I felt like I just had to work through them all let them pass. Stay strong it gets better!.Edit spelling
