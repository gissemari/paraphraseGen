We're going to my sister in law's tonight my BIL is a huge alcoholic. We lived with them for 3 months in 2014 while we got back on our feet 11 people in a 3 BR house and me husband and BIL drank soooooo much to deal with us all being stuck together. The drinking was constant and copious. ..We went there for Thanksgiving this year and as is traditional with them we got wasted. ..We are going there tonight for Christmas and somewhere in my subconscious I had already planned to drink. I wasn't going to bring it but I figured if it was there I was going to indulge...It's crazy how these thoughts can occur at the very back of our consciousness. I am glad I was able to identify them and squash them. IWNDWYT.

Good call and catch!
Good job identifying that.  I can feel those sneaky thoughts triggered everywhere these days.  Awareness is a big part of this for me.  ..Happily lifting a LaCroix to you right now!
