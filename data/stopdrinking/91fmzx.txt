I am facing a very stressful move and may have to suddenly change plans due to outside factors. This has all been complicated by a rather severe relapse ("I need to say goodbye" "I'm celebrating" etc.) that I'm still recovering from. An old drinking friend has invited me telling me that we'll hang out frequently not knowing I'm trying to get sober for good. I've been able to recognize "bad" drinking friends who are total pieces of shit who I only bonded with over alcohol but this is one I trust who manages a successful personal life and has interests outside of drinking. I can envision going out with him and not drinking being the DD but I can't help but shake this notion that he expects me to be the same always-wasted asshole and that we might lose touch if I'm not doing the same shit I was when we knew each other. On occasion with a group we'd be the only people who would want to sneak off and drink liquor when nobody else would be willing it seems like it will be awkward if that changes.

I feel you and I have a few people like that in my life.  I wouldn't be able to stay sober if I lived with them.  I'd say honesty is the best policy.  Talk to him and you might be surprised by how he feels about your drinking but mostly think about where you want to be in a year five years ten years on your death bed: how do you get there?  By moving in with him or by doing something that seems more difficult now?
It might go just fine it might be awkward.  You are the one making the change.  The people around you aren't the ones choosing the change.  ..A pro/con list is a good tool here. So the con of being sober is some fears about changing relationships.  The cons of starting drinking again?  I can make a pretty big list. The pros of drinking?  Maybe 10 minutes of familiar times in old habits.  The pros of sobriety? Countless. .I still have new fears and angers in sobriety.  For me the steps of AA are my tools for processing them.  I hope you keep seeking solutions.  Best to you. .
