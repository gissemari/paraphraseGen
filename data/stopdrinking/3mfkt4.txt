Hey all! ..I'm in a bit of pickle. I'm currently in school to become a psychiatrist. My goal is to work primarily with those who struggle with substance abuse in a community health setting. I've loved working with addicts (alcoholics IV drug users etc.) since long before I developed an issue myself... an entire topic in and of itself. But I'm struggling with the idea of navigating a therapeutic relationship with a patient in an optimal way in light of my personal connection to the issue. I know that there are probably resources out there (or there hopefully are considering that this is probably not a entirely uncommon issue in this field). I know this is a long-shot but I didn't know who else to ask. And I know ya'll know a lot about a lot.  My other option is to go to one of my professors and discuss my not so distant struggles with alcohol... which may in the long run prove to be a good resource but I'm worried may open up a whole different fairly uncomfortable can of worms. ..I've been up for quite a while so if you need clarification on what I'm asking for let me know. I appreciate you guys here. ..Cheers to one more day sober friends!

Which med school? Just curious. 
So you're in med school or doing the actual psychiatry intern?..
There are professional AA meetings for doctors. Just Google it they are everywhere. I might consider seeing a counselor outside of your institution. Confidentiality ensures the info can't be shared by inside the hospital gets tricky. Since the other doctors might be considered inside your circle of care. ..In other news: thanks for doing psychiatry with a focus on addictions. The psychiatrists i work alongside are amazing. 
It may be helpful for you to have some sessions with a psychologist about maintaining boundaries with patients. I see connection with clients as a continuum where on one side a practitioner is completely closed off and cannot build empathy and on the other extreme side the practitioner is merging with their clients and is not helpful to their clients or themselves. Appropriate therapeutic rapport balances empathy and boundaries.
