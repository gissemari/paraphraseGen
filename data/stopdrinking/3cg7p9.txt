I don't post here often because of countless relapses but my question is does anyone use coffee or has used coffee to help withdrawal? Or will it just make speedy and want a better fix because I have energy? I mean three or four cups not like multiple pots... Anxiety is through the roof thirty hours since last drink. I can hardly show my face today. Physical withdrawal nearly over mental like a train... thanks guys... also just wanted to say hey and remind myself I'm not dead and am SOBER. Things could be worse. Although my brain likes to tell me otherwise sometimes. I'll try the coffee alongside pounds of water. ..Any experience with coffee/mental withdrawal? Also have mild case of full body shakes. Brain fog is the worst. I wish I could see clearly and realize it'll be a few more days before that's an option.

I tried to minimize coffee because of the anxiety myself. Have you thought about seeing a doctor to talk about your drinking and plan for quitting? And being really honest about how much you drink in case you need medical intervention?
I noticed my coffee intake spiked when I quit. I already liked coffee before I quit but now I feel like I could drink it all day long. I didn't have too much in the way of withdrawal so no insight there :/ stick with it thanks for posting!
I think there is pretty good evidence that in early sobriety coffee is a net positive.  It's frankly why one of the symbols of AA is the coffee pot.
It was the weirdest thing I hated coffee. HAAATTEEEDD coffee up until I stopped drinking. Now it's a nice pick me up that puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day or at least until mid-afternoon. ..I never had any withdraw symptoms (which shocked me) so I'm not sure about that 
In my experience coffee makes withdrawal much worse.
