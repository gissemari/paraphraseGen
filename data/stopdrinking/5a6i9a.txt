Hi all today is my wedding. Getting through the open bar today will be the last challenge in a fun-but-tough few days. I've really never seen anything like Halloween in NOLA. An absolute ocean of booze. the group we're with hits bars all day and I've been okay. Haven't touched a drop. ..For anyone struggling when I decided to quit drinking two weeks ago I never thought I'd be able to make it to even three days. Each day brings challenges but a little more clarity and strength. I NEVER would have thought I could make it through NOLA but I was ready after two weeks of preparing and doing the right things. ..Keep going. Stay sober today. I will too. Thinking of you all.

You can now tell yourself that if you can get through Halloween in New Orleans without booze you can get through anything but you probably already know this. Congratulations on your wedding! I am so happy for you.
Congratulations!!! Have the best time!
