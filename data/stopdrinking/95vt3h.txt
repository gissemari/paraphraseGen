I had 125 days at the beginning of July and relapsed. I relapsed a couple of times since having a few sober days each time. My drinking was definitely not as bad as before but still problematic and I couldn't stick to sobriety. ..This time it feels different again I feel like I can go for a longer (hopefully very long) sober episode again. I am not saying  forever' yet though. I don't feel confident saying that yet. ..Anyway I feel so down. I have felt it for the major part of this month. Whatever I do exercise eat healthy meditation the feeling of being content doesn't stick. I'm numb and not motivated. Everything feels like a burden. ..I have bipolar disorder and I'm used to these episodes. They happen despite having medication. It's part of life but it's just so annoying. It's no fun doing all me daily stuff that I usually enjoy without enjoying them. It also feels so ungrateful. ..I learned last month that drinking definitely doesn't work as a remedy for this feeling and that's why I feel confident that I'm not gonna drink anytime soon...Thanks for reading and IWNDWYT

Big hugs managing a mental illness and working towards sobriety is a ton of work. And you're worth it. Do you have medical professionals that you feel comfortable talking to you about this?
My husband is bipolar too. Alcohol messes with the effectiveness of the medication. He's doing so much better since he quit drinking entirely. However meds often need adjustment- maybe talk to your psych about your depressive episode and see if they can help.
