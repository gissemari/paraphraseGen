Hello! I am starting my quest into being sober and I am a bit afraid of the withdrawals. Recently I became sick with the flu and quick drinking for six days and didn't feel any side effects but I have been steadily every day drinking for four or five years now. It is at the point where in one week between my birthday and Christmas I had six bottles of wine. This week I've had three or four and some beer on top of that. With every single day drinking to at least being buzzed how would you all recommend I quit? I'm still struggling to quit and terrified of the withdrawals if they come.

You should talk to your doctor if you are concerned about withdrawals. Personally when I was drinking a bottle of wine per night I had no issues when I stopped. I had to stop every few weeks for an entire week because of work. Later on when I was drinking two bottles of wine and a six pack every night I started to feel pretty crappy for a couple days when I stopped but I didn't have anything life threatening. Shakes sweats nausea lethargy. I understand that it is medically necessary for some folks to taper down like if you're drinking a handle of vodka per day but I know I would have a very tough time trying to control a taper. When I did finally stop I went to a detox and treatment program.
A doctor can assess your detox needs. ..See HAMS Reduction.
I tapered; was drinking about six glasses of wine most nights. I tapered: 6-6-5-5-4-4-3-3-2-2-1-1-0-0-0-0.....worked for me. Not giving advice of course.
