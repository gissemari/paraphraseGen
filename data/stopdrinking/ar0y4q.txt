Usually at this time (around 3:00 pm). I am paralyzed with craving....especially since it's Friday!! That's how I know it's close to time to get off work........just looked at the clock and realized it's 3:30........What?? I am not struggling right now!! Wow!! I can't believe it :) IWNDWYT

Keep it up 
Yay that's awesome!
That is so great. I'm finally feeling my cravings lessen (a little). Every day I know they'll fade a little more. I know I can make it to a year.
This is totally me too. I found my two Fridays sober to be the most challenging days. But I got through them!
