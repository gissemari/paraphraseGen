It doesn't matter how far down the road we are in recovery we are all just one drink away from the the ditch; we must all be careful. ..We may be getting stronger but addiction and relapse are doing push-ups in the parking lot; we have to keep getting stronger and never let up. ..I am reading far too many stories about people that think they can have just one. Ask a recovering heroin addict if they think they can have just one fix. ..I am just one drink away from the abyss so I will never ever have  just one  as I know I can not possibly ever stop; it's just not possible. ..Drinking does not make good times better it turns good times upside down and ruins everything every time. ..I don't think for one minute I can have just one; but I know I am am happiest when I have none. None is better than one each and ever time. ..I will not drink with you today not even just one. ..William

One drink will take me back to the nightmare.  Great reminder William! IWNDWYT 
You are exactly right. Thanks for the post and the reminder...IWNDWYT
I like thinking that when I resist a craving my sober muscles are doing pushups too! ..Thanks for the post. IWNDWYT 
Thanks for this!
We ARE getting stronger. 
One drink away from getting my old lifestyle back?  I'll leave that drink alone.  It's one decision.  One tiny big thing
One tiny big thing indeed. Not after this long no way.
