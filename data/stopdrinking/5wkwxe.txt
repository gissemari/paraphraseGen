In this community is having one or two beers considered a relapse? This is a new yet necessary decision I am making in my life but I am conflicted.  I really enjoy the taste of new beers but getting drunk is out of the question.  What do you all think? okay or nay?

Most are here because moderating didn't work and it was easier to stop drinking.  Whatever works for you though.  I won't drink with you today.
I know choosing to drink even one beer would make me reset my badge but what counts as a relapse is up to you.  For example some people here would reset their badge if they drank kombucha because it has a small amount of alcohol in it but that doesn't count as a slip up for me. You set your own standards around here. 
Yes. For me one is too many.  Far too many.
This site is for anyone who "wants to control or stop drinking"...The choices are all yours...I support anyone who makes a decision takes action and accepts all the consequences...For me personally I prefer being unimpaired...But that's just me!..Glad you're here!
If you can have one or two drinks and stop you are different from most of us. 
I don't think it's up to me or anyone else to tell you what your relapse looks like.  For me even having a drinking *dream* feels like a relapse.  I know I can't moderate and occasionally I search "moderation" in the SD sidebar just to remember why.
what you are describing is moderation...Im an alcoholic I can't moderate. Meaning that "one" new beer would = 1000. ..There's no rule. Do you. 
If I could have a couple beers without getting drunk or crying to my dog I would declare victory over my alcoholism and drop my SD and AA habits but I can't.
