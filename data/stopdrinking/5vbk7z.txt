I found this quote in a group that motivates and gives advice during a job search but I think it's pretty applicable to sobriety. Especially after relapse it's good to remind myself to be stubborn about my goal of sobriety. I don't give up because of one "failure." I wouldn't give up looking for a job because I wasn't offered the job for the first interview I ever went on! ..If we find our methods of staying sober aren't working it's okay and healthy to think "what can I try differently? What support systems can I add to help support my goal?" ..Thinking of you all this fine morning I'm so grateful for this community and everything you all have taught me!
