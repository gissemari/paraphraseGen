In a way I am proud of myself I had 140 sober days in 2013 albeit they were in two parts. At first 98 days then relapse and the year ended with 42 sober days more. This is by far my record year after 9 years of drinking since I started at 16 and starting from 2011 trying to actively cut it down. In the past I have tried AA antabuse group therapy and in the end of january I am starting one-on-one therapy which hopefully helps with my guilt/shame/anxiety issues...I really hope that there is a budding change in my way of thinking. Alcohol was a way of rewarding myself and I still feel the rush as I recollect the memories I had with it. I truely hope that during the upcoming year I can embrace other ways of feeling good since this proud feeling has also been my key to relapse...Stay strong people!

You stay strong too. Knowing you want to be free of the crutch of alcohol is a very strong place to start. Good Luck in this new year.
Good for you! The last half of this year has been the most sober I've been in about 10 years. I've had a few relapses as well- They ARE part of the disease but I feel and hope they are behind me. I get that sick to my stomach feeling about alcohol that a lot of people mention on here- that never happened to me before. I'm so happy to see you're starting 1 on 1! My 1-1 court ordered after my DUI was the beginning of self realization for me. and also for me it planted the seeds that are now my sobriety. So many of our stories... so similar. It truly is an equal opportunity disease. You stay strong as well! I'm praying for you you sound like you're getting to a good place. :) 
I know you can make it. I can see your struggle to change that's what important your self-willingness to change. 
You should be proud of yourself congratulations.  I hope you have a sober new year.
