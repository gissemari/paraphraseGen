I'm reading Zen of Recovery by Mel Ash and am really liking it.  The author is a recovered alcoholic and Zen teacher.  He uses Zen as his higher power which is non-theistic and might appeal to those struggling with spirituality because of issues with churches/God.  Most of the book is comparing Zen Buddhism with the 12 step program  of AA and offering teachings from Zen that mirror or complement the steps...http://www.amazon.ca/The-Zen-Recovery-Mel-Ash/dp/0874777062

yes! I have been reading this on my Nook. Great thorough account.
Thanks for the tip! Definitely going to read this.
Thanks!  I ordered this book from Amazon a couple months ago and kept meaning to start it.  I feel I'm pretty spiritual but really curious to further examine the parallels of the steps and Bhuddism.  This is encouraging :)
Hey Mel Ash! I read his 'shaving the inside of your skull' and worked through most of the little assignments in it while in uni that guy's great.
Yes I read this and it was really good.  In spite of my screen name I'm not sure these days if I'm really a Buddhist but I like almost all of what I know about Buddhism.
