Hi guys.I've been struggling with alcohol dependency since I was about 17 years old  and have been in and out of detoxes/alcohol clinics/AA for the last 2 years or so but the one thing that always gets me is the fact that all my friends ever do is go out and drink! Since we're all in our twenties there's not much else anyone really wants to do (which I recognise in itself is a problem but that's British culture I guess) so when I do decide to quit the booze I always end up becoming a total social recluse and never leaving the house... which ultimately leads me to drinking again.  ..I'm currently 6 days sober (new years resolutions...) and I REALLY want to stick at it this time but I know about 2 weeks in the loneliness will become too much and I'll be tempted.  If anyone has any advice on what I can do whether it be hobbies or coping mechanisms. ANYTHING. I just really want to give this a proper go and I would rather be prepared in advance. ..I'm also extremely socially anxious (cuz of this stupid addiction) and pretty much incapable of socialising sober too so any advice for that would be great...Sorry if this is all over the place  I'm not very good with words lol

Honestly I found hanging out with sober people amazing. They were just as awkward as I was about doing shit sober and it made it so much less anxiety-inducing...I had massive reservations about AA and peer-support groups but at the end of the day it was so nice to connect with people who didn't drink...I got sober at 25 and yes there are people in their 20's in Britain who don't drink.
The gym...I poured myself into the gym. I bought in to the fitness lifestyle. I learned how to lift weights eat right prepare meals etc...I found not only happiness and health. I found that a LOT of the people in the gym even the young guys dont really drink much. I know a ton who dont drink at all not because they ever had a problem but because alcohol is anathema to their lifestyle.
