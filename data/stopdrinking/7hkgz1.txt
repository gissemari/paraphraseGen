Short backstory wasn't a heavy drinker besides maybe once or twice a month going through my 20s. I just turned 31 and since feb I've been drinking heavily coping with a breakup and the expected loneliness. Problem is now I'm ready to stop but the shakes and cold sweats along with the brain fog have me debilitated. The only thing that curves it is having a moderately small drink. I just want to get through this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel stuck almost trapped.

It's really tough I've been there - I wanted to stop wanted to reach but was so afraid of the judgement. And then after a while I reached out to my doctor and they way he reacted blew me away and I wished I reached out sooner. He was so understanding and regretted he wasn't there to help me. ..Do you have a family doctor you can talk to? It is really scary to disclose this secret to your doctor but that small/giant step truly feels like a stone rolled off your chest.  The doctor will help with physical withdrawals and will make it easier. ..All the best!
detoxing is serious business. no medical advice should be given here.   please see a doctor.
