my longest streak was 38 days ended last week of 2016. today is 38 days sober and I can't believe I'm really thinking I'm going to go drink. it must have to do with relapsing on day 38 that's triggering me

Drinking is only fun for a short time. Very short for me. Hang tough.
maybe so why don't you try for 39 just to be sure!   
please dont relapse.I did and I can assure you this is one of the worst feelings ever.the hangovers only get worse.and its debilitating
Some call it "the wall". It's the anxiety that goes with reaching the number of days we think we can. And anxiety can send us to drinking...That's why "one day at a time" is always valid. I'm one year sober and I don't have a badge for that reason. I didn't want to count days and be anxious about it. For me it was one fucking day at a time...Can you stay sober for today only?
You will never regret the decision to NOT drink. Take it a day at a time and put your relapse off until day 39 and then put it off until day 40 and repeat. You can do this.
