I checked myself into a medical detox a few days ago and relapsed bad. Almost lost my boyfriend had to quit muy job (turns out working at a liquor store and being a drunk don't mix well.) I'm self detoxing at home this time. The withdrawals have been intense but my boyfriend has come back home to help me get by. I still have some meds from detox too. I also have a very loving family helping me focus on help. I have to make this work before I lose everything...I'm glad I have this sub too..I can do this!..Now if I could just keep food down and sleep I'm ready to leave this past behind me.

Keep the faith and check in here often.  I will not drink with you today.
You can do it! Check this subreddit AT LEAST once a day :)
Praying for you..IWNDWYT 
The beginning is the hardest part. You can do it!
I'm currently employed at a liquor store and it's the downfall of me. I can't remember the last time I went more then 3 days. Also in the process of quitting. You got this! 
Hang in there! I will not drink with you today!
I'm glad you have the foresight to take care of yourself before it gets any worse than it is right now. That's what I call wisdom...The real test comes now endurance and dedication. I just started my life of sobriety a few days ago. Together we can do this...Get some sleep :)
