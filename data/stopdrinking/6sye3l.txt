Hi all. I have finally strung together 60 days sober again. Last time I got over 4 1/2 months sober before relapsing horribly. I moved back to my tiny hometown to regroup and I'm doing very well. New job back in school eating and sleeping incredibly well. However the AA/NA program here is miserable (for me). I've been to almost 30 meetings and they do nothing but make me mad. There is no SMaRT recovery group here and I know there are online resources but I'm looking for ways to maintain my sobriety and really work a program that is not 12 step based. I relapsed last time because I quit putting work into recovery and I don't want that to ever happen again...Any suggestions? Books that aren't often mentioned? (I've read all the real popular ones)..Thanks!

I went to AA for the first 2-3 months and quit going like you wasn't my thing. My program of recovery is basically keeping a positive attitude and always having short and long term goals that I am working towards to keep me motivated. I made a budget and with all my extra money I started investing it into myself and learning new things. Going to my first guitar lesson this Monday. Super excited and I think that will keep me busy for a while.
Have you looked into Refuge Recovery? At the meeting I went to there were a few members that joined specifically because AA wasn't working for them.
