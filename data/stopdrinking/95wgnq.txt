Waiting on my third badge reset. Feeling hopeless and tired....    I made it 400 days before I relapsed. Life is incredibly messy and I quit fighting myself and that terrible demon telling me to drink. I'm not sure how I'll start living sober life again but I'll start with day one. .     Just got out of a 7 year relationship and I don't have family or friends nearby. I am trying to find activities and hobbies but the depression isn't letting up enough for me to care. (On meds seeing a therapist already). I feel like I failed in my relationship and my sobriety. .     How do I cope with relapse? I find I get stuck in a swirl of feeling like a failure and that I don't deserve good things/to be sober. What is your inspiration to keep fighting that demon? .     Thank you all for being here you're the reason I was able to stop the first time.

I guess we are waiting on our badge resets together.  ..So embarrassing for me but I suppose it must mean that I do have a bit of hope that I can achieve success on this attempt...My inspiration is the memory of how much better my body and mind felt during my 26 day sober streak.  ..My challenge is how to deal with life without the escape alcohol provides...Best of luck to us.
