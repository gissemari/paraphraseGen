A couple things:..Next time we're here. Fire a post off and I'm sure a bunch of us will message you with support. ..Second it's not my place to judge - a drink or 10 drinks... if you feel bad you feel bad. I can't help that but... I don't know... I mean I want to say that if it's what you said it's only a drink. But I know a lot would disagree with me. It's the principle and it's the time you spent not drinking...  am I allowed to say "it could be worse"?..Probably not. I feel like Tyrion when he's trying to console Danaerys before she appointed him hand of the Queen... .she basically tells him he's really bad at it.....I dunno. If you want to talk or something let me know. We're both a part of this group of people battling this disease. 
You've only had a few sips at this point. There is no need to see this through by continuing to drink. Can you put the drink down now and reach out to someone close to you who you trust?
I agree. One drink does not a bender make. You can stop now and go back to being sober. 
Sleep it off
