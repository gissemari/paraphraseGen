I'm back at the beginning. I relapsed. I'm not super proud of myself there's been a lot of self hatred. I made it from aug/23/18 to jan/29/19. That's the longest I got so far in a while and I'm damn proud if it. I'm just all to ready for my life to begin and this hangover to end you know? This community is damn amazing. Why does whiskey have to taste so good?
