I feel a sense of solidarity when I see people with the same (or roughly the same) badge number as me as I feel we are undergoing the same phase of the struggle that all of us are enduring...Anyone else feel the same way or am I just weird? Haha.

Weird is the new normal. No seriously it does seem to help to see that people on here aren't all veterans that have been through it all. My favorite posts are from the people who are going through the same kind of thing as me. (They are less likely to get sick of my wining.) I hope.
Oh sure! My sobriety twin from the last time I got sober is still a big support and a good friend. This time around my sobriety triplets /u/peanutchowder &amp; /u/ucantsimee have been awesome supports. All of those people are on my reddit "friend" list so I can search for their posts more easily and their name shows up in red when they comment. I enjoy getting to know people on here and it's part of what helps me stay sober.
I absolutely feel the same way...Shout out to all my fellow 16 day people! Where you guys at? 
23!
Totally agree! There's a few other October 1st-ers on here and I always give them a mental fist bump with I see them post!
For sure! I get excited whenever I see a post by /u/parallelplay
