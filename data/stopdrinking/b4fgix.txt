102 days sober today. Working my 4th step. I have been feeling so spiritually fit. Doing the deed. Lots more work to go but really I feel fantastic. ..So why last night....ALL night...did I recreate my last drunk...my horrible emotional suicidal bottom.....in my dreams? I woke up with tears pouring down my face. I drank in my dream I raged I was filled with shame jealousy and the need to control everything and at the end of it I fell off a cliff and died. I woke up and sat up crying for an hour. I went back to sleep and it started all over again. ..This morning I was re-examining my whole program. My whole dream like my bottom centered around one relationship in my life that was the focus of my obsession and rage when I drank. Maybe I am not as emotionally healthy as I feel? Am I on the road to relapse and just kidding myself?  I have tried to put it aside as just a nightmare but it feels like there is a message in there for me that I am not getting. ..Is this normal? Can anyone shed some light? Am I putting too much into this? ..

Drinking/relapse dreams are so so so common! They're even in the sidebar!! Don't worry. I know they can be distressing. I try to view it as a free reminder of all the horrible motivators that can sometimes fade over time in my memory. 
Exact same thing happened to me last night. Its really horrible and I feel destabilised by it too. You're not alone. Let's be extra kind to ourselves today
