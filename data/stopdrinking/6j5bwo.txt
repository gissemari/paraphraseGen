6 days since I stopped this is attempt number 2 after blowing it after nearly 5 months. I stopped in January picked it up slowly late April which then exploded like I should have known it would in June...So I still have some night sweats. I remember the first time I quit they lasted somewhere around a week so I think I'm almost done with those. I'm really looking forward to that. They're so odd and unsettling waking up with a very even thin layer of sweat on my entire body head to toe. I'm not sleeping very well maybe about 4 hours per night but the last two nights were at the firehouse so sleep is always kinda shit there anyways...My mind has been slowing down. Like everyone said and like I learned the first time but forgot a lot of us think that we drink because of anxiety but in actuality the drinking causes it. I'm a little more chilled out now. I'm always a bit intense but I can feel a bit of that leaving me. That's a nice benefit. This last year at around 2 months I remember feeling so good and motivated and very positive. I can finally see that this will come my way again. I'm looking forward to that and it's motivating...I had the day off today. I kept busy during the day and tonight I've declined offers to meet up and will just screw around on the computer or watch TV. I don't need to go out there. I don't feel like I'm depriving myself of anything and I won't get mad at myself for being lazy. It is what it is at this point...Not to be part of the herd or anything but the fridge is full of (name brand) flavored soda water. I'll probably put back around 6 of these. I still have the constant thirst. Last go around the night sweats lasted around a week and if I recall correctly the constant thirst was something like 10-14 days or something. I don't exactly remember. I think I'll go through my post history and check that out...Anyways I don't expect anyone to have made it to this paragraph but if you did thanks for reading. This sub is very helpful and I'm glad I'm back. While some of the posts here are corny AF ;) most of them are very motivational and remind me why I'm here again. And for that thank you. ..Time to crack open another (name brand) flavored soda water. I might even order Chinese...*EDIT*...First off I found this about the constant thirst from my older posts:..**So I texted about a week ago about my thirst that wouldn't quit asking if anyone knew what was up. It wasn't dehydration or diabetes and while I could find people on forums talking about it I couldn't get a physiological reason as to why it was happening.**..**Well I never found out but it quietly ended yesterday at around 12 days. If you're feeling that way well maybe this is a rough estimate on when it will be over.**..**So damn weird.**..Also if you relapsed like I did go through your post history. What an odd perspective to be able to see this word for word. Also I started drinking again after about 4.5 months but stopped posting at around 3.5... I guess it's important to never get too far away from this sub..

I read the whole post.  I remember the fireman in L.A. doing the steps in Santa Monica in full gear.  All 189 steps .  Man they were in shape.  They could really move.  I did get up to 10 sets but I had to walked slowly.  Lots of breaks walking around up top between sets.  I would think as a fireman it would be a huge incentive to be really fit.  I won't drink with you today.  I'm still drinking a lot of name brand too.  
Read your post need to reset my badge because you and I have had a really similar timeframe. I appreciate your honesty and also the way you wrote it it felt very familiar...The sweats the anxiety the feeling so weak I can hardly get to bathroom? Hoped I never had to feel that way again but my time spent off taught me a ton and made it that much easier to say "no more" again...Not drinkin hope you feel better and better.
Well done. I'm almost a year in and still drink soda like a madman. Night sweats and shakes are a memory for me at this point but remembering those early days reminds me of what I was putting my body through. Ugh. Anyway bravo.
Enjoyed the post. I read here nearly every day even if I do not post or comment. Yeah days 5-6 were the worst of my withdrawal days and maybe 12 to get out of it. Rooting for you.
