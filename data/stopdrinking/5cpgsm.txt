After my first real sober relationship (and a short while later break up) I've learned a lot about myself and how I can truly control my actions reactions and emotions on a daily basis. I never could have learned this drinking and numbing my emotions constantly...I understand we all have struggles - it's why many of us drank as heavily as we have - but the more time I have to experience myself and my emotions the more I understand I am in control. Not some drink. ..Just thought I'd share my newest insight on this wonderful weird journey of sobriety. Today SD I'll join you in not drinking.

I'm a big believer in Choice!..I'm not so sure about me being in control but that's me.  I have choices.  Alcohol certainly is *not in control* when it's outside me.  So I've taken that off the table!..The answer for me is "*Acceptance and my Subsequent Choices*"...There's a short quote that represents it for me:.."I can't change the wind but I can trim my sails"..As Lionel Richie would say:  [Sail On!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg-ivWxy5KE)..Today I Sail On and forgo just ONE drink   The First One..
Thank you! I'm in a relationship that is showing me just how much I have to learn about the choices I'm making around my emotional state. It truly is a choice. I don't have to give away my power to another person and certainly not to alcohol!
