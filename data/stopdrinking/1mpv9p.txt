I'm so happy!  Thanks to all of you for your support.  I couldn't have imagined getting this far a year ago.  It was insanely hard for the first few months but it gets so much easier and the rewards are fantastic.  I still have cravings once in a while but they pass very quickly now (30 seconds at the most).  Keep it up folks from what I experienced and from what I read on here about relapse once you break through that 3 month barrier it seems to get much easier.
