Hello all!  Happy Saturday morning.  Just wanted to take a quick moment to share two major NDVs I've had in the last week or so both related to basic healthcare and upkeep.  These things were a STRUGGLE while I was drinking regularly and it feels really refreshing to just have them taken care of...1. **Scheduling an Appointment with my Dentist.**  I have dental insurance through my work so it seemed so stupid for me to not take advantage of it.  I haven't been for a regular cleaning in about 16 months and as the days and weeks past (especially after the 1-year mark) it became this anxiety-ridden thing that I put off further because of how long I had already put it off. Do I find a new dentist because of how embarrassed I am? Do I suck it up and just go back to endure the doctor's finger-wagging? I have an appointment this coming Tuesday with my previous dentist which I'm not worried about -- it was ACTUALLY MAKING the appointment which took the most energy...2. **Refilling Medication.** I take an unusual medication that requires a refill every 90 days.  When I was a regular drinker getting this refilled was a mountain of a headache.  I would always lose the package that had the Rx# on it so I could never use the pharmacy's automatic phone refill system.  I would never call for a refill until a few days prior to running out causing massive anxiety for everyone involved when the pharmacy had to special order it (like they always do).  The worst part? I used to be a pharmacy student so I REALLY GET how shitty it is for a patient to act this way with a busy retail location.  This time I saved the outer package in my medicine cabinet and used their automatic phone refill system a full 18 days before I run out.  It took about 5 minutes and now I don't have to stress over it... ..Aside from the life-changing physical health benefits I've experienced (glowy skin normal digestion no more puffy face thicker hair) the *ability to better care for myself* has been the best benefit I've experienced after stopping drinking.  I agonized for a long time over the decision but now that I'm 90+ days in I know this is the path for me.  I promise if you're thinking about taking the plunge you will not be disappointed with the changes you see in your life.

I can relate to this. I can't even tell you how many times I missed my birth control shot. I needed to get the prescription then go to a nurse. That seemed impossible when I was drinking.
Don't worry about the dentist; I hadn't gone for ~8 YEARS when I made my first post-drinking appointment. I thought I would need several teeth pulled possibly surgery...all unfounded. Granted I had a lot of cavities and it took several visits to get everything sorted out but it's such a weight off my shoulders. The fillings while not pleasant by any stretch of the imagination were far preferable to the constant anxiety. 
Oh man so true. Not putting off brushing teeth before passing out. Or a shower. Eating better since sobriety helps nutrition discipline. Having the energy and rest to maintain exercise regimens. Sleeping regularly and deeply not hiding in a back room chugging from a bottle at midnight. So many NDVs...just raining from the sky.
I find myself in similiar situations like these. Things that are so simple but I make them soooo much harder for myself and have such anxiety towards them it feels like it it impossible. In the end it turns out that I wasted sooooo much time stressing and procrastinating for something that took a matter of minutes...I am so happy to see in myself and hear about your health benefits and ability to take care of one's self. It truly is one of the best gifts sobriety gives. Congrats on your 90+ days...High Five
thank you for sharing. I am 31 days in. so far i am still sleepy/groggy but i have to say my hair looks better than it has in years! I look forward to the self care you mention. So many things seemed impossible or overwhelming when I was drinking (ie gym yoga dr. appts for myself etc.) Now everything seems possible when I am not constantly hungover. thank you.
It's not that it is impossible it's just that you dont give a shit about it. Not until you really need it or it's too late.
I watched a great programme on the human brain the other day explaining the difference between our conscious and subconcious; when our brains are function properly the subconcious can take care of all the things that it's done a million times before... however alcohol seems to push these basic good acts deep down and all the little things that seem to start getting missed becomes too much for your conscious thoughts to take on and things start falling behind. God alcohol is fucking awful! 
Go back to your dentist if you like them!  Trust me.  I am one.  We see people that disappear for a decade then show up.  It is no big deal.  People do it all the time.  1.5 years passes by fast drunk or sober.  Glad you getting back on track.
Oi Vay I hear you on the dentist thing! Add to that the massive anxiety I experience even for a teeth cleaning and the additional anxiety of always being hungover...I basically *did* get a new dentist after I got sober LOL. Well done!
