You've got this! It is a victory nonetheless because here you are still keeping at it! 
I'm glad that you're here.  With hope comes willingness and willingness (to get well to listen to do whatever it takes to follow advice) is what shifted the balance for me.
It's day one. You're giving it your best shot! That is very inspiring. ..You got this! You're doing better than you'd like to believe - It'll be my pleasure not drinking with you today.
Every time you come back you come back stronger. You got this. IWNDWYT!
I'm glad to see you here you've got this. IWNDWYT
