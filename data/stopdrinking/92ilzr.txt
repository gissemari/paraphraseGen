I'm an extrovert who struggles with loneliness. I'm very fortunate to have such a large group of friends and a wonderful church I belong to as well as a stress-free job. I keep myself busy all week after work with social activities. However the moment I get home and I'm alone I start drinking. Despite having a great social life when I'm alone I can't stop comparing myself to others I start thinking about my screwed up childhood I start reflecting on all my failed relationships and I just feel... lonely. So I drink until the loneliness goes away. I want to stop but it's just so easy to drive half a mile to the liquor store and pick up some cheap beer. I guess I sort of "justify" it to myself by saying *"I deserve a drink. My loneliness isn't my fault but I can control how I feel about it after I drink these few beers. Besides I never get blackout drunk."..It's a sick mindset I know. I never reached out to anyone before now because I don't like thinking of this as a "problem". I know my drinking is just an escape but I'm unwilling or unable to run from it...Can anyone else relate? Any advice? I'm a 27 y/o male if that matters.

Are you sober now? That's how we all had to start.
