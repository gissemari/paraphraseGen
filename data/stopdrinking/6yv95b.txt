Update on past post!..Was a little worried about a Leadership Conference I was attending this week. It's for General Managers and Executive Chefs of fine dining restaurants. Usually is a pretty heavy booze fest and was. ..But happy and proud to say that I made it through without a drop of alcohol and had a FABULOUS time. Drink of choice: club soda with lime in a rocks glass. Looks just like a cocktail. No one bothered much about it and everyone just had a great time...Huge milestone for me. Usually I'm catching the flight home the next day severely hungover or still drunk hooking up with another manger from a different store or blotchy memories of sounding like a total moron...Thanks for the support of SD you all are genuinely great people and I'm so blessed to have found a place to work out worry and struggles and also celebrate accomplishments!
