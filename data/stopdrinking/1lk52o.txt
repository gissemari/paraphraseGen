Hi everyone ..Well it's a Sunday night and I'm at home. I've been sober since August 11th 2013 after I had a relapse. I had been sober for a full 365+ days before that and then thought I could sneak a few months in. I wound up blowing out all of my debt thresholds failed a few University classes  drove home drunk multiple times and made more out of character decisions than I would care to admit. ..I wish I had seen the warning signs sooner. Reading over a few of my journal entries during that time..."been 85 days since I haven't had a drink..." and that was just the beginning. ..Now that I'm sober it's true there's less to do right away. I remember this takes some getting used to. It's frustrating for being 25 years old to admit that you have problems. I'm finding out that my ability to say "no" to myself my self-control has been pretty useless for sometime. That makes it tough to get out of bed because saying "yes" and doing positive things start out like doing chores. ..I'm not sure where this post was going but perhaps just shows there's far more happening when your drinking every day that goes unnoticed..

First of all  be glad that you're 25 and able to admit you have a problem instead of it waiting until you're 26. Alcohol isn't picky when it comes to who it wants to take with them. Be glad you're safe that you didn't kill anybody on those drives home and that you atleast have a bed to wake up in. Habits don't form overnight and most of the time it takes some work to get used to it. You need to find yourself a hobby. Something that you really enjoy or want to learn. This will help give you that little "oomph" when it comes to just getting out of bed. Don't beat yourself up it's a waste of time and nobody wants to be around a pity party. I'm sure there are some things that you stopped doing before you were big into drinking. Take a step back reflect and figure it out then go apply yourself. You've already become a better person by not drinking; don't stop bettering yourself now. Use that momentum.
Loneliness is easily curable since a lot of lonely former drinkers are actively pursuing recovery.  Go to some meetings of some sort; meet some people.
