I want to thank everyone for your support during my urges and thoughts about drinking last weekend. I honestly had this thought in my head that after one year of sobriety my mental health and brain would be completely recalibrated and everything would work perfect afterwards. Here I am with over a year sobriety and I'm still struggling. But it's okay because I can access support and do other things like that because I'm sober...Even though there is a part of me that would love to have a drink so I could have an easier time falling asleep the fact of the matter is that alcohol is terrible for anxiety and insomnia and I'm better off talking to my doctor and psychiatrist about non-addictive treatments then self-medicating myself. I did that for decades and it didn't work. I suspect it made things worse...That said for all of the struggles I experience I'm still very grateful to be sober. I have beautiful cats and dogs a loving spouse a terrific job a beautiful home which is a big deal to me because for over 10 years we lived in what we called our Crack Shack. It was in a terrible neighborhood not much room for the dogs to run and the house was old and falling apart...I could not have achieved these things if I was drinking...I also would like to give a shout out to anyone who is struggling today. I know what that's like! And I know that it's possible to ride the waves of anxiety depression distress and come out on the other side. For me the waves come throughout the day so it feels like it's constant but it isn't. There are moments where I can breathe...We all deserve sobriety and the gifts it can bring. Wishing everyone a wonderful Friday. Chances are I will be checking in this weekend because last weekend was so difficult and I don't want a repeat. Better to be proactive than reactive!

Thanks for posting! I find myself riding the waves too the feeling hits so hard sometimes that I'm positive that I'll end up drinking. But I know now that if I wait it out long enough that I won't feel that way anymore and then feel full of gratitude for having not drank. I hope you have a fantastic Friday :)
