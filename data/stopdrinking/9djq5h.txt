I wouldn't be where I am today. I believe that all of the horrible things I've done or caused while drinking was some sort of blessing in disguise to snap me in to a sober life...If I wasn't sober I'd be drinking heavily still (obviously). Ruining relationships. Unemployed. Broke. Severely damaging my mental and physical health...There's nothing glamorous about drinking. Nothing good comes from drinking. ..Sure you may feel temporarily  fine  or  happy  after drinking but what will tomorrow bring?..Heartache. Anxiety. Guilt. Shame. Empty Bank Account. Upset loved ones. Unexplained Bruises. Headaches. Hangovers. ..... the list goes on...If you're struggling and thinking about drinking today keep coming to this group. Go to a meeting. Call a loved one. Go on a walk. Avoid alcohol like those salespeople working the kiosk in shopping malls...If I didn't find this group I wouldn't be sober today...IWNDWYT!

Everything I ever did wrong can be used to help someone else. All my alcoholic fuckups can help someone else to realise they have this disease or help them through the same situation. I think god/the universe/whatever you wanna call it recycles in this way. There is nothing that can't be used for good.
Avoid alcohol like those salespeople working the kiosk at the shopping mall...That is excellent! Made me chuckle. It is the perfect response to alcohol- no eye contact cross to the other side of the mall walk faster ignore whatever they are saying just say no thanks..Thanks for your post. Iwndwyt
