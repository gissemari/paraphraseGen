Please pray for me y'all... I had 9 months in the beginning of June then slipped up and like the story always goes I'm finding it difficult to get time again. I know I will push through but I back at day 1 today... again. Instead of hiding my relapse though I called my sponsor when I woke up and told him everything... my addictions manifest and find their life in the darkness and secrets. I felt horrible when I woke up but after that call I feel better. Relapse is apart of recovery but I will not drink with you all today at least.

sorry to hear that ! I'm really wanting to drink today and I'm also contemplating it 
I'm back at stupid day 1 today too hugs! Won't drink with you today  
Good luck! I know how tough this is. It's probably the hardest thing I've done in my adult life which is sad but true. But many people don't make the decision that we are making to change our ways and be healthier people. I won't drink today! And you'll always always find support here :)
back at day one as well :(
What happened in June? Defining my triggers and becoming aware of situations/both emotional and external was really crucial to relapse prevention for me. Welcome back and I will not drink with you today!
Back on day one too.  Hang in there.  Will say a prayer for you
