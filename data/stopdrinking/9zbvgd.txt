Hey everyone- Happy Thanksgiving/Happy Holidays to those who celebrate...Tonight seemed normal enough for me- my wife of about 10 years came with me to my parents house for Thanksgiving. It's about an 8-9 hour drive one way  and even though I thought everything was fine earlier apparently my wife thought differently. I've been abstaining from alcohol all together but the rest of my family was unwinding with a couple of drinks so I had a few beers.  Fast forward and my wife and I have a melt down complete with her sleeping on the couch at my parents house.  I honestly don't know why.  She claims I was being mean to her and calling her names which I don't remember at all.  I wasn't blackout drunk. I remember the entirely of the conversation.  In my mind I was joking-playing around. I wasn't being serious. She claims I  threw blankets at her - which I don't remember at all.. ..I know my issues would likely resolve completely if I gave up drinking entirely.. by its hard when you feel like you've done nothing wrong.  ..I'm really struggling right now and I think I really need a friendly voice. ..No matter what happens with my wife of 10 years I need some change in my life today. No matter what happens with me tonight ..IWNDWYT...Thank you all for your support and your encouragement.  I appreciate each and every one of you.
