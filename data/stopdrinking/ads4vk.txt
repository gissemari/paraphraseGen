I'm 26 years old now. I've been half heartedly trying to quit for several years. I'm not sure what the breaking point was but in early December I called my parents crying and asking for help. They let me move in and for fourteen days I didn't drink. I didn't think about drinking only a few times I was tempted to stop at the gas station on the way home but I managed to keep driving. My family and friends were exceptionally supportive. ..On my fourteenth day sober the day after Christmas I walked into work and was fired. I was completely blindsided - every performance review I was told I was doing great. I worked my ass off during our holiday season with long hours and minimal days off. ..I relapsed. I went on a five day bender before I returned to my parents house. Since then I have been sneaking drinks and drinking during the day at my apartment. ..I start my new job tomorrow and I'm ready to quit again.

Welcome.  I got so tired of being sneaky with drinking so others didn't see how much I was really having.  It sounds like your parents are supportive that's good!  Not drinking and starting your new job fresh sounds like a good plan!  I will not drink with you today.
