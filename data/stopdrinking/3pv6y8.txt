I've quit many times in the past 8 years but never came close to over 100 days. I know that is not a lot of time but I've been very surprised that for some reason it's not been all that difficult this time around. The fact that drinking is on my mind very little has me concerned somewhat. I want to stay prepared for a craving that comes from out of the blue. Equipped to manage that situation so I come out the other end of it still sober...What are some ways you keep your guard up?

"You know what? I've been doin' *just fine* these last few weeks. I can totally handle a beer!"..You can't. It's a *trap*.

Great to hear you're doing so well! Congrats on 109 days! 
I keep my guard up by trying to notice early early triggers and thoughts long before they are fully formed or strong. I had an easy around this time so I don't think it's abnormal that this can happen.
I keep my guard up by checking in with other alcoholics every day whether here or at meetings.  Being able to share my (former) shame has made a huge difference.
