Yesterday I bought wine two big bottles in fact. It went against my own inner voice. I was telling myself not to do it to go straight home. But I didn't listen. One red solo cup turned into two turned into the entire liter bottle. I thought i'd only have a little but I disregarded past experience not having that off switch. So 5 months streak broken in one night. I feel like crap. Headache numbness malaise I feel slightly separated from my body and each movement and thought takes effort. ..It ain't worth it. I'm getting rid of that other bottle when I get home. It's $18 but it ain't worth it. ..So if you're out there struggling and you see this don't do what I did. It ain't worth it.  Talk to someone get help  eat tacos whatever just don't get booze. It ain't worth it.

I'm sorry for your lapse  but today's a new day!! ..You can do this!!  IWNDWYT 
Thank you this helped me a lot. I'm struggling with temptation. Not going to drink today tomorrow next day. ..You are strong and brave to start over you can do this!!!! ..Iwndwy
You're right.  I told myself every 2 months I'll have a day where I drink to remind myself what I'm giving up...Well I only had 3 drinks and I guess my body was so used to waking up completely fresh because I felt completely out of it the next day.  I mean if 3 drinks can do that imagine what 7 is doing to our bodies.  ..So I'm throwing that plan out the window.  I guess my recovery is going that great that I dont even want to drink anymore.  Strange thing is my tolerance was still high as I didnt even feel the drinks.  So basically I didn't get drunk and still woke up in a fog...Bottom line drinking is boring once you've gone through a few months of sobriety.  Stay strong!  
Great reminder!  And tacos are so much better anyway.
Thx.Iwndwyt
