i'm 24 years old and have been drinking heavy since i was 21. i sober up in between because of too much binge drinking blackouts and hangovers. sometimes i make it just a day or 2 up to a few days sometimes a weeksometimes a few weeks sometimes months. and even though i  do well in those times when i'm sober for months and start to feel good i somehow always fall back into drinking again i always sell myself the idea that now i'm cured of my addictions and i can just have 2 drinks for the night. i'll buy about 10 beers planning to make them last at least one week and then i end up just chugging them all without any control in one sitting. or i'll buy just 2 beers for the night finish them and then go back and buy more...i'm definitely an alcoholic i completely loose control once i start drinking and i am dependent on alcohol. i am hungover as im writing this and it's not the first time this week and this month.. but this time i feel a strong need and longing to stop drinking. ...i made it to 7 months sober this year and it was amazing but then i got depressed because something happened and i went back to my old ''remedies'' i relapsed in August and got sober in september again and it lasted for almost 2 months. in late october i relapsed again and since then i've been drinking and drinking. ...one thing that doesn't help with my alcoholism is that i love the taste of beer i haven't had a stronger drink since february this year. but i drink a lot of beer and some of those beers are 12% alcohol by volume and i drink a few of them and it's like i've drank a whole bottle of whiskey...i think what i need to focus on and take care of is my depressionanxietysocial anxiety and really work on those and if i get better i won't feel any need or want to get drunk.

Definitely agree with you that addressing the underlying reasons that lead to your drinking is a smart move. A LOT of us here struggle with depression anxiety (social anxiety too) including myself. The alcohol never helps fix those and only makes them worse in the long run. If you can work on those I think you'll find that cutting the alcohol out of your life will get much easier!..You can definitely do this and it's absolutely worth all the effort you put into it. I will not drink with you! :)
This could've been written by myself. I'm 25 had 6 months sober at the end of 2014/beginning of 2015 but slipped back into old habits of binging every time I have a drink. .You've realised you need a change which is the first step. I wish you every success for the future :)
