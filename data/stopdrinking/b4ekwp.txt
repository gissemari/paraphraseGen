I've been at a sticking point in my recovery lately. I keep realizing behaviors and thought patterns that I need to work on but don't necessarily know what actions I can do to fix them. I also find myself realizing that working on the aspects of my personality that I don't care for those pieces rooted in trauma or from spending more than two thirds of my life drinking is actually rewarding even though it sucks in the immediate moment...I was having a conversation with a friend as she was giving me a lift to work after a meeting about how much this shit has sucked lately and she had asked me "Where were you a year ago? Two years ago?" and told me how much improvement she's seen in me since we met...People keep telling me things like that and I have trouble believing them because the self critic is still alive and well inside me. I have buried an alcohol monster alive somewhere and that self critic fucker is going around with a shovel and a map trying to dig it up...I am thankful for the words of encouragement I read here and for the opportunity to say little nice things to other rad people in this struggle...I am thankful for my Refuge Recovery sangha a group of people I now consider family...I am thankful for the difficult realizations and for the difficult circumstances. Not drinking through these has been the yardstick by which I measure my progress in recovery...I will not drink with you today!
