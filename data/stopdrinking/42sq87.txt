Wife's mother is still in the hospital and we are all preparing for the results of her tests. Wife is going through a lot of struggle and seems torn. I am doing what I can for her and our children. Took off work yesterday to watch kids (first time I took off work since getting sober) and it helped. So much to consider... We are taking in her mom's animals... We will officially be a zoo in a few days! Ugh. Did I mention I am not drinking today? Going to a meeting tonight. Thanks for reading!

Stay strong. Our thoughts are with you. I'm not drinking today too!!  :)
Good luck with everything I hope she gets back good results
Sounds like you've taken up juggling. Glad you're keeping the self-care in the mix--that helps me today.
