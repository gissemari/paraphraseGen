9th day sober been seeing doctors this week and they prescribed me soome antabus to help cutting the addiction...For the uninitiated antabus reacts with alcohol and causes severe blushing nausea and headache. It is taken to prevent the possible relapse though it doesn't help with the cravings...I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand it feels silly to take such medicine for I'm not planning to relapse (who WOULD?) But I'm also excited for the knowledge that I couldn't have a pint even if I wanted to...Then there's the small possibility that the medication will destroy my liver. For that I'll have to visit the vampires of lab every two weeks so that they can analyse my blood. Luckily I'm not scared of needels...Anyone having experience with antabus or other meds? Or words of wisdom regarding this whole quitting with the help of doctors?

This drug can be a great for stringing the initial days and weeks of sobriety together. Our motivation and desires are not static. Monday me wants to eat healthy and exercise. Friday me is the opposite. Taking Antabuse in the morning is insurance against urges to drink later in the day by removing the option. It is not a cure but can be an effective piece of the sobriety puzzle. It works even better if you can get a friend or family member to witness your medication intake. 
I took antabuse before and helped me twice to stay sober for 2 months. Both times after 2 months I thought I could handle it without Antabuse... and I relapsed in less than a week... I'm going to start taking it again.
