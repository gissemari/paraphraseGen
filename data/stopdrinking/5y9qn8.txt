My mom came up to me last night as I was making a nice dinner since coming out of the hospital and said "flowers I want to tell you something important. I like you sober the most. You're more fun and happy. I love this you the most." Gave me a mom kiss and went to bed. .Two weeks to the day sober after a nasty relapse. Went to the psych hospital did group therapy. Learned a lot about myself talked to a lot of alcoholics and had some heart to hearts. I Gotta say naltrexone and new meds are helping following through with therapy. Zero cravings so far and very happy with how things are going. Just had to share. No drinking tonight just another good home made dinner with my awesome supportive friends and family!

That's so sweet! Sending you good vibes. I won't drink with you. 
Too cool! Aren't mom's great? I'm happy for you seems you've got a plan :)
Such a lovely post :)
My mom mentioned that too. She said "you know I don't think you can handle any other state of mind except being sober and thats nothing to be ashamed of. It'd beautiful actually".
