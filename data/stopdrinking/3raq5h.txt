So I've been drinking and using drugs for half my life.  I'm 29 now and my life has basically amounted to nothing.  If it wasn't for my dad I would literally be homeless on the street. I have no job no diploma friends etc.  I've spent the last 2 years after I lost my job at my fathers place getting clean for a few months then binging for a few weeks.  The last couple years I've discovered Buddhism and meditation and I felt like it had changed my life I really discovered a way to be happy sober and I thought that I was done with drinking.  However every few months I would forget about all the pain and problems from drinking and just have ONE drink and before I knew it I was blowing thousands of dollars and booze blow pills etc and just hating life.  The contrast of that from who I was only a few weeks earlier really hurts to think about.  .Anyways enough of the all the crap.  I'm ready to try again...this time I'm thinking I need to be accountable and maybe have some support other than my parents.  I was also thinking of journaling and having a good routine that prevents me from relapsing ever again.  I don't like AA been there before and never felt at home and it actually ended up making things worse.  The longest I've been sober was 8 months and it was using excercise and meditation.  Bu then my friends gf randomly called me and invited me to his surprise party and I thought that I'd drink one last time for HIM because he hadn't seen me in a long  time etc etc.  it doesn't matter why you end up drinking again its never justified and usually a stupid reason.  That's my biggest fear it my own mind which lies to me and tells me things that end up putting me in situations in which I could've easily died..How to end this for good?.

Accountability and social pressure can be pretty important. You might seriously look into AA and getting a sponsor.
