Hi friends...today marks one year since I quit drinking. I was an every night wine drinker with occasional binge drinking episodes ranging from embarrassing to horrifying. But none of my friends or family thought I had a problem. Drinking is completely normalized in my community and I was  no worse than anybody else.' I have advanced degrees a great marriage and material things that make it seem like everything was  fine.  I knew it wasn't fine and I had a problem. I struggled to quit for years. I felt alone with this problem afraid to feel my feelings and I was in denial about a lot of things in my life. Then after drinking heavily on my birthday and not having any fun in the process I decided I really wanted to give myself a gift. I wanted to feel better and i knew the only way to do that was to completely stop with alcohol. .It's not been easy but it has been so worth it. I DO feel better. I am hopeful. I feel more confident and I am starting to heal. .Step one: give yourself the gift. Don't drink today. This community has helped me through and let me see that I'm not alone in this.

Truth to everything you said. Especially about it being  normalized.  All of my educated successful friends are very heavy drinkers. Good for you to make this change! IWNDWYT
