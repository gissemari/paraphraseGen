I am really struggling right now. I cannot sleep I have terrible headache/pressure . Every time I close my eyes I hear my head pulse . It's 3am where I am and I have to be up at 430 for a ski trip . I'm not petrified of being in a car for 5 hours ..This has become a 24/7 disease I am literally from the minute I wake up till I go to sleep checking my phone for symptoms. The minute I put my phone down I can't keep any concentration. ....
