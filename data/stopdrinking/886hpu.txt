So I have been here before day 5 6 and 7. This is where the loneliness hits. Hubby has to go to bed early for work. Our kids are grown...it's just me and the dogs binge watching tv. Usually this was me and my best friend wine time but not now. On my various attempts to quit since October this is what ultimately caused me to relapse. Not this time. Something is different. There's a peace inside me....I don't want to drink. I have no desire to drink right now! I feel content and I am actually enjoying my  loneliness  right now   IWNDWYT
