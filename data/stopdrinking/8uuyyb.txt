I'm determined not to drink this weekend. It's just hard when I'm on vacation. However I want/can do this...I've relapsed and starting over again and it's almost a week. Thank goodness for this sub and all the wonderful people that help!

That's a great goal! What are you going to do to achieve it?..Early on something as "simple" as keeping a chart with 24 rows 4 columns so that I could check off a box every 15 minutes I didn't drink was helpful. So was making a commitment to check in to SD.
