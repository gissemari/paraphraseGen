Hey Sobernauts!..I've accepted the responsibility of sharing my story on December 24 8pm meeting. (I attend 12 step meetings as part of my recovery.)..The strange thing about my story is that I have actually had much more struggles since I put the drink down than I did before I got sober...When you hear the stories of other people who quit drinking what part of their "Experience  Strength and Hope" is most beneficial especially around the holidays? I would like to know what I should focus on and what to avoid about my journey. ..I welcome feedback. ..Stay sober my friends...Mouse

Sweet! Another chance to be of service!
We all like the war stories at meetings but all too often It seems it's 40 min of "what it was like what happened" and 5 min of "what it's like now". For me I think it's more inspiring to hear about what it's like now to know that sobriety is worth it. I've followed your story on here the last few years of being sober and it in itself is an inspiration which I'm sure would have been much more of a struggle had you not been sober. It proves that no matter what is thrown at you it still is possible to go through it without picking up a drink. I honestly think sharing as much as you are comfortable with about your sober journey would be an awesome share.
