I hope it is ok to post here because it is primarily related to my drinking. But I wanted to share that with increased sobriety my desire to smoke pot pretty much went away. That does not mean I am completely sober from pot still working on it. Complete sobriety will mean never smoking pot again versus once a month. I also have struggled with eating disorders and aside from two slip ups I haven't had the urge to purge since quitting drinking. I think this is because my psychiatric medication can actually work now that I'm not combining it with alcohol. Just wanted to share!..Edited to add that I noticed this was downvoted. Is this an inappropriate post for this subreddit?

Sounds like you are doing really well..My problem was and will always be alcohol so your 200 days is awesome to me..Keep going you got this!
Not inappropriate in my mind.  Our isms often run in pairs or packs.  Success in recovery means not falling down a different hole.  ..Good luck  - also realize reddit itself seems to throw in down votes on occasion for no reason I understand 
Quite a few meetings I go to stress that all shares must be solely about alcohol and one of our secretary's is dead against for example Cocaine Anonymous yet CA starts each meeting with a reading encompassing all mind altering substances including alcohol. I've never understood the exclusivity as so many of us have at least one cross addiction. Oh and it would be so much more constructive if down voters posted about their problems so they could be taken on board.
