The treatment program I am in consists of 3 phases. Its called intensive out patient with supportive housing. The reality of it is we live in a home like inpatient but go to our groups and approved recovery meetings outside the home. The whole program has a lot of support built into it but I am not allowed to work or even look for work until I'm in phase 3. Currently I'm in phase 2 which is the longest phase and have gotten certain privileges back like my phone and internet. But without a way to make an income the largest struggle I have is how to pay my two bills... a very small storage unit and my cell phone. ..Feel free to ask me any questions you may have...I'd love any ideas surrounding my situation.

Good for you for taking positive action to improve your life.  I had a similar situation when I went to my third treatment in Ga.  We lived in apartments and had like a campus where we had process groups and such.  We had phases similar to what you describe.  The last phase was mirror imaging where we started to get a couple months together and could begin to see a shift in out thinking for the better.  Best wishes to you my friend.  
You are fortunate to be able to attend such a program. Many don't have the opportunity. Inpatient treatment saved my life. I hope it does the same for you.
