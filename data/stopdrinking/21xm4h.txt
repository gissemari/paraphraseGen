Tapered down last week and my last drink was 2:30pm on Sunday so I'm coming close to the 48 hour mark. Yesterday I felt pretty great besides one or two points where my heart was racing and I had some bad anxiety. But it passed in under 30 minutes. I drank lots of chamomile tea and went to bed earlier than I have in a while. I seem a bit shakier today but other than that I feel good motivated and don't have any craving or desire to drink...I've been talking to some people on here who quit the same time as me and it definitely helps. Just knowing someone out there is sharing in your struggle is motivating. Best of luck to everyone today.

You're doing great! Don't worry about drinking too much tea or giving into cravings for sweets. All that matters is not drinking. I ate so much candy and drank so much caffeine during the first 45 days and it really calmed my cravings down. I think that I was letting my body know that I wasn't getting rid of all mood altering substances just the deadly one. 
Good deal /u/quittingalcohol!  Please keep sharing.
Best of luck to you too - sounds like a great start!
