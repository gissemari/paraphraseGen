So the badge is a lie first off. ..Longest stint sober was about a year intermittent months since then. ..Every time I'm derailed by a romantic interest completely without their knowledge in an attempt to seem normal. ..Anyone else struggle with this?

Tell them you can't drink because of some medication you are taking for something trivial. "Sobermicine" if you will :)
No I don't. Because I know I'm not "normal" and that's okay. I accept myself as I am because this is me. Warts and all. My suggestion would be to get some sober legs under you and learn to live that way before trying to date.  I've seen it suggested wait up to a year before dating and I know people who have but I don't know if that long is actually necessary.  I think being honest with yourself is the most important thing. 
Yes. That's why I've stayed away from any dating until I'm confident in my sobriety. Maybe around the six month mark I'll reconsider.
No I am not drinking for anyone or any body even johnny depp.
