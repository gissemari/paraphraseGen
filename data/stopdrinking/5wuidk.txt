I relapsed on Monday and I hadn't posted on here in a while but I did Tuesday when I was feeling awful about relapsing. ..So many of you responded. I woke up again this morning to about 10 amazing supportive comments. You have no idea how grateful I am. Thank you! I still feel disappointed but I keep reading over your comments and know that it'll be OK. ..I've never wanted to give so many strangers on the Internet such huge bear hugs! You guys are the absolute best.

This place really is great. I have never felt judged which makes it so much easier to talk about mistakes. I'm glad you are feeling better! I won't drink with you today.
Talking to others is how we all stay sober. Sorry to hear about the relapse. Can you draw any lessons from it that will make your sobriety stronger going forward?
I never could have broken the drinking cycle without what I learned here on r/sd. Best wishes. 
Best wishes - you've got this!  .  .Not drinking with you today.
Here's more huge bear hugs for ya! xo
For me this sub is like a 24/7 AA meeting that I can wear my pajamas to. I don't even have to shower before I check in for my new sober day!
