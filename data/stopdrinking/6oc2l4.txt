A few weeks ago I felt weak I was a total slave to my desires. I struggled with temptation a lot. Dieting was difficult and the thought of not drinking for a weekend felt impossible...Since quitting though I feel stronger. I feel more in control of myself and my life. I don't gorge myself on food and drink whenever I feel the urge...I've got this.
