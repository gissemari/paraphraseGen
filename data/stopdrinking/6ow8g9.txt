Tired of relapsing. Tired of feeling like there's no one here that drinks as excessive amounts as me. I can't even believe it's possible to handle so much abuse. I can't eat or hold down any fluids today. Can't rest with out crying in pain. I don't even know what I've done the last 3 days. I look in the mirror and it's amazing what 3 days of alcohol can do; I don't recognize myself. Some one please tell me I'm not alone with this amount of drinking. I'm terrified that this pain will last forever this time. I just want to know other people have survived worse amounts. I remember when drinking 1.75L a month was considered excessive by me... Can't believe how bad this has gotten. Just want to relate to someone that's drinking as much as me to ease my mind that I'm gonna be ok come tomorrow even though I feel like death today. ..Edit: thanks for all the replies. I know everyone hurts and struggles when they suffer alcoholism whether it's a beer a day or 20. It just feels nice knowing im not alone in terms of sheer volume I consume. I'm baffled how some people could drink 1.75L a day for years on end and still manage to function like a couple stories I read here. The amount of physical pain I'm in is unbearable I just can't imagine how people cope with it so long. It's like all my organs are about to explode.  Trying to stay positive and just appreciate knowing I'm alive and I can push through this. Blah.
