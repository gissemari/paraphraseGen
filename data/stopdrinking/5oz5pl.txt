I won't drink with you today.  It'll get better.
Your post couldn't have come at a better time!! I will join you in NOT drinking tonight!
I won't drink with you today either. It is so shit right now but it really does get better. That part of the brain convincing you to drink is the 'booze brain' and it's a disgusting liar. Keep busy focus on your music and let it pass with distraction. Easier said than done but try and stay focussed on not prolonging the pain and something healthy you enjoy.
The Voice sucks.  It's never done anything good for anyone.  Sorry you're struggling right now.  Do you have anything that brings any relief?  Even if it's just a walk/a video game/drawing a picture etc.?  I had to stay so busy I couldn't hear the voice.  Different people have different copes but I found that sometimes even a few minutes of relief made all the difference when I was struggling.
I went to bed at 7pm with ice cream several times to get through a super annoying day.  ..Repeating week 1 is the worst!  Hang in there you got this.
