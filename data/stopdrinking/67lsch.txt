[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** There was a blackout in San Francisco and I didn't know what was going on. I heard that blackouts were simultaneously happening in cities like New York and New Orleans. I thought -- maybe it's the zombie invasion! My triumph is that I did not have to worry about how I was going to get wine if all the shops were closed like they were after the last big earthquake because even a zombie invasion was not going to make me drink. (Turns out that wasn't what was happening after all   it was just a fire in a Tenderloin electrical substation.)..**Struggle:** My mother went to the doctor for a digestive issue and the doctor asked her not to drink for three weeks so that he could re-test her after a period of sobriety. But after only one day she was back to drinking wine with dinner. On the one hand it's none of my business. She has her journey and I have mine. On the other hand it's hard for me to listen to her talk about how she shouldn't have to feel deprived. ..**General:** I just watched *The Secret Life of Pets* on Netflix which was fun. Of course I teared up at the end when the pets joyfully reunite with their owners after a day of fighting the bad guys...What do you imagine is the secret life of *your* pet?.
----------immediate responses--------

Hey Wednesday!.Triumph: I'm back on track with my energy level on the job. I had a few important meetings yesterday and I was surprised how clearly I can articulate myself and have sharp mind again. .Struggle: Some matters between me and my GF are not closed with conclussion their are back again and again and it's hard. Positive side is that I know alcochol doesn't influence my thinking. .General: Have fantastic idea how to make additional money. Started preps yesterday. It's nothing but on-line training for IT bit I guess it could be successful. ..I have two wabbits. I'm pretty sure one of them is boss of underground pets gang like in the movie! :)
Triumph: sobering on with 90 days feeling better than ever .Struggle: Having a lot of really bad dreams that I remember now that I fall asleep instead of passing out (gotta love normal live shit).General: Had floors installed wow I love having the money to get new flooring I saved $2600.00 from stop drinking on January 5 sober day January 9 after detox 
Hey zombie invasion made me laugh.  I'm now thinking of The Walking Dead.  Which drink-wise also made me think.  If I was in a real-life situation of the walking dead what would I do when all the alcohol was gone?  I would need to stock-pile a secret stash of booze and fags and would no-doubt risk my life (and the lives of others') to get my hands on it...Today is Day 7 for me I have managed to navigate my way round the supermarket twice.  yesterday was the most difficult so I bought myself some nice food instead and am feeling rather smug about it :).I have also been able to jump in the car at any time without having to calculate how many units I had when and if I am now OK to drive..I would like to thank everyone here I would not have got past day 2 without you all.  As much as anything I don't want to let you down..Sorry for the rather disjointed and off-topic post.  Its 5 in the morning and I needed to 'speak' to someone...Have a great day everyone I will absolutely not drink with you today :)
Triumph: Have a second date(ish) with this girl who is sober like me today. She's a year clean so it's like an even keel type thing between me and her. I would rather date sober women but not those early in sobriety for obvious reasons. We have a ton of things in common she likes motorcycles running spicy food coffee weird psycho thriller type movies. Really energetic. Emotionally mature and pretty....Struggle: That girl is moving at the end of the week to another city. Close by kind of (170 miles) but still moving away. I don't have anything invested there obviously since we've only had one date but dang it still a little bummed. ....General: Trying to lose these last 8 pounds before I leave for Europe in mid May. Things are looking pretty grim. But hell it's freaking Europe and I've already lost 70 pounds so far. Also trying to learn how to hold a back bend for longer amounts of time and I am going to try and learn to kick it up into a handstand tonight. 
T - Wednesday will mark the 46th day of complete sobriety for me. NO drinks...no weed. I think it's the longest I've gone clean for since graduating high school. .S - Managing depression is a tricky thing isn't it? Lately I've been feeling trapped in a job I'm losing passion for. I don't really know where to aim the ship that is my life. I have no career planned just goals and aspirations that seem out of reach. I've taken solace in small pleasures such as time off...which is sparse so Monday-Wednesday always feels like a huge hole to dig out of. .G - When I set out on this path I knew it would be difficult. It's hard to fill such holes you put so many bad things into. I bought a vape as an outlet I'm not big on vape culture but if it can help me not drink that's a good thing at least in my mind. I haven't seen one of my best friends in 4 months but I know I'm not ready for that environment yet. ..One day at a time. It ain't easy but nothing that was good ever was. Keep grinding.
Triumph: Today's day 31! The fact that I've made it this far is triumph enough! ..Struggle: My husband &amp; I began the process to buy a house. Anything financial REALLY scares me and stresses me out. I like our current lifestyle &amp; im scared of change. ..General: I'm truly looking forward to this Saturday just so I can sleep in! I'm exhausted lol
Triumph: Coming up to a week sober. I host a weekly event at a bar which I attended this week. Usually drink throughout the night and is probably the most I spend on alcohol a week due to actually being at a bar. I drank water all night and after telling everyone(Including the bartenders) that it was water all night for me because I was now sober everyone was happy for me and congratulated me. Felt good for people to be so supportive of me. Especially being a bar knowing that they cared more about my health than about their business from me...Struggle: Was going to start hitting the gym again on Monday but got hit in the face by allergies. Haven't had the energy/state of mind to exercise. On the plus side I'm not dealing with allergies *and* a hangover...General: Speaking of Netflix I've been watching Bossgirl. Absolutely love it. About 3-4 episodes in. It's also been very inspiring watching a show about someone trying to follow their dreams now that sobriety has started to make me feel more capable of following my own.
Triumph: Reaching Day 4 feels great! I have been actively struggling this time round since the end of January and I haven't reached Day 4 since early March (I got to 22 days in February!). I am just not giving up. I am going to do this and do this...well..until I really do it!.Struggle: Procrastination. I am learning to "make" myself do essential tasks again (housecleaning work-related tasks). I used to be able to do this more easily but in the last couple of years it has been more and more difficult. .General: I am grateful for finding SD. For me this is the most upbeat nonjudgmental and inspirational place on the internet for online sober support. Thank you!
We have a nest cam so I know the secret life of my pet lol 
Triumph: First I am really impressed by myself I made it this far and I have kept to my plan of checking in SD multiple times a day. For the first time in my life I am actually LOVING my sobriety rather than running/hiding from alcohol.  ..Second huge triumph dangerously high blood pressure is already beginning to come back to almost the normal range after only 10 days.  ..Struggle:  Wife and I are effectively living separate lives under one roof and it is not an ideal situation.  There are a lot more complications in our relationship but the drinking/hiding was/is a big one. But a little mini-triumph in this struggle is that for the first time I am focused on me and my sobriety and accept that whatever else is meant to happen around the sober me will fall into place...Another struggle is losing some weight. My body used to respond very quickly to changes so I'd have thought after 10 days I'd be down just a couple/few lbs but its marginal; I'm eating better and exercising so hopefully it'll come soon..
Triumph: I made it through my birthday weekend! I wasn't too worried going into it but I knew my brain might try and make it a reason to drink. But I played the tape forward and took it like any other day and I turned down free birthday drinks :)..Struggle: I haven't been doing the good habits that I worked to get into lately. I haven't taken my vitamins in weeks. I should have changed my contacts a while ago but haven't hell most nights I've even been sleeping in them. Instead of bringing a lunch I buy some crap at the cafeteria or go out and eat junk. I'm pretty loosey goosey by nature but I do much better when I make myself stick to routine. I recognized this morning that letting these things slide is a big red flag. I need to get back into practicing discipline for my own good...General: My grandson has a hamster that lives at our house which means I have a hamster to care for. They're nocturnal animals so I don't see much of him but when it gets dark he comes out to run on his wheel all night long. I have mixed feelings about the whole thing but I try to provide him with a good home since he's with us. ..
Triumph: finally finished a huge project for the VP of Finance so that burden has been lifted from my shoulders (it's been stressing me for weeks).  ..Struggle: I burned both ends of the candle getting it done so I have been walking around like a zombie for the past couple of days. Reminds me of my hangover days haha. ..Random: I have never owned a pet. Never wanted one even as a kid. And I hope my son never asks me for one. 
**Triumph:** I have a week sober I have made it to 7 meetings so far &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; I am remembering to brush my teeth in the morning :D..**Struggle:**First month emotional wrecking ball rollercoast of doom.... dealing with that. It's like I am bipolar my ups are UP but I can cry driving by a cactus (it seriously happened a cactus)...**General:** I couldn't bring my dogs with me when I divorce and fled :( HOWEVER I had a pet bird for almost a decade and he is with my sister now &amp; he is still alive and kicking. The Secret life of Mork... idk he pulls out his own feathers and it neurotic as hell - yeah I really dunno. ..High Five
I'm trying to quit but I get bad shakes and night sweats if I go to long. What's some good advice for tapering off slowly I can't afford to go to a doctor and I've heard that "tuffing it out" might be a dangerous choice.
**Triumph** I successfully attended TWO boozy events this past weekend with flying colours!  No urges.  No slip ups.  Just a great sober time...**Struggle**  My health.  Nothing tragic just frustrating.  Since I decided to get sober I have had nasty bronchitis followed by pink eye / conjunctivitis (YES! it is terribly contagious!).  I just want both to leave my body!  NOW!..**General**  Sobriety is wonderful!  Lost a few pounds with 20 more to go.  Once I feel 100% I will be hitting the gym with my daughter who I will be bringing home from university tomorrow.  I can't wait for her to discover I am not drinking.  She will be over the moon.
Triumph: We were finally approved for our Specific Use Permit and are able to move into the new building that we have been fighting for since February...Struggle: I am trying to get back on track as I had yet ANOTHER mini relapse on Monday... so I need to reset my badge. Friday is a large vendor event and there is always a ton of booze and I'm stressing it... on another note I'm not sure if it's a struggle or a triumph I've been able to see why I'm 25 lbs overweight I can take a look at my lifestyle for the past few years and see that binge drinking and the next hangover day trying to make myself feel better with fast food 2-3 times a week contributed to all this... even if I was working out regularly...General: I just got diagnosed with adult ADD which apperently leads to impulsive behavior so there is that... but the Dr is super rad and is allowing me to try my hippie/natural remedies first. My dog totally sits on the couch when we aren't home... sometimes he even naps on my daughters bed (big no-nos lol)

Triumph made it to my class at the gym when I just wanted to succumb to my couch.Struggle-anger .General-moving in 15 days finally no more roommates. I'm scared - but excited! .I will not drink today! 
**Triumph:** Ting! that's the sound of my badge turning into a star...**Struggle:** Still dealing with moodiness...**General:** I'm running a marathon with friends on Saturday. It's going to be hot and miserable. We are undertrained. Hoo boy.
T: At conference lots of friends and comraderie and drinking. Had a good time with mineral water. Went to Refuge Recovery meeting too. They were super welcoming and friendly. So very glad I attended...S: Work. Just focusing on getting done some of the basic tasks. Follow through...G: I feel pretty damn good. I am losing weight. Skin is amazing. No more achy pains. Trying to do mindful meditation at least once a day. Thankful for you all here in SD. You have kept me going.
Triumph: Sticking to my plan of sober people and sober places (I read about this in several posts - so simple and yet I've never really tried it before! Maybe abstractly but I've never thought of it as something hard and fast that could help me stop drinking.. duh!). I turned down some invitations over the weekend and planned early morning activities to keep me busy...Struggle: I've been somewhat obsessing over my 30th birthday. I'm choosing to spend it out of town with my siblings who all live in the same city. My initial goal on SD was to stop drinking for 30 days and my birthday will be after that. Part of me wants to be able to have a drink to celebrate and part of me thinks I would be happier if I didn't drink at all. ..General: Just being on SD has helped me think critically about a lot of not so healthy things I do automatically and why I do them.
**Triumph:** I've been tangentially connected to [Choice In Recovery](http://choiceinrecovery.net) since I got sober. It's really neat to see them growing and gaining traction...**Struggle:** I've been sick. Spent a couple days sleeping a couple days dragging. A week later and I finally feel like I can get back to exercise...**Secret life of my dog:** She sleeps on furniture she is not allowed on when we're not around. She knows I won't be mad at her so gets up much more slowly when I come in and bounds up when my wife is first in the door.
I'm glad you were OK during the blackout Mary! And nice NDV ;)...Triumph:     I'm incredibly happy dating R. There's a feeling of peace and love that I haven't felt in many years. It's almost surreal...Struggle:    There's been another setback with the health care opportunity that I'm getting certified for. It's very frustrating and nothing I can do about it but being sober has provided me with the patience and determination to hang in here and stay strong...General:     Next week is my birthday and friends seem to be planning something. The good news is that they know and respect that I don't drink and there won't be alcohol present. It's just going to be different having a sober birthday party - but I wouldn't trade it for the world!
Triumph: This is day 4 of not drinking...the longest streak in 18 years. ..Struggle: My finances are a mess and I'm freaking out about how to get back to a good spot with my money after drinking away my savings and into 11K in credit card debt. ..General: Two days in a row at the gym today will be day 3. 
Triumph: today is 100 days not drinking! My mind feels clearer than ever!.Struggle: though (or maybe BECAUSE) my mind is clear I am struggling to complete tasks that need to get done but do not give me joy..General: my cat has a powerful dirt bike and an evel knievel  outfit. When my wife and I go to work she sets up death-defying stunts to entertain the neighborhood pets.
DAY 3 
**Triumph:** I finally got a sponsor and I've been meeting with her weekly. She told me that she thinks I'm ahead of the curve and that she has a lot of faith in me. It's very strange to feel so comfortable with just opening up about my drinking and my family and my trauma stuff to another person. I don't feel defensive or judged or...anything but relief. It feels like progress though and it feels good to have someone else listen to all of this and say "Hey you need to be gentle with yourself and hey I've done this before and I can see that you're on the right track." ..**Struggle:** My mother who I went no contact with in November is still trying to reach out to me. It has slowed down but hasn't stopped. Her [hoovering](http://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/hoover-maneuver-the-dirty-secret-of-emotional-abuse-0219154) stresses me out and makes me just want to completely shut down. ..**General:** I've been watching old episodes of ANTM on Amazon and idly researching old contestants to find out what their lives post-reality TV. Many of the finalists who got far end up in entertainment or entrepreneurship of some kind but then one apparently went to prison for twelve years???? For armed robbery???? And now she's tweeting from prison (????) things like "WAKE UP SHEEPLE." I'm fascinated by her story; in an interview she talked about how addiction played a role in her spiral out. Although she was a bit of a pill on the show (thanks to some clever editing too I'm sure) I never would have guessed that would be the trajectory of her future. Further evidence that addiction touches all kinds of people and sends them all kinds of destructive places. 
**Triumph:** Got through the first week..**Struggle:** Turning work mates down for our usual drink. I still want to go and bitch about work damnit..**General:** No pets and I'm pretty sure my houseplants don't get up to anything while I'm gone!
**Triumph:** I'm at the final stages of interviews and reference checks for my dream job. *fingers crossed so hard.* ..**Struggle:** everything is up in the air (job housing finances potential baby) and it's really hard to find solid ground at the moment. I hate this feeling. I need to accept the large temporary uncertainties and focus on the things that I can control. ..**General:** every morning my dog stares at himself in the mirror for a good five minutes. completely motionless. it's hilarious! I always wonder what goes through his mind. does he understand that he's looking at himself? does he think it's an alternate universe with another mom and dad and extra treats? is he secretly a brilliant physicist unlocking the mysteries of time and space? SQUIRREL!   
**Triumph:** Getting to a stage where I'm happier with my trombone playing than I have been for a while. It's good to feel less frustration when playing than I was.....**Struggle:** Work's been fairly intense lately some aches and pains are telling me there's a build up of stress. I think I need to get out on my bike more.....**General:** If I had a pet it would be running a 7 figure e-commerce company from home as soon as we left each day and then switch the laptop off before we return.
**Triumph:**  Went to my first therapist in a long time on Sunday.  Looking into amino acid therapy to help with moods and emotional resiliency.   I can only afford her once a month but just the thought that I have someone I can work with on my stuff is a source of calm and hope to me!..**Struggle:**  Trying not to freak out as GF who is declaring bankruptcy and has no emergency savings is now dealing with an ill pet and a vehicle needing work.  She's not asking for help so I'm trying to keep my damned mouth shut and just be supportive.  But get animals involved and my emotions work overtime!..**General:** My dog was so curious and friendly with other animals of different species that I imagine his secret life would involve him wagging and trying to get to know birds and bunnies in his back yard as well as watching planes fly overhead.  I've never seen a dog so interested in abstract things like planes and cars stopped at intersections!  He would stop in the middle of the road and peer into the cars! I'm convinced this was his first go-around as a dog and my first go-around as a human.
Triumph: Not many of those lately except that I am still sober. That's always a triumph no matter what else is going on. ..Struggle: All the things. Just kind of generally depressed. On a prescription medication for anxiety now which is helping though. My mom is terminally ill and despite that I've known about since last summer I think I'm out of the denial phase. Which is hard. Denial was easier. .Oh and my boss is a jerk haha!..Secret Life of my Pet: My dog thinks he's a hunter. Always chasing birds rabbits. I bet he would be good at it too!
Triumph: Day 10 and I am constantly surprised at how much more productive I am in the evenings. My life seems so much calmer and more manageable...Struggle: Tomorrow is a beautiful sunny day and I am going to change my tires at my dad's. Normally it would include a beer... setting myself up for success by planning to bring an iced coffee to celebrate ;)
**Triumph:** I decided to tell one of my jobs that I really can't work so much anymore.  I've got to prioritize studying for my architecture license exams.  I just got approved by the state to sit for exams.  Hell yes!  It's nice to be working toward that goal...**Struggle**:  I've been having a hard time with my living situation.  It's not that bad really so I feel like a brat for not being content.  I feel stuck though which always makes me want out regardless.  It's been hard to determine what to do so for now I'm just adopting the "no big changes for one year" rule...**General**: The secret life of my dog is not so secret.  The huge beast sneaks up on the dining table when I'm gone so he can get a better view out of the window.  He leaves paw prints and dog hair behind to show off his misbehavior.  I imagine he stands on his hind legs and table dances.
[removed]
Triumph: finished my enrollment at university and put in my application for recognition of previous study..Struggle: work is difficult at the moment with a co-worker trying to pull rank (when if anything I outrank him). Looking for healthy coping mechanisms ..General: my cat has been super needy and is currently trying to climb into my shirt 
Struggle:  I've been going over my Weight Watchers points more days since getting back on the wagon.  Keep telling myself 'one thing at a time' and that the alcohol thing is a much bigger danger to me right now than some extra weight.  Also the cravings have finally kicked back in.  It was a smooth month but now I have to fight the beast in my brain again and I usually can't win that fight for long...Triumph:  It's my Friday and I didn't buy alcohol.  Even on good weeks (not drinking EVERY night) I always drank on my Friday.  .The last time my badge had this many days on it I had been drinking and neglected to reset it.  I haven't had a legitimate 33 days of sobriety since 2001.  It feels good...General:  My pomapoo generally just sleeps the day away only interrupting that routine to bark when the mailman delivers.
