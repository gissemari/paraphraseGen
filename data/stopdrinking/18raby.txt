And didn't drink. It was a friends birthday party and she had it at a bar. I didn't want to go because of the ease of access. No one really knows I have been struggling with this. I went anyway and even sang karaoke. It showed that I could have a good time and not drink. I am really proud of myself.

Good on you bud.
great job I bet you felt GREAT this morning.
Awesome!  Glad you had a good time!..Remember there's nothing wrong with bailing if you did start to feel uncomfortable/a drink started to look good... your life is more important then anyone's opinion of you!
Great job you should be proud of yourself. 
Awesome job!
Good job but by keeping secrets you're just making it harder on yourself. Anyone who knows you well has probably noticed that drinking was a problem. At the very least they'll hopefully realize that things are starting to get better when you stay sober for a while. Being honest with others is the biggest step you can take to being honest with yourself. And if you're honest with yourself you stand a much better chance of avoiding falling into the trap of *"It wasn't that bad.... I can handle just one.... I've been sober for X amount of time I must not really have a problem..... Etc."* As soon as those thoughts take hold you might as well have a drink in your hand already. 
That's awesome.  I'm proud of you too.  It can be really tough especially early on.  But now you've seen you can do it.  The next time should be easier.
Well done!
You should still stay out of bars. They are a trigger.
