Hi /sd!..Nothing much going on for me just chilling out on a Friday night got some groceries puttering around the house preparing and planning for a fun and active weekend. It seems like there are a lot of new folks around this week so I wanted to pop in and say keep posting reading learning whatever it takes. ..Try to not throw in the towel after a relapse or a struggle. Sobriety is always available to all of us it's free and it's pretty much guaranteed to make our lives better. ..Hope everyone has a lovely Friday evening! Keep on keepin' on!..Oh and according to my phone I now have 1711964 seconds of sobriety. Rock on...Anybody have fun plans for the weekend? Depending on where you are looks like nice weather to get outside and blow the stink off. ..

Pretty chill weekend planned for me. I probably *should* be starting an assignment but I have three bags of walnuts from the tree in my backyard so I'm going to bake a cake instead. 
I've got a 60k bike ride planned for tomorrow.  Then a nice dinner with my wife.  I'll probably have a lazy day on Sunday before traveling next week for work.
Hmm what kinda app/counter do you use?
Finally spring has arrived here on the east slope of the Canadian Rockies. Raking up the yard and putting down a little lawn fertilizer then a family bike ride with the missus and our daughter. After the looooong winter we've had that really will be fun : )
Last weekend was the first weekend in years that I did not get drunk. This weekend is my second. So far quitting has been rather easy. I really don't want to drink.
My family is taking me to Iron Man 3.  Tony Stark is my hero for being a genius billionaire playboy.  Robert Downey Junior is my hero for getting his life back and turning his career around without drugs or alcohol.  Hope to be there too someday.
