Well it's not allowed to talk about dreams as it seems but I really struggle with it I am having those alcoholic dreams and I just wanted to ask if someone here overcome this nuisance. Hopefully this sort of discussion is allowed since I don't know where else I should ask. I don't want to start drinking again but those fucking dreams and why I have them after more than a year of sobriety I am scared......Please don't ban me for this.

I still have them occasionally...usually when an event is coming up where I would have in the past participated. While they are very real I enjoy waking up and realizing it was just a dream...pat on back!
Hi there!..AFAIK there is nothing stopping you from talking about the dreams - in fact from the FAQ there is a link to [other posts discussing drinking dreams](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=title%3Adreams&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) .....Maybe some of those threads might provide some useful insight as well as your discussion here in this post......Hope that the problem clears up in due course... I dream about all sorts of crazy shit from time to time but I know there is no need to act out that dream in real life.....I won't drink with you today! Congrats on your 402 days and keep up the good work.....Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
You are welcome to talk about your dreams. There is no rule against it. In fact if you look in the link in the FAQ in the sidebar you'll see all kinds of posts about dreams. Check them out -- maybe you'll see a post that gives you some of the answers you are seeking.
We can't talk about dreams?! Yeah right :) I'm drunk every single night... in my dreams that is. ..But then I also do all sorts of odd criminal or naughty things in dreams. The id gone wild I guess. I don't read too much into them in general!..Sometimes the odd one is prophetic or tells me something about the relationships in my life: they stand out in some way as being useful.
I love my drink drunk dreams. I'm sorry if yours bother you. It's like a treat for me. I don't feel guilty about it. I wake up feeling even more brave that strong for not doing it.In real life  
Why would talking about dreams be a banned topic?  I had a couple of beers in my dreams last night and felt extremely confused and remember thinking "why am I drinking I thought I quit?" Lo and behold....still 100% sober when I woke up. Have had some sort of alcohol related dream every night since I quit (9 days ago).
I still have dreams about drinking smoking pot doing cocaine and smoking cigarettes all of which I have quit (17 years since my last cigarette). Sometimes they freak me out but I always feel relieved when I wake up sober. What's weird is that I only do one per dream. Like I never smoke pot and drink in the same dream. Don't know why.
