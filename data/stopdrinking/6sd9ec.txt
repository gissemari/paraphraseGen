I've been unemployed getting by doing odd jobs. I have no money in the bank I'm ruining my marriage and haven't been able to look at my failure in the face. ..I have a lot of work to do to fix everything I've broken. And I can't afford to have a clouded mind. I can't continue to wake up feeling sick and tired every day. ..After struggling for months I will not drink today.

Great job!  We're really glad you're here.  I won't drink with you today either!  ..&gt; And I can't afford to have a clouded mind...This was true of me too.  But honestly after my mind cleared up I found I like it better this way.  I don't even *want* to go back.  I think you're making a great choice and I won't drink with you today!

I'm proud of you! It takes a lot of courage to start to turn things around. You'll get there.

Welcome!  Don't worry about fixing what's broken you'll find if sobriety is your number one priority many of those things will fix themselves.  I won't drink with you today!
Be safe. It sounds like you might need some professional detox.
