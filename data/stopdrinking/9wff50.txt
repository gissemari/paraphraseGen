I've been away for a while continuing to battle with myself... drinking progressively more and more. ..Today I'm putting a stop to it. I no longer want to feel this continual internal struggle and self loathing every time I go too far (all the time). ..So I want to remember Monday November 12th as the day I said ENOUGH! ..I wrote down on a post-it  Every single one of the goals / aspirations I have for myself will be enriched by my abstinence from alcohol. None of my goals / aspirations will be harmed through abstinence from alcohol ..It's a stupid and really obvious statement but it shows me just how fogged things get when I'm drinking. The fact I have to write something out that should be so darn obvious. ..Anyhow today I'm saying no to continuing the internal struggle self harm and all the negative things that come with my drinking... I know I deserve happiness + peace and sobriety is a key to it. ..I'm really grateful for everyone here #IWNDWYT
