Hit 8 months today! Celebrating with coffee records and a book. It hasn't always been easy but it is worth it. This is the longest I've been sober since I was a teenager (31 now) and I feel proud of myself. I've saved some money lost a few pounds I look and feel better. I still deal with anxiety and depression but I'm finding better ways to manage it. My life is calm now and it feels good. Even on those hard days knowing I didn't drink means the day wasn't a complete waste. Don't give up if you're struggling it will get better I will not drink with you today!
