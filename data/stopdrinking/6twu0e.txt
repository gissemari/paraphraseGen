I just wanted to post to kind of celebrate how little alcohol is an issue in my life anymore. Last weekend I went to a wedding and it never even occurred to me to be nervous about alcohol at the wedding because I simply don't drink. And then this week I'm traveling to a convention for work and once upon a time both the travel and the conventions would be drinking opportunities/triggers but again it's now a complete non-issue. ..Over the last few years I've been progressing toward and working to support permanent sobriety. My usually brief relapses even the most recent one which was 8 days long have I think all helped get me to my sobriety now which I'm fairly confident is completely permanent. ..I know I have to work to maintain it and that's cool with me I'm prepared to do that. I just wanted to sort of bask in how great it is that I don't have to wrestle with things like wedding and travel anymore. That's all!

It's about acceptance and surrender.  It does not have to be a struggle and it sounds like you have figured that out for yourself.  Great job!
That is wonderful news friend. It's such a great feeling when it becomes an afterthought as opposed to the all consuming thoughts it was before.
You're my hero today and I can't wait until I can post something similar.  Not drinking with you today 
I have found that sobriety is **so much easier** once drinking just wasn't an option any longer. I don't care who what where or when... I'm not drinking so I don't have to worry about it! **FREEDOM!** ..I'm so glad you're enjoying your freedom. I will not drink with you! .
