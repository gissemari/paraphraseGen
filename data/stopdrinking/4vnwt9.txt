Here I am. It is 4am on the 2nd day of August 2016 and I am scaring myself again. I'm trying to blame various things   a lot of change coming university starting even being over-emotional because I'm on my period. But the truth is I have been allowing myself to drink. I quit last year for a good five-month stretch after being in rehab. But then I got comfortable. I started to allow myself to have a couple of drinks when I would go out with friends. Then it was wine with dinner several nights a week. Then I let myself get drunk once a week..Now I have found myself drinking every three days. It's still not every day but I have no doubt that I will get there if I keep going down this path..Alcohol and other drugs have been responsible for (or at least linked to) almost every bad thing that has happened in my life. Every struggle and every time I have fallen off track it has been because of my addictions. .I know what I need to do before I lose everything I hold dear. This has been the last time. ..Alcohol has no place in my life. It's like an abusive lover I've held on to for far too long. And it is time to break up..
