I just saw my flair which said 60 days sober! I check into this sub more than 5 times a day reading all the positive posts but also the relapse posts or going through a bad night posts. This community is very supportive thankyou all for being here. So in another 30 days my cravings for alcohol have disappeared like a magic trick 30 days ago I still remember I had anxiety and a bad craving which I had to fight with heavy artillery.My cravings hit me mostly on (Friday nights) over a 12 year period.. which were always my night out in town at a club or pub drinking as much as I could get my hands on and still drinking Monday morning feeling very ill. Now they are gone I'm happy to stay home watch a movie have a can of soda with some takeaway food. My favourite places to go when a craving hits is... The duck pond 10 minutes drive frommy home..in..(Queensland Australia) it has a walking track around the pond roughly 500 metres in length and around 30 kinds of bird life I see kookaburras' and owls cockatoos black and white very often some water lizards its a very peaceful spot fresh air and other fellow walkers or family's having a barbecue. Or I  go down to the harbour and wet a line or quickly jump on here to read a good post. Thanks again for being here. I will post again at 90 days if you are struggling just keep going dont take the first sip. Its harder to get sober again than to stay sober! I will not drink with you today.
