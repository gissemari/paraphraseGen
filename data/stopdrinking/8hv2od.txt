Hello all..A little background info about me. Im 29. I've been drinking since I was 13. Drinking heavily since I was about 17. Became a day drinker (couldn't get out of bed until I had my first drink drink a few before work on break at lunch and hit the store on the way home everyday.)..About 3 years ago after a bottle of vodka and a very rare blackout I woke up with a serious hangover. Nothing like I had ever felt before. Had no alcohol and no means of getting any. I panicked. I thought I my heart was going to pound threw my chest. I thought I was having a heart attack. I got my neighbor to take me to the E.R. Got there and was told I was having a panic attack and they gave me Ativan. Felt better in minutes. The doctor gave me a script and sent me on my way saying I should see a psychiatrist...Fast forward to about a year ago I'm on 3 mg of Klonopin a day. Still drinking everyday. At this point I snapped out of it and realized I have a serious problem. Couldn't hold a job friends became distant no love life. All I wanted to do was go to bars or if low on cash lay up in my room and drink cheap beer/alcohol. So I decided to quit. I read online that benzos are used for alcohol withdrawal. Perfect! ..So I go a couple weeks without a drink bored out of my skull coping with sober life. I started to take more Klonopin than I was prescribed to keep my demons at bay at for the most part I didn't crave alcohol much. Wow what a wonder drug! Then I ran out about a week and a half before I could refill. Bam. Benzo withdrawal and now I feel like I'm dying. I need a drink and I need it now! Relapsed. The drink smoothed it over enough till I could get it filled. This has been my story on and off for a year or so now...I quit drinking for awhile relapse feel like I'm dying reach for the bottle of Klonopin etc. I read up on kindling lately and I believe that's what I'm going through. I would like to hear your guys and gals thoughts on my situation. I have enough Klonopin to last me to my next script. I stopped drinking again today. I'd like to quit for good and be off Klonopin for good in 6 months to a year (long taper process) I know the drink and pills are killing me but am I exasperating it with this kindling effect?..Thank you all!

We sound a lot alike. I researched the shit out of withdrawals and kindling. I've had a seizure before due to medication and was worried I'd be prone to one if I just quit. I went to a doc and they didn't give me anything to help. I really wanted Xanax or what you've got to help me. She wanted me to go to rehab. So I tapered. I'm actually glad she didn't give me anything cause I'd be taking it like candy. I am obsessed over reading things on the internet about what could happen if I just stop. So I had to stop reading on the internet. I took her second advice and tapered. I'm trying not to think about kindling and what could happen. Because if I don't stop now it could be MUCH worse later and guaranteed I'll have problems stopping if I continued at the rate I was.   At my worst it was a box of wine a night. Then to a six pack of beer. Now to nothing last night. I'm worried still but I've got to continue and not worry about what could happen.  
Yes the kindling effect is real. Alcohol and benzos are the only two drugs that can kill you with withdrawal. Combining the two is asking for serious trouble. You need to go to a doctor who specializes in addiction and be honest.
