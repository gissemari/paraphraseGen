I used to LOVE music. Especially while drinking of course.  But now it feels like all the old songs I used to love come attached to some horrible cringey memory of me being a drunken idiot (like forcing people to listen to something they hate while wailing along to the lyrics or listening to it while drinking and texting exes embarrassing sappy things stuff like that). It's basically ruined them for me. I keep trying to find new stuff but nothing seems to click anymore. Anyone else struggle like this?  It really sucks. :-/

Some songs do that too me. But I went wayyyyyyyyyy back. like 2004 back and 90s and found some that still got me hyped without the attached memories of my idiocy lol
Yep. Rock music that I loved (while drinking) is a trigger now while staying sober. SD has an excellent song list pertaining to recovery and I've found these tracks are easing me back into loving music..https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/music
I've been trying all sorts of new music types that I've never been interested in before. It's been a needed and nice change of pace.
I didn't listen to any music or even my car radio early in sobriety.  I think I needed to avoid the stimulation.  Now I am rediscovering music and some of my preferences have changed.  I never liked Jimi or Janis and now I love them.  Still can't stand The Doors.
I really love listening to music. Maybe try some different music or get some fancy headphones (B&amp;W or AKG) or some old british speakers. I love to just sit and let the music take me away it's the most amazing relaxing feeling listening to all the different instruments...0 days.
