been a drinker over 4 years haven't had a drink in 3 days. I often feel hopeless i began drinking over rejection and feeling like a failure and being homeless i feel completely alone. im completely out of control ive gone through hell my whole life no1 one understands me and feel completely helpless. i have no relative or friends that care to help anymore everyone gave up on me. the pain is unreal. im mentally unbalanced and have more memories of being traumatized than i can handle i have to reach out anonymous strangers on the internet but this has long been recognized as being serious i feel completely lost. help!

First off welcome to r/stopdrinking. This is the friendliest place on the internet and it's full of people who once felt as helpless as you do now...Being sober for three days is huge. You should feel proud of that. You should also know that no matter how difficult your life is alcohol never actually fixes anything and usually just makes it worse...Have you reached out to any AA groups in your area? That might be a big help for you as you  start out in your sobriety.
Welcome /u/Dashashound to r/stopdrinking.  I found my way [using the instructions at this link to a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be useful to you.
Well done on being sober for 3 days - same here!..
Welcome! I have a lot of trauma in my past. I have sought intensive professional help and it has greatly helped me. Without it I would not be sober today. 
It sounds like you need professional help if you are homeless and suffering so greatly from mental torment. You don't have to suffer alone check out services in your area that help with addiction housing and general mental health. It will be so much more difficult to change anything without some stability in your life to stand on. You are NOT alone many people dedicate their lives to helping people like yourself please seek them out. Also this community will be here for you no matter what. Best wishes and good luck on your journey!!
3 days is a really tough place to be. The good news is is you never have to do day 3 again. It gets better. You can do this.
