I'm fighting a craving tonight. And the dummy in my brain says   hey everyone says it took them a few try's before it to really stuck  so use one of those relapse   .I just made myself a Pom fizzy water and am hoping I was just thirsty and this will pass. .Snuck up on me this one. I've had a good day nothing bad is happening. In fact we're going to a concert in an hour.

From my experience a drink would not be worth the disappointment you'll experience in the morning. 
You're doing great. Drinking Pom getting ready for a concert and coming here to chat. The craving will pass. Enjoy the show!
You made the right call. Well done. Our inner sneaky bastard can try to be a...sneaky bastard :)
I know that feeling so well! I did cash in a week ago after two months of sobriety and it wasn't worth it at all. But I felt the same inclination that other people had badge resets all the time etc. But it's at those points I start reeling it in to "one day one hour at a time" because the idea of never drinking again is still really hard to grapple with for me. But that's tomorrow's problem. Today is the day I won't drink. Maybe tomorrow? ..Awesome job beating it. I will not drink with you tonight! 
I'm having the same issue! A glass of wine sounds so yummy but nope! Not doing it!
Sometimes it can be tricked by buying like alcohol free beer. 
Not everyone is able to come back from a relapse. Some people stay drunk and lose everything even though they want to stop drinking. If it were that easy to come back from a slip no one would be an alcoholic. ..Sorry if I come across as negative but if you can just stick to the fizzy water. It's easier in the long run.
