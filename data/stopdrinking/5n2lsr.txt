I am 40. Married to a beautiful wife and I have an amazing 2 year old daughter. I'm not sure where to start. Full disclosure....I have had at least one drink everyday for the past 20 years. I'm not sure I would call my drinking a problem. I don't have job health or marital issues. My life friends family and habits all surround drinking. I am at a point in my life that I am done with drinking. Here is the rub. I am a strong willed person and always told myself the day would come and I would quit. Problem is I am struggling with it. Which leads me to believe I have an issue. I have a stressful job crazy schedule etc. I used to be a college athlete and very fit. I have never reached out to anyone. I want change and I just don't have the answer. I don't get drunk daily but I definitely drink daily. I want to be better. Is there a way to quit and enjoy a drink here and there? Any words or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks

Your situation is almost similar to mine! I've been drinking for close to 10 years now. Quit for about 3 years and then started again. I can quit for several days or even a month but then I go for the occasional drink and slip up. I'm not a heavy drinker at all I like the buzz it gives so I don't do more than 2 to 3 drinks at a time and I usually drink about 4 to 5 days a week. I've found that the best way to quit is to stay busy at times when cravings hit me the most especially in the evenings. I've been quit for about 10 days now since the year began with a small slip up on the 3rd day but that's it. If I were you I would stay busy with exercise work or whatever to distract you keeping your guard up for triggers to drink. In the past I've relapsed especially when I talk to or meet with my drinking buddies saying it's ok to have a drink or two and I'm back to square one with cravings and anxiety hitting me again everyday. It certainly gets better after a while and I've found that if I take a drink after quitting for 30 days alcohol tastes like crap so it proves that one can develop a detest for the taste of alcohol and it's mostly an acquired taste as you continue to drink!
