I haven't had a blackout or a hangover since early February.  it's amazing how much easier that makes things in the morning...After a blurry two-month relapse this winter I'm proud to say that I've spent most of 2018 so far dry - sixty days straight for a long Lent then three separate weeks in between (regretted) one-day lapses.  I feel bad for bothering the mods so much - I've started my count over every weekend for the last three weeks and for what?  A drink or two that wasn't nearly enough to be worth it.  i guess I'm technically "moderating" but I don't like it.  Would rather not have the teaser at all...Quitting caffeine has really really helped with my anxiety - the main reason I was drinking every day - and I credit that with not letting one drink turn into 8 on any of these weekends...My digestion's better sleep is better focus is better.  I'm happy and getting closer to the "it's okay to never be drunk again" mental step.  Anyway I just wanted to thank y'all for being here.  I hope everyone's doing okay this evening...I will not drink with you today.

Moderation was such a pain. A.Couple drinks just isn't worth it. Glad you are here. 
Great work! Moderation was agony for me. I recently cut down on my caffeine intake (not that it was a lot; I went down to one cup per day from two) but it's definitely further reduced my anxiety and I'm sleeping a bit better.
