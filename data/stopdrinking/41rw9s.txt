[Original post one week ago.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/40mhip/ashamed_putting_the_pieces_of_last_night_together/)..I'm no stranger to /r/stopdrinking...I've been here for 3 years I've been wet I've been dry.  I've never really tried to quit "for good".  I'm not sure I'm quitting "for good" right now to be honest.  I do know however that I wouldn't have quit the last 7 days if it wasn't for the people reaching out to me in this sub when I needed help...So to you I say thank you.  It hasn't been nearly the struggle this week that I thought it would be or that it has been in the past.  I went back through my old posts and old comments in SD and I've realized that every single time I've been sober and went back to drinking it was related to stress.  ..That was what brought me back but that wasn't what kept me drinking.  THAT is my problem.. .Things in my life have changed over the last months and my stress levels have been reduced greatly...So it's been seven days.  I think about drinking every night and every night I stop and focus on why.   Every night for seven days it has been simply because I am bored.  Sitting here playing Diablo 3 is more fun when I have a beer or three or six.  Watching a movie is always better with a pint of bourbon or a rum and coke or a vodka-cranberry...At first... sure.  But if I could stop at that point I probably wouldn't be here.  ..Fact is I have no good reason to drink right now if there is such a thing.  Whether or not I'll have a good reason to drink tomorrow night remains yet to be seen but tomorrow morning I'll wake up guilt free for the seventh morning in a row...My sincerest thanks to you /r/stopdrinking.
