I caved to the notion that my social life is over without alcohol...I spent two days drunk and woke yesterday morning with a bit of a sore throat which I assumed to be the result of the 40+ cigarettes I can get through per night while drinking (I'm horrified even to type that but holding self accountable and whatnot)..I spent this morning hooked up to a saline drip in the emergency department because I've tonsillitis so painful that I can't swallow a thing. Laying there on the bed I promised myself that I'll not put myself in hospital again. Some social life to be losing at the tender age of 22...I'm home with a course of penicillin and my tail between my legs. .

So.....what is the plan going forward? Sounds like if you continue as is your social life will be limited to people wearing scrubs on a 12 hour shift. That works well for me because I am a healthcare professional.
Hi there. I hope you are doing ok...What were your thoughts and emotions leading up to moment you drank? Can you walk me through what happened and maybe you can identify ways to prepare for them next time?
And you're back here posting aren't you? Focus on that. Welcome back. 
Things ain't workin' out the way you wanted them to?..Maybe it's time to admit complete and total defeat and not drink anymore?..Good luck. I went to AA and found a solution to all my problems but not drinking is very important for it to work.
