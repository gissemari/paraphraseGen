I'll never be over my addiction to alcohol because it lingers in the background and I still miss drinking sometimes but this is an important milestone for me nontheless. I want to thank this community for just being so awesome and for always being so encouragingly optimistic  I mainly lurk but when I have bad days this sub was a very helpful crutch that I would lean on and when I read other people's stories about their struggles and successes with quitting alcohol it reminded me that I wasn't alone and that what I was trying to do was indeed very possible. My partner deserves a lot of praise for always being so surportave too she put up with a lot of shit through the years when I was drinking and even though she will never read this I still want to say to her that I love her very much and thank you :)
