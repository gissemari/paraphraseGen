I bounce between weeks or months of sobriety and weeks of relapsing. During relapsing periods I fall behind of other things in life that I need or want to do. Guilt pushes me to try again and get my shit together but then there will always be the "Hmm. Now I got all my shit together but now I'm stressed as fuck. I know how I can ease this stress it won't hurt" or "You can't go to a bar with a date and not drink you will come off as an addict" or some other form of ridicilous but good enough rationalization and here we go again. Even gastritis doesn't seem to stop me. But fuck me I try again. Would be so much easier if there would be a way to make alcohol just "meh" and drop it like a student drops ramen noodles after they get a job.

Oh boy yeah for me it was sheer determination and one little tool provided here called "playing the tape forward". ..I made up some automated actions for myself such as if I wanted a drink at any point of the day  I went for a run that day. I hate running.  :) ..Hang in there there are tons of sober people to date btw!
