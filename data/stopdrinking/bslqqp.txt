It's okay to taper. Get out of the space you're in right now some change might help if you can muster the energy. Reach out to friends/family they're there whether you think they are or not.
Remember this moment will pass!

It's okay to take it slow. You're human. Treat yourself the way you would treat your younger child self. You'd be patient and gentle. You deserve kindness and sweetness.
It's totally okay to taper. Relapsing is far from the end of the world. It's normal. I don't have statistics on it but I bet more people relapse than don't on their way to sobriety...You're going to be okay.
I tried to taper but couldn't. It is difficult. A better option is seeing a doctor. I did and got medicine which made it safer and easier to stop drinking. I'd get medical help.
Hi I tried to taper after a pretty hard month long binge last week and ended up having a seizure on Monday. Spent the night in the hospital. I really recommend tapering tonight but seeking medical help tomorrow. I hope your night goes easier I know how much that feeling sucks
If you are feeling suicidal please go to the emergency room or call a family member/friend to me physically be with you right now. Probably emergency room if you are having withdrawals as well as these feelings of malaise.
You matter. What you do MATTERS. Treat someone well tomorrow. It matters.
