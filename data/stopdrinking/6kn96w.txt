One of my closest yet always drinking friends invited me over for beers and weed when she got home yesterday. She knows I've had mental health issues in the past but she has no idea of my struggles with substances by any means because I'm always very secretive with my extra drinking and only drinking in public with them when everyone else is drinking etc. yesterday I told her I'm trying to cut back on my drinking (easier than saying stoping forever just cause I can only take this stuff day by day) and she was super supportive. The next day another close but even more so a drinker invited us out to lunch for bottomless mimosas and my first friend cut in and said "hey i don't think Pazuzu-the-gargoyle is down for that and it's a little too early for me too." So now we are just going to bunch and the friend that wants to drink can order her drinks however she wants. It was nice to be able to be honest and just make sure I'm taking care of myself and have some of that extra support. ..I will not drink with you today.

Back in 2015 my first post here was about hiding my sobriety from my friends. We're in the same boat!..Now? Forget it I tell everybody. I love being the non-drinker love being the anomaly on late Saturday nights just out meeting people having fun with a clear head. I've had people confide in me that they really respect what I have done and it feels great. With experience comes confidence at least for me. Keep at it! 
That's great! You are an inspiration!  I haven't said anything aloud yet not even to my husband.  He knows of course but it's just the big huge uncomfortable elephant in the room.  Good for you for being honest and finding that support.  I will not drink with you today.
