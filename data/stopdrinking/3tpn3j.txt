I'm just finding AA is not for me. I want to be sober not just not drink. I want some sort of a program but I don't like AA. I'm scared if I don't have some sort of a program I'll relapse. I don't want to. Advice?

My advice: Look for alternate programs...they are out there...just fire up Google. Determine what you don't like about AA and find a program that doesn't have that...Or ask somebody at AA for alternate programs...their goal isn't to keep "members" it's to help people recover...they'll steer you in the right direction..
There's several support groups linked to in [this sub's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_real_life_support_groups)...I didn't follow a program when I got sober and I've been attending SMART recovery for a few months now. I'm appreciating the opportunity to talk things through face-to-face and working on tools...What are you looking for in a program? What parts do you like and not like so much in your current one?..I like to think of r/stopdrinking as a suport group in my pocket :)
Truly AA is NOT for everybody...On the other hand At 16 days sober I was not able to judge this.   Maybe I was too far in a hole.  I needed help that was free readily accessible and packed with people from all walks and experiences and who were ready to help me.  I needed fixing not AA.  So I took what I needed and left the rest.  I still do.
I think it depends on what you are looking for in a program...FOR ME I will admit stopping on my own wasn't working. However my life is hectic as all hell time wise so I don't have time for meetings. I've pretty much lost all faith in any higher power (not that I don't believe they exist I just don't believe they care about us as much as most religion makes them out to) so I don't want to turn to that for support. To me the thought of sitting in rooms day after day *talking about the things I am trying to not focus on and cut out of my life* seems to be counter productive. But all that is me...**What I do need** is a place I can go to anytime ask questions encourage others get advice get pats on the back when I am doing good slaps upside the head when I am making mistakes and stories about both success and failure so I am both encouraged and also aware of mistakes I might make. I wonder where I could find that.......Oh yeah! Right here! Thanks /r/stopdrinking !
