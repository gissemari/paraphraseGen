[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I got the stitches removed from my left hand and now my hand no longer looks like something out of a horror movie!..**Struggle:** I struggle with a  politeness reflex.  When someone is rude to me I am usually so startled that I am nice in response and then get annoyed at myself for being a milquetoast. I am trying hard to break this habit...**General:** I recently watched  Dear Mr. Watterson  a fascinating documentary about the man who drew  Calvin and Hobbes.  It has made me look at that comic strip in a whole new way...What is *your* favorite comic strip?
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: 8 weeks sober and l dont ever want to go back. No thoughts about suicide since l quit drinking much more stable mood l laugh more and generally just enjoy life. Hitting the gym 6 days a week It's the one thing l always look forward to every day...Struggle: This may sound kinda weak but l've got a colonoscopy coming up (hah) soon as theres blood in my shit and as l've had more than a few relatives pass away in cancer (stomach or around that area) l just gotta go through with this shit but the thought of someone fucking me in the ass with a robot scares the shit out of me...So l've been told they offer something to "calm you down properly" im guessing thats bensos. Would that be breaking my sobriety? It kind of feels like it and l really dont want to be reminded of how being numbed out feels as im just getting used to handling life completely sober. But man having something crawl around inside you im afraid l'll freak out or something. This may sound like im justifying trying to score a high but it really creeps me out :|
Triumph : today I'm 6 days sober and it feels great being able to achieve this with the support of people I love and SD. It gives me motivation to get thru the day knowing others are in the same scenario...Struggle: its hard to not have a drink when you work at a bar especially after a stressful day. I'm currently looking for a new job but I cant just up and quit gotta pay the bills. I know its best to leave for me. Been applying places so hopefully something will show up...General: currently watching family feud and even though Steve Harvey acts shocked by some of the answers it still cracks me up by some of the things people have to say. They should rename game show network to family feud network since its always on. 
**Triumph**: Got my shit together enough to put an offer to buy an amazing house!  In this past year I have stacked so much money from either not buying booze not buying expensive cakes while I drove home from bars and not buying stupid stuff online while I was blacked out...**Struggle**: Bid on this amazing house and didn't "win"...I got 2nd place.  The sting was real and legit and felt like I got shot in the diaphragm.  It's a weird feeling "Here take $500000!  Oh wait...you don't want it?  Ok."  Like my friends say it wasn't meant to be!..**General**: Garfield
Triumph: crawled out of bed and showered didn't drink.Struggle: the anxiety from my latest bender is literally physically hurting me this is torture so why do I keep repeating the same pattern over and over?.
**Triumph**: 86 on my bio test. Meh I'm not crazy about it I was hoping for an A but i'll take it. ..**Struggle**: I really really want to ask my coworker out. She saw me lose a lot of weight and she wore these glasses today that made her look really good. I didn't compliment her though because well I don't want to get dragged into HR or her think I am a creep when the compliment doesn't come out right. So now I just have to slam my head into the desk over the don't get mixed up in dating coworkers rule. I'm also trying to drop 11 more pounds and I am having to fight more and more to get them off. ..**General**: I'm going to go out on a very long run today I'm thinking 12 miles. I'm also going to get my racquet strung so I can start hitting more. I'm just going to spend the whole day outside wearing my new mid thigh shorts. skies out thighs out right? 
Triumph: Made it through a week..Struggle: Watching my SO polish off 1/2 a bottle of wine tonight and then open up another one. .General: I just finished reading "Dry: A Memoir". I feel a little numbed by it at the moment..My favorite comics are "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" and "Bloom County".
Triumph: made it to two weeks and have lost two pounds. Good things come in twos apparently...Struggle: I'm wrestling with my internet addiction. I'm not how y'all feel about the concept but I feel like my internet use has done me more harm than any other problem in my life. It's my refuge my excuse the first thing I resort to. All the things I think about doing get put aside to just sit at the computer or on my phone and waste hour after hour after hour. Every day I tell myself I'll get out and do something productive and I don't because it's my safe place. I don't know how to change that...General: Please let the rain stop soon. It's been weeks! I just want to walk around outside and be dry at the end of it.
Triumph: 7.5 weeks sober I finished school recently...Struggle: motivation for sport/gym (really need that) is null. While I don't want to drink I still contemplate some intoxicated moments but I shouldn't .....General: Sometimes I prefer the winter over the summer 
**Triumph**: Had an awesome time on a holiday I was dreading. Instead of drinking I went to hot springs ate so much good food played pinball laughed and just had fun. And no hangovers for me...**Struggle**: I need to start making money pronto! ..**General**: I have started training for a half marathon again. Pretty happy. 
Triumph: I've been running a lot and my times and distances are improving. I've entered a 10 km race (run for me) taking place in May - I never dreamed I could do it. My fitness has improved since quitting drink and cigarettes...Struggle: Intrusive thoughts about binging on wine. It's disappointing when they occur and I can feel quite desperate for the brief time that I struggle with them. They are very intense even though they pass after a few minutes. ..General: My general advice today would be to get your pets insured! I've had a real shocker over the last 6 weeks with vet bills (current total is  1500). 
**Triumph:** I got offered the position in the band I went for a few weeks ago. I'm now a member of one of the best 20 brass bands in the world.....**Struggle:** My right ear is playing up after swimming the other day. I think I've perforated the drum slightly. Whilst it doesn't hurt it is causing me to hear things a little differently...**General:** My favourite comic is Viz.
**Triumph:** recently saw The Beach Boys front row got to shake hands with Mike Love and Bruce Johnston (two of the three living originals) and scored a set list sheet. Very fun night!..**Struggle:** Not enough hours in a day not even close! I sort of pride myself in having a busy life in sobriety but this is ridiculous. It is important for me to avoid "redlining" because it only takes 5% more that I can comfortably handle to feel like it's 50% or 75% more than I can handle. Normally I just prioritize and delegate but it is harder when some many things are hot and many not so good to delegate...**General:** Looking forward to my H&amp;I (hosptials &amp; institutions) AA panel tomorrow which never fails to lift my spirits. It is some of the most rewarding work I do. No matter how busy I am with other things I always find time for my panel. I mean I always managed to find time to drink so I really have no excuse especially since it is so important to keep my sobriety #1.
Triumph: found the courage to cut bad influences/toxic "friends" out of my life. All problem drinkers..Struggle: didn't manage to get to my volunteering thing today because the anxiety from my most recent bender is just too much. But I DID call and rearrange even though I was bricking it ..General: going to get myself to the gym soon. Need the endorphins. My ex won't leave me alone. I'm just so over it. Kind of want to move away and start everything over. But it's a beautiful day!
Triumph: 55 days sober! I never thought I'd make it this far. Running is going really well and I'm excited to run a 5K in a few weeks. AA program is going really well- my sponsor says I'm doing really well and I'm doing everything that's suggested (even though it's hard sometimes)...Struggle: I'm procrastinating a lot at work / personal life and beating myself up for it even though I know it doesn't help. I gave up sugar for Lent and it's been horrible- I can't make it more then 3 days. Probably harder then giving up alcohol to be honest...General: Thanks /u/sfgirlmary for posting.
**Triuphm**: I'm making time for myself today and getting my hair cut. The Carol Brady look is not my jam...**Struggle**: Making *and* taking time for myself during this time of uncertainty and worry. Closely related -- trying to find a service dog (not emotional therapy dog) for my kid...**General**: Favorite comic strip xkcd; cliche I know 
**Triumph:** I'm tired and sore and it feels *good*! Two weeks into a training cycle and waiting for my body to adapt to the new demands...**Struggle:** Balance. I am falling out of yoga poses I can normally hold--see the tired and sore bit. There's also the life balance struggling to keep motivated and productive at work now a couple huge projects are at a breather...**General:** Calvin and Hobbes is *so* good. It's something that rewards me every time I revisit it. Right now the only comic I'm reading regularly is the renewed "Bloom County".
Triumph: I started decluttering my life over spring break. I was able to donate recycle or throw out around 20 bags of things I no longer need. I also started redecorating and have been interested in going for a brighter look. Guess I want it to match my life now haha...Struggle: Although cleaning was great. It distracted me from studying and working out. A kind of productive procrastination if you will. Oh well one thing at a time. And my grades are still good sooo.. meh. ...General: I couldn't find the ginger beer I really like so I tried La Croix and wtf is wrong with you people?? Is this some kind of prank? It makes me wanna die hahaha
**Triumph:** 77 days! 11 weeks!..**Struggle:** I'm really really struggling with a neighbor who struggles to maintain boundaries. Last night I ran into her while out and she asked if I could walk her home (she's vision-impaired). I quickly texted a friend to tell her what's up and asked her to call me so I could walk with the neighbor but not actually talk to her. It's a terribly rude thing to do to a regular person but if I give this person even an inch she takes a mile. A conversation can very quickly shift from exchanging pleasantries about the weather to her asking me for a favor that I don't want to do and have to say no. It's terrible...**General:** I borrowed season 2 of Fargo on DVD from my library and I've been really enjoying it!..My favorite comic strip used to be Garfield but as I get older I actually find it rather depressing!
Triumph: After a bad interaction over the weekend I recognized that spite is a very strong motivator for me. It can be a positive but in this situation it would have been very negative. I had to swallow my pride and get through it. My sobriety is far more important to me than proving someone wrong...Struggle: My hormones are out of wack lately it didn't help any in the situation I mentioned above. I've been kind of waiting to see if things balance out but I think I know I need to make an appointment and find out whats going on...General: I always liked Bloom County. When I was a kid I didn't really get it but I liked Opus the penguin and that crazy looking cat.
Triumph:  Life has been good lately didn't get tornado'd the other night so that's always a plus. ..Struggle:  I've been thinking about getting drunk for my bday in june.  I haven't decided yet and the only thing really keeping me back from it is that it wouldn't be the full year from when I stopped.  I don't know.  The more I think about it the more it seems like an excuse to get juiced.   luckily I've got some time to think about it.  ..General:  I'm working on combining all my short stories into one massive tale.  I'm on page 41 so far and it's going great. 
I just realized that I recently passed my 1-year mark.  That's pretty cool.  Overall being in my regular environment hasn't been overly hard; I find that if I consider it a switch that is OFF I am fine but if I slip into a "moderation" mindset I know I'll be f*ed.  I'm taking a trip to Ireland soon and am considering trying to moderate.  Damn lizard alcoholic brain still trying to convince it could work it could be ok.  Just a taste at the Guinness place or maybe a small dram in the pub...  I'm actually making myself sick to my stomach thinking and worrying about it.  It's my first big vacation since I quit my S.O. still drinks and enjoys it quite a bit.  Asking for support good vibes anything ya'll can send my way.  Thank you in advance.
Triumph - had a stressful day but slept like a baby - feel refreshed and ready to go! .Struggle: Working hard to lose the 8 pounds I gained this last month (yes some of it is muscle - but not all of it! .General: Feeling content -have less fear.  In the beginning I was scared of every dinner party get together holiday - each day I get stronger. I won't drink with you guys today! .
Triumph: I studied parse trees for two hours last night and also a friend quizzed me on them for my Automata Theory Class. I built grammars for a language and proved if a language was ambiguous or not. I finished my homework in the class early...Struggle: Knowing that the weekend is coming up. I keep thinking "oh man St. Patty's Day. That will be a tough one!" I'm still determined to prove to myself I can do this. This will be the first real weekend to test my might. Last weekend I started this journey and didn't drink simply because I was hungover. I keep thinking "Oh god Friday is getting closer!"..General: I am going on a run today! I'm training for a marathon to also help alleviate my depression from past relationships and drinking. I've lost 8 pounds! ..Cheers everyone! I will not be drinking with you today.
TRIUMPH:  ..My mental collapse didn't happen overnight.  I didn't just "out of the blue" crack in the middle of the toilet paper aisle in Target and start running around with a crazed Homer-esque "woo hoo!"  It was a slow but steady decline over several months digging my well deeper and darker refusing to ask for help.  Not really knowing how to say the magic three words:  "I NEED HELP."  I was a contributing writer to a local newspaper.  People got to watch me get more and more crazed each post getting more maniacal and more cryptic.  I was heavy into the booze a 750ml per day.  One night I kinda sorta maybe publicly declared the City of L.A. to go f*** themselves.  Then I disappeared...I thought for sure I'd been banned.  I was too enraged and depressed to care anymore anyways.  I spent the next four months consumed by my own selfish dramaramas.  I slowly started to miss writing reaching out to anyone who'd listen to this clown.  This past weekend during my meltdown on SD I busted out with a new article.  I emailed my (former?) Editor with a sincere apology admitting I had acted like a real bitch and feeling truly remorseful that I hurt her and so many people who'd been reading--  but whether she'd printed or not here's another story for her for the road.  She responded immediately.  I was mindblown.  She said she read a little of the infamous "go f yourself" story but then stopped assuming I probably had something really bad going on in my life at the time.  And she'd be happy to have me back...They'll be featuring this new one on the site and also putting it in the printed paper.  I'm welcome to write again about whatever I want.  I don't know what made me cry more--  getting another chance to have my voice heard or that this lady forgave me for some rather bad things I did.  I needed a second chance so badly I needed forgiveness and mercy more than anything.  I got them.  And I'm going to appreciate them and not blow it again.  I won't drink with you today....STRUGGLE: ..Still get sad about the exSO having put me out with the trash on New Year's Day.  I need to let go of the hurt and the rage....GENERAL:..Did you know that Hummingbirds consume so much energy that they have to eat a human's caloric equivalent of 1300 hamburgers each day?  That's what it would take if we wanted to be able to fly straight up/down sideways and even backwards like they do in the split-second of a whim.
Struggle: you know after posting on here for 121 days you'd think I could find the daily check in!.Triumph: I don't care cause I'll not drink with you today anywhere! Yay!
Triumph: my house is clean! It's not perfect I still have some clutter to put away but it's so nice to have a clean space. I am really enjoying my home. ..Struggle: I have another darn cold. I was supposed to have a friend over but I just canceled. I can't stop coughing and I feel like poop. So mad to bail on plans; this was the first time we were going to hang out just us. Oh well. ..General: I finished watching The Fall last night and I really enjoyed it. Not sure what's next. Also I too love Calvin and Hobbes. I read all the strips when I was in elementary school. It's the only comic I've really liked. 
Kinda getting hard to resist to this spring weather while you are in the country where beer is national drink. Hope I will go through it
**Triumph**: I got out of bed I managed to do some work related stuff I cleaned the appartment a bit. Today my goals aren't high. ..**Struggle**: Lately I suffer from all kinds of infuriating minor pains. It was already my stomach my back and head! Head is the worst. Right now it's neck. I think it can be psychosomatic but I can't grasp what is causing it! ..**General**: I'm going to socialize a bit today. Another event without me drinking. I remember last time we visited the place we're going today. I ordered dark beer which was way too strong for me as I don't weigh too much. I smoked then. How much a life can change in a year.
**Triumph:**  I am budgeting!  I am a budgeter!  Adulting!  Lord this has been a long time coming.  .**Struggle:** Wondering when I can trust my intuition and when it's an overly reactive response.  Will this ever end??.**General:**  I now want to watch that documentary!  That was such a poignant comic strip.  I have been sticking with my daily meditation and between that and the 5-HTP feel like there's a shift beginning in my follow through and mental acuity.  Huzzah!
Triumph: it's day 4. And it's amazing. I haven't had any physical cravings but some weird sleep. .Struggle: thoughts of the future. Pushing back the sadness of never having a drink again. Trying to stay focused on what really matters - today..General: I will not drink today. This is the right and only decision. My user name says it all. 25 is the amount of years I've been drinking. 
T:   Dealing with failure without drinking. ..S:  Got a D on my exam.  Ugh...  ..G:  I've been getting into graphic novels. (Nerd alert)
**Triumph:** 66 days! Also still going to the gym increasing weights and difficulty level on the treadmill. Up to 200 crunches now. Muscles are tighter now and visible. Also holy crap I'm amazed at how fast I fall asleep now...**Struggle** Still haven't lost weight...**General** When is it going to get warm already dangit.
Triumph: One day away from two weeks sober this is the longest time I've been sober in years so I'm pretty excited. ..Struggle: trying to not eat ice cream and sweets every night but it's so difficult. ..General: I've been reading a lot more finished Ancillary Justice Blackout and am currently reading the first book in the Dark Tower series How to Grow Up and Nexus. I forgot how nice it is to lose myself in a book (or three I guess). I used to be an avid reader but when I was drinking more often I found I didn't really have the attention span. ..My favorite comics are Hyperbole and a Half Perry Bible Fellowship and Hark A Vagrant 
Favorite comic strip: Technically a webcomic but I love [QC](http://questionablecontent.net/)...Glad you got the stitches taken out! Hopefully your hand isn't still in pain too? Hand and foot injuries are particularly terrible; every time I've had one I've realized just *how much* I actually use them. Painfully...**Triumph:** I went to an industry meet up and it went surprisingly well. I used to hate this sort of thing but I went felt like I met some good folks and made good connections realized I know a lot more about my industry than I give myself credit for and felt surprisingly comfortable. ..**Struggle:** Today is the ninth anniversary of my dad's death. He died from an alcoholism related illness (he was trying to quit drinking because I was coming to visit). It's the first one I've ever spent sober. I feel like a sad space cadet...**General:** I've been mixing up my typical recipe go-tos with [Mealime](http://www.mealime.com/) and it is *awesome*. I make the mistake of getting stuck in a rut re: what I'm cooking and then I get sick of eating and then I order in or eat junk. So this app is helping me mix it up. So good! .
**Triumph** I had two pretty serious meetings today the kind I would usually try and back out of and get uber anxious about. Not only did they go great but I owned those things and led both like a badass. ..**Struggle** Sugar. Damn sugar you are an evil swine. You lure me in with your chocolaty goodness then put me to sleep instantly. You are the praying mantis of the food industry. ..**General** Watched the big short the other night and loved it. Amazing that more people haven't seen it as it's so important to understand that stuff right now. Top of the iceberg stuff. Highly recommended. ..PS love this sub. Wishing everyone peace and chillness today. 
Triumph: I pushed myself through a 30min workout yesterday even though I wasn't really feeling it...Struggle: I'm on day 17 of quitting smoking and drinking and I just seem to have hit a wall. I do fine all day at work but when I get home I have addiction whispering in my ear "You're just going to fail again. Why are you putting yourself through this. You deserve a treat after all this. Have a smoke. Have a glass (bottle 2 bottles...) of wine". I just want it to shut up...General: Loving mountain living. I've really developed an appreciation for the beauty around me. I didn't realize how much I was missing by always looking at my feet when I walked. Look up! There's so much going on!
Triumph: tempted to drink the other night absolutely didn't. ..Struggle: I'm sick. I'm in bed. I feel guilty about it because I had to call in sick to work which I only used to do when I was hungover. Being in bed on a weekday makes me feel like I've taken a step back if that makes sense. 
Triumph: Managed the day sober...Struggle: Everything. 4h of sleep general restlesness agitation pain a fucking riot of a day at work questioning the value of everything due to being so strung out. Topped the day off with a very unsuccesful climbing session because overachievement and tiredness and so on...General: I feel like I am slowly starting to lose my grasp on sobriety as I'm not actively thinking about drinking that often and have had moderate cravings. My therapy isn't really giving me answers and I just feel generally frustrated about everything. I could really use a vacation..
*Triumph:* I paid off my remaining loan and now am officially debt free! f*ck yeah!  .*Struggle:* I'm officially debt free and want to celebrate with a beer! sigh..  .*General:* my diet has been shitty and i've been sleeping way too much but i'm doing something significant (to me) every day and it keeps things exciting. I didnt even plan on paying my loan off today but it felt like an empowering thing to do on international women's day since I didn't skip work. 
**Triumph:** I paid off my remaining loan and now am officially debt free! fck yeah!  .**Struggle:** I'm officially debt free and want to celebrate with a beer! sigh..  .**General:** my diet has been shitty and i've been sleeping way too much but i'm doing something significant (to me) every day and it keeps things exciting.

Triumph: built up the courage to call a place that specializes in IOP rehab and therapy for women. I have my intake visit on Monday. :) .Struggle: Getting my butt out the door to run everyday. It's hard sometimes but I'm always thankful I did afterwards..General: One week. Should feel happy but I've been here so many times before. I guess I just gotta keep on truckin!
**General:** Hello I'm new here I decided to stop drinking three days ago I want to see what it will do with me I'm not sure for how long I'll quit.  .**Struggles:** It's going to be hard I don't even know what I'll say to my friends on our next night drinking.  .
**Triumph**: 6 Days. I like myself today. ...**Struggle**: Meeting two people for networking "drink" after work. I've never said "thanks but no thanks" to alcohol in my life. Worrying about that moment. ...**General**: I heard a story on NPR about r/showerorange and it is AWESOME! I've found a fabulous distraction from drinking!!
**Triumph**: I told one of my old drinking friends that I have been sober for nearly six months rather than avoid seeing her when she's coming into town. She's been incredibly supportive. Everyone has. And it feels good that everyone knows now. I feel somehow more accountable this way...**Struggle**: I am nearly 3 weeks into a long distance relationship. My bf is living on another continent in a timezone that gives us a six hour time difference. I'm starting to deal with pretty rapid mood swings and feelings of abandonment that I need to work through. My feelings are just so intense especially compared to how they used to be when I was constantly numbed by alcohol...**General**: My first Spartan sprint race is in less than 2 weeks! I can't wait. 
Triumph: Day 3 of no drinking. I woke up early and felt great today. I was productive at work. Made a to do list of shit I plan to accomplish this week. ..Struggle: I had to go around to businesses for work and my social anxiety really kicked in. It sucked ass. ..General: I feel happy today. Monday and Tuesday were really hard because I was sad/hating myself for what I did when I got black out drunk on Sunday. But today I was happy and a little less foggy headed. It was nice. 
Triumph: officially a college sophomore by number of credits! Only took me 7 years lol (long gaps start and stop)...Struggle: I'm half asleep laying in bed but I'm trying to stay awake to finish this post! ..General: really making an effort to take care of myself as I could feel myself slipping into depression again. Gained 10 lbs (!!!) but I've gotten my eating under control the last few days and I'm back to exercising regularly. Even if I only have time to run 2 miles on my lunch break. AND it makes me feel so energized for the rest of the day!
