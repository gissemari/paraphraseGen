My SO and his friends got drunk while watching the England match on Saturday. While he was on his way home he mentioned that he'll be doing the same thing for the semi final on Wednesday (having a piss up with his friends I mean). I realised I'd been experiencing this nagging feeling about him drinking because this was the fourth time in a little over a week that he'd gotten really drunk. I told him I've been feeling slightly uncomfortable with the frequency that he's been drinking but I understand that it's the World Cup and all so it's not a big deal plus I don't expect him to change because of my personal recovery. I don't really know what I wanted to gain from that comment; maybe him reassuring me that after the World Cup it wouldn't be a regular occurrence? I'm not sure but his reaction absolutely blindsided me...He started to really tear into me. He wouldn't accept that my recovery is something personal to me because *he's* had to endure three years of it *he's* the one that had to run to A&amp;E from work because I decided to try to kill myself ***he's*** ***the one that's stayed with me when no normal person would.***..He said a lot of other things but those words in particular really upset me. Yes my SO has tolerated a lot from me (which has depressed me to no fucking end and is partly why I wanted to die) but he told me that once I left hospital it would be a new start. We've barely mentioned anything negative since I got out of hospital and we've been in such a good place the past 7 weeks. I don't think I'd ever been this happy in my life. ..Anyway my SO and I talked things out this morning and he basically told me he's so sorry he didn't mean what he said he doesn't know why he said it... It's painstakingly obvious he said it because he was drunk. I'm not sure if I believe that he didn't mean what he said but I have talked so much shit when drunk that I know it's entirely possible to express so much anger and resentment that you don't actually feel when sober. So I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now. ..I feel awful but I'm really proud of myself for not relapsing. God knows I was close.

I'm sorry you had to go through that - its hard enough to think before we speak/react and alcohol makes that impulse that much harder. I'm really proud of you for not relapsing too despite all of that. You've got this - IWNDWYT &lt;3
textbook example of drunk behaviour and the damage it causes. good for you for being able to keep going. it really validated your decision.
i think you got the right handle on this tbh. i also know from previous experience that at some point the scales tip and all that hurtful shit you didn't even mean suddenly gains a life of its own and overshadows everything else. ..the only thing i think is worth adding here is i hope not even the tiniest part of you believed that stuff you bolded. i heard somewhere that 'we like because but we love in spite of' and i think that is the truest shit i've ever set eyes on. ..when you love someone you love all of them for better for worse. you went through tough times and he was there and that is a beautiful thing - but that's love. that doesn't qualify him for a medal. may be worth saying when he's sober because squash it before it grows 3 heads and rears them again. ..you have been through tough times and you deserve to be cherished because of that not kicked for it. ..hope i am not overstepping but that just rang a bell for me - as i said personal experience. ..good on you for staying strong. fight on. proud not to be drinking with you todayxx
That must have been really hard. I'm proud of you for not drinking to deal with the emotions! I said a lot of angry things I didn't mean when I was drinking - your story is a good example of why many of us quit. .I hope you are able to work through this together. 
A drunk person's words are often a sober person's thoughts. You guys might need to have a couple more talks about these things he's feeling. 
This sounds really tough sorry it is hard. Hope that whatever happens on Wednesday goes easily for you. 
Well done for not hitting the sauce again. That's got to be the most important thing...When I was still drinking every now and again my wife would decide to 'have a talk with me' about my alcohol consumption while I was smashed. My standard response would be 'do you really think it's wise to have this conversation while I'm drunk?' but there were a couple of actual full on arguments too - which was rare for us. ..Personally I wouldn't dwell on it. Booze is messy that's just how it is.
I feel you're holding up a mirror &amp; he doesn't like what he is seeing so blames you instead. Stay strong he only said those things because he knows that getting drunk so often is bad all-round. Proud of you for not relapsing x
