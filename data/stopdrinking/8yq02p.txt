Hello /r/stopdrinking! The last time I posted here I was not in a good place...24 years old and 30+ days sober! NOT having the hangovers and every negative that comes with drinking is fantastic and makes you wonder why I drank. Still dealing with anxiety and panic attacks at times it is a paradox. Having a panic disorder that has resulted in constant hospital visits since I was 18 is a struggle I get to deal with as well as addiction. Although I believe every addict has a mental health problem that resulted in their drinking to begin with. When your amygdala overrides the logical thinking looking for a simple solution is there. I associate a lot of good memories with using partying and a lot of "Fun" while drinking. So sitting in on a Friday night without going out and partying still seems weird right now. The social anxiety is always intense. Having used a substance as a social lubricant so long and trying to do those things sober I still get those thoughts. I am VERY serious about this though. The intimidation of this being young is there although it makes me try harder. That and the fear of relapse after the "Honeymoon phase." Thank you all! Have a safe and sober Friday! The opposite of addiction is not sobriety; the opposite of addiction is connection.

The opposite of addiction is connection. You're so right. I have an emotionally tense weekend ahead of me and it's difficult right now. Hit up two AA meetings called my sponsor poured out everything. .Congratulations on 30! I will not drink with you today.
