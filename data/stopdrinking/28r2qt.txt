I had 28 days before yesterday and somehow I let my guard down. I feel awful about it but it really woke me up. I had been staying sober but I hadn't really done anything else in terms of recovery...I'm going to my first AA meeting in less than 30 minutes. I'm nervous and excited and can barley form sentences but I'm ready to actually work on my sobriety...<3..EDIT: I'm back and feeling really good about my decision. I think I'm gonna try a few different groups and see which one fits me the best but I'm definitely going to a meeting again tomorrow. I would have never considered AA if it wasn't for this sub so thank you all so so much.

Good for you /u/suchgoodpups -- please let us know how the meeting goes. 
You can be proud of yourself for this attitude. There is more to recovery than just not drinking. Let us know if you got any comfort and encouragement from the meeting. 
Please update us on how the meeting goes. I'm super curious about them. 
Don't forget that if you don't like this meeting try another. The speaker might be lame today so go tomorrow! ;)
You're probably at the meeting now! You fell you picked yourself back up dusted yourself off looked at what you were doing and are trying something new. Good on you for doing the right thing for yourself. Let us know how it went okay?
