Since I have been relapsing regularly after just a few days I finally decided to try something new. I"attended"my first online SMART meeting today. It was a brand new experience and I think I can definitely benefit from it. I also talked to my husband about me being serious about this and I need his support. I asked him to just keep the alcohol to himself and not let me know if he has any. He said he doesn't want to feel responsible if I relapse so he said he won't let me drink his stash. I would have to go out and buy it for myself if I ever decide to drink. Honestly I kind of panicked but maybe that is what I need. I just wish he didn't seem so annoyed when he said it. Like he's tired of my shit. Maybe I'm being paranoid.... But I have a new start and I'm going to focus on me now!

Hello. Your husband has a point. Maybe he is tired. We really don't know what our loved ones go through when we are abusing alcohol. It's not really fair to rely on them for support. That's why I found it by having a therapist and going to AA. Putting a significant other in a parenting role doesn't benefit the relationship. He doesn't want to have to be in that role. I hope you'll find other support. I didn't know how to build a sober happy life without lots of help.
