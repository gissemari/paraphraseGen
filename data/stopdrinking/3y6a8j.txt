[Is this YOU?](http://i.imgur.com/MUH30jz.jpg)..Has anyone else been visited by the [Christmas Grinch](http://i.imgur.com/WdbuON2.png) at all? Any anger anxiety irritability sadness? Post here to vent if you need. Even better: if you've managed to sleigh (boom boom) the Christmas grinch please share what worked for you!..I've been visited by the Christmas grinch. To borrow /u/embryonic_journey 's struggle/strategy format:..**My Christmas Grinch Struggle**: I woke up this morning a little tired from a late night and I can recognise the tell-tale signs of anxiety have been creeping in too. There is no good reason really I've de-stressed my Christmas pretty well already. My husband has a dose of the man-flu and we've been a bit snappy. We won't be doing our planned Christmas walk which is a shame because when I'm in a mood like this a walk or cycle will reliably turn me right around...**My Christmas Grinch Sleighing Strategy**: We have cooked and eaten breakfast and just that simple thing has helped. I have put on christmas music. I am wearing reindeer antlers. I am running a bath and will go and write down my Christmas gratitude list. I'm going to take it easy today and seek inner peace I will turn this frown upside down the [Grinch will NOT steal my Christmas!](http://i.imgur.com/O1YByNN.jpg). Most importantly NO MATTER WHAT I will not drink today even if the grinch sticks around I made that commitment already on today's [check-in](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3y5y5m/checkin_friday_december_25th_christmas_day_2015/)...Wishing you all a grinch-free Christmas my fellow sobernauts!

What a great post thank you for this!
As long as the Grinch don't get me pissed iam sound well done on 477 days.
Just remember that the Grinch's heart grew three sizes that day!  Sounds to me like you'll have a terrific day.  Merry merry Christmas!
Awe merry sober grinch-free Christmas!
You are a beacon of self care! The Grinch hasn't struck yet but the day is young. I will be sure to check in!
I woke up anxious also. I had to call work to make sure I didn't make a mistake yesterday.(It was an ICU medication. It would have bothered me.)..I'm ignoring my mother's text until they are safely at church. I'm not letting them guilt me into going with them so I can be subjected to 2 more hours of their hypocrisy. I'm also not going to lie about going last night. I try not to give them reason to worry about the immortal soul that I'm not sure I have but if they can't realize that one can be a good person without following the letter of their laws then that's on them...I'm going on a long run to make the most of this warmth pre-medicate myself for the stress of the afternoon and hopefully burn off some of the excessive amount of pie I ate this week...I'm not going to vent to my sister. I'm going to do my best to support her dream of having a warm family Christmas. Most of all I'm not going to stop at the liquor store on the way home. In 10 hours this will all be over and I will be back here with my cat and my sparkling water...Well I feel better already. I guess if you can't make it a great day remember it's just another day. I can totally handle that. ..Once more unto the breach dear friends once more ;)
a lot of sadness this morning my life is great i have no reason to be sad but still having a hard time shaking that twisted nostalgia yearning and melancholy for my old life of drinking as if it was so great ... still feels like something is missing ... maybe the transition is taking longer for me than most people it does comfort me to hear "one year is nothing" ... because it feels like I still have a long way to go
I'm full of the Christmas Grinch! Trying very hard to get rid of it but so far no luck. 1. I'm sick which is making my head hurt and I'm out of cold meds 2. I don't get to see my family (which is my own fault really) and I have to spend it with inlaws 3. I don't get tamales. Ugh I just want this day to be over but I need to find someway to cheer up so I don't ruin the day for my husband. At least I have zero desire to drink so that's something.  Feels nice to rant thanks :) .I think I'll try starting doing small stuff as well maybe it'll very me out of my funk. 
I hope the bath helped. Keep those antler dry!..You may want to be careful [sleighing those grinches](http://themetapicture.com/grinchs-heart/).
I just kicked the grinch out of my apartment thanks to you!
