So I've been wanting to do this update for a bit but decided to get 40 days beat first... I have to say overall this hasn't been as bad as I thought it would be. I still crave a buzz every day but I've been able to make it through. My caffeine intake has increase substantially and I'll probably need to lay off of the sugar pretty soon. .. Not having suffered the withdrawals and terrible symptoms others talk about has been both a blessing and a bit of a curse. My drunk brain tries to convince me everyday that I probably didn't really have a problem. *I mean I didn't need medication or suffer from weeks of sleepless nights so was it really so bad? I would probably be okay if I had just one drink right?* The answer is resounding HELL F'n NO!!!! One drink probably wouldn't push me over the edge but I know myself well enough to know that I can **never** just have one drink. Oddly one of the things that worried me the most about quitting was the fear I could never drink again. Well I most likely can't and I'm okay with that. Granted it's still early in my sobriety but I'm hoping my attitude will not change in the future... I haven't been in a social situation where I would be tempted to drink but I think I would be fine. I have been invited out several times but declining was easy as I always preferred to drink at home anyway. I often do favors for people at work and have received three bottles of really nice wine as "thank yous". I gave those to my coworkers. I'm not sure how best to handle that as people have gotten in the habit of giving me booze. These are people I deal with in a professional environment so I don't want to tell them I quit drinking. It would be easier if it were someone new then I could just say I don't drink. Any recommendations on how to handle people who know you drank offering you booze would be appreciated.   .. Now to my favorite parts of being sober:.*The obvious- no more hangovers..*Remembering what I did last night. This didn't seem like a big deal until my husband and I started talking about what drinking was doing to out marriage. It makes me sad to think about all the nights that I just blacked out. So much of being in a long relationship is having shared memories. I can't remember anything but being drunk after 6pm for the last few years. That's a shame because the only time I get to spend with my spouse is in the evenings.. .*Waking in the morning regret free..*Knowing if I'm not feeling well it's not my own fault..*The money I save. OMG I can actually pay my bills on time now!!..*Being more alert and able to think clearly. .*Getting home sooner because I can take the interstate instead of the side roads that run by the ABC store...*No more shakes. I used to be afraid to take the stairs in the parking garage at work because my legs would shake so violently that I thought they would give out.... I could go on. It seems the list is endless. On the flip side I cannot think of a single good thing that came from my drinking. Sure there are many people out there who can have a good time while drinking. That's not me even when I drank there was no fun in it. BTW does a TV show (for adults) that doesn't have drinking in it even exist? I'm sure I only notice it now that I don't and thankfully seeing drinking doesn't make me want to but really no adult can get angry happy sad etc. without drinking???.... I came out to my sister this week which was a really nice conversation. Like everyone else she didn't know the extent of my problem. She drinks occasionally and maybe more than she should have in the past. Her question to me was "what do you do when you get really angry or stressed out?" In all honesty I haven't felt angry at all since I quit. There has to be a correlation... As far as being stressed yes I have wanted to drink but I want my life back even more... I do worry that I'm overly confident in my sobriety and maybe dealing with the "pink cloud". I really hope that's not the case and I'm just one of those people who really can do something once they make  up their minds to. My mom reminded me that when I was a toddler I told her I no longer wanted a pacifier and then calmly tossed it out the window. Apparently I never mentioned it again. Hopefully I still have some of that toddler determination :).. If you've made it through this wall of text thanks for reading. To all of you on SD I want to say a very heartfelt **THANK YOU**!! Whether we've commented together messaged  or you've simply shared your struggles you all have been my rock. I really don't think I could have made it this far without SD and all of you!.

This made me smile!    
How wonderful to hear from you again! Bravo for 41 days!
One day at a time. Always remember that. Even your worst day will eventually become yesterday...Keep up the good work!
I love the pacifier story! So relevant to you as an adult!!! Keep rocking it!
Is getting shakey legs when walking down stairs due to alcoholism? Is this common? That happened a lot to me I figured it was my poor diet caused by having a shitty appetite (due to alcohol in retrospect so kind of indirect in my mind). 
Nice post....I can relate to everything you've said. We are only a week apart :)
Woot!  Thanks for the update
