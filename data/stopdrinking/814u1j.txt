Curious about what your first time off the wagon after years of sobreity was like and what exactly you can identify that led to your relapse.

10 years dry then I convinced myself I could moderate.It took another 10 to face the reality that I am an alcoholic.Moderation for me is a wispy romantic notion that has no basis in reality.If I want a lifethe respect and love of my wifekids and grandkidsgood health and self respect then I can not drink.Pretty simple really.
Thank you for posting this - I have been asking myself the same thing. The notion terrifies me.
