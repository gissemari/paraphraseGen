Being sober has been fantastic. It's helped drastically with my depression/suicidal ideation anxiety and OCD. My fiance and I are closer than ever. I feel better. I don't have to struggle through debilitating hangovers and regret...But Jesus H Christ am I craving sugar. During IOP I learned that it's very common to crave sugar/junk food while in recovery... it's been terrible. I eat dessert every day sometimes twice a day. And I'm not talking about an oreo or two a day I'm talking a giant piece of cheesecake enormous Jimmy John's cookies large chocolate shakes... it's insane. Is anyone else struggling with sugar cravings? Has anyone defeated them? How did you do it? Advice would be greatly appreciated. I will not drink with you today.
