I am struggling right now. I had a falling out with my best friend of over 25 years 2 Christmases ago and I just received an email from her first communication since then. She is still fb friends with me and so I assume she's seen some of my posts and has gathered that I have quit drinking though I haven't spoken to her in a year and a half now. We started to drift apart a bit after she got pregnant and had her baby but also we have mostly lived 3000 miles away from each other this whole time since the drift started happening about 8-9 years ago. Her email basically said she had been doing some thinking and was "so glad I've decided to quit drinking as many of her issues stemmed from that." She continued on to say that she felt like I always came first in our friendship and that I was really self centered and never asked her how she was doing how the baby (now 9 year old girl) is doing tc. etc. My side of things is this: I tried to reach out to her many times over these later years and she NEVER called me back or texted me back hardly EVER. I gave the fuck UP. My experience was that she completely abandoned me as a friend when I had expressed that I felt we were drifting apart and that I didn't want to lose her as a friend something I could never have imagined happening between us as we had been SO close for so many years (btw-she partied and drank and did blow with me all the time too so she never was "the sober friend" or anything like that until she got pregnant I guess). To my mind maybe she just did want to lose *me*. I don't know...But I am trying so hard to just sit with this take it in and not overreact. I am making myself wait at least 2 days before responding so as to be sure I don't respond knee-jerk emotionally. I mean she did reach out and contact me after all this time. That must mean that she still cares right? Right now though I am bawling my eyes out (news of Luke Perry's death not helping and kind of sending me over the edge too--he was only 52 years old and I just turned 50 just gah) and just generally don't know what to do. I have some serious resentments and hurts from her too. At bottom? I feel like the real truth is I was never sufficiently 'gaga' enough and fawning over her baby. I'm not a kid person I don't know how to interact with them really and just generally am not that interested in children like so many women are. I don't know how else to put it even though I know that sounds harsh. Am I just supposed to acquiesce to her every issue and ignore how utterly abandoned I felt by HER just because I was drinking at the time? Do you see how I feel like there are other factors at play in this and that it wasn't just that I was some drunk asshole? I feel like this whole email lays all our problems at MY feet and I resent the hell out of that. ..Ok I just needed to write this out as I don't have that many people to talk to about it I guess. Thanks for listening. Any passing thoughts from my fellow sobers will be gladly accepted with gratitude. &lt;3

I'm so sorry you're going through this it sounds really painful. I've definitely gotten some very harsh words from people before (about my actions when I was drinking given to me after I was sober) but those were in the context of amends - I'd reached out to them to clear up my side of things. Once when I was still drinking I got a nasty email from a friend and it was very painful...In both cases I mostly tried to identify what was hurt pride - where were these people right and what could I learn from it? And the stuff I felt was really unfair or untrue I kind of let go. It took time but I just kind of chalked it up to like everyone has issues and this is theirs. ..I didn't stay close with the girl who wrote the nasty email (we just went in different directions in life; I did make amends to her later) but I'm closer than ever to some of the people who responded with harsh criticism to my amends...I don't know how you should respond if you should respond whether you should cut her off etc. But I can tell you every time I've responded to harshness with harshness I've regretted it. And sometimes it's VERY painful to hear the truth about ourselves but what we do with the information is up to us. We can let it make us bitter or we can grow from it. ..I'm not saying she's definitely RIGHT with what's she's saying btw. This was just my experience. I wish you the best - do something nice for yourself today!
Sorry to hear about your sadness...Friends are important especially ones that go way back.......&gt;I have some serious resentments and hurts from her too...Isn't that part of life?  Hard to be around people and not rub each other's soft parts......   because we know each other and where those soft parts are.......I can't afford any resentments...Resentment is the poison I drink hoping you die...I sit with the following thought and meditate on it:.."Forgiveness is when the past is as good as it will ever be"...Will she change the past?  Will you change the past?..Then I look at the "costs" of carrying the resentment:  It is an obstacle to having love and friendship.  As long as I'm "hurt" and think I'm "owed" some apology I'm holding out.  ..As soon as I forgive *even quietly and only to  myself* that's when I remove the darkness from my heart and open the gate to have love flow...If I love someone i don't have to own the same interests (e.g. 'children').  However I respect that *They* have some interests and out of love I give them some input on that which they care about.  ..I might consider taking the time as you are and then crafting a short email or letter along the lines of:  "I care for you and miss you.  You're important to me and I'm interested in what you care about.  I want to remove any obstacles to our closeness.  Please know that I love you."..But that's me.
