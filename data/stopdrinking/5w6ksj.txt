I'm here.  Here for you.  And you're here.  ..If you can't find someone to care about you please find it in your heart to give care to others.  There are so many people here who will appreciate a kind word a willing ear to listen someone to share their pain. ..Stay here a while please.
Oh no. I'm so sorry. I wish I could hug you. I wish you knew how loved you are. 
Hey there TLW - I've been in that place of which you speak. It has a name - depression or the big D as I like to call it.  I got away from it - but not without help.  I got a therapist I got the right meds (took a long while on that) and I slowed way the hell down on my expectations of myself and life in general.  I just want you to know that there is light (and life) on the other side of that horrific tunnel.  I want dare I say need for you to see and trust this.  Please reach out to anyone and everyone you can for help.  As always we in the SD community are here for you.
The world is full of nasty people but also full of wonderful people. Please keep searching for the wonderful people!! Stay safe!!
Sorry to hear that you sound like you were in a painful place. I'm glad to see you here today. ..Please also be aware of the subreddit r/suicidewatch which has people there who care and want to listen should you need.
