I'm 28 and still get carded for cigarettes. I know the feeling. 
I'm in my late 40s..I get carded for alcohol until I remove my baseball or winter cap and reveal my head of grey hair; the clerks invariably blush then.
I on the other hand have looked about 30 since I turned 18. I am not grateful for how easy it's always been to buy liquor without an ID. Also for looking 30 at 18.
I'm glad things worked out. What's your plan for next time? ..I won't drink with you today!
Yes and wine will turn that baby face haggard if you drink enough of it.  It also destroys your organs.  Have you read This Naked Mind?  You  can download for free i sidebar.  You can get a badge in sidebar too.  25 is SO YOUNG!  The world is your oyster.  I won't drink with you today.
