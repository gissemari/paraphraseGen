Original post is here:.https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3rj24b/wedding_this_weekend/..The wedding occurred over a week ago and I've been crazy busy since so I hadn't been able to get a chance to update...The wedding was a flurry of activity in fact I was so preoccupied and busy with the kids I didn't have a chance to want a drink. I stuck to a couple of diet cokes and ginger ales and it was easy to deflect any offers. The next morning I was happy to be able to get up and out without being hungover and had a clear head to drive home...That was a big test for me and not struggling through makes me confident that not only stopping drinking is the right thing for me but I also can do it...Thanks for all the support and also everyone who has been sharing their stories.
