Hi all. I'm back after a 10 month relapse following just one sober month. I'm reflecting on almost 40 years of daily drinking when I associated drinking with anything 'fun' when I would pounce on any excuse to celebrate or 'drown sorrows' and drink even more. I'm surprised my career went as well as it did...Though now 'amicably' divorced after 32 years I am in a great relationship with a new partner. I'm starting a new business venture and determined to rid myself of the shackles of alcoholism. As much as I can I hope to recover the damage all that booze has done. I need to retrain my brain to respond differently to all that life throws at us good and bad. The answer is not booze!..Thank you all who contribute here. What amazing altruistic souls you are. The optimism the encouragement and the truth spoken here give this man hope...Day 4: I will not drink with you today.

Welcome back I will proudly not drink with you today!
27 year daily drinker here. Wishing you luck. Got a plan? 
I am working on retraining my brain too. I drank for 30+ years so there are a lot of things I associate with drinking. I am working on replacements. If I feel stressed/anxious I workout or drink calming tea. If I'm depressed I workout read journal. It's been a struggle at times but I had a lot of years drinking... we can do this!
Glad you're here!  ..I too had to retrain my brain...I spoke to a counselor.  She recommended meetings.  I went and got support from people who understood.  Got tools resources and fellowship.  I've never been happier!
