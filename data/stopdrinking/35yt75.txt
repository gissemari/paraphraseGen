I just wanted to say I am really excited to be back on the path after wandering waaaayyyy off of it for 6 months. Throwing up for hours on Monday morning not even being able to take a sip of water and generally feeling sick and exhausted for 48 hours post-pounding a large bottle of wine Sunday night has really prevented me from thinking I can pass this off as "just something I shouldn't repeat." I've been feeling disappointed in myself disgusted with myself and generally miserable and it's time to change all of that. Last summer I went about 3 months sober. That was the longest period of time I've been sober in a long time. It was also a really good summer even though I struggled with the challenge of remaining sober. I want to get back to that amazing feeling of peace and simple enjoyment for life because currently I am right back to the same place I was this time last year before I quit. Thank you everyone for all of your current posts and future posts-I missed this community more then I realized!

3 months is my record as well :)  I'm starting over myself today- let's do it!
Wonderful! Welcome back. ..That feel is horrible. That was my morning. Let's never experience it again? :) ...Any thoughts on what happened at the end of those three months? Anything you learned you'll apply this time?
