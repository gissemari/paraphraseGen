Last year I used to drink everyday at work at home out with friends.  It really started hurting some of my relationships and I stopped.  Was sober for 148 days or so.  I've started again not drinking too often but when I do it's to fill an emotional void and I can never stop with just one.  I'm just wondering if there's someone around here able to act as a form of support system for me someone who I can msg or txt when I'm struggling and trying to find clarity and remember why I wanted to stop in the first place.  I'm fighting to not let this get out of hand again.  Thanks Reddit.

Welcome and kudos for your decision to be a non-drinking person...This subreddit is an excellent resource. You can post anytime and usually get an answer. One of the best places to find a sponsor is AA. I found it very helpful. You get advice support and guidance from experts.
Any reason you're not interested in a support group like AA or SMART Recovery?
You can get a lot of support here in the sub and on the chat but I humbly suggest that there aren't any online substitutes that will do for you what a good sponsor IRL can.  That's just an opinion though.  Take it for what it's worth as unsolicited advice.
