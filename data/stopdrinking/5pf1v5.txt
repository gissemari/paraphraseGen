I have nothing to be ashamed of because there are so many people with alcohol problems that we all know someone who's been through the wars...Since I'm a pretty outgoing happy dude I have been able to get away with a lot... I'm Australian but I live o/s so I'm allowed to be a bit of a party animal because I always get up for work; I work hard and I play(ed) hard and nobody's really had a problem with that... ..except that they have and it's so obvious to me and everyone else who knows how to observe things (i.e. everyone who's sober) when somebody's struggling with booze or drinking too much.  It amazes me how patient people are to allow others to fight their own battles and lose while not saying "Dude/ette you think this might be kind of messing your life up?"..Anyway I realised the path through resistance is acceptance.  This is I guess a bit like Step 1 (I haven't been to an AA meeting in 10 years but it's the only time I've had 100 days in the last 20 years at least)...I said no to a $250 bottle of whiskey last night and it was easy.  It's helpful that I broke one of my ribs last week in a blackout because that reminder just keeps giving but I thought about the taste (actually pretty awful give whiskey to someone who's never tried it before...) the sensation and the feeling of losing my week and then told my friend everything...Every person I've told has lit up at the news I'm quitting drinking given me a massive smile and a hug and told me their with me and that they'll help in any way.  How lucky am I?  I decided to accept it to stop hiding and all of my resistance to the changes I'm looking for is melting away in front of my eyes...I want to study Vipassana meditation kundalini yoga mindfulness... I want to merge with the universe without the use of external substances I want to conquer my cognitive dissonance and treat my body like the amazing machine it is treat it well...I haven't been super active here for the last week but I've checked in every morning and I read your war stories when I take breaks at work...Thanks for being here all you strangers sharing your advice facilitating group consciousness and community even for those who don't participate it's a beautiful thing...Day 7 I will not drink with any of you today!

First week down nice!  I finally began to make some serious progress when I finally accepted that drinking was the entire problem and I had to stop.   Speaking of whiskey - my husband likes a bit of scotch a few nights a week - and I can barely sit next to him on the couch as he drinks it the smell is so strong it burns my eyes.  *Hideous.*
