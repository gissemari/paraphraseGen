All I can say is THANKS to this site AA &amp; other support I have been given. My life is so much stronger now than I could ever imagine and getting better by the day. It was a monster at first but the fight was worth it. If you are in a struggle the answer is YES you can defeat it. Thanks again IWNDWYT

First off congrats! 500 days is nothing short of amazing can't imagine how great it must feel...As someone who is just getting started I was wanting to ask: is drinking still something you think about daily? I quit smoking 7 months ago and while it's something that pops into my head maybe 3 or 4 times a day I've largely forgotten that I was ever a smoker. Has quitting drinking been the same for you?
Wow! 500 days is so inspiring! Congratulations to you.
