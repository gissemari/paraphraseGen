I feel so much better lately but I still have a hard time falling asleep/ waking up. I've always struggled with bouts of insomnia. Once I'm asleep I'm good but I wake up so tired. I was hoping that being clean would leave a little bit of energy. I'm eating healthier working out 4 days a week and keeping myself busy with housework. Anyone else having issues with getting out of bed?

It takes a long time to normalize. The drained feeling can linger for months. I suggest getting a probiotic  multivitamin and Iron.( Check with your doc of course). Those helped me a lot over the summer. I had 100 days sober and blew it. 
Same exact thing is still happening to me. Falling asleep especially. Hope it gets better and here is to 21 more days for the both of us congrats man.
It's pretty normal to feel drained and tired and have messed up sleep patterns in early sobriety. I'm four months in and still get weirdly exhausted sometimes (might just be life lol) but mostly my sleep patterns and energy levels have evened outs. Stick with it! IWNDWYT!
I have found that taking vitamins- especslli vitamin b and high intensity cardo really helped me bump up my energy levels 
I tend towards insomnia myself.. right now I wake up way earlier than necessary and go to bed really early too it's mostly working except the few times something unavoidable comes up and gets me off the routine.      better than boozing though that's for sure
