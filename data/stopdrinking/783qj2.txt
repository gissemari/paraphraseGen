I don't know why but for some reason when I was just waking up I thought about what it would be like to slowly push a fork into my eyeball like how far would I get and how bad would it hurt etc... It was mostly curiosity. Then I thought about how damaging that would be so what if I just cut my arm and I cringed because some people really struggle with self harm. ..The fork part was so casual and removed from reality and the cutting made me realize this is the same pattern as that first drink leading to the next and so on...what a weird urge. All of it ultimately harmful.

There's a thing called intrusive thoughts. It's not uncommon...Congrats on 22!
Our mind can be a mysterious thing sometimes. Maybe focus on things that will make you feel good instead of being harmful..
