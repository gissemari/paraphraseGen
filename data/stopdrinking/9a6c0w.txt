The first weeks of sobriety was fairly easy for me this time but around the tree weeks mark (I'm now on day 45) I started to get serious cravings. The devil in my ear says things like "Just one night of drinking to get your mind of things" etc. But I know it's a bad idea it would not end well this time either. I feel like I'm drifting closer to relapse every day and today was a close one. But I will not drink at least not today.

I combat the whisper by talking to a sober support person!
Have you seen the Smartrecovery tools? http://www.smartne.org/tools.html They have worksheets to help you figure out a plan for when the inevitable urges come. 
[The Voice](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7tkztb/what_are_some_of_the_sneaky_arguments_the_voice/) is one of the most formidable forces against us in early recovery. Being mindfully aware of its arguments and lies is a great strategy to fight urges. It's a good practice to write down some of the things that devil tells you. Just remember: **relapse is not inevitable**. The future is not written. A lot of folks get stuck in the mindset that relapsing is an inevitable part recovery. Recovery is not like walking on a set of railroad tracks waiting for the train of relapse to eventually hit you. It is totally possible to step of the tracks and find a different path!
