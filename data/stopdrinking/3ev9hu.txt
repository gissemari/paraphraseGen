Hey ..I'll keep it short because I don't really have much to say that isn't in the title...Me and another guy at work were up for a promotion. Apparently it was a hard choice for them but they went with the other guy...I'm crushed. Absolutely crushed.  I wanted this really badly. I worked so hard for it. ..I left work after they told me. I guess I have a bit of a flair for the dramatic. I'm now at home cuddling with the dog eating junk food. ..I'm not going to drink over it. It won't help the situation. Relapsing would just make a shitty situation a tragedy. ..11 weeks today...*sigh*

You have a job! Some people don't even have that! You got this! 
I can't tell you how many times over the years I've seen all this work out for the best in ways never imagined if you don't drink.  Hang in there and look for opportunities.

Eleven sevens. That's something to celebrate isn't it?..I'm in a similar boat. Looks like the position that I could be promoted into won't be funded. Instead we're hiring a different skill set. I have to sit on the hiring panel and choose someone who will be junior to me but paid more... Dogs make everything better.
Congrats on 11 weeks buddy. You're doing great. I like the dramatic flair. That kinda made me chuckle. I'm sorry you didn't get the promotion this time but chin up find out what it was that tipped it in the other dude's favour and build on that. I'm sure your dog was pleased to get some extra love if nothing else came out of this.
