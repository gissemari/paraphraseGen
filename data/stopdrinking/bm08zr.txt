It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I went to see a nurse practitioner who looked at my chart and asked me  Has anyone ever told you that you're a pre-diabetic?  Needless to say I was appalled. I immediately thought  Oh for crying out loud. I already have multiple sclerosis and liver disease . . . and now I have *pre-diabetes? *..**Triumph:** I looked at the printout of the lab results saw that they were from around the time I quit drinking and asked her if I could take the tests again. I went to the lab had my blood drawn . . . and just got the results back. My numbers have gone back down to normal. Apparently because of my sobriety I no longer have pre-diabetes (which I never even knew I had)!..**General:** I'm sorry that all my recent WuW's have been about my health; I promise to talk about other more pleasant things on Wednesdays in the future.
----------immediate responses--------

&gt;**Struggle:** Procrastinating at work is killing me. And I'm struggling to find time to work out when all I want to do is sleep. My coffee intake has been high. 60+ oz a day of the good stuff. And my family is stressing me ouuuuuut..&gt;.&gt;**Triumph:** Worked through my first sober Derby weekend at my very busy bar!! I think last Derby I was sober-ish? In any case I was likely going through withdrawals. I saw lots of reminders this week on why I need to maintain my sobriety. I decided last night that my coffee intake was too much and started to taper off today. Here we go! As far as stressful family I'm happy with how I've been shifting my thought process to be more empathetic..&gt;.&gt;**General:** Health is important! We like having you here with us no matter what's going on!   I haven't been on reddit lately or as involved with AA as my work has ramped up considerably and all I want to do is sleep.
The body is only a vessel to carry the brain we must keep or temple clean. I like to think it goes much deeper than physcial cleanliness everyday i ask myself.."did i do the best spiritual cleaning today that I could"? ..Congrats on your results! The mind body and spirit can and do heal only through consistency self love and service to others. ..My triumph is small but i understand that Rest is just as important as training and allowing myself a day to enjoy hobbies is needed. Decided im going to the local library grabbing a book and learning something new after I wake up. .IWNDWYT.  
Struggle: work stress. I work in mental health and today we had a crisis situation that we had to respond to and I could still feel my body recovering from that adrenaline hours later. Tomorrow I have meetings with upper management about a couple recent client deaths which is a) depressing and b) makes me feel guilty or like I should've done more. Not fun. ..Triumph: my boss praised how I handled the crisis today. ..General: tomorrow makes 14 days without drinking and it feels like much longer. Today I wanted wine after work more than any other day so far but at the same time I wasn't tempted to drink. I wanted it but knew I wouldn't do it. So I'm feeling strong in that sense.
Struggle: Currently sitting in a hotel room at 11:30pm on a work trip with a 6:30am flight to catch in the morning with bad insomnia. Wish I could sleep. Having all the chamomile tea in the universe...Triumph: I'm sober in a hotel room on a work trip at 11:30pm at the end of sober day two after having to host a client dinner with 15 people where many people were drinking (but a surprising number were also not)...General: I changed jobs internally at my company about six months ago and I'm really still not sure I made the right choice. But looking forward to going on vacation with my husband and son in two weeks. I need a vacation badly.
Im so happy for you! :) its amazing how much alcohol has fucked us up. Dont feel sorry for only talking about your health share whats on your mind and if that is health for 10 years straight so be it. We do not mind at all were glad to help. ..Struggle: Realised I cant stay at my job and applied for university which starts at autumn. But I have no idea what to do now. I feel like Im fully drained and dont wanna risk feeling worse so I do not see keeping to work until university as an option. I also do not see getting another job as an option - I have not gotten back to fulltime yet Im still tired and unstable need to sometimes get ofr work just like that to go to AA oh and I can only work a few months nobody would hire me. So Im considering to try for staying at home on sickleave. Yey. Oh and I still have no idea what I want for life havent devekoped that since I was 12 because of fucking alcohol. Fuck you alcohol. Also realised Ive been depressed since I was like ten years old. Might have to consider medication in order to handle university... I have a meeting with my boss in an hour...Triump: I have not felt like drinking in this situation right now. I did hit a real low point when I first started thinking about maybe quitting my job and going to university. But now - no alcohol cravings! My therapist asked if it could be becauee this time Im makinh decisions and taking action. Could very well be it. Im proud of myself that Im handeling this. ..General: Thats about it..
Struggle: Generally wrapping my head around a permanent change.  *Insert whiny rationalization here*..Triumph: A new job opportunity has landed in my lap with a big advance and raise.  Blessings beyond what I could have thought possible 3 years ago.
Struggle: I've resigned from my teaching job because it brings me no joy at all anymore and I don't have the physical or mental capacity to stay sober and do this job. Only a few weeks left and I am finding it nearly impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel despite it being so close. Motivation for the job is beyond gone...Triumph: I am getting so much done around the house. I have never been prouder of my home or myself for staying productive instead of drinking!..General: I'm just so happy to have all of you here and to know that we are making it. And I'm looking so forward to summer!!!!!
Good morning Mary! That's great about the pre-diabetes. I'm surprised she brought it up being from so long ago. My dad goes back and forth from pre-diabetic to not like all the time so I know lifestyle can have a huge impact. He gets a blood draw w/the pre-diabetic result tries harder to stay off sugar for 6 months or so (he is like a little kid and loves to eat massive amounts of sweets) then gets a better draw the next time then slowly slides back. Over and over for the past 10 years now. ..**Struggle** I know I'm not really busy compared to most people but it feels like it. I felt like a marathoner running through finish line tape as I got into bed last night. I could use some down time here. ..**Triumph** All the yard work we did on Sunday looks great. Baby steps. Also proud of the pizza I made on Sunday. Making great homemade pizzas was a goal for 2019 for me and I'm getting there...**General** I'm sick of the cold weather. Looking at my journal from last year I'm seeing proof that I'm not crazy. This time last year I was writing about enjoying spring finally arriving with flowers starting to bud and whatnot. Wearing short sleeves. It's still in the 20s or 30s each morning and doesn't get super warm as the day goes on.
Struggle:  My brother's interment is Friday he took his own life after years of mental health problems which he medicated with alcohol.  I am very sad that I couldn't help him...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph:  I just received my final marks from university will graduate in June and made the dean's list. I am proud that I kept up with school given my home situation...&amp;#x200B;..General:  I feel this time is a major turning point in my life where I have the chance to excel mentally physically and emotionally now that I am almost four months without alcohol.
I'm glad to hear about the reversal of your pre-diabetes! That is excellent news. And the purpose of these posts is partly to vent about our struggles there is really no need to apologize for talking about your health. ..**Struggle:** I feel like I cannot really form my own thoughts almost like my thoughts are not my own. It's quiet inside my mind a lot. I used to write paint draw and I have no ideas anymore. I haven't had any creative ideas in a long time. I am hoping when I have distanced myself far enough from alcohol that my thoughts and ideas might come back...**Triumph:** I have been getting better sleep even dreaming. I have already started to replace alcohol where I can going for walks sometimes. Other times I just let myself be sit on the couch and binge Netflix. ..**General:** I need to work on being more productive - picking up/cleaning around the house exercising spending time with family. I feel like I'm still pulling myself out of this sinkhole I have been in and hopefully once I'm out all of these things will be easier.
**Struggle:** My mental state is so bad right now. I am but a shell of my former self. Not exercising eating right able to socialize. The bare minimum of therapy and taking meds are hard enough along with not drinking. My heart is broken and it seems will never mend...**Triumph:** I'm not drinking. 393 days sober is still an accomplishment I suppose...**General:** I don't know making it through today without drinking is about all I can put my mind towards.
Struggle: global liquor industry expected to grow from $2.3 trillion to $2.7 T in next 5 years...Triumph: we have this growing sub as support against the poison...General: IWNDWYT
Struggle: Mine are health-related too. Even though I quit drinking 5+ months ago I'm still experiencing stomach pain and distress. My Doc ordered an abdomen CT scan which I had on Monday. Even since drinking the contrasting liquid my system is out of wack and my stomach is more upset than ever. Still waiting to hear back results...Triumph: Had a breakthrough in therapy yesterday and realized the friend I thought I lost when I quit drinking never really was a true friend to begin with. It took me noticing how she treats her boyfriend (and therapy) to make this realization but I'm so glad it finally happened. Fuck off Susan!..General: Happy to be here and hope everyone has as good a day as possible. IWNDWYT.
Struggle: My fianc  had to go to the Er on Sunday due to a major health scare. After many tests he was cleared to leave with instructions to schedule one more follow-up test. There's nothing serious wrong and there's a fairly good chance that there's nothing wrong at all but good lord that was terrifying. I was so tempted throughout all of it to have a drink but I'm so glad I resisted!  As scary as it was for me it was just as scary (if not more so) for him and he needs a loving supportive partner. Not a drunk one. .Triumph: I've noticed since I quit drinking just how happy I've been!  I didn't even notice I was unhappy before  but I see it clearly now. I've been in a much better mood on a day to day basis I've been super motivated and energetic and I'm even beginning to get my confidence back!  I went to the dentist yesterday and had a long very pleasant conversation with the hygienist. That NEVER would have happened when I was drinking. I would have been so stressed out thinking about how I don't know how to talk to people without booze. But yesterday I didn't have to think at all!  For the first time in years making idle chitchat was EASY!  .General: Burn season is coming up and we have our first burn at the end of this month. I'm really excited to experience them sober for the first time but also extremely nervous as there will be a lot of temptations. I'm trying to make a list of everything I want to do/experience. I think if I have a bit of a pal the temptation to drink won't be as strong. But if things get rough I plan on dropping into SD for some moral support!
My first week of May.....**Struggle**: Organizing my life and keeping an open mind about the future. Sometimes at work I get fed up with apathetic management. At times I let it get the best of me because it seems like there's nothing I can do. In the past this is often why I would come home feeling down and as a result turn to drinking...**Triumph**: I've continued abstaining from drinking and soon approaching my 3rd sober week and it feels great. Honestly it helps to start the day when I feel more confident about my ability to handle whatever happens at work. I can more carefully steer my mindset away from the negative at work and I'm less likely to come home upset. It helps me let go of the bs.  ..**General**: When I was drinking I tended to be way more reactive in situations that didn't seem to amount to anything except me getting more depressed. I know for sure that I forgot stuff way more often and sometimes this would really scare me. I definitely work on myself way more now that I can simply see myself more clearly.
**S:**  Threw my back out on Sunday afternoon.  I was letting the puppy in.  That's it just bent over and bam!  Excruciating pain originating from the lower right side of my back radiating from my toes to my shoulder.  ..**T:**  I've been laid low since Sunday afternoon.  It's frustrating as I tend to like to run around in a frenzy like a chicken with it's head cut off in an ADHDish haze bouncing around doing various tasks.  I've been required to conserve my energy and focus on the things that are truly essential.  It's reminded me that I'm a living breathing creature and has forced me to reckon with my own mortality.  How is this a triumph?  It's brought me to the painful exercise of assessing and evaluating my goals and values among other things...**G:**  The goal of life is not to create a start up move to Silicon Valley and become a billionaire at the IPO.  Steve Jobs.  Our mental and physical health are one and Jobs achieved that goal of becoming a billionaire but the price was steep.  His billions weren't able to buy back his health.
This is the far from my first "day one" but I genuinely feel positive about making it to "day two".  Tonight I'll be trying a meeting for the first time something I've been making excuses to NOT do for the last 10 years.  IWNDWYT.
Struggle: Work is still not very fulfilling and now it is our busy season. Plus I am working more at my side gig so it just feels like I am working ALL THE TIME. The money will be good but I'm tired. And I don't have as much time to go for runs anymore so I think that makes me more tired. ..&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: I have an interview tomorrow for a job at my same company. Its in a different division. It would be a lateral move and not really a promotion but I could get paid more and it would be nice to get out of this position and get a fresh start somewhere else. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: It feels like now that I am well past 30 days the "high" of being sober has worn off a bit. Which I expected. And now comes the harder part of just getting through life one day at a time and still not drinking. Anyone else feel this at all? In the beginning every day feels like a milestone and an achievement. But now that I am up to 40 days it seems like more of a grind and the idea of not drinking ever again seems daunting. I think its normal to feel this way but I just wanted to document it and see if anyone else felt a similar way in their 2nd month of not drinking.
Fantastic news on your health improvements! Cheers. IWNDWYT.
Struggle: Waking up from a literal week long morning-until-night binge wondering how the hell I got to this point. Realizing how I've let everything spiral to a shameful point. ....Triumph: Waking up from a literal week long morning-until-night binge and realizing that my life needs to change. That was yesterday and I did not drink. Today I will also not drink and I actually felt excited for the possibility of what today could bring. Instead of drinking I went to the library and borrowed some books and began studying for my licensure exam. I haven't read for fun in probably 2 years. I love reading. I've missed out on so many things that give my life spice and joy (running used to be a ballet dancer music etc.) and I can't wait to get to know myself again. ....General: I have work to do but I do love a challenge! Just being here with you all gives me such hope you all inspire me.
I'm grateful that you re-tested and don't have pre-diabetes Mary :)...**Struggle:**     The visiting doctor just left the house after examining mom. I asked what medications they could give her to calm her down (i.e. stop screaming bloody murder at 2AM every night and throwing her table tea food remote etc. at me). Evil sister told the doctor not to give her anything that I shouldn't "drug" her. Funny because evil sister *does not LIVE with her* I do. I'm the one that deals with this dammit...**Triumph:**     I'm getting out of here and going up to SO's for one damn night. I may actually sleep...**General:**     I used to enjoy the beach walks shopping...now I just yearn to leave the house. Period.
I just found out my best friend who is 23 has been dealing with alcohol abuse for the last 2 years. I started to notice he was drinking while we played video games online with each other within the last year so I'm not surprised. I care deeply about my friend and I want to help him in any way I can. I feel bad because a lot of the fun we've had in the past has involved alcohol. If anyone can give me a few tips on how to talk with him about this please help. I've already told him that this doesn't change our friendship and that drinking isn't the reason we're friends. I'm worried though and saddened to hear he's dealing with this.
Hey Mary you go ahead and share whatever is most pressing on your mind.  If it's health then it's health.  You do us many great services here and you get to benefit from releasing your concerns here as much as the rest of us...**Struggle:**  I seem to keep gravitating towards people who are not really friends after all despite what I've thought.  I had an old friend move back into my town and I was so excited to reconnect with her.  We went out a couple of times and every time she gushed about how much she enjoyed her time with me and how glad she was we reconnected.  And then radio silence.  Every time I tried to make contact or plans she wasn't available.  I finally gave up.  I had no idea what happened and I guess I didn't really want to confront her about it as my feelings were hurt and I was tired of putting energy into a confounding situation.  Just recently had something happen with another friend who only contacted me when she wanted to bitch about her girlfriend.  I drew a very gentle boundary around spending time with her and the woman she told me she never wanted to see again and who had treated her terribly but told her I'd love to meet up one on one to catch up.  And now she doesn't want to spend time with me.  It's hard to make good friends in my 40s and I'm wondering if my friend picker is broken...**Triumph:**  I did make a couple of cool friends who like to do fun things and seem more communicative and respectful.  And I'm committed to seeing a therapist once a week for the first time in many years.  Looking forward to seeing what that brings...**General:**  I am increasingly aware of how much out of my comfort zone I am going to have to go in order to make much-needed changes in my life.  I refuse to give up.
**Triumph:** I spent yesterday on jury duty. I wasn't selected and the process was *endless*. But I participated and did my civic duty. It came at the end of a busy week. I've stay on top of everything and feel pretty good about it ..**Struggle:** After a few weeks of low stress it's piling up. I'm hoping that the tools and techniques I've been practicing will come into play...**General:** Health is such a fickle thing. I'm glad mine has been good and feel for all my friends who are having issues.
Hey all. I've posted once or twice about needing to stop drinking and I finally did it. I'm on day 6. ..It took me losing the man I love And a hospital stay (mental health check) but I did it! I'm moving out of my toxic home environment I'm living with a sober friend that has meetings walkable. Also starting an outpatient group program. ..I'm really nervous about all the change but also really happy. I know it can only get better from here. ..Thank you r/stopdrinking for helping me get there and IWNDWYT
Struggle.Inlaws in town which means lots of booze. I also have a bunch of cans o' wine in the fridge for my MIL. Been having edibles some nights (THC + CBD) but not booze..Triumph.I bought alcohol for everyone but ALSO bought a million really fancy sparkly waters juice kombuchas NA beer cold brew coffee and iced matchas. The fridge is stocked and I havent caved. .General.Had a goal of 90 days when I started this streak getting close!
Struggles: Trying to make today my first day of being sober. I recently went 31 days sober. Thought I could go to moderate drinking after breaking the 'habit'. I was wrong...&amp;#x200B;..Triumph: Visited my first AA meeting yesterday. I don't know if it's for me but at least I know it's there and I'm no longer scared to go...&amp;#x200B;..General: I'm trying to remember I'm doing this for me and to accomplish the goals I have.
Struggle: my boyfriend of four years and I officially broke up. This was after my psych hospital stay because I was ready to off myself after cheating on him when wildly intoxicated. Reasonable still sad. I'm also struggling with the fact that I have nothing to do but work on myself and that's scary. I chose to move out of my house because of the environment and basically couch surfing until I can get back to work and save up. ..Triumph: I woke up not hungover. I woke up hopeful. I didn't lose my shit at the official conversation of ending it. I am sad but I am managing. A week ago this would not have been possible. ..In general: I'm excited to move forward with a new chapter in my life. I'm nervous a lot of my friends/life was centered around drinking (my house my friends comedy scene etc.)..All in all I know I'll be so much happier healthier and will grow so much. Thank you to all of you who have commented encouraging things before. IWNDWYT
Struggle: I still think about my ex a lot and it's quite frustrating. I just want to stop already. It doesn't make me sad or upset anymore. I miss him a little and I know I shouldn't ick...Triumph: I'm down to 158.6 pounds from 172 and still going! Getting into the 150s from the 160s was a huge boost for me today! It's crazy what losing 13 pounds will do for your confidence!..General: Almost done painting my living room it's been a long project but really worth it. I'll be finished on Saturday (I hope!)! I've also been working on coursework for my new job opportunity it's boring but I'm excited about opening new doors!
Struggle: had a depressing talk with my therapist where I realized I will have to deal with my mental healtg issues the rest of my life. Been really trying to spend time digesting that today and understanding that although it'll be a lifelong fight that I'll never "win" in the way I want to it is ultimately something worth fighting for. I am something worth fighting for...Truimph: Ivstruggled with eating disorders for longer than I have with alcohol and drugs and I've been gaining weight and I'm only 8 lbs away from no longer being underweight. This is huge considering I had a set back a couple months ago and lost 15lbs. I look almost healthy now and feel pretty good.
Struggle: Feeling calm and confident at work. New job lots of learning. ..Triumph: Feeling generally healthy and sleeping so much better. Looking forward to going to sleep with a clear head and walking up with one. I think my resting pulse is a triumph too. I can see the numbers that support improvement with anxiety. ..General: Content with life.
I'm hoping my next exam will show improvements in both blood pressure and blood sugar so I can get off these damn pills. Congratulations on your improvement!
I'm glad that your health stuff has turned around!..Struggle: ive been having a hard time physically with a bad sleep and nightmares last night. I've tried to quit countless times over the last..... year I guess so the kindling is hitting hard this time. Also stressed out about other life stuff. ..Triumph: I'm feeling a lot better than I was yesterday or even earlier today. After sitting around in a funk for a while I cleaned my bathroom and swept the alleyway/sidewalk outside my house and my steps. Cleaning really improved my mood. I think/hope I'll sleep a lot better tonight.
For me.quitting is all about the purpose of better health. ..Your post reminds me. just how reversible the effects of drinking are through .cessation of alcohol.
