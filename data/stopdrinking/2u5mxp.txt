Today was my birthday which also happens to mark the longest I've gone without a drink in over a year. I typically don't draw much attention to my birthday and try to fly under the radar...I worked about a 12 hour day at a client site and at the end of the day my peer decided to tell the manager and partner in charge that it was my birthday  right before going out to dinner (ugh). So we're at dinner and of course everyone orders a beer and I just order water. The partner looks at me with a shocked face and says "WATER?!?" I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that I'm an non drink so I just muttered some nonsense.....To top it all off I've been struggling with a cold/cough the past couple days. It's definitely been rough. BUT I chose not to drink today and plan on doing the same tomorrow. With that simple decision even though today wasn't the best it was certainly better than the days of old where I would have had 1 or 2 drinks and then compulsively obsessed over when the next one was going to come.

i have been in the spot a few times "jester_fool_ you wanna beer?"  and then i apparently have 3 heads when i say no thanks. with some people i just come out and say i quit drinking and it's no big deal. but sometimes depending on my mood or who the person is i just dont feel like getting into the conversation. at which point i just let them know i just feel like having a soda right now and that is simply the end of the conversation...the best part about your story is that you stuck to your guns and didn't grab a beer like everyone around you. way to go man_eating_flamingo!
Happy Birthday and congratulations! I worry about how mine will be as they have always revolved around getting black out drunk in the past. I'm sorry that it didn't work out as you planned but in a way it did. You planned to not drink today and you followed through with that. That's a win to me. Great job
