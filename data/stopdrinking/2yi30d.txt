There's a lot of nonsense going on in my head and I thought that writing it all out might be helpful. I apologize in advance if all of my sentences and words are jumbled...Today is Day 2 for me again (as the title states I need to reset my badge). The last time I posted here (I think towards the end of January?) it was also a "Day 2 again." And oh my god I have had SO many Day Twos since then - too many for me to keep track of - often ultimately resulting in giving into the craving to drink. ..I thought of that quote insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. On none of those "Day Twos" did I reach out to anyone for help with my struggles and that obviously didn't work for me. Maybe this will...Now that it's past 5 PM my brain is like "woohoo! drinking time!" I try to remind myself of the reasons why I want to stop but I swear my thoughts sound like a petulant child throwing a temper tantrum. The more I resist the more the rebellious thoughts seem to push back at me: "Who CARES if you drink tonight" I think to myself and eventually I believe it. ..All I want to do is drink because it makes me feel stupid-happy and I forget all the other shit that's going on inside of me. I like that numbness. Most times I even LIKE the lack of control. But damnit that scares me. What is wrong with me?..In the words of Forrest Gump "That's all I have to say about that." I'm not sure if I'm looking for support for advice for ... I don't even know what? I don't feel any better after typing this up but I will hit submit any way :(

Do what you always did get what you always got.
Hmmm. Once those resets start they tend to keep happening. At least that's what happened to me...Ask the mods for an extra sticky badge that's what helped me break the cycle this time. That and making a concrete plan that involved taking action in real life (seeing a therapist committing to go to a support group meeting daily and making a weekly schedule of meetings to go to) and **lots** of accountability (posting on my SDLocal sub to find people to go to meetings with me posting here daily about my progress being honest with my husband about the extent of my drinking.) I have not even *thought* about taking a drink since my last badge reset. Hmmm. Musta been that extra sticky badge they gave me!
Do you have any plans for the night? If not make em quick! Can you go for a jog/walk? That's a quick way to release endorphins and release some anxiety. I always feel positively after a walk. 
&gt; All I want to do is drink because it makes me feel stupid-happy and I forget all the other shit that's going on inside of me...Yeah alcohol makes you stupid-happy. The only reason I used to drink was because It was very efficient at making me euphoric. It also was very efficient at fucking my life up. So that was bad. ..If I could have that feeling without any of the negative consequences I would but that isn't the case. ..I think you are focusing too much on the temporary happiness and not focusing on the solution for real lasting happiness. ..You see as a sober man I can never feel as euphoric as a drunk man. But as a sober man I don't need to. I don't need to escape from a broken life I've fixed it. I don't need to hide from failures I'm succeeding. I don't need to forget the night of bad decisions I don't have them. ..Alcohol prevented me from having a good life so I drank to numb that realization. It's a never ending cycle. ..You can beat this!

Hi /u/sundriedpotatoes I hope you're doing well! I stumbled across this post and wanted to reach out. ..I check this subreddit quite often and I am always here to talk whenever you feel the cravings. The hardest for me is during the night after 5 now too especially since my girlfriend is working nights this month. I know you said you reached out to people before but I don't know if they were dealing with the struggle of alcohol like you and me. From your other posts I see you're into photography as am I. I'm hopefully going to purchase a nice camera here soon to get back into it...I'm only on day 2 (after 2 resets in the past two weeks) but I know I can do this! I know **you** can do this!
