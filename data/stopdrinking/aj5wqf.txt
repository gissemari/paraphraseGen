Early recovery is the hardest bc I've experienced the strong urge for about a month and then it's way easier (someone may explain that better bc I'm exhausted!). I used this tool today and it worked so I wanted to share to anyone else who is struggling.

How did you reward yourself? I had major sugar cravings so I used to reward myself with chocolates! 
Cranberry and ginger ale all night..We can do this  
Tastes great and something about mixing it helps..Stay strong brother..IWNDWYT or tomorrow
I've been buying books and shoes..prob not saved any $ or much at least but these also won't cause hangovers!
Instead of looking forward to a beer when I get home from work it's vanilla cappucino 
I bought myself a new bedspread now that my bed isn't a place to just pass out.
