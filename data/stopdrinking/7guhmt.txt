A couple weeks ago my fiance who I was with for 13 years moved out leaving me with double the bills a bit of sadness and anxiety. I stopped taking work in my painting business in September and became a union painter quite suddenly as well. The job is a lot different from working for myself and isn't at all what i was expecting nor is the pay enough to clear all my new expenses. Bought a new truck last summer with an enormous interest rate when my other vehicle finally gave up too. Then there are the ongoing family issues I wont even subject you all too but suffice it to  say I am overloaded with stress but I knew two things: The alcohol wasn't helping the situation and the times I have hopped on the wagon before made life easier rather suddenly. It seemed impossible to drive home from work without stopping for my usual fix so I began taking the bus.  Last Sunday I woke up and poured out the last two beers in the fridge.  Several things are different from the last several times I have laid off the sauce one being I am having zero problems sleeping probably because of my energy expenditure all day. I'm easily recognizing the symptoms of alcoholism in my coworkers who all seem to have been accustomed to the work/drink/sleep routine because if you can stand the politics and don't mind the boredom it can be comfortable and most of these guys are fine with that. I know I will never be fine counting the hours until the pension and if I was going to do something more I would have to quit for good. There is motivation there. Given that it has been easier this time than ever to turn away. I knew I wouldn't make it another five years as a drunk with the thoughts I was having daily. Already those destructive thoughts are dissolving. It's time to take it head on and this is my last chance.  Fortunately it feels very possible right now.  The relationship left me without friends or social life so it is a blank slate from here and already the rebound is looking promising.  Thanks SD I will be back with updates because this time I have no enabler to relapse on and it feels amazing to think about what the future holds now free from the two most debilitating things in my life.

From one Woody to another congratulations on making it this far!..The 'blank slate' thing can be pretty scary but just take things one day at a time and be gentle on yourself and before you know it that slate will start filling up with good stuff.....Hope you'll stick around and keep us posted on how you're doing (but don't be too stingy with the paragraph breaks eh!)....I won't drink with you today and Fizzy-Water-Cheers to a bright and booze-free future!..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;..
