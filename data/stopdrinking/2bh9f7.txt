The world lost a great artist all too soon when Amy Winehouse died. I still listen to her music several times a week and will probably enjoy it for years to come. When I think about how much more she could have created if it hadn't been for her addiction it makes me feel rather sick...Her music speaks to me in no small part because of our shared struggles with alcohol. I can relate to the fear that kept her from seeking help until it was too late. It is also possible that she suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder like I do and whether that is true or not her music certainly depicts several of the same struggles that I have had as a result of living with the disorder...If you had asked me about The 27 Club two or three years ago I probably would have remarked that I would be lucky to live even that long considering my struggles with alcohol and suicide attempts. Next week I will turn 27 and I intend to live for many more decades to come...Here's to you Amy. I will honor you today by staying sober.

Sobriety is sadly populated with lots of ghosts.  Some are prominent like Amy Winehouse Kurt Cobain David Foster Wallace and others are heartbreakingly family members friends and even members of our sober fellowship.  This disorder spares no one.  It is ugly and monstrous and our personal obligation is to do simple sober actions to dismiss it from our daily lives.  I'm glad you are part of the light and living /u/quirkyperson stay strong and be a power of example.
I love Amy so much I even have a portrait of her hanging in my apartment. Never thought I would live to even be 27 much less make it through this year. In December I'll be 28 but I also want to live through that year too. Cheers to life and Happy Birthday /u/quirkyperson!
