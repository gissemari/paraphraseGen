I drink 6 days a week and have for the past several years. ..I haven't had any major issue come from it. I see many small issues from it adding up and I'm starting to see that. The biggest one is the hangovers. Every morning is a struggle. Beer is also holding me back from getting in better shape. I'm excited to replace my nightly beer and junk food routine with a gym or biking routine. ..The habitual acts of going to the liquor store drinking beers going out for beer ect... Leaves me with a lot of time and i want to use it positively. ..This is my chance to start positive habits and make myself a better person. Today is day one wish me luck!

Good luck you'll be grand \o/
Good for you! Your plan of replacing your beer habit with something else works really well. Enjoy a good morning tomorrow :)
Sometimes breaking a routine makes it just a little easier to not drink. I used to stop at the liquor store every night on my way home. To combat that I found a different way home. As dumb as it sounds it helps. 
You can do it! It's great that you're starting out focusing on the positive things that you want that are incompatible with drinking. It's amazing how much more impact working out/running has when you're not drinking 1500 calories in booze every day! And I am telling you sober mornings are THE BEST.
