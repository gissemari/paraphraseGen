I had a long night last night to think about what I wanted to say. Waking up this morning I finally agree with what I thought the night before...I started a process about a month ago where every 2 weeks I would implement a new life change that I thought would make me a better person. It started with cutting down on snack foods then went to exercising more. After a night out drinking I have decided what the next step is: cutting out alcohol completely...Alcohol does not make me into the person I want to be. As soon as I start drinking I turn into an emotional mess and struggle to recover from it. I have tried moderation a few times but those attempts haven't been successful...So starting today I am giving up alcohol completely.

Congrats on that choice.  It is not an easy one but for me it has been very rewarding.
Congrats on your choice!  ..I also had a eureka moment with alcohol where I finally realized that abstaining was the best choice.  For me it was realizing that I had a mental addiction to alcohol.  I couldnt moderate (its impossible to control an addiction).  I had to eliminate it.  When I accepted it was time to rid myself of this albatross it was liberating in itself.
