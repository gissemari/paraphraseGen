So I've reached day ten again. Been reading a lot recently to help keep me busy. One of the books I've been reading the main character is a recovering alcoholic. Two lines that have stuck out to me in this book. One is (you'll have to excuse me for paraphrasing) I'm not addicted to the booze because of what ever shitty thing happened to me in my past. I'm addicted because I'm an alcoholic and the sooner I realize this the faster I can move in and get help. The other is that you can't turn a pickle back into a cucumber...I've been struggling a lot recently and always seem to fail and fail hard around the ten day mark. I've done a lot of terrible things in my life. I use to be a good person and wish for that man back. I dont know if he is even still in here. But while I'm a drunk I know he'll never return. I go to meeting and hear other peoples amazing stories of sobriety and part of me wonder if I even deserve it. Part of me knows that just the addiction talking and part of me doesnt care. I known I've had a problem for a long time when it came to alcohol. But in the last while a picture has started to form how truley powerless I am to it...I'm so torn. I want to fight yet i just want to quit at the same time. I have things to keep myself distracted but what happens when I run out of little things to do. The real world is still out there and I cant just keep hiding from my addiction. I've given up so much. I think I've hit rock bottom just to rise up to come down even further. If I cant get sober this time round I'll lose everything again and I dont know if I have it in me to try and build it up again...I just dont know. One day at a time.
