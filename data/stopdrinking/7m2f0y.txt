So I had a portion of Christmas pudding last night not realising it's soaked in brandy. I've not drank at all. I feel so bad like I've relapsed but does this even count? Do I need to reset my badge?

No you're good. If we counted unintentionally eating alcohol no one would be sober. Don't let people tell you that alcohol cooks off though. Turns out that's not the case. 
Sounds innocent and no intoxication. I wouldn't sweat it one bit. Sober on! Btw it doesn't appear you have a badge on here.
I accidentally ingested some wine once and didn't reset. For me intention is everything.
I think you're fine (although it's a personal decision)..PS- your badge doesn't appear visible though...
No you're fine. Please don't fall into the addict line of thinking that says  'well I had a brandy soaked christmas cake and was fine so maybe I could just see if I could have one?' (While forgetting just how difficult it is to stop)...Almost all addicts eventually end up back in the place they were in before they managed to stop
