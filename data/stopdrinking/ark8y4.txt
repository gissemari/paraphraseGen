Frank Sinatra once said  I feel bad for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning that's the best they're gonna feel all day.  But hey a walk or a workout sure as Hell beats a hangover...I admittedly still have trouble with mindless Reddit during sober evenings so it's fair to say I still struggle with sober evenings. But the morning air and stillness never gets old. I went out for fresh bagels this morning too.

I love it too.  Every day I get out for a walk .. it's amazing
I stopped drinking a few days before New Year's Eve 2019 and celebrated New Year's Day with a walk first thing in the morning - it is winter here but it happened with you! An evening walk is great for stress relief but a morning walk is a great way to start the day by appreciating it. You've inspired me to so on a short walk in my neighborhood right now - THANKS!
I love it as well. The sun rising the birds chirping... I remember I used to often stay up until the times I wake up some of these days. It was such a depressing existence living like this I felt so lonely all the damn time. The changes that happen slowly but surely made are pretty damn amazing. I never thought I could be a 'morning person'.
Early morning walks with my precious doggo.   Not very enjoyable all hungover and feeling like the business end of a meat grinder.      IWNDWYT
I'm the opposite!! I wake up early and then dick around on Reddit instead of doing something productive. I was gonna get up and go for a walk but it's still dark and cold this morning so I don't waaaaannnaaa and here I am on Reddit...lol...Have a good one Rachie :)
Nice!
