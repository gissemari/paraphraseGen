I have a lot of hang ups about AA. Not necessarily the higher power stuff. It just seems like such a desperate move I guess... but I am that desperate. The community here on this sub is great and reminds me I'm not alone but the reality is I have no one in my life that I know who struggles with alcohol and is also trying to do something about it. That makes me feel incredibly alone especially because I'm fairly young still (27) and live in a very  boozy' city. Hoping that finding a community will be something that makes me feel less alone but also helps me work through this in a better way. Just some thoughts to help me air out some of my nervousness before I head over soon. Can't hurt to try.

It sounds like everything you are looking for can be found at AA :)
Congratulations!..Let us know how it goes!
I live in a boozy city too makes for a lot of great and diverse recovery communities a lot of diverse people. In the beginning I needed somewhere to spend my late evenings so I found a 1030pm meeting and...grew from them. Maybe check in and let us know how the first meeting goes it's so interesting.
