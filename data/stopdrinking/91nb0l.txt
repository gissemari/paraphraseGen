I read tonight about the relapse of Demi Lovato to heroin - and about her new song. I listened to it for the first time and he words have never rang more true. I'm sorry I'm not sober - right now I'm not. But I'll get there again. Just a reminder to all be kind to each other ourselves and this is our own journey. XO
