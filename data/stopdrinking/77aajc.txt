I really have no goal. I stopped drinking at the end of March just for a month to see if I could do it. On a planned night in early May I made a nice meal and bought a bottle of wine.... that night was not the romantic night I thought it was going to be with my girlfriend. So I quickly got back on the wagon after that night. I was angry at first I tried to prove to myself I could come back and drink in moderation and it failed miserably. So now I knew I couldn't even do that. I was lost had no goal but I did want to go back to drinking. But I kept abstaining not sure for how long or what limit I set. First it was this first vacation. Then it was 100 days. Well I got my annual week of training a little past the 100 day mark so let's just go do that week sober. Then I came back from training and said alright I'm going to celebrate with wine but I never did. I forget why. It's not important though but I didn't drink. I kept having these dates just a little further outside and I kept abstaining until them. I was planning to have some wine with my gf the other night but I did not.....And now there was this last weekend. I was fatigued barely got 55 minutes of sleep one night. And I was starting to come down with a cold. My last few days off at home I had felt like a hangover after a bender. The anxiety the fact that I couldn't accomplish any tasks in any logic order. I was so disorganized felt like shit and pure anxiety. This is what I used to feel like every single night before my work week started. I hated it with a passion back then and I hated it even more this week. I haven't felt that messed up in a little under six months. It was horrible and I felt exactly like I was hungover...But the good thing is this all came without drinking a drop of alcohol. It served as a fantastic reminder of what I hated after drinking. I got to experience it without having to reset my count. ..Stay strong guys the mind plays tricks. When you think you can handle it try to remember how bad the next couple days are after a bender.
