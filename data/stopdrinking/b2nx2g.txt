Should've listened. It was definitely too soon for me to be around heavy drinking. Woke up Sunday with the worst hangover and I've been struggling with massive anxiety ever since. Feeling very down on myself. How do you guys pick yourselves up after caving?

Sleep and time. I'm in the same boat. Feel better after a nap. Just take it day by day you've got this!
Sleep. Sleep sleep. It's never too late to start again. Stay strong  
hey you're here and that's what matters. you could have thrown up your hands and said "fuck it" but you're asking about how to pick yourself up. by being here I'd say you've already done it. it's ok to feel disappointed but don't let it derail you just keep moving forward. you got this!

I avoided social situations that involved alcohol for several months.  That gave me time to build up my confidence to know that I could resist.
I did the exact same thing. I'm feeling anxious and depressed as hell since Monday morning. ..Anyone out there it's not worth it. I would have had much more fun and a better feeling and enjoyable weekend had I not drank...I wasted all of Monday which I had taken off work and was a beautiful day I could have been out hiking or enjoying the company of family and friends. Instead I was curled up in a bed regretful and shameful.
