Hi all. Apparently it's my cake day so that's nice. A year of being on Reddit more or less. This username started as a throwaway but became my main account. ..I'm five months sober about a week ago. Can't believe that. It's so crazy. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster I guess. ..I'm bipolar which presumably had a big part to play in my drinking. Part of the reason I quit drinking was to get that official diagnosis. I was so tired of dealing with depression all the time. I was told I couldn't be assessed by the mental health folks until I had got sober because I was initially diangosed with depression and my medications hadn't had a chance to work thanks to the alcohol. Getting sober let my medications do their thing and for a while I felt brilliant. My moods have been on the whole better but after the intial few months' lift in mood I've found that I struggle with side effects that I've noticed such as a flatness of mood. The inability to really feel good for any length of time (nor extreme lows but still lows that can remove all motivation to do anything for a while) and I think that this has contributed to my difficulties with the autumn...Autumn is my favourite time of year. I love the colours and crunchy leaves the smell of bonfires cosy dark nights the chilly sunny days. Autumn makes me feel alive and excited to be a part of everything. But this year I haven't felt that at all. I enjoy the smells and I like the leaves but I have no excitement. No joy. It's been creeping around the edges of my mind that I could have that with alcohol and I've been struggling with it. I've had a few dreams in which I've drunk and been in control of it despite feeling guilty. I don't want to drink. I know it's not true that I could control it and thngs would be different. I can't just have one to get in the mood. ..I know that this is part of the cost of dealing with my illness and finding medication that works for me. It's painful because I look forward to October all year and it's a long wait. I hate the idea of missing out and having to wait until next year. But that's the up front payment of building a life in which I can have that joy and excitement every year without alcohol as well as living a fulfilling and content life generally. ..I've never been good at delayed gratification and this is maybe the most painful delay yet. ..I think autumn will be harder than Christmas because as much as I enjoy christmas it's not my favourite and I feel like I just like to eat lots then and chill out and be cosy. It's not the events of all these holidays the parties and family gatherings that I will miss alcohol at it's the quiet evenings in with a warm fiery drink. But sure that's what ginger tea is for :D

Happy Cake Day /u/saltwatermonkey -- I feel some real melancholy in your post. ..I also hear my own alky voice in all its incarnations: you're going to miss that booze because it's autumn you're going to miss that booze because of the football; you're going to miss that booze because it's a day ending in a "y."  If I resist this call it gets easier--I know because I heard that voice in a myriad of ways I understood it for what it is and I defeated it to now.
Autumn is my favourite too but I haven't gone outside to appreciate it since sobriety because my brain still makes those associations in my head of Autumn=drinks whilst snuggled under a blanket. I guess I'm a bit hermit-y at the moment but it's keeping me sober so all good. Thanks for posting and making me feel less alone X
