I relapsed again a couple weeks ago after 120ish days sober. Today is another day 1. I had a good thing going before that and I've already put all my hard work in jeopardy. Tonight is all about reflection and my journal. I will never give up.

good on you for coming back to fight the good fight. it's not easy but boy is it worth it. ..you can do it! never give up. IWNDWYT!
Lifting a glass of orange juice in your honor as a toast to your last day one  . You can do this!
