Hey guys about to turn 34 and have been sober for almost five months. My drinking played a large role in the failure of my marriage and I want to stay clean if only so my son doesn't grow up with a drunk for a father. ..To the point: I'm struggling with regret over the divorce and being a thousand miles from my son. He's only three and needs to be with his mom at that age but I still feel like a failure for not being a daily part of his life. ..- Went to a few meetings in the first weeks.- Work full-time (best job I've ever had).- Have the support of family where I am and a great job but can't see my son regularly..- Still have dreams where I'm getting hammered...Thanks for hearing me out AA was kinda terrifying and it's nice to have a forum.

Kudos for five months sober! Working the steps in AA helped me maintain momentum. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about myself but it was invaluable. I hope you'll be able to move closer to your son soon. He needs his dad too. 
Hi perhaps in time you will be back in your son's life again. I found two books that has helped me: "This naked mind" by Annie Grace and "Stop Drinking Alcohol" by Kevin O'hare. But you are so much ahead of me I look forward to having 5 months as well...Best wishes. I hope to see you here. This is one of the most supportive and kind forum.
