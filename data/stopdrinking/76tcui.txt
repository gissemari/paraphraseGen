...Physical* I can spell I swear!!..I am hoping to learn everyone's experiences with both mental and physical changes over time when they've stopped drinking?..I'm on day 12 but had 15 days before a one day relapse. I'm about 10 lbs lighter face is less puffy.. and I feel amazing. I am tired though still have some trouble sleeping. My face is still red though!!!!

My sense of smell is coming back! I can't wait for further improvement.
Hi!..I bookmarked this old post regarding an [Alcohol Recovery Timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/) which I found interesting.....For me it definitely took a month or two to really start feeling the benefit mentally... it takes quite a while to heal from years of alcohol abuse so keep going even if progress can seem slow from day-to-day!..I found it helpful to take a few pics of myself along the way to look back on... the difference between day 1 and now is pretty obvious but its harder to notice when you see yourself in the mirror every day.....Hope that helps! I won't drink with you today..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
