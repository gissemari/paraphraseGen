I'm having a hard time getting past 9 days. Any advice on what you did to help with the cravings? I keep relapsing and then doing the whole "I'll just quit tomorrow" for days on end. ..Thank you!

Meditate breathe bath...."Be still"...
Distraction/deliberate procrastination I found worked for me. putting off giving in for just a little longer. and a little longer. even minute-minute or hour-hour..."Well *sure* I could go buy some beer/wine/vodka. But i'll do ____ first. Then i'll decide." and keep repeatedly finding things to do- and listening to podcast/stories etc while doing. anything from reading a book tidying drawers even cleaning the damn toilet. I found after a while I was able to push myself until either the notion passed or the magic 10pm hour when shop could no longer sell alcohol. 
Schedule a trip to the gym yoga jogging something else that will perk up your endorphins safely. Take a different route home if you pass by a usual liquor store. Have a plan for your evening. Call a sober friend. I had to want sobriety more than anything else before I could end that merry-go-round. Best wishes.
For me getting psychiatric help was necessary.  I was prescribed medication to help with the cravings so I could do the real work through therapy.  Many different ways to sobriety.  Keep up the good fight!
Staying sober without lots of support would have been impossible for me. I am grateful for my therapist and AA for teaching how to live a sober happy life. 
I learned that *Willpower* and *Determination* are useful attributes to bring me many successes in life...I learned that *stopping drinking* was not an area in which they were very effective.  I kept making deals with myself about "tomorrow" and then when tomorrow arrived I had some *really good justification* about why well today is *different* and I'll do it tomorrow...That set up a cycle of broken promises to myself doubts about my willpower and guilt for my failures...What changed it all for me was asking for support.  I spoke to a counselor.  She recommended meetings.  I went and found people who understood what I was experiencing.  I got tools resources and found fellowship to support me.  They helped with the urges/cravings until they went away...I've never been happier!
Book your evenings with anything you look forward to doing sober. Read "The Naked Mind" (in sidebar) if you haven't it made the first couple of weeks much easier for me.
Something I learned here: H.A.L.T..Am I Hungry?.Angry?.Lonely?.Tired?.I reflect on those things and when I figure out which it is I try to find a way to resolve it.
