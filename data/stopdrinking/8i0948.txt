One of my co-workers has been struggling with alcohol since I met her.  The "lush" of the company she was at every party and clearly was doing fine.  When I started down my journey into moderation (and onward to sobriety) I've shared with her I was stopping.  She was fantastic and supportive and made a point to tell people not to push me if I said "no thanks" to that Happy Hour beer...We met each other on our way into work today and another co-worker of ours invited us to a party to get rid of her "excess liquor".  My friend laughed and said "Well we'll be there - but we won't be drinking any of the leftover booze you're offering us!"..It filled me with such joy to have someone at my side seeing the benefits and working through it.  She's going on her third week and I'm so happy for her...IWNDWYT!

My spouse and I often joked that our friends would drink less or stop all together if we quit drinking. It's totally coming true. Ha!
Lucky you. Keep helping one another and spread the love of sobriety. 
Support is so helpful! Glad you're both on the same page now:)
