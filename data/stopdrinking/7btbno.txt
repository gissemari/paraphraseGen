I've been lurking for a while and decided to finally make my first post. I apologize if this gets long. A bit about me: I'm in my late 20s and belong to a social group that includes many drinkers. I've been questioning my relationship with alcohol for about a year.  I'm generally healthy in many ways other than my alcohol consumption. During the week I exercise plans my meals etc. I sometimes have 1-3 drinks during the week then I almost always go into excess on weekends. I often binge drink on weekends both with my social group and alone/home with just my husband (who also has developed similar habits.)..Ive been afraid to share my concerns with friends since a lot of our social activities include alcohol. But recently one person in our group got sober (she might have had a chemical dependence definitely had a mental one.) That person has actually gotten a fair amount of criticism but it's making me more reflective on how I'd like to proceed...I stopped drinking for 2 weeks. During that time I had occasional single sips from my friends' drinks for taste if they were trying something new to me. I know those sips would disqualify me from being considered sober by most views. Even so 2 weeks was the longest I've gone without drinking in years... and it was actually much easier than I expected. I mean I was tempted but I didn't agonize over it. ..And so I decided I must have better control than I realized so  a drink or two  couldn't hurt. I opened a bottle of wine and intended to have 1-2 normal sized drinks. I had one normal pour followed by two more large pours that resulted in my consuming 3/4 the bottle. I would have had the entire bottle but my husband had already poured himself a glass. I even contemplated drinking some beer left over by a friend despite it being a kind I specifically dislike. Luckily something clicked and I started thinking  why am I doing this it isn't fun and it's bad to me  so I didn't drink the beer. I went to bed drunk and slept terribly. . .Now I'm back to  not drinking  and again it seems manageable from day to day. But I'm still struggling to come to terms with that that means for me long term.

Welcome. Your story is familiar. I understand the "occasional single sips" and the thought that "I must have better control than I realized..." followed by a quickly empty bottle and a search for more alcohol to feed the demon...Been there done that...I learned that for me I am happier not drinking than I am having sips or [limiting myself to] one or two appropriately sized drinks.  One or two drinks makes me irritated or squirrelly or both. And I don't like being irritated or squirrelly and I don't like being drunk so I don't start. I choose not to drink. I am fine if people around me drink and if they enjoy it I enjoy their company. And I drink seltzer water...You're in the right place. I will not drink with you today
I hear that. The longest I've gone in the past year is 1 week here &amp; there &amp; I've always "rewarded" myself with a binge afterwards. Now that I'm at a little over 2 weeks I'm worried I'm going to get those sneaking thoughts that I don't really have a problem. But reading everyone else's relapse stories is helping me stay sober. For today. This weekend will be a test for me since I'm going out with a friend but I'm hoping to stay strong. I will not drink with you today!
