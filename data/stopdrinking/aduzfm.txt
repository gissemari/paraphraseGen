I never though I could do this and make such a big change in my life. I am happy and grateful and got a tattoo of a poison bottle to  commemorate and to keep me strong when I struggle. Reading your stories over here also helped a tremendous amount to stay sober! So thanks and happy sobriety to mee :)
