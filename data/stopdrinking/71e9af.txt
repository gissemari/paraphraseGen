My wife left today to visit the in laws for two weeks with our 4 month old daughter they live in another country. We had a long talk at the airport about my drinking and my wife was very proud of me not drinking the last 10 days. . I had strong cravings on the way home my brain was telling myself "she is not here now you can't saying anything hurtful if she isn't here she will never know.. I even went to shop. I had to stop the car and tell myself it is not worth throwing it all away you will feel guilty and if she found out it would break her heart. Do you want to let them both down... I got some sweets and a energy drink went home and watched a film and had a sleep then went to work tonight feeling great...Not going to drink today whatever happens...The struggle is real.

Well done! This technique can be very useful. It's good to want to be a better partner and father. My only concern is that I don't hear you saying you want to do this for YOU. ..Congratulations on 10 days. I will not drink with you today. ..Butterfly   
Fantastic!! You won that battle!! The struggle is real I won't be drinking today either..Congrats on 10 days!
Way to go!!!  That's awesome!
You are doing it! I won't drink with you today :-).PS. Personally if a craving hits - I always remind myself of the awesome sober feeling!
