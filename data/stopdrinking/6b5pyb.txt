Somehow I've been sober for 90 days. That's longer than I've ever been sober before. I have my higher power to thank for that whatever my higher power may be. And my sponsor who I adore...I've learned a lot these past three months. I've stopped being as reactive I've started being more open. I've learned a lot about honesty. I've definitely noticed a change in myself. Not only is my body healthier but so is my mind. I'm actually starting to like myself. It's such a foreign concept yet it's happening. Slowly but still happening...I just wanted to check in here on the sub. For everyone who is struggling in those first few days or weeks it does get better. I know when I first started I couldn't imagine two weeks let alone three months. Yet I was still saying "I will never drink again." My attitude is different now. I won't drink today. Tomorrow is another day...Yesterday is past and tomorrow isn't here yet. All I have is today so I will be the best person that I can be today...I will not drink or use today.
