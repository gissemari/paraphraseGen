Hi everyone. I'm really trying to stay sober. I'm really bad at writing anything interesting. Yesterday after I got dumped I decided it's really a good time to try to be sober. I'm only 24. I'm trying to get better now but it's freaking hard! It's really hard to not just go to the liquor store and buy alcohol. Anyway today is my day 2 and it's been a really hard struggle. Just wanted to share and I'm grateful for this community.

24 was when I started drinking heavily.  First job out of school. Disposable income. The young party lifestyle that everyone expects out of you.  If I had saved all the money I spent on drinks I'd be a millionaire.  You're making the right decision. I'm 33 btw. 
Congrats :) I am at 72 hours! Hang in there think of people who prefer you sober and how it will male them feel
