My girlfriend and I broke up and I am coping by drinking I need to stop and want to stop.  I don't know what to do but the drinking makes me feel better but I know it's something I shouldn't be doing.

I'm sorry to hear about your break up. Drinking only makes you feel better in the short term but it doesn't help you get betting in the long term. ..I had a break up a little over a half ago and it prompted me to start drinking heavily again to cope. In truth it only prolonged the pain its only now that I've gotten sober that I'm starting to work through some of those issues and the hurt. We're all here for you when you make the choice to control your drinking. Good luck!!
AA helped me stay sober 24 hours at a time. Now I'm here 1yr and 8months later enjoying life more than ever...One day at a time we do recover. ..Get help now you never need to feel this way again
I think I am going to go to a meeting. And use this sub daily. I can't fall into drinking to deal with this. Thank you for the support and advice it's means a lot.
Breakup? Hit the gym. Beat the streets put on the running shoes. Get back to school or study harder if you are already in it. Now is not the time to rest on your laurels it's the time to focus on making you a better you. Alcohol won't help you there friend. It'll numb the pain but the pain won't go away. You'll have to face that demon again best to be a better person when you do. I won't drink with you today.
