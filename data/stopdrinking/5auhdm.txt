I have only recently made the decision to stop drinking which is the right choice for me but not something I'm asking others to embrace. So far being around friends and family boozing and going to bars for a ginger ale hasn't been an issue for me but I am starting to find myself judging others habits and I'm not sure how to temper it. My SO works in the service industry and called out today after celebrating his 31st a little too long and hard last night. I get that its a completely different  world of drinking when your best friends are bartenders  and in theory a birthday celebration is the exception rather than the norm but my internal reaction is screaming  what the heck?! Skipping work to recover seems like a huge red flag to look at your life but it's not for me to say and I'm hyper sensitive about being a preachy zealot at 2 months sober. For those of you that have struggled with recognizing substance abuse problems in your friends and family could you share some of your experiences on how you handled it?

Moment of silence for those still suffering the throws of any addiction. Taking a deep breath to stay calm in order to be of the best help should the opportunity so beautifully present itself. Knowing to remove myself from any situation if it will be a detriment to my safety my sanity my sobriety.

That's a touchy situation... were you in a similar situation when you were drinking? If you can relate if you were in a similar position before then try to be understanding. ..If someone is going to stop drinking and they have a problem they need to make the decision for themselves. And it'll take every drink until their last before they come to that conclusion.
