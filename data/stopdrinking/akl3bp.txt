I've been eating all sorts of processed food over the last two years - partly due to struggling with work bullying and that could be the reason why I'm now craving the good stuff. But I wondered if it's also a by-product of withdrawal. I can't even face the rubbish I used to eat.

Specifically sushi. Yup. I'm in the small minority of those trying to quit drinking but I still smoke weed. The hunger cravings are unreal...I physically can't eat anything till 4-5pm though regardless of how much I smoke. I'm still on week 1. I keep resetting after 2 weeks because I think I have it under control lol
Absolutely! I've been craving specifically fresh fruit! 
Just noticed that I've got a badge and it's wrong  
Don't listen to me. Quitting the proper way takes WAY more resolve and brain power. I envy you people who can cut the spirits out without substituting something else in place of it.
