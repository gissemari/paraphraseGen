I've been lurking this subreddit for nearly a year as I began to try and get sober in August 2016 and was sober for nearly a month but relapsed for a solid few months sober again relapse so on and so forth.  It's truly been a battle...I feel like I'm getting better even though after relapsing I feel completely defeated.  For the past several months I've done longer and longer stretches of sobriety.  But I'm ready for it to finally be a continuous unbroken stretch.  And so I'm here.  I will not drink today.

I am sorry you are struggling. Without help I would never have made it. A therapist got me started on the road to recovery. Going to AA meetings puts me in touch with people who understood. They gave guidance hope and friendship. I hope you will find a support system.
Glad you're here!
