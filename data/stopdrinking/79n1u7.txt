I've been struggling with alcohol abuse for years and feel ashamed for having to hide it from my girlfriend. Last night I had empty bottles stashed in my backpack and she could hear them clanging when I moved it. She gave me a strange look and asked if I had glass bottles in my bag and I outright lied to her and said: "No of course not ... it was nothing." Damn why do I keep doing this? I know that I am not a liar but this has turned me into a real asshole. I became rude and defensive with her and she told me I was "acting weird" because I was trying to hide the fact that I was drunk. ..I will say I do not drink at near the level I used to and don't drink every night. But when I do drink I just overindulge every time. I want to completely quit. I want to be one of those individuals that can work through stress without a crutch. Alcohol is obviously not making me happy. I am a college student and work full time. Took an online exam practically wasted and pretty much bombed it. Looking back at this morning I see the silly and stupid mistakes that I made. Wow if I had been clear-mined and sober I would have passed it no problem. ..In 2015 I wrecked and totaled my car and was arrested with DUI. It was an arduous and expensive journey through the court system and I was required to take mandatory alcohol education classes at the time. Obviously it wasn't enough to make me cease and desist this insidious drug. As much I want to envy those "lucky normal drinkers" I just don't have the will power and self control. Therefore I need to stop this BS. I am considering going to some substance abuse counseling at my college. I use the excuse that I don't have time to do this ... then again I have plenty of time to waste indulging. So no excuses! ..Thanks for listening :-) .alienagent007

Man that is tough.  I lied waaaay too much when I was drinking too.  The gift of not having to hide or be sneaky is a definite benefit of sobriety...I will not drink with you today!
