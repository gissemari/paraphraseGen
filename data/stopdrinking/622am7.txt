It seems I can just sit on my computer watching documentaries and reading for hours on end when there are chores and jobs and things to do.  I've always struggled with procrastination and then go into blitz hi speed mode and just get done in time.   I have a lot of goals and hobbies lined up and so I think I'm literally going to draw up a schedule to follow.  I won't drink with you today.

Oh absolutely this is me all over. Post-it note lists have become my best friend. Very specific lists with details and time frames- "Read 50 pages of &lt;book title&gt; today" rather than "Try and read more this year" or "Eat five fruit and veg and take vit d pill today" as opposed to "Try and be healthier". I break things down into small doable steps and find it much easier to get things done and find the satisfaction from crossing things off really helps. Keep things in manageable doses and things really can build up in terms of progress. 
This is me for sure.  I've gotten a lot better at procrastination in the past couple years though.  I need to set time limits for things.  If I need something done by Friday I might set a deadline of Tuesday.  My time is scheduled now for the most part.  I defenitely schedule in down time though.
Oh man I'm bad at getting things started. One time I waited 2 years to get sober :)
Yes. I've had terrible motivation ever since getting sober. (not that getting sober ruined my motivation but I just can't blame my apathy on booze any more) I'm trying to regain it but everything feels like mountain climbing. Even the smallest thing. I think drawing up a schedule is a good idea. I need to do the same thing :)

absolutely.  The last few weeks has changed for me as I want to get things done before I relax.  Before it was any excuse not to do anything.
Yes!!!  There are several threads that are touching on this topic.  One of them had an interesting link related to the topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/61vu5x/lpt_stress_management_lessons_learned_from_a_usaf/ ..
I think it's the lack of dopamine.
