My stomach just did a few excited flips at the realization I am at 90 goddamn days! Good lord this has been a struggle and I've had to get so real with my life which we drinkers HATE to do. Stopping drinking sure as hell doesn't fix anything (besides saying goodbye to wicked hangovers) but it has freed up my cycle of self-hatred anxiety and guilt so that I can see my life more clearly and take steps to change the things that don't work for me...No more anesthetizing myself daily with that handy dandy poison. By ditching the booze I have opened my eyes to the parts of my life that I have been trying to hide from. Though there are tonnes of things that I don't want to see I now know sticking my head in the sand doesn't fix a thing. It sucks but at least it's real and now I have a shot at making my demons shut the F up...It ain't easy but I'm so glad and proud that I have opened up my eyes. No more hiding.
