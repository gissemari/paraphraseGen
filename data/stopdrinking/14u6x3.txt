Easy Quit Easy Relapse?..*Another Wall-O'-Text^  from Ambivalent_Fanatic*.***..For many of us those first days of sobriety were the hardest and it got easier as time went on.  But there's another group I don't see mentioned on here much a group I used to belong to many years ago: those for whom the first days of sobriety are the easiest.  Actually I do see them mentioned a lot but they go by another name: the frequent relapsers.  This post is for you my friends because for a very long time I was one of you but I'm not any more.  At least not today.  ..While the memory of the latest debacle or embarrassment a pissed-upon bed a bloodied nose an overnight trip to jail or maybe just the worst hangover of all time is still fresh in our minds it's easy to swear off drinking forever.  For some it may even stick.  I knew a guy in college who got very drunk one night threw up everywhere and had to be stripped down and tossed in the shower.  Over twenty years later he's still not touched another drop of alcohol.  ..Should this kind of person really worry about their drinking?  No one can say.  No one can tell you whether you're an alcoholic or not. Except you that is.  It really is completely up to you...But for those of us who are alcoholics alcoholism meaning not drinks-under-bridge-and-lives-in-box but someone who has the tendency to remain obsessed with alcohol despite the harm it does who can't stop after one who rationalizes drinking constantly etc. this early determination can fade after a few days weeks or months.  Then we think "Well I got that licked I just need to remember to be a grown-up about it and not get out of hand again."..You'll notice I said above that this is a group I *used to* belong to.  Throughout my twenties and well into my thirties I didn't think of myself as an alcoholic.  Of course not!  That would have been too depressing.  I was just a partier who knew when to take a few days off and let his system reset to normal before overdoing it again.  I quit drinking dozens of times but it never lasted.  Within days I was back at it...So how did that work out for me?..Fast forward to age 39:  I'm 70 pounds overweight I hate myself my children are starting to notice Daddy talks funny at night I have no ambition I have to gobble ten bucks' worth of pharmaceuticals just to function in the morning my life is heading into the toilet and my wife is sitting across from me saying if I don't quit she's gonna leave me and take the children.  Woohoo!  Fun times!  Party on dude!  ..If you know alcohol has done you damage if you have vowed to quit but can't make it stick what can you do about it?  How do you maintain the perspective that allowed you to stop in the first place?  How do we keep from forgetting how horrible alcohol makes us feel?..The answer is: through some personal inner work.  We have to work on ourselves.  We have to talk to other alcoholics to remind ourselves of what is was like and this may mean admitting we are alcoholics too.  This is a very hard step for most people.  They hate the label and the associations.  Don't like the word?  Fine!  You never have to use it again if you don't want to.  All that matters is the meaning behind it.  ..If alcohol is controlling any aspect of your life alcoholism is very likely an issue for you.  Getting over that resistance and simply admitting this is true is the first step toward recovering your independence from this pernicious debilitating poison.  If the early days are easy for you great.  The rest of your time can be easy too if you want it to be.  You just have to do regular work...**TLDR:  If you wanna stay quit talk to other quitters.**

Good write up thanks. Someday I should write something for my group Hard Quit Easy Relapse. Har har. ..But seriously thanks for putting this out there. I bet it will speak to a lot of the newcomers. (Hi newcomers! (Of which I am one!))
I'm definitely guilty of the easy relapse. It usually goes.....Wake up feel terrible want to get sober go to class hold onto my 24 hour chip bite it rub my thumb on it really hard go home get text from best friend pick him up pick up vodka pick up beers drink drive drunk pass out. Repeat infinitely.
I had an easy quit. Will I relapse? I've made it 10 months; I don't see how I couldn't just as easily do 10 years. ..Here's why: ..Occasionally the thought pops into my head that maybe I'm not an alcoholic.  .Maybe if I'm not an alcoholic I'm just a "problem drinker."  .Maybe if I'm just a "problem drinker" I can learn to moderate.  .Maybe if I can learn to moderate me and alcohol can live happily ever after.  ..So am I willing to risk the rest of my life on "maybe?"  .The answer is always no.
&gt;How do we keep from forgetting how horrible alcohol makes us feel?. .Constantly writing about it for me... but there were some fun times too. Actually some damn ugly ones mirrored by some damn awesome ones.. .The thing is there's a risk factor. My bottom hit hard but I didn't even know it *until I became sober*. Yep looked back. Even with the good that **bad** was really **bad** not worth the good. Or maybe it was for a learning lesson. But the brain tends to forget the bad. The "good old days" are remembered because our minds *want* to forget the bad that's the way our mind protects itself. We wall it up. Even after breaking down the walls we tend to re-wall it up but after we forgive ourselves of it *it's still there* and we made mistakes and we have to constantly remember them.. .There is no final penance. It's something we have to live with. It sucks but we have to remember it constantly or else we'll relapse.. .I quit easily. I didn't stay sober however without a LOT of help from others. I think the first few weeks were fine. It was around the 6mo mark that I started to go insane I think the point where the body starts realizing that the habit is gone and the little red devil on the shoulder is really making noise. Easy to quit so easy to relapse... but that could be said of anything too.. .Hard to quit easy to relapse too. This morning I could really use a drink but it's not going to help me at all so I'm not. It's like that every once and a while almost... the demons get louder and louder though infrequent. . .Handling the holiday parties is easy because when I had a problem it wasn't when I went out... I was usually the designated driver. I would socialize while sober. If someone else was driving I'd still stay sober because that designated driver usually wound up drinking one or three or a dozen anyway. My problem was drinking by myself when I didn't have to go anywhere so my problem is my own selfishness.. .I also quit out of selfishness; I didn't care about anything else but if shit was gonna go down in my life it was going to happen while I was sober not drinking. So that's my drive to stay sober.
Thanks AF! I really needed to hear this this morning! 
I've never tried to quit before but I have failed multiple times at moderation.  I think you're advice about staying quit involves talking to other quitters is wise wise wise advice.  That's why I'm here.  Don't want to go down that road.

Sometimes I drink like a gentlemen. Sometimes I drink 8 beers on a weeknight. I'm happier when I'm sober but I felt like I was missing out. Now I feel like I'm missing out on life because I'm drinking too much. maybe it's time for another streak of sobriety.
Thanks. I'm in that group... quitting is (relatively) easy starting again is even easier. It's clear I have a crapload of personal work to do. 
Thanks for the thoughts...A couple of nuggets that have stuck with me.....**"How do you know you've reached your bottom? You quit digging."**.I know that some "high bottom drunks" are afraid that their foundation will heave because they did not dig below the frost line. I don't think that is necessary. I know some folks who were smart enough to see the trends and patterns seek help and prevent a lot of the "yets" that we hear about. (I haven't lost my job/gone to jail/been homeless... YET!) Me? I had to try every available half measure and overcome a ton of denial to get to my bottom...The thing I ask everyone when they come back after a relapse.....**"What are you going to do differently this time?"** .If your relapsed taught you what did NOT work it was worth it. If you keep doing the same thing expecting different results well we all know what that means.
Here is why I feel very humble and drawn to stay within the next 24 hours...The first time around I began with all the false starts you are talking about: five days sober two days drinking and then the other way around.  I eventually hit the bottom and got sober for almost 12 years. It is what happened next that I find frightening: I stopped caring. My life turned around money came back but there was still a big void so I just gave in. I just thought: the hell with this; I am an alcoholic and what an alcoholic does is to drink alcohol. And I became a functionnal alcoholic...I don't see this as relapsing. I see it as collapsing. I knew I would hit the wall. Hell I could see the wall coming right at me. But alcohol was stronger. I knew I would eventually have to stop but kept getting wasted one-day-at-a-time. I was never into drugs but sometime I feel that alcohol was for me what heroin is for some people. Just guessing of course...I stopped because I had sincerely no place to go. I heard a guy in a AA meeting who said that it felt he had been living on the Moon surrounded by grey rocks and pale dust. I think we were neighbors...I surrendered to AA and  have let these folks pick me up. I am listening to them and I listen to you. I thank my higher power every day for the opportunity it gives me to live and I thank myself every night for not giving up. The only small edge I have over a drunk is the fact that for me  not drinking today will be a little easier because I did not drink yesterday. I have to be thankful.
