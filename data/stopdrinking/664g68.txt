I am glad you are back.  Good luck.
Welcome back.  ..I had a similar experience where I would stop for an extended period (extended for me at the time anyway) - around 45 days once and 70 days another time and each time when I went back to drinking things were worse.  ..I definitely believe trying to quit made my drinking worse because I knew the end was nearing so I was trying to "get it all in" so to speak and would justify over-drinking since "I was quitting."..That said each of those extended periods taught me things that I was able to use when I finally quit for real...Good luck!
Good luck. Race you back to 104!
