This is the first time I've gone more than a few days without any booze in...well as far as I can remember. I wasn't binge drinking every day/night but in times of great stress (e.g. certain periods in the past couple months just started grad school) I was drinking up to half a bottle of liquor or 4-6 strong beers per night alone. On weekends I'd throw 'em back in the company of friends you know the old "Everybody's doing it so it's okay!" ..For me though it's been a problem. Alcohol interfered with academics relationships and leading a generally stable life. Each day I woke up so ashamed. Tired embarrassed clammy anxious depressed. Sad that I was letting my boyfriend down my family down my friends down not being there for them or being too drunk to take their phone calls or communicate properly. ..In these past seven days I've noticed a few changes. Mentally I feel more consistent/stable than I have in a while. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life and obviously booze does nothing to help with that. But since November 1 I've been running cooking eating well (way more than usual actually I suppose that's because I'm not too busy downing booze to eat...hopefully it'll level off!) communicating clearly with friends and family completing my assigned coursework thinking of ways to better myself. Just being a "regular person" something which had at times felt entirely out of reach. Molehills are no longer the mountains I'd been making them out to be. This week I have felt proud instead of ashamed satisfied instead of overwhelmed/suicidal.  ..I was planning to keep the sobriety up for just a few weeks to "get back on track" but now I'm wondering if it's even worth going back. At the very least I want to be more mindful of the role booze plays in my life and this time is offering me valuable perspective in that department. ..Right now I get knots in my stomach just thinking about booze. And while the *idea* of cracking a brew and watching the world burn during the election results tonight sounds fun when I actually think it through I realize it wouldn't make my evening feel any more complete...Anyway thanks so much. This is a lovely community. I've popped in a few times in the past couple years but never posted. It's a great resource and I commend each and every one of you for putting your best foot (feet?) forward!..PS: Oh and TMI but I've been experiencing some constipation for the first time in my life. I Googled it and apparently that's a normal side effect. Sexy as fuq.

A strong beer is like 250 calories. So eating more is to be expected and normal. You've suddenly cut your daily caloric intake in half and your body is demanding you replace those missing calories. I am almost a week in myself and also noticing that I'm eating more mainly that I am actually eating breakfast now every day for the first time since I started drinking 10+ years ago.
Nice work on a week!
