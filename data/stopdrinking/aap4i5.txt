Going through old notes today and ran across a sheet entitled "The vicious cycle of addiction." Yup.  I know it well.   I believe this is from Dr. Valerie Mason-John co-founder of Eight Step Recovery...Trigger - e.g. fight with spouse.Feeling tone - unpleasant (tension knot in stomach).Thoughts - get me out of here I don't want to be here I need a drink.Emotions - anger resentment frustration irritation.Thinking - what's the point I've been doing my best I may as well just (do whatever).Actions - we pick up our choice of distraction. .Gain - temporary relief from the discomfort that has been arising.Cost - actions have consequences you've lost sobriety of mind guild anger with self. With each trip the costs get higher. With relapse the costs can be huge. ..The place we can step off is at feeling tone.   Feeling is going to arise. But feelings don't have to lure us if we turn toward the feeling and the body and begin to pause. We may catch a thought (Everybody has arguments it's really okay;  maybe I just need to sit down and take a pause.)  This is where we can stop the cycle.

This is a central tenet of Buddhism which I find interesting.
Saved. Thank you.
