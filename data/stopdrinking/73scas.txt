And raise you a day sober. I'm inspired by each of you out there whether you are resetting starting day one or at day five hundred and one. We are in this together. A week and a half ago I was panicking berating myself hating myself and wanting to quit. But I was scared. I would buy a bottle to "taper" with drink it all and try again the next day. I had 6 days before a Saturday relapse but now I know I can get through those first tough days and I'm ready for day two again. We got this. Love you folks

Nice job! Yup we've got this. Love you too!
It feels so good to be awake and sober and not hating myself!  Lol who knew?! I stayed up too late and my new internal alarm is set to "early" but i got through those first days and you can too! 
Well done. Feels amazing doesn't it!?
