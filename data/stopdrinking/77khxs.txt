Drinking water right now but I really want to just get a drink. I'm feeling overwhelmed with anxiety from work and home life. Texted a few people but no responses back so far. Struggling at the moment.

Ginger Beer or something sugary. You'll get a quick hit which might be enough to qualm the cravings. Good luck.
Play the tape forward. Think about how you will feel in the morning. I won't drink with you tonight! 
May I ask why you're in the bar? It's impossible for me not to drink in a bar so I absolutely avoid them unless I know I'm determined to sink alcohol.
Congratulations on 35 Days :-)..Don't it will solve absolutely nothing &amp; you know it. You have stayed strong for 35 days. Stay strong for day 36. Get out of that bar &amp; go to a cafe instead. I will not drink with you today.
Uhhh get out of the bar! 35 days sober would be way to soon for me to test that water! Come on man... Get up! Go! Apparently drinking is something you have decided against right now. Why temple that decision so soon?
Thank all of you for your support and advice and kindness. I left the bar without drinking! Day 36 on the horizon!
