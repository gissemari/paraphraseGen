[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** For so long I hated having a drinking problem and I was frightened by it. It made me feel so much  less than  people who did not struggle with alcohol like there was something fundamentally wrong with me. But lately I have truly begun to believe that without this terrible problem (which nearly killed me) I would never have discovered that I have deep reserves of strength that I never even knew about. ..Recently I was reading a book called *Born This Way* and a gay man who as a teenager was overwhelmed with shame and had torn up all the photos of himself in drag now has one prominently framed in his home. In the book he writes  It's a daily reminder to be true to yourself and that what you fear most in yourself can one day become your greatest gift and source of strength. ..**Struggle:** The nearest big supermarket to my house is a bus ride down a steep hill. Then after my shopping I have to get back onto the bus laden with bags of groceries. It's a huge chore and I feel ridiculous trying not to overflow into the other passengers' space with all my stuff...**General:**  It's too early. I never eat December snowflakes. I always wait until January.   Lucy van Pelt *Peanuts*.
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph.I had an interview on Monday it was crazy difficult and i didn't get the job but i wasn't disappointed - i was impressed I got the interview anyway and it all seemed a bit too corporate for me. And I'm working towards a promotion at work so it was a win/win situation for once!   ..Struggle.I managed to randomly wake up in the middle of the night and it took ages to get back to sleep. How nice that this Wednesday my biggest struggle is a lack of sleep! ..General.My boyfriend is ill and I feel guilty that I'm not. How silly is that!?   damn my excellent immune system! ..On a more serious note since i started taking the gym seriously a few years ago and even more since i started cutting down drinking/quit smoking i just don't get bloody ill EVER.   
**Triumph:** Bought christmas booze for other people and wasn't even slightly tempted to buy some for myself...**Struggle:** Slightly worried about making it through the christmas night out without drinking. Am sure once the booze flows people will try to tempt me and I don't want to lose my temper and cause tension...**General:** Listening to old Linkin Park tracks and finding that the same old lyrics now resonate with me and my situation in new ways. I know Chester battled with Alcohol &amp; Drug abuse for years and wonder how often the lyrics struck home for him even when it wasn't him that wrote them.
u/sfgirlmary if I was anywhere near you I'd pick you up and take you shopping and wherever else you wanted to go in a heartbeat so you don't have to take that damn bus! Hmmm ya know a girls road trip isn't a bad idea! ;) (And since we both like Marley we wouldn't even argue over the radio station lol!!!)...**Triumph:**    K and I hosted our first Christmas party where our families met for the first time - everyone hit it off fabulously and it went great!..**Struggle:**    I have come to find that something very serious took place completely behind my back just before I got sober. It's a matter that may actually sever relationships. K is my rock and is supporting me (in ways I could never even imagine) 100%. I'm going to need all the protection I can get to muster up the strength get through some extremely uncomfortable conversations and hopefully set things straight. It's so stressful that I'm grinding my jaw at night and have been getting constant headaches. But ya know what? I won't drink over it. **FUCK THAT**. I'm going to *do the right thing*...**General:**    Why is it that as an alcoholic I feel so undeserving sometimes? Why can't I just stand up and **fight** instead of feeling guilty for being drunk all those years???
Triumph: I beat very strong urges to drink yesterday. My reward was a great nights sleep. I slept for 8 hours woke up refreshed a half hour before my alarm was set to go off. Have time for a snowy walk my my daughter and dog before work...Struggle: I am on day 3 so the urge to drink is very present. The longest I have been without alcohol in the past year was two weeks. I am determined to make sobriety stick this time. I do not expect sobriety to bring miracles but do want to find out what I am capable of without alcohol in my life. ..General: My birthday is Friday. Going to be 41. Looking forward to making it the first alcohol free once since I was 20. ..Thank you for being here SD!  
Congrats on day 3!  I need to reset because that's where I am (again). I just turned 51. Really proud of you for taking the step. When you fight through successfully you will have saved TEN more years of your life than in did. That would be amazing. Go for it!.
Triumph: having strong urges lately and I've recognized them for what they are (sometimes it takes a minute to realize why I feel so anxious/angry/weepy) and used my tools and lo the tools worked. .Struggle: freakin urges. .General: I'm in a cabin in the woods listening to rain on the roof snug in bed in the quiet predawn hours this Wednesday before Christmas. 
Triumph: the last 2.5 weeks of daily hard work at the gym are starting to pay off big time. Starting to look pretty guddddd right out of the shower and I'm damn proud of kicking that beergut in the ass..Struggle: Lonely..I need friends who don't drink.
Not drinking with you today
&gt; It's a daily reminder to be true to yourself and that what you fear most in yourself can one day become your greatest gift and source of strength. ..This is a great quote. Thanks for sharing. ..You do you. Shopping is just shopping. :) It sucks I know the struggle but you do get through it every time and there is so much space in the world. The space you and your shopping occupy for a few moments in that bus are rightfully yours!..**Triumph:** Deciding to quit drinking. It's been a part of my life for so long but now that my eyes are open I can't believe I didn't quit earlier. It's just so *normalized* but there is nothing normal about it. Not to me. Not when it becomes me and takes my time my money. Especially not after taking my father. For a long time I did it ironically to be closer to him. Because that's what he did. Now I want to honor him by doing what he couldn't. Quitting drink. ..**Struggle:** Getting through the Holidays/Putting my own needs first. Christmas parties man... *sigh*. Putting my needs first is important and a struggle. Other people don't seem to think it's a big deal not even the people that have said my drinking is troublesome. They say one drink can't hurt. A few can't hurt. On special occasions it certainly can't hurt right? It's just that I need to drink *less* they say. So I spend a lot of time thinking of these interactions and dreading them. But they don't matter. What matters is my decision to quit. I don't want to drink. *no not even one* and you may disagree that's fine but it's my decision what I do with my time money and body. End of discussion. :) ..**General:** This passage from Stephen King's 'On Writing' was one of the things that woke me up to my problem. It struck so many chords and made me realize I needed to take a closer look at my drinking behavior. .."A friend of mine who has been through this tells an amusing story about his first tentative effort to get a grip on his increasingly slippery life. He went to a counsellor and said his wife was worried that he was drinking too much. "How much do you drink?" the counsellor asked. My friend looked at the counsellor with disbelief. **"All of it"** he said as if that should have been self-evident. I know how he felt. It's been almost twelve years since I took a drink and I'm still struck by disbelief when I see someone in a restaurant with a half-finished glass of wine near at hand. I want to get up go over and yell  Finish that! Why don't you finish that?  into his or her face. **I found the idea of social drinking ludicrous - if you didn't want to get drunk why not just have a coke?"**..That last line especially made me realize my behavior was not normal. If I drink it's to get drunk period. And that should never be the goal of anything. To have my inhibitions lowered my memory broken thoughts dulled body poisoned. For what? And that's why *no I can't have just one*. ..Turned into a really long post it helps me work out a lot of stuff writing it down. To anyone reading thank you. I will not drink with you today. ..
Triumph: This afternoon Wednesday December 20 marks two weeks since my last taste or consumption of alcohol. I am truly proud of myself...Struggle: I can feel myself having to deal with stressful feelings and irritations that at one time I would address by having a drink or by sitting down to "happy hour" (translation: sedative hour) and that now I must address some other way. I need to find those ways such as walking or some other form of exercise perhaps or yoga or meditation or something.
Happy hump day y'all!..My triumph: Monday a coworker gave me a gift she had made. It's a thing to hang on the wall that says  how to tell time  and 2 coffee cups where it says AM and 2 wine glasses where it says PM. Cute idea but kind of ugly lol. Anyway I didn't want to upset her but I was honest. I said  look thank you so much but I've quit drinking so I don't think I can hang that up  and she was totally cool about it. Found it another home. ..Struggle: the gods have seen fit to reward my sobriety with a December cold. Really putting a wrench in my plans to work out almost every day which sucks because I hate forcing myself to rest. ..General: super looking forward to xmas with my husband and kids. We are getting a Nintendo switch and I plan to kick all their asses at Mario kart   
**Triumph:** I can feel myself getting stronger every day and I love it! I'm working on harder climbing problems than I was five weeks ago and on my ride home last night I didn't stop once going up the hill (except for traffic lights)! Not drinking is doing right by me. ..**Struggle:** I'm tired from baking after work last night. I'm bringing two pies to our Christmas potluck and one of the pies needed two hours to cool before refrigerating it. Fortunately I have coffee with me!..**General:** I rejoined Tinder last night. I've been feeling lonely so I'm giving it another shot. I won't take it too seriously; if I meet someone great. If not oh well.
**Triumph:** Lately I've been going to bed before 10:00 not drinking a drop reading a lot and listening to interesting podcasts and going to the gym 3-4 times/week as well as some off-season running. Yesterday my wife remarked that I've become *super* boring lately and I took it as a compliment. I'm not sure it was meant that way. I've come to the realization that excitement is not happiness and that boring has a lot going for it...**Struggle:** Life's struggles just carry right on after you drop alcohol. My happiness has always been conditional on "something". A new job having more money having a nice big house having children etc. But this feeling of life being unsatisfactory persists following each of these accomplishments. It's the same for sobriety. I'm doing the thing that I said would make me happy and in some ways it has but I'm still not at a place where my happiness is unconditional. I'm still looking for an external thing to happen to reach this state of mind and this is the ultimate misconception about how the human mind works...**General:** Binged-watched all of Shameless (US) recently and I would have thought that all the drinking would have triggered me. But it really makes alcoholism seem incredibly pathetic even thought Frank constantly glorifies it. Enjoyed watching all the depravity while drinking green tea and munching on baby carrots. 
Hey everyone! New here!..Triumph: I stumbled across this place by accident.  It's supportive and informative from what I can tell and I need that. ..Challenge: I'm here for an obvious reason. I have been using alcohol to self medicate for anxiety and I need to get better. One day sober is better than no days I guess. I want to make it a lot more days and I'm worried I will struggle more. ..General: Work was hard today but I had this realization that I signed up for what I'm doing and it's really not that bad. I'm actually very happy at work for the first time in a long time. ..Thanks in advance; I know your support will be priceless  
triumph - down 15 lbs over last two months.struggle - telling kids tonight that we're divorcing.general - oddly/sadly I'm the most hopeful I've been in years..I will NOT drink w/you today!
Boom! Feeling so good! I will not be drinking with you today!
Triumph: Staying with my parents and helping out a lot with Christmas prep. I feel excited to be a better daughter for them. They used to worry so much...Struggle: I'm trying to edit some writing I've done...but mostly just getting distracted/avoiding it instead. I've always told myself I want to be a writer but why do I feel so miserable doing it lately?..General: My family is mostly vegetarian (or at least pescatarian). I am a meat eater though I don't eat meat every day. I might start tracking my intake more. I'd probably eat more veggies if I didn't always focus on the meat main. Burgers are just so good...
**Triumph:** I run a weekly meeting that people say helps them. People reach out to me for advice and support. Being that person is not my self-identity and it still catches me off guard and amazes me...**Struggle:** One and half more weeks of house guests. Holy fuck does adding two people who can't and won't communicate into the mix make everything so much more complicated...**General:** [Looking At The World From The Bottom Of A Well](https://youtu.be/NSNuqX3EY70). It's so good to have climbed out and have a bigger view.
T:  Going back to bed and sleeping until I feel like it  (or i have to pick up my daughter)...S:  Not really a big fan of xmas.  I don't really like the consumerist aspect of it...G:  After finishing the semester  I thought I'd be happy and ecstatic but instead i feel weird without the massive amount of pressure on my back.  I definitely feel less stressed but it's almost like i miss it.  
Triumph: day 3 of sobriety! I didn't need as much moisturizer this morning. My fine lines are even finer. I didn't need "clear eyes". My eyes are not glassy. I don't have a headache. I have eaten cleaner without the desire for junk foods. I've had a liter of water already today and my liver and kidneys are thankful for it. My girlfriend has forgiven me. ..Struggle: incredible guilt and embarrassment over my actions from the weekend. Worried about how I will face mutual friends and when to apologize. I will take this day by day. I want to show them that I am making a real effort to change. ..General:  thankful for the inspirational people in this sub. It gives me strength knowing I am not a freak of nature   .
**Triumph:** Another day sober..**Struggle:** Politics..**General:**  The first snow fell last night.  Now it's raining again but it was pretty.  
Triumph: Successfully navigated anxiety this week on a daily basis caused by meds. Tapering off has been better than I thought so far (day 3 today)...Struggle: Was so close to drinking beer in order to calm the body. As soon as I gave myself the permission to drink rather than have a panic attack it brought a lot mental relief. Then each hour along the way I would say to myself: *I can drink but do I need to right now? Do I want to? Can I go another few hours?* It's working for me...General: I spent 8 hours -- yes 8 -- at the hairdresser someone I know pretty well. I kid you not it was surreal I was there until midnight. After it was done low and behold my hair looked greyish instead of blondish. Well at least I know what I'd look like with grey hair -- and I'm not a cool young hipster I'm a sort of cool 40-something. (He's going to fix it tho).
**Triumph:** Made it through the holidays (early) with my family and avoided drinking my favorite Swedish mulled wine drink (glogg).  Funnily enough all of the older folks were the boozers and those of us in the 30s to 40s barely drank or didn't drink at all...**Struggle:** I tried a sip of port to see if it tasted as good as I remember.  Contemplated resetting my badge because of this but honestly this was more of a triumph in that I kept having that little voice in the back of my head lately wondering if I could have "just one" after all of this time.  I tried that sip and wonder of wonders it didn't taste delicious like I remembered and it shut up the voice because now I know I don't want a drink because it's really not as good as I was convincing myself it was.  It actually reaffirmed my desire to stay sober...**General:** And because of that sip I had nasty drinking dreams that really reinforced how very much I want to stay sober.  Blech.
Triumph:  I'm 10 pounds away from my goal weight of 165 haven't changed much in the diet catagory but I do own a house with a lot of stairs and it's been keeping me busy.  ..Struggle:  This is the time of year where my urges get the strongest.  Last night I found myself googling a fancy version of jack and I had to stop and think why I am doing this? who is this for? ..General:  The wife's been sick since saturday I'm the worst in these situations I'm pretty much a robot in the real world so I have no idea how to be sympathetic. 
Triumph: The Vikings made the playoffs and I made it through a party with my old college friends without a sip of Alcohol.... and it was actually a good thing I didn't drink because I ended up having to take care of two people who went waaaaay to hard...Struggle: Christmas and Retail.... Ugh...General: Things are getting easier and my head is clearer then it's been in a while. Feels Weird Man. 
Triumph:.Doing things for the first time that have been incredible. New friends new fitness goals best sleep no hangover. Enjoying hobbies and spending time with family. Been doing well staying clean and sober. Some changes at work that I'm hoping will be positive. ..Struggle: .Have to go to inlaws this weekend. Will be ackward. Some possible setbacks in 1/2 marathon training. Some boredom cause it's raining. ..General:.Overall about average right now - some good and some bad. Any problem I had is now easier to confront while sober..
triumph: 100 days!..struggle: work/life balance...general: just really giddy today. don't mind me. :)
My triumph is 3 days of no hangovers and 4 nights of sober sleep for the first time in just under 2 years.  Reduction in anxiety and feeling less fragile health wise. Being able to be out in public with my child going to multiple places without anxiety attacks and feeling faint!  ..Struggle is mostly physical. Another intense splitting headache that woke me up at 5am. Another Excedrin. Dizziness. When I was done with my bicycle ride I was feeling so off and worried my peripheral vision was almost gone/"sparkling" and I've never experienced that before. As a nurse I should know better but I googled it and see: signs if a stroke. Ugh. Feeding the anxiety...In general every day I feel better. I just can't wait to be past all the physical stuff. I just want to be normal. To workout without concerning symptoms. To be out and about and interacting without feeling like dying. 
I will not drink with you today. Thanks all. 
**Triumph:** Business turnover is up about 20% year on year plus more people appear to be showing faith in what I do and asking me to support them. I'm putting plans in place to make 2018 even better too...**Struggle:** Finding time to fit bike rides in. I know if I don't keep fit at some point my mental health will decline...**General:** All my Christmas concerts are done for the year too. I've realised I don't really like Christmas and only used to because it was an excuse to drink.
**Triumph:** I made it to my first AA meeting. Two even! And planning to go back to one later this week. I've been thinking that I need in-person support and I hope this group ends up being the right fit. ..**Struggle:** I'm nervous about identifying as an alcoholic at AA. I know that I can tell myself it's just a formality but I never felt like I  was an alcoholic either. But I definitely quit drinking because I'm better off without the alcohol so I don't know why I am so caught up in the definition/label...**General:** I'm so checked out and just want to lounge on the couch and then celebrate the holidays and start everything fresh in the new year. I'm taking a proper break from work for Christmas week so at least I'll have that!
**Triumph**: I've been working on being less codependent when it comes to my wife's drinking/going out.  I tend to be controlling as well as an enabler which has pretty much not worked and has brought me a lot of stress frustration grief and worry.  But lately it feels like I've made some progress.  I'm disengaging more and letting her be in charge of and responsible for her own actions.  It hasn't been easy but I'm more at peace with it than I used to be and hopefully that will increase as I continue to work on it...**STRUGGLE:**  I caught a cold last week and I'm frustrated because I thought that I wouldn't get sick this year (in the past I blamed getting sick on the fact that I had a weakened immune system and lower tolerance from drinking and not getting good rest).  Also I'm a cycling junkie so when I can't ride I tend to get a little depressed (and the weather has been great for riding here in California which only makes it worse)...**General:** "*Life is like a ten speed bicycle. Most of us have gears we never use.*  - Charles Schulz
TRIUMPH: Not drinking has really amped up my stamina and strength in my spin classes! And they are intense enough to give me a "runner's high" so it's really helped give me that rush without alcohol...STRUGGLE: I'm close with my parents but it's never really been realistic to home even for Christmas. I've always been alone and it's okay for almost all year but it gets tough around this time to not have anyone at all. Interestingly I never turned to alcohol (I was more of an "alcohol when happy" type never when I'm sad) so that's not a temptation but it's just emotionally difficult. ..GENERAL: I'm so thankful to have my dogs by my side though. They are honestly my heart and soul I don't know what I'd do without them.
