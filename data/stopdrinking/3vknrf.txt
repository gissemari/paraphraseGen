I made it through half an evening without drinking then I ordered a beer. When I went to get a second one a friend near the bar sent a whiskey over (my usual drink) and then it was downhill from there. Drugs bad decisions spent too much money. I had doubts about being able to resist and as time passed last night I gradually talked myself into drinking. Hungover today full of regret. I feel more sure that not drinking is a better option for me but I'm struggling with accepting a sober identity. I wish this was easier. I wish I wasn't surrounded by people that drink. I love my friends my community and I don't want to lose them. This place helps though. Thanks for being here.
