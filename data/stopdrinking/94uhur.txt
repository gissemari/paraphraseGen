Greetings sobernauts! I hope you have all had a smashing sober Sunday. It is the end of day 14 for me and I am sober. Today I've been reflecting on the importance of resting. It's so tempting to keep oneself thoroughly busy in early sobriety in order to takes one's mind off the urge to drink. However I'm finding that I'm getting tired very easily. I know that tiredness can be a trigger to relapse so today I came home from church and made the decision to spend the rest of the day doing absolutely nothing. And the result? My batteries are recharged and my mind is peaceful. I've been reading a post or two throughout the day though. Lots of newbies joining our wonderful community I noticed. We are so fortunate to have each other here on SD. There is a wonderful spirit of goodwill amongst us. Anyhow sending you all best wishes especially those of us still struggling:-)

All good. I laugh.. I'm always struggling even though it is an easy struggle. My weakness comes the moment I let my guard down... "I'll buy the Mickey 13 oz won't hurt me" so when I start thinking that I got it made  I'm most vulnerable. So it seems that way for me.
