Six months!..I recently wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7lu7vb/merry_christmas_i_got_you_something/) on a whim at 3 am here on /stopdrinking that garnered a few emotional responses and even got given my first gold (twice). ..Because of that response and the feeling it gave me the feeling that I was actually helping someone out there the feeling like all my struggles and bullshit and lessons might actually be worth something to others... I've begun writing a book to help people stop drinking. ..It tackles the topic from my particular perspective which is one of biological emotional and psychological self-awareness - in other words it's about knowing what is happening to you when you drink and when you get sober so that you can TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for it and navigate your own physical situation. I've been writing all week and I feel very good about the outline I have...There are thousands of books on the topic but /stopdrinking has made me realize that if I help even one person I've done more than I would have if I spent the year drinking...Thanks everyone. I'll post bits and pieces as they finalize and seem relevant. ..Happy New Year!

More details to those wondering where I get off: I'm six months sober since my last drink but my experience and research into alcoholism addiction counseling addiction treatment and my own struggles and street living have all encompassed more than fifteen years of my life. There are classic rookie mistakes many newly-sobers make; and until there is time to progress that's all these statements are going to be to anyone reading this. That's fine. I'll post another section for New Years that I finished last night and we'll go from there. One day at a time.
This is wonderful news! Happy New Year to you too. Best of luck on the book--very much looking forward to reading it.
I am looking forward to reading what you write!  It's very much appreciated!
