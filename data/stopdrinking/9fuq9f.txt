My friends wanted me to go to the bar with them since yesterday was Thirsty Thursday but I came down with a cold. Not gonna lie it's a struggle trying to be sober at the age of 22 all of my friends drink and I get tempted everyday. If I wasn't sick and I actually went out last night most likely would be resetting my badge. I think that was a sign that I'm not ready to be around alcohol even though I'm not drinking anymore. ...IWNDWYT

"Dry people dry places" was what I had to do for the first few months at least.
