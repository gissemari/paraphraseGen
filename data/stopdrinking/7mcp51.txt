I almost wish I could remember exactly when it was. That Christmas was a disaster overall. It was the first one after I left my kid's dad and we were trying to celebrate together but everything about it just felt so off and so wrong and I couldn't stand being around him. We had a huge fight and after it all he had our kid for a couple days and I remember just feeling like such a broken lonely mess. Those few bottles of wine I'd received as gifts wouldn't stop calling my name. So I drank 'em. And many many more since...Alcoholism crept up on me like it does with so many of us. I've struggled with it a lot since then and tried to moderate and failed. Even now four days sober I can't stop thinking about booze. I'm trying to keep busy and remember to take it a day at a time. And it seems to be working. It feels good to start feeling good again...Thanks for being an endless chasm of support in an online community everybody. It helps so much to have someone to stay accountable to when the cravings get bad. I've opened up to so many people in my life now and am overwhelmed by how supportive and great everyone is being. I won't drink with you all tonight!
