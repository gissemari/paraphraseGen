Hey guys..While I've been doing the monthly binge in some failed attempt at self control for the past 9 months I've finally admitted that I can't control this any longer. ..I luckily still have my dream job a woman I love and an apartment that isn't too bad as long as clean it sometime before 2019. I hit my low point though on Friday the 13th as threw up bile from a Thursday afternoon binge and couldn't keep down food. ..My hungover miserable self loathing post relapse self was smart enough to write a letter to the over confident headstrong idiot future self that is now hopefully slightly more self aware. ..I'll share it sometime in the future; maybe at the meeting I'm attending tonight. I can't read it without crying so it might not be my opener to the AA community. Maybe that's the reason it should be. ..Going into work - idle hands and all. ..Cheers

Welcome aboard!..Drunk Me used to leave little notes for Hungover Me too sometimes.....Keep us posted on how you're doing!..IWNDWYT ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
That letter sounds like a good addition to your toolbox for a rainy day. There often comes a time when we forget what our last drink was really like; here you've got it in writing...Have a good meeting tonight. Should you decide to share I'm sure you'll find a very sympathetic audience...Sober cheers to you too!
