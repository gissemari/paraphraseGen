Checking in..I'm 51 days sober today. I stopped drinking in October and it has been with the help of this sub. Other redditors pushed me to go to AA even though I have a real problem with their guidelines. I now go to a group once a week. Iv begun my meditation practice again and keeping myself busy. Most importantly I learned to say no no to going out to the bar no to a quick one before a concert and no when I'm having a no good day...When I'm struggling I come to this sub reddit for support to share stories to offer advice. It has truly been a great outlet and one I will continue to utilize as I start this new adventure and life. Again thank you all!

You've made some great changes in your life.  And heartily second your thought that SD can be such an important part of getting us to a better place.  Hats off to you and to all those SD-folk that play such an important supporting role.
yay for 51 days :) ..has AA helped?
