I had a good streak and relapsed in late December.  I'm back now 3 days alcohol free....  I see some things clearer now...  1.  It would not take me long to go straight back to drinking martinis every night. 2.  It gets physically harder to quite every time you start back and then detox.  3.  Successfully remaining sober for a period of time does give one mental confidence.  4.  I can have a lot of fun while drinking and often have no problems but I can also be at my absolute worst - anger poor decision making violence etc.  5.  The individual moments of my life may not have have the same level of excitement when sober but I enjoy my life better for sure.

If you don't mind me asking? Why do you get angry when drunk? I am curios because when I drink I get happy and helpful. 
I'm glad your back.  I hope you find out what was missing last time so you feel more fulfilled in your sobriety this time.  If it isn't really tempting to leave your new life you must be doing something right... what do you figure?      .Sorry if that's pushy I'm Fish and I'm happy you're here!!! 
I can relate so much to your post. I can quit drinking for a while but end up drinking even when I know the consequences. The time between relapse are getting longer and I'm happy about that but damnit I want to quit for good. It's frustrating 
http://sd.bot.nu/badgedate/ if you need it (I gather it's not easy to find if you're on mobile). I love your fifth point. That has been very true for me and I think part of what makes the difference is being able to remember what I did. :D..Best of luck. I won't drink with you today. Welcome back!
Thank you for sharing. Your post helped me!
