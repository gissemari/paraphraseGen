For those of us in the States the long Labor Day Weekend Holiday is over or slowing to an end. This has been the hardest for me it has been since I started my journey. Going up north to the cottage was always an excuse to grab a case and drink them until the next day and start again. But I can pat my own back because I made it through hanging on the porch swimming at the beach sitting around the fire. More than once I went to the fridge and saw the cold beer and grabbed water instead. VICTORY...To those that made it through and to those that may have tripped; tomorrow is a new day...Sorry to toot my own horn tonight but while my family knows why I quit drinking they don't understand the struggle. So I wanted to talk to the community.

Good job! *pats you on the back*..My boyfriend went to a Labor Day work party tonight but instead I went to AA and am gonna spend the rest of the evening doing yoga and chillin' with our cats. Just gotta take it one day at a time! I'm glad you survived the holiday weekend and here's to surviving many more!
