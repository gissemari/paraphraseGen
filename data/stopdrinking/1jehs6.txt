My addiction has obviously hurt my wife a great deal. The communication over the past week has broken down completely - she is clearly upset and while she assures me I didn't do anything during a blackout that I don't know about (I'd hate myself forever if I got violent) I'm worried about her. I can see that she is struggling to move past the whole terrible episode in our relationship that was my addiction...Now that I'm sober she is still traumatised by it and I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help someone when I'm barely holding myself together as it is...I did my best to make amends for my actions but it feels like it will be impossible to move forward without guilt. I've dragged her into my emotional disaster zone and I don't what I can do now...I can't get any more sober than I already am. I can't do anything more to show that I'm trying to be a better person. But she's still hurt and I don't know how to fix that and fix myself at the same time...Fuck this post is a mess. Sorry.

&gt; I can't get any more sober than I already am. ..Yes you can.  You said that you're barely holding yourself together right now.  Things can get a whole helluvalot better. You also said that you don't know how to "fix yourself" while this is going on. So you realize that you have work to do.  ..It sounds like you expect your wife to flip a switch within herself and repair all the damage that's been done to your relationship.  If it's that easy why don't you do the same thing?  Why don't you flip the same switch you want her to flip?  Why aren't you fixed by now?  ..Because it doesn't work that way. Not for you and not for her either. It is unreasonable of you to expect that she can instantly turn things around. Your drinking affected more than just you. It will take both of you time to recover...It's normal for you to feel guilt over causing these problems. But you have to accept that it's not something you can fix.  The damage has been done. Not all damage can be undone.  And whatever healing is going to happen is going to happen over time...You said in your post that all this bad stuff happened because of your "addiction."  I don't know if you drew that distinction purposely but I hope you're not expecting your wife to come around because "that was my addiction honey not me."  It's true that addiction causes us to do things that we might not otherwise do.  But you can't expect your wife to see it that way.  Besides even if you're right that it was the addiction and not you what assurance does she have that it won't happen again?  After all it's already happened once. And how many promises have you broken?..The best -- and only -- thing you can do is keep fixing yourself.  Live each day as best you can.  Be as kind and gentle as you wish you would have been in the past. Over time you may start to regain her trust.  Over time she may come to believe that the problem is behind you...Whatever you do don't get upset with her if she doesn't react the way you think she should react.  As I said that's unreasonable of you.  Plus all it's going to do is show her that you haven't changed. You're asking her to believe that all of that is behind you when you don't even believe it yourself.  ("I'm barely holding myself together")..34 days sober is fantastic congratulations. You are off to a great start. Keep it up. Keep working at it.  Over time your wife might start to believe that things have changed. And so might you.
