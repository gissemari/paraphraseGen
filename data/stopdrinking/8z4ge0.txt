So I've been sober for nearly 10 months now and I find myself on my first sober holiday as an adult. I'll be honest I'm struggling. ..My daughter has Autism so we go to the same place each year so she can cope with it. This means I'm in the same apartments as every year (So they left us a welcome bottle of wine) and the same taverna where I've always ordered wine (and where they give you free Raki at the end of the meal). Now sitting on the balcony and everything in my head is shouting "This is when you drink wine! Where's the wine?" :(
----------immediate responses--------

Resist - I did it after 3 years off wine and have been trying to stop again ever since.  I am sure it will get easier the longer the holiday goes on...wish I'd practiced what I preach (although with hindsight !)  I will not drink with you today. 
Check my name out please before you drink .I am here due to holiday relapsing 3 times  - it always ends my sobriety- it is my aim to get through a big holiday without drinking- .I've been on a weekend holiday and there's other one this weekend in Devon - .Please don't drink - it will creep back in to your life and ruin you as it did before -.Believe me I know this xxxxxxxx
