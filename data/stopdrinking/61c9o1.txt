A friend just invited me to a kickass gala tonight! Free food & free drinks!! Open bar!!!..And my wife's friend is suddenly staying with us tonight. I have good reasons to hate this person and I do and I'd love to be elsewhere tonight...But I'm not strong enough to go anywhere with an open bar without drinking.  So I told my friend no thanks and I'm staying home for a miserable evening...I'm pissed.  Thirteen days ago I'd have gone and probably had a fine time probably wouldn't have gotten too drunk probably wouldn't have fucked anything up.  Why can't I just go and be normal? Just have a few drinks tonight?..Well I can't. I'm not "normal" and it wouldn't just be tonight--it'd go back to the way it was before I decided to quit and I had good reasons to quit. I can't moderate so I can't drink and I can't go out without drinking so. Ice cream & seltzer for me tonight.

Good for you! Way too many times I convinced myself I could handle one or two. That is the start of the relapse. Get a string of days is so hard. I've spent years getting that first week together!  12 days is something to protect. Again good for you!.
Ice cream &amp; seltzer are my "go-to" as well." and maybe a little Netflix or a game on my phone (slither.io or Mario Run!)
I can relate. I recently quit smoking and a girl out of the blue texted me tonight wanting to hangout. I've had a dry spell for the past 6 months so I was super excited but a massive craving hit me and I can't go out like this. I've got no choice but to decline and pass out or else I'll scare her off with my angryness. Oh well at least it will be more enjoyable than it ever was once I successfully kick the nicotine.
