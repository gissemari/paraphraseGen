I'd hate to say that I was "lucky" to have struggled with a crack addiction in the past but quitting alcohol has been by far the easiest addiction I have ever overcome. Quitting smoking was nuts. Quitting crack was nearly impossible without moving halfway across the country to get away from that circle of 'friends'...But alcohol? All I have to do is keep water nearby. After the first few days of withdrawal everything has been simple...The only trouble I'm experiencing is EXTREME irritability. I have a prescription for diazepam to help out with the withdrawal symptoms including that but it doesn't seem to help all that much...What do you do to combat feelings of disproportionate irritability?

Go for a long walk.
Run on the treadmill read a book or go to bed early.
Easy physically yeah by comparison maybe but the real trick is not picking it up again because it's easier than crack or finding something else to get addicted to......Congrats though  keep on.
I found that quitting drinking was easier than I expected. When it's hard it is really hard. But I thought it would be that way all the time and it wasn't.
Stopping was not hard learning to live without it was a pisser.
