It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** A client tried to get away with not paying me for work that she'd hired me to do. (She said as a defense  I had a brain tumor!  I responded  Well so did I but it didn't stop me from paying my bills!  When she realized that her bid for sympathy wasn't going to work with me she switched gears and said  Well the truth is that I'm feeling ambivalent about paying your bill  ) Then she completely stopped responding to my emails and phone calls. ..I was kind of screwed because when you're a freelancer and you send an invoice after you've done the work it can be really hard to get the person to actually pay you. Sometimes you just have to take the financial loss but I couldn't afford to...**Triumph:** After six months of her evading me I finally got the former client served with legal papers and she immediately paid what she owed me in order not to have to appear in court (which apparently she *really* did not want to do). ..My real triumph was not in finally getting her to pay my bill. My triumph was that when she tried to stiff me I decided that I would not allow it and then took concrete steps to solve the problem instead of just spiraling into a hot mess of anger alcohol and an inability to cope like I would have done in the past. (Okay not a hot mess. I was always a non-sexy mess.)..**General:**  I don't trust children. They're here to replace us.   Stephen Colbert.
----------immediate responses--------

I've been sober for a whole day I know it's not much but I've spoken with my therapist and she's talking me through my struggles one step at a time 
hey just looking for someone to talk to been drinking since I was 15 and haven't had a problem til the last few years (am 23). Not looking to never drink again just get it under control.. I know it's a problem because every night all I can think of is settling down and having a drink (by drink I mean like 8 or 9). I've been in good routines where I'll only drink a day or two out of the week but I can't seem to get myself into that habit again I just love drinking every night and I hate that it's so unhealthy for me but I can't seem to stop.. if anyone wants to talk I'd love to
Went out with my friends today after working many 12-15 hour days consecutively.  Although I had to sit at a brewery for part of it I had a lot of fun because my good buddy is in town and he doesnt give a shit whether I drink or not.  Feels good not being a hermit 24/7.  
Struggle: My partner who I love a lot is being awkward with alcohol after I told them I'm quitting my consumption. They really don't need to quit they have 1-3 drinks a week at maximum often less. They can drink and enjoy it like a normal person and I don't want them to lose a healthy relationship with something they actually enjoy responsibly just because I'm an incorrigible drunk who needs to put down their own bottle.  ...Triumph: I noticed they opened a single beer and left it in the fridge once I got home from work and didn't grab their treat like they normally would while we were watching a show. So when I got up to get my soda I offered to get it for them and they said yes. Sort of my way of validating that we are two different people with different relationships with alcohol.  ...General: I hate telling people in real life that I'm quitting drinking alcohol. Like if I'm around a coffee drinker and I don't drink coffee no one pretends not to want to use their coffee maker they just say "Oh OK you're not drinking coffee" and then they pour themself a cup of it and the conversation continues. That's kind of how I would like people to treat me I don't want unsolicited pity or support. I know if I ask them not to drink they'd probably not but it doesn't bother me and I don't really want someone depriving themself possibly building resentment or just plain avoiding me just because they think it might help me.
Getting over the dts.  Going to AA tomorrow.  I've let my foolish pride prevent me from pursuing the thing that will save me.  It will be humiliating to go there admit defeat.  But all that is just in my head.  Those people have only loved and helped me.  
Love your real triumph!  
Triumph: I received the phone call I've been waiting for for years. I got a new job!!!! My current job is the ONLY reason I drink (never liked alcohol until I was 35 and hating life) and now I know the reason I have drank a six pack or more every single night for the past four years will be nothing more than an uncomfortable memory in two weeks time...Struggle: I don't remember the last time I drank but I think it was last Friday. I've been  good  since trying to land the new job. We had wine last night to celebrate and I had only 2 glasses. Now the rest of the bottle is waiting in the fridge. The good news is I'm not worried that I'll overdo it. I'm aware of the calories now! Cross your fingers!
Struggle: I have a new set of GI issues caused by the treatment of my previous GI issues. It's so frustrating to constantly have to be dealing with this especially since I briefly had so much improvement and now this. I took my anger out last night on a bag of pretzels with chocolate and peanut butter...Triumph: There could have been far worse ways for me to deal with my struggle and I've regrouped my thinking this morning. I already have the medication I need to take and I'm back to being optimistic that it's going to make an improvement. If it works I only need to take a pill or two with meals and I'll be fine if it doesn't then I'll find something that does. ..General: My husband had done some side work a couple years ago building a website for some guy's business. It was an ongoing project and my husband charged for maintenance and adding new features. At one point the guy just stopped paying the bills and wouldn't respond to emails so the site mysteriously went down. The money owed came in pretty quickly after that and the "glitch" got fixed and if I remember correctly my husband charged him to fix it too. 
**Struggle:** Same old :)..**Triumph:** I went to a job interview yesterday and I was on top of my game! It's just a little position but it's exactly what I want to do and it will get bigger year by year with occasional side projects. It is tailored for me. And the best part: My world won't crumble if I don't get it!..**General:** It's stunning that you can take a tree as tall as a house cut it down haul that beast into your livingroom and inch by inch log by log shove it into your fireplace - and it DISAPPEARS!! That huge heavy massive piece of universe vanishes into thin air. Simply amazing.
Stephen Colbert is insufferable. 
What up SD...Struggle: I think the only thing is I caught a bug over the weekend and had to take the day off yesterday but tbh it's been fine and I feel better today...Triumph: Had an absolute stellar weekend with old friends by the coast totally sober. One of my friends was also not drinking...These were people I used to get totally sloshed with and we all had a great time. Two of us were sober and the rest didn't really drink at all...I did so much - played in the arcade saw an incredible art exhibition visited the local attractions and even went raving (only til 1am - my sober time limit)...Good times all round. One of those weekends that's makes me fall in love with being sober all over again...General: I work with researchers at a university and had a whole conversation with someone about their research into VR porn and sex robots. Universities can be bizarre places! ..
Struggle: At work I would say I am the top middle manager. I was brought to my company to make major changes for improvement. The number one major problem with the company is that they coddle generally terrible middle and low level employees and basically allow them to get away with murder. I want to clean house because the terrible employees ruin the moral of the good employees and generally set a precedent that anyone can basically do anything they want with no consequences. However upper management and ownership will not allow me to get rid of said terrible employees because they have "been with the company for so long" and it would ruin moral to see them go..  ..Triumph: I'm still not drinking and I've been hitting the gym 6 days a week! Feeling incredible!..General: Still haven't really told anyone I'm on the wagon yet outside of my better half. Haven't really been challenged yet and peer pressure is where I usually cave. I feel stronger this time though. Time will tell.
**S:**  Weather.  We got an ice storm.  Power didn't go out so that's good but the start of school is delayed for two hours.  That's not so good I got shit to do!...**T:**  Filled for child support.  Ex is going to flip.  ..**G:**  February is the cruelest month not April.
Made it to 48 hours last night. Feeling pretty proud of that.

**Triumph:** Exercise is going well. After taking a couple months off of focused training at the end of last year I'm back. The movement is good for me--improves my mood gives me time to think. The structure isn't bad--it's nice to have something to focus on and I have flexibility built in to accommodate life issues. Exercise is so beneficial for me and it wa something that slipped badly in my last few years of drinking...**Struggle:** I had an issue explode at work on Friday. It was the first time in a long time that drinking or other drugs sounded like an appealing way to alter (or rather forget) my emotions. I sat with it knew I was in no danger of acting and just let it stew.
First time posting here. ..I drank pretty heavily for the last year or so due to issues with my job and a previous relationship. Quit my job went back to school and haven't had a drink for 17 days which I believe is the longest stretch since I turned 21. ..&amp;#x200B;..Struggle and Triumph: Got some good news that was most likely due to my lack of drinking and my first response was to reach out to my friends to celebrate. Decided to cook a nice meal and watch a movie I had been saving instead. ..&amp;#x200B;..General: I live four hours north of most of my friends and we used to text and call each other on Friday and Saturday nights to chat when we were all wasted. It is comical to be sober and listen to some of the stuff said by someone on the verge of blackout. I know I have been that guy several times before and it made me realize I have some awesome friends. They could have easily held that stuff over my head or ribbed me for it but I have never heard a disparaging comment from them. 
No sexy mess! Love it.
My struggle:  I'm finally sober but my husband drinks. Every damn night...That's ok because I refuse to not be the BEST VERSION OF ME POSSIBLE!..IWNDWYT
Can someone tell me how to get a badge?  I've been sober for 12 days now and I'd like to become a bit more involved in the community to help me continue down this path
Dudes so many days!!!  Never thought I'd make it this far.  This sub has been a big help.  Thank you all.
**Struggle:** Don't want to work on somebody anymore. Winter is making me mad tired of snow and frost...**Triumph:** Started a side project with my brother. Hope to fix the problem of working on somebody else with that...&amp;#x200B;
Struggle: Actually feeling pretty good today. The last few months and next few months have been and will be hectic as my wife is finishing coursework and I have been doing more of the chores around the house. The chores along with watching the toddler and our puppy after working an 8-9 hour shift are stressful when she has night class - like tonight. ..Triumph: 10 days no drink. The jeans I wore 10 days ago are much looser in the waist to the point where I almost need a belt. With all of the bloating 10 days ago the same jeans were very tight on the waist. ..General: Happy to come here each morning to remind me of my new plans and goals and evening when I start to get a craving. 
Sheesh. I'm sorry you had to invest so much time and effort just to get paid what you were owed. It makes me hopping mad how people act like such jerks...**Struggle:** I'm so tired today for some reason and I wish I could just stay home and sleep. I was half expecting to be snowed in and I'm pretty disappointed that I need to get my butt to work...**Triumph:** 74 months alcohol free.
My OH is leaving a job and they have potential scammed us out of  15000. Certainly  4500. Leaving this toxic place was supposed to be a great thing for us and he has a great new job to look forward to. But anxiety over the ongoing battle has ruined it. Anyway it has coincided with not drinking but I've stayed very strong and ignored the nagging voice that says I would be justified in having a drink just for today. Well no. Piss off voice. Just for today I *won't* have a drink. ..Today when it got particularly hard I forced myself to get off the sofa and tackled my very unorganised kitchen. Made a lot of leeway and I'm feeling much better. 
Happy hump day
Struggle: I feel like I'm wavering. I need to recommit...Triumph: I enjoy being fully present for my family...General: having a hard time doing some minor tasks for work. Have you ever noticed the smaller the task the harder it is to get started?
Day 2 weeks in the books. Roads are a disaster so after my training I have no temptation to drink. These the easy days when it's too hard to even access booze. But at least I still get an endorphin high from lifting.
Struggle: while I've fallen off the horse a few times when I get back on I'm going for longer and longer stretches of sobriety. That said because of my clearer head I've had days where I'm angry from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed. Other times I'll be in the middle of an uneventful day and suddenly I'm just *angry.* And not like  haha I'm so angry at that  it's  I genuinely want to hurt something  angry. I know irritability and mood swings can accompany withdrawal but I really don't like having a resting murder face.  .  .Triumph: I'm losing the cravings for alcohol that drive most of my day for so many years. It still flares up but not with the same insistence that it has. I'm bringing it and other parts of my life under control again.  .  .Quote:  If sir you cannot serve as an example then you must serve as a warning.  -unsure if author
Well I'm going to try again managed around five months last year but slipped back into the habit as usual my brain is playing tricks telling me my weekends won't be the same music won't sound as good etc...it begins..
Took my first non-alcohol-related sick day in probably a couple of years. I was frustrated  at first - like how dare my body not feel well... I'm not hungover! - but then I realized this was a milestone in its own right.
Struggle - Hungry all the time (finishing out day 5)...Triumph - Doing homework with my son without a drink in my hand. It was about him NOT me. It felt really good to be fully invested in him rather than one  unsteady foot out the door. It's thrilling to learn how selfish I was because THAT is totally workable...General - Just trying to focus on one day at a time. As much as I want to get excited about the future I know I'm not ready. I will not drink tonight  and I hope I can make the same commitment here tomorrow morning. 
Struggle: I'm very irritable and trying not to snap at people..Triumph: I made falafel with delicious dill sauce ..General: sleepy time tea is delicious and cozy :)
I ended up out with friends tonight unplanned. We went to a bar for trivia. When we walked in one of my friends a guy I kinda like handed me the beer list and asked what I was drinking. I looked at it for a few seconds I wanted to get a beer but then I handed it back and ordered a Diet Coke which he put on his tab. Idk if he likes me back but I'm glad I didn't drink. 
Triumph: woo hoo one year..Struggle: caved on my diet yesterday and ate so much KFC    what a waste of calories!! ..New day today and back on track
Struggle: Finding my way back in my family relationships. Dealing with shame and guilt and low self esteem regarding this. Not fun. .Triumph: Went to a concert in a theater yesterday. Was pushed a glass of alcohol in my hand during the break came with the ticket apparently walked straight to the bar and switched it for a sparkling water. My mind said for a split second: "maybe one?" and than my mind immediately said: "no way we're done with that remember" :) .General: Emotional still all over the place sometimes. It's okay. I'm sober. Feelings won't kill me and I trust that in time I'll figure out the things I need to figure out. .IWNDWYT
Struggle: S/O still drinks often to excess. It's odd watching from the outside. ..Triumph: My friends and family are supportive of my choice to not drink. ..General: I'm off work with a bad flu during an ice storm. If that's not a silver lining!
