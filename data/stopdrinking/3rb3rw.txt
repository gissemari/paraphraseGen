The weekend started with my friend arriving with large bottles of flavoured vodka and Baileys. It was a party on a private garden on top of an apartment block. The holiday was to last three nights with a pub crawl and various late night drinks in hotel rooms. We had all travelled to an Asian city...Luckily I had my GF with me who doesn't drink...I survived the weekend but there were a few weird moments:..* I drank three NA beers. (It got my friends off my back as it made them think I'd drink later)...* Drank quite a few soft drinks. I'm really not happy about this as I'm trying to quit sugar...* Accidentally drank some alcohol when I found out the dessert I was eating had a shot of brandy on it. It was one of those fancy desserts they light on fire. I ate the dessert and that means I did consume some alcohol but I don't consider this a relapse as it was gross and I got no pleasure from the alcohol. It didn't kick off any cravings. I've always hated hard liquor...* I didn't drink any coffee which I'm proud about as I quit coffee at the same time as my drinking...So overall it was a success but I need to figure out a better plan to deal with soft drinks...I had no alcohol cravings over the weekend. If anything watching all the Halloween revelers getting drunk made me feel very happy I am sober and will wake up feeling fine in the morning.
