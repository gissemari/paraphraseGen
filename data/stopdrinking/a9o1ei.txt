I cannot remember the password for the account I used to post with. It's been a while. ..There has been so much I've been grateful for within the past few months. Starting with getting my drinking under control. My self value increased and along with it my confidence. After a nearly two long year search I was hired and immediately put on an expedited track toward supervisor. It is incredible to finally be in a position where I feel valued finally using my degree and working in my field. ..While sobriety has been great I just don't feel much anymore. It is troublesome I'm distant. Aside from my immediate family I simply couldn't hold a conversation. It is incredibly unlike me at least the me I used to be. I normally love talking to people so I faked it. ..I had a couple drinks with my family as we normally do and I started to feel social again. But along with it came a deep resentment. I told my sister and she quietly look my glass of wine away. ..My thoughts lingered and I needed to get fresh air. All I wanted was to go home lay down. The buzz I felt was a reminder of why I wanted to stop drinking to begin with. I took the family dog out with me and we went on a walk. After I returned my mother asked if I was okay and I told her I don't think I am. We talked for a while she already knows my situation. ..I have this deeply rooted self-hated. I compare myself to other people I lack the charisma I once had. Mostly I'm not happy and I cannot figure out why. I should be right? My life is improving but I don't feel happy. ....
