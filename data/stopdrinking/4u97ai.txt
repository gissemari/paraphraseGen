After a terrible breakup with my codependent and enabling relationship and after borderline domestic abuse and after nearly drinking myself into a coma the days have gotten better. ..I started doing things I havent done before like get a new and understanding sponsor go on hikes read nonstop and generally try and be a better worker and more agreeable friend and family member. ..The hardest thing to give up on right now is the self-pity and the underlying fear that all of this could happen all over again all the same way. I'm not going to start saying "I'm cured!" because I know I've done that a few times before and then I realize that maybe I'll never be cured. Maybe we can simply be treated but not cured. ..This subreddit has always been a good resource for me and I appreciate the honesty and encouragement and even the raw human emotion that I see typed out in a little white box. My hangover is still eating away at me and the emotional hangover will take a lot longer to get rid of but I keep telling myself this had to happen or else a change would never have taken place. ..Maybe I would have driven drunk again and killed someone; maybe I would have gotten drunk again and killed myself or just generally spread misery to those closest to me in my life. ..Ive gotten some great advice and I want to make changes even if right now I have to force those changes to happen. ..In a way I wish I could always stay this emotionally aware but I know it's just a symptom of post-binge depression. The times when I start thinking about relapsing is when my life is generally on the right track. ..Just wanted to check in. Anyone who is struggling in their first week just know that you're not alone you're not the only one who's thought those thoughts and done those things. Being told that in person really helped release a lot of anger and self-hatred. ..Stay safe everyone. Love yourself and ask yourself if you'd rather live or die. Today I want to live.
