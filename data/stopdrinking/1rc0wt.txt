I am celebrating 5 months today. I also recommended the topic at today's AA meeting a first for me. I wanted to hear other people's thoughts about moderation. Most of the group stayed for about an hour and 45 minutes instead of just an hour and I felt like people were really interested to tell me why moderation didn't work for them. I'm still struggling with the idea. I want to be a problem drinker instead of an alcoholic. I think I need to find a sponsor tho. It's been 5 months and I still don't have one. I am grateful that there is this subreddit and the rooms near me. Thanks guys and gals.

Five months is truly an awesome achievement. For me at the moment I'm just waking up and saying 'I'm not going to drink today!' I have spent half a life time drinking and I've had enough. I would always call it 'having a few beers' honestly I never had just two beers I drank until drunk. So whether an alcoholic or a problem drinker well I'm not sure of the difference for me alcohol is a problem. Thank you for for being here I look at your five months and think I want that! Congratulations.
It was my attempt at moderation that proved to me that I was an alcoholic. I imagined I could drink like a lady but  I can only drink like a lush. No thanks.
Five months is a good start on a sober life.  So glad you shared.
Well done.
Congrats on 5 months! ..I know for me moderation was not an option. My last year of drinking was an experiment in controlled drinking (although I didn't really realize it at the time) and it was a complete failure. The funny thing is the idea of complete abstinence had NEVER occurred to me because I so couldn't imagine my life without alcohol. ..Today I'm grateful to be able to imagine what would happen if I picked up again. That keeps me from doing it :)
