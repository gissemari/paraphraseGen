Yesterday was a friends birthday so we had a little get together/pool party.  Got to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while.  ..It was a small intimate gathering so we all got to interact pretty closely.  All my friends grew up partying pretty heavily and we're now in our 30s.  The group was pretty evenly split between sober people and complete wrecks.  Half of us were totally sober while the other half were getting trashed.  ..One of my buddies has seemingly been on a bender for the last ~8 years.  By the time I left at around 6:30 he had already had about a fifth to himself with no stopping in sight.  Teeth starting to crack and fall out and overall looks like shit.  Friend's long divorced parents were there.  Mother is very well put together father is borderline handicapped with a bunch of missing teeth as well and living with his son.  ..On the bright side one friend has been sober over a year took on running and healthy living as her new addiction and looks fantastic.  ..Another friend went through detox and is now living in a sober house looks awesome as well.  Another tried to commit suicide ~4 months ago by taking a ton of benzos with booze we got her help and now she is sober and doing great.  ..One of my best buddies likes to drink but he is a happy beer drinker but only on his days off.  Wish I was able to regulate like that...It's times like those that I think actually help me to remain sober (when I actually stick with it).  You see both examples of what you do and don't want to be like.  I've been on both ends.  I had about a year sober was feeling great and good things were happening then had a couple of nasty relapses and ended up on the other side.  ..I would love to be able to still drink but I've had my fun and want to stick with the sober and motivated me...On another note when I relapsed I forgot how easily you can smell others' drinks.  I can smell somebody's beer from across the room now...Cheers everyone.  Here's to a good week.

wow. all of my friends (were) drinking buddies. i'm at a point where i can't hang out with people who are drinking. at least you have some friends that have their shit together but it must be difficult to watch the ones that are falling apart.
Good work /u/SourCreamWater -- I think most of us can relate to that time in early sobriety when the beer goggles fell off and we began to see our peers unfiltered.  It can be pretty upsetting.  I think the stark contrasts soften after a little while--they did for me.  ..That feeling that I'd like to still drink--that goes away for most of us when realize that the "fun" or "sophistication" in drinking is not what we thought.  ..Keep doing what you're doing.
