There are a lot of assholes out there with their own agendas. If I were in your situation I would make a list of the pros and cons of staying verses leaving. Whether you can tolerate the position that you are in now and if it's worth it for you and your recovery. Best of luck to young whatever decision that you make. Try to stay positive and move forward. If it helps I won't drink with you today!
