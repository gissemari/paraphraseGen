So a few of us were talking a bit of shit earlier today and decided to make one another accountable not just for drinking but to getting back in shape. I admitted that I've been struggling with sugar since giving up alcohol but I can break through given a bit of a challenge and being made accountable.......So... if you'd like to join then please do. You can download the app and join if you'd like. ..If the below link doesn't work then please contact the below user as he set the group up...http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/group/112630-stopdrinking-challenge..u/_OP_is_A_

This is just what I was wishing for- thanks!
Love this idea! Will definitely join! 
I am totally on board with this!
Oh yes.
This is a great idea!  I will have to change my username then I might jump on board.  My username on myfitnesspal is my real name. 
Phew! We're going to be ok! I've confirmed they already have a bunch of exercises pre-entered...[This is going to save a ton of time!](http://take.ms/FHBwV)
This sounds like a good thing! I'm already in a weight loss challenge with a group of friends. I joined SD 5 weeks ago and lost 10 lbs without increasing exercise or depriving myself of food. Avoiding the caloric intake of 4-6 drinks per day really helped. I hope others in early sobriety also see the benefits. To be clear I was careful to not replace the calories with food rewards. Early on I would spend the money I saved by not buying alcohol on flowers or manicures to treat myself for being strong. 
I'm in GREAT idea love it!
oh this is great. i'm a total marshmallow these days and am in the minority of people who didn't miraculously lose weight immediately once they quit drinking. see you there! :)
