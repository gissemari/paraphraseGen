Just shy of 11 years sober from a homeless bum alcoholic a little over 9 years since I left my Oxford house and my wife and I are buying our own property to turn into a women's Oxford house. ..Our town has pretty bad drug problems and not a single house for single women. Even though the real estate market is freaking crazy we looked and looked and found one that met Oxfors's requirements. Pulled my money out of retirement and we're signing in a few days. Lease already drawn up with Oxford...I'm not the best recovering alcoholic. I've only sponsored a couple guys. I screw around too much and it can get hard to stay thankful and forget where I came from...I have been moderately successful though partially through hard work partially through luck. I don't talk much about my past with my friends and family but I wanted to share this with r/stopdrinking a forum which gave my Dad some comfort before his own alcoholism put him in an early grave. ..To everyone out there struggling. Please keep struggling please keep reaching out. Your life can be so much better you can be so much more.
