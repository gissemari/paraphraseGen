Here I am at Day 2 again. Longest stretch was 2 months in June...but since then just been repeatedly resetting. Haven't gotten anywhere near the level of drinking I was at before...but the beast is definitely awakened. ..Had a great day with my family yesterday. As we headed home around 4pm I thought "I could get something to drink when we get home". Then I played that tape forward. How much I would actually drink. How id feel this morning. How I'd most likely end up drinking today because I'd be hungover & wanting to feel better. It dawned on me that since I relapsed in June I stopped playing tape. A lot of what got me to that 2 months was I wouldn't want to "ruin tomorrow". ..So in addition to admitting to my husband that this is a bigger problem than I let on...I also need to vow to myself to keep playing that tape over & over. As many times as it takes.

Great job not giving up and coming back.  I also do that but in addition I started to try and track the situations I was in that made me want to drink.  It helped me identify patterns and then do my best to try and avoid them.
Playing the tape forward has been a really helpful tool for me. That and this sub along with AA has kept me sober for my longest stretch ever. I will not drink with you today.
Welcome back.  It's a process.  Have you read This Naked Mind?  Link to free download in sidebar.  I also really learned a lot at SMART Recovery online.  I got their workbook on Amazon.  I won't drink with you today.
It's a great tape and although the ending is always the same it never ever gets boring to watch.  A bit like watching a classic film that makes you feel all warm inside......at least that's how I feel when I look at how I would be if I "just had one drink" and how I am now without it...Stay strong.
