I made a goal to get sober before the holidays because I have always found myself drinking way too much all season. I had a few relapses getting here but it looks like I'm managing to make it. I went out with family for a Thanksgiving buffet that had an open bar. The thought of drinking some whiskey crossed my mind but I am pleasantly surprised the idea did not sound pleasant at all. Instead of obsessing about getting the next drink for the entire rest of the day I had a good time with my family and I'll have a great day tomorrow. IWNDWYT
