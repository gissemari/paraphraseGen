Got out of treatment on December 2nd and I started drinking around Christmas. ..I was told you guys would be able to relate to my issues. I'm trying to get back into treatment currently because at my current rate I'll either die or kill someone else. ..Just looking for some words of encouragement or hope because lately all I want is to die. Tired of stupid ass little substances running my life. Atleast im not doing meth anymore.

Glad to hear you're trying to get back into treatment. Hang in there. The fight is worth it.
I'm happy you're here. Keep trying and come here often. This support network has been a lifesaver for me.
Just coming here and writing what you did is a big step - seriously. Good going - keep building the momentum!.Are you likely to get yourself back into treatment soon?.
Glad you're here...I got support at meetings...No charge no fee no requirements.
Welcome to the family :).
Welcome here. Hope you find the same help I have from all the fantastic people on SD.
