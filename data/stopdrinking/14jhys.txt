So I've noticed there are a lot of newbies on here recently possibly due to it being the holidays (lots of extra sad drinking) or maybe something else entirely. Either way I find it very helpful & inspiring to read books from former addicts about their journeys & it was extra necessary in those first tender weeks. I thought it would be cool if we could compile a list of the best books about addiction for those looking for a helpful read. So I will throw in my favorites and hopefully others have some to contribute as well!  .1. Kristen Johnston - Guts. I read this in the first few weeks after quitting and it really made me feel way better about my own situation. Johnston (who played Sally on Third Rock from the Sun) went through a terrible medical ordeal caused by her addictions but came out of the other side healthier & sober. Plus her writing voice is very candid brassy & funny.   .2. David Sheff - Beautiful Boy. A father wrote this about his son's addiction to meth. I liked it because he is a great writer and also gives an outside perspective on watching someone he loves relapse over and over again. I would highly recommend it though it is definitely depressing.   .

I've had the one by susan powter on my bookshelf for years and nothing's changed!  I suggest you avoid that one.
Drinking: a love story by Caroline Knapp
New Pair of Glasses - Chuck C..Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption - William Cope Moyers (Bill Moyers' son)..I'll think of some more soon
Unwasted by Sacha Scoblic - I love this one because it deals with life during the first year of sobriety rather than recounting all the war stories with a single concluding chapter about entering rehab and life is now fine...Everything I Never Wanted to Be by Dina Kucera - So many problems in her family but (for me) very illuminating about how the problems of alcoholism can ripple through the lives of everyone we know and love...Now reading A Drinking Life by Peter Hamill very well written but I'll have to wait and see how it turns out.
I'll pile on for Drinking: A Love Story and Unwasted. I also posted with requests and suggestions for [good recovery blogs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/137knw/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_recoverysobriety/)
Dry-Augusten Burroughs. Funny and irreverent this is a cautionary tale of someone who has is so well and yet is so flawed due to alcoholism.
In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts (Gabor Mate). Mate worked as a doctor in Vancouver's Lower Eastside- and area notorious as one of the roughest in Canada in terms of street addiction. Non-judgemental informative and insightful.
One time I read this one called the Big Book. It's classic self-help literature and a must-read for anyone trying to sober up even if you aren't going into a 12-step program. If you've never read it the first 164 pages is what's recommended but the short stories that follow are all rather inspiring. Lessons such as "there is always someone who has it worse than me" and my personal favorite "I am not a normal drinker. I can not drink like most people. Therefore I can not drink. Ever." EVER
1. The Big Book of AA. I read it pretty religiously for the first year and still read it a couple times a week. I was a little scared to start reading it because I thought it meant I was an alcoholic (of course my morning drinking wasn't a cause for concern but reading this book would have been...)...I honestly recommend everyone to read the Big Book if you're struggling and going through hell. The first thing I read were the stories in the back speficially one called "Student of Life" It's about an young woman who drinks in her parent's house alone after graduating university. Pretty much my story...2. Another book is called "Wherever you go there you are" by John-Kabatt-Zinn. It's not related to addiction directly. It's about learning how to live in the moment it's about the value of meditation. I think this book and practicing what it says saved my life...3. Daily meditation books. I have one by Karen Casey and another by Melodie Beattie. These have changed my life. They center me everytime I read them and allow me to honestly reflect on what's been going on in my life.
I have created numerous booklets on recovery.  they are free on my website (requires flash) or as PDF via Magcloud.com. .My website is Odatbooks.com  this is self promotion though.I am in the process of removing markup on hard copy versions.MODS: please remove if this violates terms etc.
Undrunk: A Skeptic's Guide to AA by AJ Adams. Funny witty and sobering tale of a man's coming to terms with his alcoholism and his journey through AA. 
The Big Book from AA. Saved my life!!
**The Big Book of AA**.  The first 164 pages convinced me of a few things which have been key in my sobriety:..* Alcoholism makes good people do bad things.* There is a solution for alcoholism.* I have alcoholism.* I'm not a bad person.* I can apply a solution to my disease.* I can have a life...**Infinite Jest** by David Foster Wallace.  This book is a mamoth complex tome.  But if you're an alcoholic/addict you will immediately identify with many of the characters.  When I was drinking this was the first book that made me feel less lonely.  At the time I didn't admit to being an alcoholic but I did see a lot of myself in the characters and I yearned for the community of "something like" AA in my life.  Who knew it'd actually be AA :)..**Twenty Four Hours A Day** - Daily meditations for sober alcoholics: http://www.amazon.ca/Twenty-Four-Hours-Day/dp/0894860127/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355086075&amp;sr=8-2 It sets my thinking in the right direction first thing in the morning
Sober and staying that way by Susan Powter. Apparently she is famous for fitness purposes I had never heard of her but was looking for a new outlook on getting sober so decided to try and find something at the library and decided on this. I am 48 days sober since reading it the longest I had ever made it before was 13 days. 
*Under the Influence* by Ketchum and Milam..* http://goo.gl/LSZJ9..Explains the disease of alcoholism which led to my understanding and acceptance of the disease; this led to detox inpatient treatment AA and long-term recovery. Powerful interesting life-altering book.
