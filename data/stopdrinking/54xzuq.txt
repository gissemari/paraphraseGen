I've "quit" so many times.  Each time I relapse it's tempting to think I shouldn't even try again.  Going to lean into friends and faith and hope and honesty and give it another go.

We have all been there. I have reset my badge several times. Like a storm conditions get just right then you drink. change things up break your routine. You've got this. 
The only way to truly fail is to stop trying. I tried many times. Eventually it just stuck...Never stop trying...I will not drink with you today!
I had no clue how to build a sober happy life so gathered all the help I could find. I read everything about alcoholism and recovery got a therapist went to rehab and involved in AA. I now have a happy sober life. Maybe you need more support. 
Recently I found this quote:  Don't be discouraged. It's often the last key in the bunch that opens the lock. 
You can do it...this week has been so tough but we can keep working on it together.
