I will be attending my first AA meeting. I thought that maybe I could do this without attending them but I have two people that live with me that are heavy drinkers. It is getting extremely hard to keep my head level. Hopefully the meeting will provide some form of help any tips for me? ..**Update::**.At first I didn't know if I was in the right place or not I may have had a little anxiety attack in the carpark. I almost turned around and went home. .I am so glad I didn't though even just hearing stories from people was enough to make me feel like I wasn't alone in this struggle. I got my first coin and it is honestly one of my most loved items now just having someone else acknowledging the milestone of 30 days as something great. .Yeah. It was great.

Just be yourself and relax. Enjoy getting your chip too! 
[Here's some ideas of different meetings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/34vu9m/faq_what_happens_at_a_recovery_group_meeting/)...For me the most important advice was to expect to do some shopping before I found a meeting that fit. I was lucky and the second meeting I attended was a good fit. Since then I've tried another 5 or 6 types of meetings at various locations.
That's awesome! You'll meet a lot of cool people who all know exactly what you're going through.

Personally I've had a good experience using AA but I had to attend a lot of meetings before I found ones I like. I gave up on it a few times but went back out of loneliness since I only knew how to socialize with alcohol. The first one I went to ended up being in a homeless shelter (I'm not the most observant guy). Was a tough crowd to say the least. I eventually found the ones that work for me and my social life opened up. ..Tip: I asked the people who I had stuff in common with to tell me which meetings they like. That was a game changer for me. 
I've never been to an AA meeting but have heard they can be very preachy which not everyone gets along with.  Would really rub me the wrong way at least.
I went to my first AA meeting last Friday and have gone to three meetings since then all in different locations. I enjoyed it right away and would go more if it was not for my outpatient treatment. I hope you gain as much from your experience as I did with mine...Check in with us after and let us know how it went. I would be very interested to hear. 
Hey I was in pretty much the same situation before I moved. AA meetings were a huge help for me especially on the weekends where I wanted to be anywhere but home. Home was full of beer weed and just general temptation back into my old life. ..Hope the meetings help I'll echo what people have said and tell you that I have met some wonderful loving people in the AA meetings I go to and it has been a huge boost to my personal growth.
How did you go?
