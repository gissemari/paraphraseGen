Like the title says. I was an absolute disaster three years ago. My life was in complete shambles. I **KNEW** that suicide was my only option much in the same way that I **KNEW** the sun rises and sets everyday. ..I had relapsed over and over and over and over and over. I won't go into the storied details. The details aren't important. What I will describe is how I felt. How I viewed myself and how I "thought" people viewed me. Nobody could possible have hated me more then I hated myself. I saw myself as the biggest most useless piece of garbage to have ever had a pulse. My psyche and emotions we're so skewed that I would start violently weeping at the drop of a hat. All bets we're off when watching Forrest Gump (my favorite movie). I **KNEW** I was wasting your time and mine on this earth...Sleep was a luxury I couldn't buy. Unconsciousness was another story though. I used to drink myself into unconsciousness every night only to regain consciousness a few hours later and drink myself back to unconsciousness. ..I would go days/weeks without eating. The only thing my body wouldn't throw up was the cheap vodka from the plastic jug. I would drink a gallon of vodka a day (not an exaggeration)...I reached such a low that I couldn't climb out of it by myself nor would I have wanted to. Why would I have wanted to save myself? I wanted death not rebirth. Thankfully because of people in my life that I "thought" no longer wanted me in theirs I was able to get back into a rehab for the umpteenth time. I saw myself as a failure and a loser but for some reason my life had been spared. This time I wanted to live and I knew my answers and my way wasn't working so I had to actually do what someone else told me not matter how much it didn't make sense to me at the time...I'll wrap this up...**While I did take the path of Alcoholics Anonymous I don't submit to the idea that it's the only way.** However since I don't know much of the other programs I won't speak for them but we do carry the same ends to a mean. The point of getting sober isn't just to stop drinking it's to **become a person that likes and loves themselves more than anyone one else could love them**. ..If you do try AA please when you go to a meeting sit down tell them your new and need help (you wouldn't be there if you didn't need help) and listen to **Identify not Compare**. Everyone there has a different story a different past and a different outcome. The single binding factor is that they so desperately want to stay sober. Like me they came in feeling  lower than whale shit  (idiom I heard in AA)...You can do this if you really want to. I'm not saying one person should have to rely solely on will power though. I have made some of the most amazing companionate honest friends I could have ever hoped for and that's only the people I've meet so far...There are over 2 million people in AA but **there's always room for one more**..Edit: Just to clarify I got 3 years yesterday. I'll assume you already figured that out though.

"there's always room for one more" - that I like!   :D
Great post!  Congratulations.
Thanks for the post!
I am just over three years as well and an unsuccessful suicide attempt is what brought me into the rooms. Thanks for helping me remember. AA may not be the only way for everyone but it sure as hell is the only way for me.
Thanks for the post and congratulations on your 3 years. I also used to think I would die as a result of suicide. I even had two favorite scenarios that kept coming back to me. But I now realise that my destination was not the grave as much as the mental institution. Boy was I ever losing my mind. I'm gratefull I found AA. Even if I was a cross-mix of atheist and agnostic I was welcomed and never felt out of place. Sad to say but when I hear people object to AA on the basis of religion I can't help thinking that they still have some room left for a bottle or two. I know I did not.

I could have written that. Well put sir.  I've had a very similar journey to you.  I hated my life and now I love my life. Here's to today!
