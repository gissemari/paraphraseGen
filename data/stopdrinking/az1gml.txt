Greetings friends..I'll provide some context here first - I'm not sure how relevant it is to the original question but...here goes?..I've had trouble with alcohol for many years now. Last year I stopped drinking for 6-8 months and relapsed for reasons I don't recall...At any rate at this stage in my life I feel more or less powerless to stop drinking. As soon as alcohol becomes available I become more or less powerless to refrain from drinking. It feels as though there is nothing within my power to stop myself from taking refuge in alcohol...This is undeniably a broad topic; I suppose I'm just unsure of where exactly I should go from here. When the cravings hit I find myself almost entirely taken by them with no means of escape...Thoughts? Thanks!

I go to regular AA meetings. Works for me
I kind of get that. For me it is rather silly because I can go through cravings with willpower and support but when I relapse it feels rather automatic. Like someone would drink a coffee in the morning..I'm hoping to find a good AA group. That is always  suggested and I hope for for very good reasons..Aside from that I don't think you lack willpower. It is a strong addiction. Maybe we just can't do it alone but who can really say that about themselves?.We are not alone. I hope one day I feel like I am not either. Good luck with everything friend.
If you stopped for 6-8 months it say your willpower is pretty good! Maybe with a little extra support you can crack it once and for all. 
For me it's not so much about 'willpower' as it about *support*...There's no way I could have gotten sober and stayed sober without IRL support and support here at SD...Have you tried different paths to sobriety?
In my opinion willpower is not enough it's like holding your breath you can only do it for so long and then you just have to breath. I am one year sober. I kept relapsing. I didn't know why I drank I never really asked.!!  I just kept at it. I started to listen to a podcast called taking a break from alcohol by Rachel Hart. I changed by life!  Essentially by taking a break from drinking we can start to see what is driving the urge to drink. It's not the alcohol but our thoughts that start the feeling of wanting to drink and hey presto we are drinking. For me it was stress exhaustion and people pleasing that drove me to drink but when I finally discovered this and tackled my problems changed my thinking my drinking stopped. This podcast is really easy to listen to and follow and it will blow your mind. Have a listen from the start. Nobody is powerless we can outsmart alcohol!! Iwndwyt 
I too was powerless over alcohol.  It is a good First Step.  Eleven more and my problems with alcohol were solved.
I didn't and don't use willpower. I used the opposite of willpower: letting go. I've tried to control it with all the usual tricks and always failed. Once I saw that it's smarter than me and stronger than me I just walked off the battlefield. ..I couldn't *stay* off the battlefield without the help of people in recovery organizations-- in my case SMART AA and Refuge Recovery-- and medical help in the form of psychiatry.
I struggled exactly as you describe...Then I had a realization:  I can easily **create** an alcohol issue all by myself.  However I could only **solve** an alcohol issue with support from others...Meetings were a valuable resource!
Willpower? I do not find this a good technique. There are better tools out there like AA SMART tools meditation etc. that work better in my opinion
