I finally started my Dental Assisting Program after being on a wait list for an entire year. This has been my goal for over two years now. I'm 10 months away from graduating with a degree and trade...During this past year I realized I probably shouldn't drink anymore. I drank for the wrong reasons I really struggled with controlling how much I drank and I have paid for the consequences of years of drinking. I still carry some shame trauma and regret but I use it now to remind me why I don't drink. I didn't want to have to lose everything before I finally acknowledged I needed to stop. ..I don't personally identify as an alcoholic and I don't count my days sober. I decided to change and while I have absolutely experienced a few setbacks I don't want to focus on those. That's why I don't keep track of my days. I prefer SMART Recovery over 12 Steps because I believe I probably cause and can fix all my own problems.  (Or learn to accept them whatever happens first.)..Anyway school brings out the worst in me. I find myself directly correlating everything to my grades. I become a relentless perfectionist I quit eating I struggle sleeping I find myself picking at my lips until they bleed and at least a once a week I find myself dry heaving in the parking lot at six in the morning because my body thinks it is in danger. Before I quit drinking I would reward myself with study beers which made studying something to look forward to. I would finally be able to relax for a second and after I was done studying I would just do whatever drugs that were available. I was still stress peeling my lips not sleeping entire days but at least I had moments where that voice that constantly criticizes me in my head would finally be quiet...It isn't a very good method but I would never get a grade lower than an A-. ..But I don't drink now. Also my program is exponentially harder and it is accelerated. There are multiple tests every week and it is hard balancing everything...I got an 85% on a test and locked myself into a bathroom and sobbed because that is a C+ in my field. I tried so hard and my best equaled a C+. My self worth shattered my faith in myself shattered and my belief the future was going to be okay shriveled up and died. Is this a dramatic response to getting a C? Absolutely. But it is what I felt...I came home that day and wanted to drink until I wouldn't wake up. More bad things happened but I just cried into my textbook and kept reviewing for my next test. I didn't drink. After a few hours I regained my will to survive pulled myself together and calmed down. ..I realized I forgot everything I learned (or relearned) since trying to quit drinking.  I wasn't being authentic-- I was desperately trying to impress my instructors and classmates and being purposefully deceptive. I was doing the uncomfortable and hard work-- but that was all I was doing. I forgot what I feel is not the same thing as the truth. I forgot my feelings will change. I forgot to be nice to myself....I was demanding myself to be a superhuman: an absolute wunder student who curiously never slept or ate yet was charming carefree and humble....I can't be that...My class is going to Chicago in a few months for a large dental convention. Most of the women in my class are right around 21 so they keep talking about getting wasted and clubbing. My Lord it seems all they can talk about. I'm 29 so I already did my heavy partying. None of this is new and exciting to me. I told them I don't really drink a lot and they keep asking me what I'm going to do while we are in Chicago. I usually hem and haw and pretend I'm still deciding....So I'm going to put what I learned into practice. I'm going to honest with the other girls that I don't drink. I'm going to remember how I feel about myself isn't reality. I'm going to watch a movie today actually eat two meals and study for only two hours. I still feel the anxiety clawing at my throat that I'm even writing this and not doing something more productive but I'm making my peace with it. Trying my best includes taking care of myself...IWDWYT.
