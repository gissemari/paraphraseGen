It's only 11 days since my last drink but it feels like a hell of an achievement. ..I work as a DJ and this weekend I've faced some tests to say the least. Thursday night had one of the owners of the venue I was DJing in trying to give me a shot. I declined then an hour later him and the head barman showed up at the booth with a bottle of tequila and the intent to pour it directly into me! I managed to refuse despite their persistence and believe me they were persistent. I ended up having to go where I didn't want to and say that the reason I wasn't drinking was because I have a problem with alcohol..Last night I was offered shots by two separate people one of whom had turned up to the booth with a pair to share as well as having several friends come by and offer me drinks. ..At these venues i get a substantial tab to use and staff swing by periodically asking if I want a drink - usually I'd get maybe a G&amp;T and a shot every so often this last 11 days I've stuck to soda water and maybe the odd Red Bull. In the past I've had a terrible habit of seeing an unspent tab as being effectively me declining part of my pay - yet drinking it robs me of hours of the following day and no doubt years of my life down the line...This week I've been waking up before my alarm consistently on many hours less sleep than usual running loads lifting weights every day meditating getting loads more done than usual. This morning I woke up at 9am - almost unheard of for me on a Sunday without an alarm to make it so. ..I'm loving the energy levels I've got my even mood the extra time in the day the fact that I'm eating far less junk than I would when drunk/hungover...Whenever I stop drinking this happens - I really don't know why I struggle so much to maintain once I hit a month or so I MUCH prefer sober me and sober me is far closer to the best version of me that I can make. ..I'm not sure whether I will stay fully sober - I would like to think I can change it up so that I can drink at my best school mate's 40th and best uni mate's 40th (and my own for that matter!) later this summer and not fall back into my terrible habits away from big occasions. Maybe it's the case that I have to give up drink completely I tend to struggle with shades of grey on this - I seem to have a very "all-or-nothing" relationship with drinking in general and the amount I drink when I do drink...I'm incredibly glad to have managed to step away from the whirlwind nightlife working can be and have this clarity - for anyone else in a similar boat it can be done. I've generally been good at Sober Octobers and Dry Januarys but this is my first sober period since 40 days last summer. It's amazing (and a little bit scary tbh) how different the world looks after even just 11 days without drinking...PS - I've been helped this last week or two by using a couple of things the apps 5 Minute Journal and WinStreak and by keeping a journal morning and night (the latter I've been doing on and off for months but really knuckled down since quitting 11 days back). Really handy to consciously promise to stay sober daily and then celebrate it at the end of the day on WinStreak..PPS - sorry for the gigantic wall of text..TL;DR - it ain't easy staying sober when people are constantly trying to give you free shots and drinks at your workplace but so far so good and it is 100% worth it

You are doing awesome thanks so much for this share! 11 days is a huge feat at least it was for me and there's no way I could have turned down all that liquor on my 11th day. I think a lot of people in the DJ scene are talking about alcohol right now with the death of Avicii hopefully that means you may have some more sober peers soon : )..."*I seem to have a very "all-or-nothing" relationship with drinking in general and the amount I drink when I do drink.*" &lt;-- This is me so much. About everything. Gray areas are *really* hard for me it's something I'm working on in therapy. I like to think that my strongheaded black-or-white view of the world that got me into that pattern of drinking can keep me out of it if redirected to sobriety. IWNDWYT
