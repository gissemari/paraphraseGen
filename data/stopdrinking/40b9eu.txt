In my experience the biggest obstacle to taking even [the Baby Steps in](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) early sobriety are feelings of isolation guilt and shame. Personally my alky-brain would just say "Fuck it I'm just going to stay here and drink..." and for 7 years of relapse that's just what I did.  I walked away from my multi-million dollar business and my professional license and finally landed in federal prison for tax offense.  Talk about crushing guilt and shame! ..How did I turn this around?  How is it that I healed a lot of my damaged relationships?  ..First I recognized that guilt and shame are WORTHLESS emotions unless I am motivated to change and if I am changing then why would I feel guilt and shame?  In AA I sponsor Ken an attorney is an avid golfer so he's rich in golf metaphors that actually are pretty insightful.  Many things we do in life can be derailed by one bad outcome a bad swing can send an errant golf ball into the drink.  Wallowing in regret over one bad swing can destroy a golf game but a great golfer can on certain days move beyond a bad shot and win the game.  Likewise wallowing in our guilt and shame is actually a conscious choice to stay in the PAST when recovery is about the NOW.  I choose every day to live in the NOW.  I record that commitment [at the Daily Check-in](http://is.gd/afsucks) and then every day I [act my way into better thinking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)..Finally with sustained time sober I start to feel better look better but to really grow I personally needed to go back and clear up the wreckage of my past--that was what the AA 12 Steps helped me do.

You sound like you were such  a JERK! (*lol*)..You are my hero my dear friend. Keep inspiring. 
I think there is a lot of pressure about what we are supposed to feel or not supposed to feel. Such as I am supposed to feel happy; I am not supposed to feel guilty. For me though all feelings are indicators on how I have been living my life - guides as to what I should keep doing or what I should change. It can be very uncomfortable to feel these emotions in early sobriety but they offer great feedback on the reality of my situation...Great post! Thanks!
I think it says a lot about the value of your advice that I and I'm sure a ton of other people here had a lot of trouble processing the idea of CC being a dirtbag. 
Yeah I used those feelings (guilt shame) as excuses to drink. My fear of even experiencing them in the first place led me to drink even more. ..Today I experience the things in sobriety I never could using alcohol to prop me up. I don't live in nearly as much fear as I used to. When I reached out and asked for help I knew I wasn't alone. I found out there are a lot of people who feel just like me and want to help and be helped. ..Getting out of myself and my negative thoughts was the biggest change I've felt since quitting drinking. I also am less of a scumbag although I recognize I'm far from perfect and never will be.
I've spent my entire life being motivated by guilt and shame and the only place they ever led me was down.  I can address my denial and I can feel regret and I can move forward without guilt and shame. Those two are shitty shitty motivators.
&gt;guilt and shame are WORTHLESS emotions unless I am motivated to change and if I am changing then why would I feel guilt and shame?      ..I like this. Because it's close to another principle I try to live "if the problem has a solution then work towards the solutiin and there's no need to worry. If it has no solution then why am i wasting time worrying about it?
Thank you for this. 
More than anything I leaned on my AA home group. I kept showing up day after day and if I was having a harder time I went more often. Between meetings I hung out kept in touch and stayed busy. Even when I fucked up (and I totally fucked up repeatedly) I never took a drink.
This is the reason i listen to your advice above anyone elses.
/u/coolcrosby thanks for for being a constant source of guidance inspiration and hope!
Thank you for this. While I cannot control what I have done or experienced (or what others may have done to me intentionally or not) I certainly can choose to live for this moment and deal with my past when it directly affects me RIGHT NOW. I don't have to dwell on it fix it or erase it. I can and will move beyond it by being present and acting the best possible way today.
I'm definitely a big fan of CC! I can also add that after I gave up drinking AND my alcoholic mentality my feelings of self worth started to come back. My crutch that I had relied on was holding me back and I fought to hold on to it for so long. .The biggest surprise about getting sober is how much my mental state has improved! 
Great post /u/coolcrosby I've spent the best part of the last 30 years being negative guilt ridden and afraid. And when I wasn't feeling that way my head would very kindly remind me of the mess I was and had created so that I'd be sure to keep wallowing in my self pity. Todaythanks to this sub the supportive people in it and my life and family in AA I am able to catch those thoughts and feelings as they start to manifest and I can now cut them off by thinking instead of the good things in all my life relations and dealings. These days I can see the good in my life slowly but very steadily beginning to outweigh the bad. " Change the way you think" someone has told me more than a few times; I get it today: change the way I think and I can change who I am ( mainly go from a naturally negative person to the complete opposite).
