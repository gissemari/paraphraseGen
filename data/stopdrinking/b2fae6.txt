At 31 days this is the longest period I have gone since having my son (19 months old) I am genuinely feeling so great I still have no desire to drink I now excersice and am down to my lowest weight since having my son and also feeling much happier in myself one effect I'm not happy about is the break outs on my face which still dont seem to be getting better but I am continuing to try drink more water to help it clear I am benefitting so much from been sober and so is my little boy we have tots football classes at 9am Saturday mornings now (I would have never have made it when I was drinking) we are getting work done in the house which is now clean instead of extremely cluttered and we ensure we go out and do fun things most days to everyone struggling it does get better I was a extremely heavy drinker every night/day and now I cannot imagine going back IWNDWYT
