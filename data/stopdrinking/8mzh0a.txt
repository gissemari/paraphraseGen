Not using a throwaway so I'll probably delete this at some point but I've been increasingly struggling with alcohol as self\-medication for anxiety and I can't seem to break the habit. I'm not a binge\-type alcoholic and don't consume large amounts but I do drink compulsively and daily just enough to stay slightly tipsy...It usually goes: I'm home it's evening I've run out of tasks to do I've run out of media distractions I'm unsure what to do with myself at that point and I can no longer ignore the twisted stomach anxiety  \-\- so I have a drink then keep grabbing sips for the rest of the evening to try to sustain it. Or else I find an excuse to share a drink in a social way then again seem to compulsively keep sneaking sips to keep my nerves calm. Then the next day I wake up depressed and feeling like an asshole for lacking self\-control and do it all over again...I keep telling myself that *today* I'll try a healthier way of coping \(meditation? exercise? draw something? go for a walk?\) but every time I get there I feel like flail around mentally and just resort back to a drink. I know there are a million better things for me to do but in the moment I can't make them happen. I'm in therapy to address the underlying stuff but not seeing any progress and I'm sure the constant numbing is part of that...**TL;DR: Can someone help me figure out a specific alternate plan of action that I can take the next time I am overwhelmed with anxiety and tempted to drink to cure it?**

&gt;I do drink compulsively and daily just enough to stay slightly tipsy... I can no longer ignore the twisted stomach anxiety -- so I have a drink..That sounds exactly like the way I ended up drinking by the time I stopped! It turned out the alcohol (and the daily mild withdrawal from the previous day's alcohol) was actually *causing* that feeling of stomach-twisting anxiety in the first place and I was just feeding the cycle... Now I've stopped that awful gnawing anxious feeling has gone away!..I had some help from my doctor to detox more safely and easily support from this sub to get through the initial adjustment period and I also found the book '*Alcohol Explained*' and the book/YouTube '*This Naked Mind*' very helpful.....When the urge to drink strikes come here and post about it instead of automatically obeying it! There can be a lot of comfort in hearing from folks who have been through the same thing and being reassured that you can get through it and it will pass.....Some extra anxiety can be quite normal in early sobriety and can also be a symptom of withdrawal.... if you can get through the first week or two (which in the grand scheme of things isn't long really) it soon starts improving.....Hope that helps keep us posted!..IWNDWYT..Woody :&gt;)&gt;..
I relate to many of the things you said here. ..I knew for a while that the drinking was increasing my anxiety yet did nothing to stop it. I wanted to say I was was too 'weak' or there were too many 'complicated' factors...but at the end of the day they were all excuses. I needed to be ready to quit and ready to stop making excuses and that's when it finally happened. ..I have a LOT of anxiety and some other fun mental health issues and I reached for the alcohol to keep that gut-clenching anxiety away. It always got worse at night for me too when I had nothing else to distract myself when I was a little tired and low on spoons. That's when the resolve would weaken and I would drink then hate myself the next day and be anxious and depressed until I could get back to the wine because "I've had a stressful day so I deserve it." But I'd only had a stressful day because of the drinking. It's a vicious cycle. ..A month ago I just decided I was very tired of all of this and I stopped fighting the excuses and decided to stop drinking one day at a time. When I wanted to drink I thought of the hangover anxiety the exhaustion the self-loathing and disgust I felt every time I drank. Day by day the alcohol cleared out of my system and by about day 12 I stopped having such strong physical cravings. Now at day 29 I think about booze much less; my anxiety is lower than it has been in years; and I'm starting to feel optimistic about my life again...Turns out a month in that I no longer get that severe crippling evening anxiety because there's no more alcohol in my system to cause it. Sometimes I still get down but I've been doing things like treating myself to a bath or some nice food or a conversation with a trusted friend. If I feel particularly antsy or ungrounded I like to take a walk or a bike ride or even do a few yoga stretches before bed. That usually works some of the energy out of my body. I also like many others on here go through large amounts of LaCroix and other fizzy drinks -- there's something rewarding to me about being able to crack open a can and have something cold that feels 'special.'..I've also been in therapy for a year and a half and there have been many times I thought I wasn't making any progress. However I realize now that I have -- it's just sometimes hard to see. A year and a half ago I wasn't ready to quit drinking because I hated myself too much and I thought in some weird twisted and mostly unconscious way that I deserved the pain and anguish that came with the drinking. Only now can I see how ridiculous that is...After a month I still feel like a baby at sobriety but it's far longer than I ever imagined I could get. I've just been taking it one day at a time keeping in mind that I CARE about myself and my body and I want to take care of it. I remind myself that the excuses are tiring and circuitous and I am better than that.  ..Final note since you asked for coping mechanisms: ..HALT is well-known in recovery circles. Stands for Hungry Angry Lonely Tired and whenever you're any one (or more) of those things is when it's harder to say no to drinking. Keeping an eye out and taking steps to care for yourself in these realms can be VASTLY helpful. My big triggers are loneliness and tiredness and so I work very hard to avoid both things and be mindful of them when they do arise. ..Also can you talk to your therapist about this stuff? They should have some good advice for you!..Good luck. :)
