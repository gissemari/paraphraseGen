I'm only 23 but I've had enough battles with alcoholism that I decided it's time to stop. Last year I spent a month in China and in 3 days of binging I ended up spending about $9k (USD) on alcohol alone and at one point woke up on the street with little recollection of the previous night and most of my belongings cut out from my pants and stolen. That's when I first stopped. I eased back in and was safe for almost a year but the past few months I've been drunk more often than not and the weekend before last I browned out for 3 days straight while on vacation. I don't remember more than 10% of the entire weekend and I came out of it with a busted face from just being an idiot...Of course I have a million stories like any of you but I wanted to give some perspective on the worst point and why I recently quit...I'm a fun drunk never angry and never sad. But it got to the point that I couldn't have fun without it. When I quit I thought that's all I'd have to battle with. I didn't think I'd have to battle focusing on menial tasks or sleeping through a night or stopping my hands from twitching (I don't know what the shakes look like but mine don't shake they twitch strangely). ..So I'm going sober. And I picked back up smoking just to have something to do when I go out with friends. But I found that it's hard to even be around it... I look at alcohol like I do at a smoker when I quit smoking. When I drive by a store I want to go pick up a six pack. I didn't plan on stopping drinking for any length of time just wanted to pick myself back up after a rough weekend... but after going through the past week I've realized how far down the road I had already gone...Anyway I'm going to be here struggling with you guys. I need support. I took a shot of Maker's Mark on Friday and it honestly felt like honey going down my throat. I won't allow that again. Thanks for listening. I just wanted to type it out.

Good for you I'm at 7 days too. I stopped because my long term boyfriend left me and am continuing for myself. I've been a fun drunk a mean drunk a passed out drunk a blacked out drunk. But I'm so excited to see what's in store for future sober me. Good luck to you.
