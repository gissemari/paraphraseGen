Being sober almost 3 years now I (26F) have some main things that I've relied on to bring me encouragement or get me out of my  funk  (the gym journaling kickboxing hiking) but I never expected to find encouragement from someone newly sober. My (26M) boyfriend of 1 year came to me almost a week ago admitting he's had a drinking problem for the last 4 years. To say I was shocked and blindsided is an understatement as he was always the one protective of anything that could harm my sobriety. ..I'll save the details and get to the point. He wants to stay sober and has been opening up to me about his day to day struggles as he adds one more day to sobriety with one foot in front of the other. (Might I add he has struggled  being vulnerable most of our relationship). As I have felt him looking to me for encouragement and advice on how to get through each day HE'S been the one that has uplifted me. His newfound drive to figure out how to find the light in this boring dark world he sees has reminded me of how important it is to fight the fight everyday no matter how much time I have. To allow myself to see the world's beauty even on my dark days. It has ignited a fire in me that wants to tell the world YOU CAN DO IT. Anytime. Anywhere. It is SO possible. It has made me proud to be able to be with him on this journey with the hope that he finds the wonderful life I have through sobriety.  ..No matter the time you do or don't have please don't be afraid to open up to someone if you are struggling. You never know who you can encourage.
