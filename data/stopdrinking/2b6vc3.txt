i hinged my life on my cat. promised myself if i never had a girlfriend by the time she died i'd kill myself..in high school and before she was my best friend. my shoulder to cry on....when i left for college she was heartbroken..she befriended my parents that both hate cats..sleeping on top of their couch as they watched tv together..letting them pet her....returning from college for christmas vacation in junior year she was dead..wandered off never to be seen again....i had resolved to kill myself. to not return to school.. .and then i suffered through the worst car crash of my life..  my cousin was driving back from Connecticut i was shotgun..a truck didn't see us passing in the left lane. Greg slammed on the brakes..lost control jerked the wheel to the right ran head on into a rock wall on the right..car kept spinning. three times. totaled...i lost my glasses...i went days without my glasses in excruciating pain. blind...my parents / family were on vacation in Florida.while i was stuck up north. in the cold. in Pennsylvania. alone..... ...i should have killed myself then..but there was this quiet will to live..this indomitable fear of the nothingness of the afterlife...i recovered..i.became a robot..put my head down. studied. did everything right.... ...i entered the Schreyer's honors college of penn state university..i never partied. i never talked to girls...i received a full scholarship and stipend to enter a master's program..it was in anti-terrorism information technology research...i was a sponge..i slowly lost my mind compressing all the information of this horrible world...i finished all of my coursework with a 3.7 gpa..i refused to write my thesis..i left on good terms... ...i became an alcoholic..i moved in with my sister..she kicked me out after 3 months...for a year after i did nothing but play videogames. and drink..and desperately hit on girls..i got married and divorced in second life...i inherited 1/3 of a million dollars...i drank more...i got a roommate off of craigslist to move into my house to pay rent to me...for two years i never learned a thing about him..we just played videogames together while he looked the other way while i ruined myself drinking...then i went to rehab for a month..when i returned he stopped paying me rent...i semi-evicted him..sold the house..moved in with my former two best friends in Harrisburg...          ..          ...i had kept myself sane for 8 months after rehab.thinking hoping praying a girl that i had been in contact with for years would come back from traveling abroad to be with me...and she did..she invaded my life. spontaneously..she met my parents. we went to hersheypark. i drove her back to richmond. i met her parents..  i drove back to Harrisburg..and i  relapsed...i told her i relapsed. i sent her sad and pathetic emails.. .a week passed she needed a ride to california..so i offered. i had a hybrid car.  let's make an adventure out of it'...so we did...a 2 month long voyage. a second rehab..at the end of it.she said shockingly.. i would have killed anyone else on this trip..nothing went wrong. ..i dropped her off outside of san francisco..thinking i'd see her again in a few months...we remained in phone text communication..but mine became . increasingly sad...she got back in richmond in time for thanksgiving..she spent it with her family...i spent it. alone. drinking...i bought her a special christmas present..i tried making plans...then received the email:   something to the effect of  .. i'm seeing two women here and i'm taking it slow i'm sleeping on her couch right now because that's the type of woman i am.but i guess i've been so afraid to tell you because i don't know how this will affect our relationship ..i freaked. the fuck. out..heart. broken..suicidal..things go bad from there...i defriend her ignore her try to blank her out of my life. try to live my own life...it's not working...nothing's working...try to get on better anti-depressives...they don't work...lose my health insurance on account of the fact that Geisinger no longer accepts American Express and lacked the ability to email me this information..and instead has been sending mail to my old house ...nearly kill myself..no one knows...nearly kill myself again..no one knows...roommates sick of my depressing nature..roommate calls my dad...dad as  punishment' hires me to his business..to do a job..digitizing vhs tapes of his life's past...things going good.... ...i refriend her on facebook to see how her life has been..we start emailing again...she's back in california..she's still  with' the two women in richmond...i had been going to aa meetings.and  suddenly felt like a sham..relapsing. relapsing. relapsing...i defriend her... ..i get a reputation for being  shaggy'  scooby doo' the drunk at Mercado's..the local pizza place near my house...drunken predominantly black people constantly tell me their life stories and ..beg. perhaps because i look like jesus...a homeless man invites me down to the riverfront to sit with him and talk..and tells me specifically that i'm his jesus and gave me a rosary... ..so i start handing out money to everyone..being used by everyone... ..i send a semi-suicidal email to her.telling her that i've become Eliot Rosewater from God Bless You Mr. Rosewater... ..she doesn't see it for months..when she does she says her  heart is breaking'..we talk... ..a little while later .she semi-prostitutes herself to me while simultaneously asking for money. for a trip..$3400...i tell her that's a horrible thing to ask of me..i tell her  i'll give you whatever you need to get wherever you're going wherever that may be.'..and send her the money.. ...i tried to stay sober at that point. for her. again..i'm failing...it's more embarrassing why i'm failing. my whole life is a joke..30 year old virgin alcoholic here. please laugh and feel better about yourself.
