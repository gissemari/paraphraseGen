An awfully stressful day a perfect day to get hammered and numb out and not feel anything. Roommate offered me a glass of champagne and I said yes. ..Something diffrent from the usual happened during that glass. There was a window of seeing things clearly. I remembered how I would feel tomorrow that I am an alcoholic and I cannot keep doing this to myself. I can use this excuse of relapsing for a glass and go pick up 10 beers right now or I can make a choice to not do that so I went for a run...I had strong cravings the rest of the day but instead of drinking I reached out to an AA friend and he shared some tips how he managed to not drink. Did something completely strange to my alcoholic mind I actually took his advice and managed to go bed without drinking more yesterday...So I just woke up and feeling sooo good and relieved..! I didn't have to destroy my body and my peace of mind. Sending a big thank you to that friend...

Impressive! A small but great victory! Well done :-)
I'm glad you reached out and had an internal dialogue with yourself. That's a great thing to happen! Remember that you are no longer alone anymore and that it's okay to set boundaries and stick to them :D (was a big issue for me for so long). I'd suggest reaching out for help but it looks like you beat me to it! Super happy for you and I'm glad you woke up feeling so good. Keep kicking this thing in nards and doing what you do!
Feels great uh? And really one does not need to be superman to do this really... i am so so happy for you especially for your realisation of this feelings
That is inspiring.  So easy to say in for a penny in for a pound let's make this a party.  Glad you didn't.  I am sure you feel great because of it - perhaps even better than you would have had you had none.  Great job.
