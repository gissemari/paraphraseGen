Six months ago I was totally adrift and lost. My mom had died of liver failure in April then a close friend was murdered in June and I struggled to stay sober for the rest of the year. I was at a point where I'd lost all hope and questioned God more than ever. I'd been drunk for eight years and it was getting hellishly bad far beyond out of hand. I knew I had to put booze completely out of my life. ..With the exception of one day January 30 I've been clean of anything and everything for a total of 120+ days. I realistically count from January 30 so it's been 46 days since I've had booze. ..I am incredibly thankful and grateful for my girlfriend who came in during October and November and triggered something inside of me to rise to the occasion. She's a Godsend. She's a blessing. We fell completely in love very fast and on the same page about how deeply we feel for each other. We have brought each other stability inner peace and clarity. It's a love neither of us have ever known or knew really even existed. She's the most incredible woman on the face of the earth and I can't thank God enough for sending her into my life...I'm currently taking GED courses and looking into college. My views on life itself have completely changed for the better. It's quite the turn-around from where I was last year. ..I'm just incredibly thankful I'm restless tonight so I figured I'd type this out here. ..Thank you...IWNDWYT
