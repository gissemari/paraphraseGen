I was mentally preparing to go to a Holiday party for the last week. I'm now 22 days sober after a 2 year relapse from 6 years of sobriety.  On the way to the party tonight I decided there was no way I could do it. If someone offered me a drink there was a good chance I would take it. So I drove straight home. I thought I was past it but I'm not. ..Who knew a happily six years sober person could so easily fall into a two year relapse? Well I did and it's harder than it was to quit the first time. I've tried to quit again a few times this year unsuccessfully. I decided this time is the last time I'm quitting at any cost. That cost means tonight I'm going home instead of to the party. I was going to see two bands I love tomorrow but I know the temptation to drink will be too strong. I will also stay home. I will do whatever it takes to say sober. I know it takes time as I've done it before - to rewire the brain. And I'll do it again. I've realized that's really the key. To retrain your brain to the place it was before alcohol. When you were a child without a craving for alcohol. When it wasn't even a thought in your mind. What freedom!..Twice this week I was in alcohol tempting situations and I abstained. It was totally fine. But I guess those are my two for the week. I'll be spending this weekend doing whatever it takes to stay sober even if it means going straight home. At least I'm not drinking...Thanks for listening
