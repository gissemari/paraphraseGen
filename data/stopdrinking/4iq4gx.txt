Hey everyone thanks for opening this thread. Yesterday I made my first post ever here pledging to not drink 24 hours. Well I just passed that mark but I wanted to give a little background on myself in case anyone finds familiarity in my story and can give me insight on their experience...As I said yesterday I'm in my early twenties and I grew up with split custody between a 25+ year alcoholic(father) and a meth addict (mother). Growing up and seeing that instilled this deep fear and hatred for "drugs"(in the sense that I didn't at all understand drugs I just knew they caused problems with both of my families) and I KNEW I would never try ANY drug to make sure I didn't end up like them. Right...I first got drunk my junior year of high school actually come to think of it this was also the first time I smoked marijuana (something else I'm battling with at the same time). After doing it a few times I realized that the times I had been drinking I found the courage to talk to women and get decent responses which is the only thing I desired as a not very self confident 16 year old. Boom I was hooked. I drank any time there was any possibility someone outside of my immediate friend circle would be around I wanted to be hilarious fun and above all memorable and it was honestly working great! I went from 0-100 real quick with my social interactions and I honestly thought I had finally become an awesome normal member of society...Come college time and things start to change a lot. I keep up this drunk fun guy charade for about 2 or so years before my life starts changing out of my control. My drinking very rapidly swapped from fun to coping as 10 of my childhood friends were killed my great job laid me off  and my relationship of 2 years ended in cheating all in a matter of months. This is where my consistent blackouts started but luckily it only lasted a few months as I made the choice to leave the environment I was in and to try college as a way to better my life...Well college is where things really got bad. To keep it brief I had found so much happiness in my new town that I no longer drank because of negativity(I had no cares in the world because of how great my social life was going) but I ended up blacking put more commonly as I was experiencing no negative consequences I was simply adding awesome hilarious stories to my collection to tell future friends. Well being drunk day in day out while working and going to school caught up. I stopped getting good grades so I dropped out of college before I took a massive hit to my transcript I got fired from my job for underperforming and I lost all sense of human personality for anyone to connect to as people only saw me intoxicated. As you all know that got old for my surrounding peers real fast and they started to push me away the discomfort in the air when I was around was palpable. At first I blamed others I thought they were the assholes but it soon became apparent that even the ones I thought were my allies for life were talking about me behind my back. I immediately recognized I had a problem and left the city as soon as school went on break...Which leads me to now I'm in a new city with old friends that I moved in with in order to kill my need to party. It worked for a little bit but the reality is that it took me a few weeks to ween down my alcohol consumption( from 3-4 40oz a day to 1-2 per day) and during that time my excessive drinking grew onto my new roommates. They started drinking heavier than they did before while I was slowing down making us all reach a nice happy medium where all of us were similar levels of alcoholics. The difference this time however was there was absolutely no good times shared by alcohol this time. Fights have been breaking out in my house ex-addicts of hard stimulants have since relapsed and have no problem tweaking up randomly during the week (luckily not something I got into despite my family history) and here I am the whole reason I came here was to avoid this. ..My current plan? I'm taking alcohol sobriety one day at a time and this is a mindset I never thought I could adopt. The idea of a life without substances is so daunting that the anxiety throws me back into using. One day at a time is a nice repeatable and achievable mantra that I am glad to adopt and use to make myself the best part of humanity I can possibly be. I would have never discovered this beautiful effective mindset had I not stumbled across you wonderful selfless people...I thank you all so much for saving my life even though this is only the beginning of my life long journey. ..I will not drink today.

Congrats on making the change..../r/stopdrinking is an incredibly helpful tool I've found....There are plenty of people on here who can give you advice about things like AA therapy and other tools if you're intesrested. 
You got this. Not drinking with you today! Keep reaching out and ask for help when you need it. There is a whole new life waiting for you in sobriety. &lt;3
