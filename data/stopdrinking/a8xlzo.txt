Hey everyone!..It's  been quite a year. This is my third time going sober since February.  I'm at 10 and a half weeks sober now and doing very well. Once I hit  three months it will be the longest I've ever been sober since I  started drinking at 14 years old (38 years old right now)...Now  that I've experienced two relapses this year and managed to get sober  again I want to simply remind everyone that the road up is much much  longer than the road back down...I feel  great right now but it took over two months to get to this. Every time I  get sober it takes at least two months to feel good and it will take  even longer to feel amazing. But both relapses dragged me into feeling  horrible in less than a week. Everything came back. My crippling anxiety  came back. My depression came back. The panic of just trying to get  through the day. The physical sickness. Not even a week back on alcohol  and I was in a horrible spot that made it very difficult to quit  drinking again. That happened both times...I  have done a lot of extra work now to make sure I don't relapse again. I  also made notes of the things that made me relapse last time. But most  importantly I keep reminding myself exactly what I  am reminding you  here. You have done amazing work to get where you are. But it takes way  less time and way less effort to undo all of it...The  reason I feel better now is because I did the work again and got myself  here. I don't want to throw it away and now I have proof of how easy  that is. I wish each and every one of you the absolute best in the New  Year. Stick with it because you are worth it. If you do make a mistake  just remember that the better life is still there waiting for you...Lots of love to you strangers that teach and inspire me. &lt;3

Good post mate I can relate to everything you've said onwards and upwards! All the best in 2019
Congrats and thank you. I need to hear this. I have only ever had 30 days sober as my longest and only because I was on Antabuse. I HATED that month of sobriety which is why I took myself off the meds and started drinking again. I know I have to give it longer and doing it without any force this time.
