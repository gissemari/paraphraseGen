I have been drinking on and off :). I decided  I won't drink again. Its hard to control from the start. Its more better to be totally alcohol free. I just relapsed at this new year. It sucks to goto clubs and drink. I don't know if I should goto bars or clubs again. But what I know is I don't need to "Drink" again in my life. I can easily go without drinking for many days  even more than a month. Just help me  and tell me how to be alcohol free.

If you don't feel prepaed to go to a club or a bar you don't have to do it. Try instead going to meetings with people that have similar problems and probably feel the same way as you they can give you the best advice
Congratulations for the healthy lifestyle decision...You could start simply by replacing bars'n'clubs with other hobbies (which are more interesting anyway).
You don't ever have to take another drink if that is what you choose for your life. Life can get a lot better. If the consequences of the club scene are making you unhappy then find another scene. Plenty of people are living happily without it. You can too. Don't drink today and start thinking about the things you'd really rather be doing. If your current friends don't want to join you find new friends. There are classes and concerts and farmers markets and parks and sports. The list is endless. Welcome.
WHy do you need to go to a bar or a club? Those are places to get wasted and kill time - do something useful instead. Play football read a book write a song take a photograph.
