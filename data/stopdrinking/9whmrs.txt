Dropped my wife off at the airport today for a work trip so now I'm home alone and dealing with major cravings. Trying to take my mind off of it by working out and cleaning the house but I continue to find myself trying to justify getting drunk this once. One of my favorite things used to be sitting at home alone getting drunk and playing drums or video games. I know I can't just do it this once because it'll inevitably lead to daily drinking again. I just wish I could be normal and it pisses me off that I can't be like others who can have a drink or two every few months (like me wife). I guess we all struggle with something...

I absolutely struggled around 50 days. I think my brain was finally realizing I was sober and started fighting me about it. I also get the drinking alone and wanting to be normal. The longer you're sober the more you realize not drinking is normal or for most people it is. It's hard like a break up where you keep thinking what if it's different this time? I've changed maybe booze has too? the IRC chat associated with this sub helps me a lot. I find having people to talk to in real time is key for me. Hang in there!!! 
You stop that! That "I wish I was normal" way of thinking is dangerous and what I blame for my relapse a bit over a year ago. I found it hardest to stay strong around the 2-4 months period. The energy from starting is gone and you've not really had time to settle into your new life fully...Keep strong iwndwyt...Edit: and what gabby said is absolutely correct. Not drinking is normal. I'm normal you're normal we've just got baggage that's closer to us than most people
