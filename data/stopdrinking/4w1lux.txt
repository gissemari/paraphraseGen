Tonight someone said "Surrender is not losing. The actual definition is to cease resistance to an enemy or opponent and submit to their authority." I thought this was really awesome because by stopping drinking we aren't losing we are just hopefully ending the struggle of drinking. We can do this people!

Exactly it's me throwing in the towel on a fight I can never win anyway. I didn't lose a thing. 
Surrender is when I stop struggling.  ..I disengage from alcohol...It can't fight me it can't beat me if I walk away from it.
Just so long as I don't drink it there is no issue. I avoid it.
