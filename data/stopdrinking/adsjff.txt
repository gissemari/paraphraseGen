Hello everyone...I know many are struggling so I'm hesitant to brag but I just had my first booze and medication free sleep for the first time in a long time. It only lasted 5 hours but I feel like a different person. I used to sleep for 12 hours on the sauce and still feel like complete shit. ..I didn't think I could make it to this point only a few days ago...Hang in there. It gets better...IWNDWYT

Ha I'm currently trying to sleep on night 1 of no booze and wide awake. It's been a long time but I can't wait to start getting a solid night's sleep. It gets worse before it gets better I guess
I'm on a 4 day binge and just woke with only 5 hours sleep. I only binge at night which is probably drinking 6 to 7 beers in 3 hoursa night. My heart is racing and I'm up as usual with regret. You guys hang in there. Day 1 for me  again.
