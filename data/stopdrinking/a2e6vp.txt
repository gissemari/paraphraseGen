I never ever had a hard time staying sober around Christmas. December was the one month that i could say i wasnt plagued by alcoholism. I wanted to be cognitively clear. I just wanted to take a minute and say that I'm praying for anyone struggling and I'm hoping you'll be able to enjoy a sober Christmas.

It's a big thing for me this year to try and enjoy a sober Christmas. Every year since I was eighteen I have gone to the local pub on Christmas Eve and drank A LOT. I've had some of my worst nights on Christmas Eve waking up with puffy eyes from crying on Christmas day several times. I am definitely not doing that this year. I will stay home and get to bed early. The other challenge will be New Years Eve as I normally drink then too although often just at home. Not this year. No plans.  The other social occasions that I expect to come up and make me want to drink will hopefully be made easier by the fact that the first Christmas party of the season was on Friday night and I ruined that by getting excessively drunk.
