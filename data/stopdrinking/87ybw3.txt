Does anyone notice increased cravings during seasonal changes? I quit for a year a couple years back and then decided last July to quit for good. I have noticed more frequent cravings recently in nice spring weather. I noticed the same thing during other weather changes. They aren't so strong I feel like I am going to relapse. It is just something I have noticed in myself and just wonder if that is something others experience too.

Yep me too it's not major but it's there.
For sure. The weather is so changeable here too. We're having a string of sunny hot days and it feels like total drinking weather. I have to remind myself if I was in a sub-zero blizzard I would still be making excuses that it was drinking weather. Heck the sun going down is another of my favorite "must-drink" excuses. This irrational addiction!.Take care of yourself and thanks for posting this. 
Yes.  I'm not looking forward to the cravings when summer hits.  I already feel a twinge of sadness when it's a sunny day and I see people sitting outdoors with their pints and cocktails.
