In someone's post last night they mentioned how they realized that they became ok with letting them self down over and over again. This so resonated with me and my many attempts at stopping drinking over the last 18 months. Honestly it's the same with my eating habits personal goals work goals etc. When there is an external deadline I'm on it...but when it's just a promise to myself I've become ok letting it go. I mean - I'm not really ok with it - I beat myself up.  ..I'm realizing I think I need to shift this way of thinking so that I can really commit to quitting...Day 3 again - typically a relapse day. I'd really really like to see myself go a full week.

Give it your very best. I don't know this but I think addiction is so insidious. It eats us up from the inside first then gets your shell later on. 
I can totally relate... I could keep promises to other people but I was always breaking the promise to myself...I've come to realize that there was a lot going on that was preventing me from being physically and emotionally able to honor my promises to myself. ..First as someone else pointed out: addiction is very powerful. This was my experience;: When you're in its grip your mind plays tricks on you. You can't trust your own thoughts and feelings. You become lost in your own private hell. It's confusing. It's frustrating. And it makes you want to drink MORE. ..The guilt and shame only complicate things further making you feel unworthy. You become desperate for comfort and relief from these intrusive thoughts. On day 3 I still had physical cravings and that was often enough to make me crack. Every moment of sobriety becomes incredibly laborious. You question why you quit../ contemplate if you really have a problem...But I blindly stuck with it despite all those shitty feelings wondering why I was doing this to myself. It would be so much easier to just take the drink so I could stop thinking about whether or not I was going to! ..After 5 days the physical craving was gone and I became more clear headed and started to not hate myself so much. ..In my experience it was worth it. And I was worth it. It wasn't easy and I felt lost at times. I tried to find hope anywhere I could and cling to it... which is also scary when you've let yourself down so much. ..I'm going into week 6 and everything is different. I feel strong confident and worthy. I am still cautious to protect my mind which is why I come here. Sharing and trying to help others helps me and strengthens my resolve. ..I found taking it one day at a time helped. At times it was too overwhelming to think about being sober FOREVER   so I would give myself permission to just think about today. ..I hope you can hang in there and get to a better place soon.
