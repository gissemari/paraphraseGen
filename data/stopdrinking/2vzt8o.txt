Is my homework assignment for the next few weeks. My sponsor wants me to do it the 'big book way' which is the column version and also the 12X12 way which is basically my life story. I was just wondering if anyone had some words of wisdom or advice. It's a pretty daunting task I've known quite a few who have relapsed while doing it but I feel confident enough from the first three steps. Thank you for reading have a lovely Sunday :)

Please remember that this inventory is not complete unless we include our positive characteristics. Just close your eyes and dive in. I did not relapse when doing it nor did many others. Steps four and five helped me understand more about myself than I ever wanted to know but there's freedom in the process. Thanks for your post.
And another purpose of the inventory is to help identify the flaws cracks chinks in our personalities which made us such drinkers in the first place AKA character defects - a term I dislike but can't improve on.   Often self esteem is involved one or several ways.   This will be needed for steps six and seven......Good luck. Keep doing...
Writing out step 4 allowed me to finally see some of the patterns of thinking and behavior that had been holding me back all my life. For me it was a miracle.
Good for you! Like SOmuch2learn mentioned the positive characteristics should definitely be a part of it. The worksheets I used were explicit in saying that we should be able to come up with at least as many positive characteristics as negative. I figured out more about myself in my 4th and 5th step than I did in years of therapy. Although that may have something to do with the difference in honesty and willingness between the two times.
