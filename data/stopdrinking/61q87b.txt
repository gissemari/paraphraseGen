Totally depressed lately. I'm a week away from six months sober and that's as far as I've ever made it before. Thinking about relapse but it feels different this time -- last times I've relapsed it started to feel inevitable. I still feel now like I could maybe make it. All my friends know I quit so if I started drinking again I'd have to hide it from them which defeats the purpose because what makes me want to drink is feeling so fucking lonely. Alcohol's a shitty friend. ..Hopefully I can start going to meetings again now that I have wheels. I live in a very rainy place and it's just hard to make myself leave the house again after work when I have to walk through the wet gloom. ..The last few months have been so intense with family shit and breakup shit and job and growing up...my life looks totally different now than it did six months ago and I'm grateful for all the changes but it's hard. I feel like my head is spinning like I don't even really know who I am anymore. Lately I feel like I've just been shutting down not taking great care of myself (a lot of TV and junk food) and I hate that. I want to be healthy and vital and have positive relationships and I feel like those things are all so far away from me even though I recognize that not drinking is a step....there's so much more I need to do and I don't know how to do it! Aaaaaaggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!
