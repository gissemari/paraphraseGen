Bad relapse.  I was injured and one of the only things I truly love to do was taken away from me for a couple months because of it.  Severe depression set in I screwed up and started hitting it again...harder than ever.  Guess what happens when you're already depressed and then you start doing something you know you shouldn't.  Ugh..I'm back though.  Ready to get back in shape...I had forgotten how bad things get and how awful I felt.  Took feeling good for granted.  I still feel like shit mentally for letting it happen...again but I'm trying not to dwell. ..I was given Campral by my doctor but I haven't started taking it yet.  Do any of you have any experience with this drug?  Between the drugs I have for my injury and now this I don't feel very comfortable adding more to the cocktail.
