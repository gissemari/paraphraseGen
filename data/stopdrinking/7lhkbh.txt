This is my first post here and I'm looking for advice. I'm really struggling. So far I've managed to cut way back but I just can't kick the drinking. ..The craving isn't going away and is a pesky invasive thought. I'll be having a normal evening and get that tickle in the back of my mind that I need a drink. Next thing I know I'm at the checkout of the nearest convenience store with whiskey in hand...I tend to make it about a week if I'm distracted by work. The first night that I have nothing going on and nothing the next day the craving comes back and I just indulge...I've watched my addiction ruin three relationships and destroy my career. Right now things aren't as bad as they used to be since I no longer get drunk every night but I just want to have some tool to fight against those cravings. My current best this year is two months. It was a battle the whole time...I'm never going to stop trying to stop.

Hello! What can you do instead of going to the liquor store? What have you added to fill the spot where alcohol was in your life? 
Take a look at SMART Recovery.     ..Their program provides a lot of tools and strategies to fight cravings.  I use their program and I find it very beneficial.  
Yep and you keep feeding it too so it's sticking around to get more.  I felt the same way finally I just had to rip off the bandaid power through a few not fun days and start constructing a new paradigm a little bit at s time.  I'm happy I did I'm feeling really good about this now and I'm able to look at those cravings in a whole new light.  I also had to use the hell out of my toolbox and keep building it as I go.  SD helped me stay accountable and determined to persist.       join me one of these days in not drinking I'll be right here keeping it real 24 hours at a time
