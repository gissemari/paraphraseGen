So two days ago was six months for me and I am feeling like a million bucks. It took a lot of false starts and retries but I finally found my center and I am holding on. I know its cliche to say but I do feel great drinking was one of the worst decisions of my life and stopping was one of the best. ..For those of you still struggling: keep it up. Even if you're "struggling" you are still making an effort. Until the jaws of the beast clasps around your body and you draw your last breath just remember to keep up the good fight. The beast is strong but we all can be stronger. Even if it gets the better of you you're not out of the fight until you take yourself out of it. ..Thanks for all of the excellent support and community /r/stopdrinking and here's to another 6 months!

An attitude of gratitude.  It is the way to be .  For me   Life is always better not drinking.
