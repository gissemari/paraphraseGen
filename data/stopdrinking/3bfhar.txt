Day 2:  waking up without a hangover is pretty cool...I've been here (day 1 day 2 etc.) plenty of times before and I know how difficult it is. I've always tried this alone with varying degrees of success. This time I'm going to do it with you all! Thanks for having me. ..Quick intro:  I'm a high-functional alcoholic no one knows is an alcoholic. It's taken a long time to admit that. I've used my success and wrapped it around my drinking problem as a way to tolerate it...as a way to justify it even.  For the last 20 years I've been in industries and environments that support/celebrate/require heavy drinking. Add in a family history of alcoholism and there is little surprise I'm writing this today... ..I hope to use you all as a sounding board and a bit of peer pressure to beat this problem and become a healthier individual. Also I hope my failures and struggles might help others. Again thanks for being here.....

Hi Flow having a good grasp of where it went wrong before can definitely help a successful quit. Do you have a plan? AA? SMART Recovery? Getting fit? It really does help to have at least one thing on the burner. This sub has been amazing for me wouldn't be sober right now without it. Hope to see you around. Good luck.
Welcome /u/flow59 to r/stopdrinking.  Perhaps in your past visits to the sub you came across the [Baby Steps post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  That post lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  The post attempts to suggest some good starter actions.  Good luck to you I hope you get traction this time.  
Similar situation here. Not many people know I have a very real problem. Finally progressed past fatty liver disease into having actual pain in my abdomen. Decided that was the line I have to stop or die. Good luck.
Day 3 feels a hell of a lot better then day 2 ! 1 day at a time. I will not drink today. Say it out loud when you wake up in the morning !
