Try using The Sinclair Method. Cravings will never be an issue again. 
For me reading *This Naked Mind* was essential. It showed me the cycle I was stuck in how I got there and what was keeping me there and how to finally break free. I never thought a self help book would work for me but I am happily surprised...Some people find AA or talking to their Dr a useful first step.
\+1 for This Naked Mind. It was a game-changer for me. Annie Grace the author as some YouTube videos from what I've heard. I've also heard good things about the book Alcohol Explained as well. I got really good advice on here: If what you're doing hasn't worked yet it's time to try something new. 
What are your thoughts like when you feel a craving? What is going through your mind?
[Urge surfing](https://www.theemotionmachine.com/urge-surfing-how-to-overcome-addictive-behaviors/) is a great minduflness tool to help control cravings. If all else fails I eat something sweet...that works 100% of the time.
