Hi all..I seem to have hit the end of the same road and thought sharing my story may lead to some suggestions which will ultimately get rid of this horrible thing \- Alcohol..I know this is a very long story so you don't have to read all of it any comments to certain segments will be greatly appreciated I just want whats best for my Mum and for her to be happy..My Mum has had a constant battle with alcohol for a very long time now \(10\+ years\) she lives on her own with my brother I have moved out but my brother is hardly there anyway her Mum and Dad live close and she is close with my Grandma..There are a number of triggers which I believe have led to her turning to the bottle to escape on regular basis such as her previous divorce from my Dad my ageing Grandparents who inevitably will pass on in the not too distant future a previous relationship with an alcoholic possible the fear of being alone as she is single high pressured work environment and a house which hasn't had much TLC for a very long time so is very messy and has numerous issues which need fixing..Her drinking habits vary down to what stresses are happening in her life at her lowest points she drinks every night and all day Sunday..I believe it is down to the fact that she struggles with reality and looks to escape it when faced with an issue/problem I am young so maybe it doesn't faze me as much because I am yet to face the horrible parts of life such as love and loss death health issues..The wheels come off usually down to an incident of some sort whether work related or something else which leads to the bottle I nurse her through it then we get together and discuss how we are going to overcome it and things stay relatively normal for a week or two at most then something happens and its back to the bottle..The solution I guess is how to control that scenario when face with an issue and turning to the drink is the first option as I have never been in it and from an outsider view it is hard to understand..I ask her to confide in me when she faces this crossroad but I end up finding out after through either her phoning whilst drunk and crying or going around and finding her as a mess..I try to do a much as possible to prevent it and pick up all the pieces when she is down but it seems I am fighting a losing battle..It effects me to the point where I lie to other family members and friends/work colleagues just to protect her..I also sacrifice my plans and free time if there is an incident to help her and strategically plan things to her occupied to avoid her turning to the drink..It seems to be when she has nothing to do and starts to think about everything that she turns to it because that is the easy escape..We have been to the hospital a few times when I was younger as I didn't understand that she was just very very drunk I just thought she was ill but it also brings on illnesses such as cold/breathing difficulties/chest infections etc. Which when she does not drink she has control over but the drink just heightens their effects..There has been one incident recently where she could of quite easily had a run in with the law and because of it I feel this is the final straw and has lead to search for answers elsewhere by writing on here..If she does not overcome it then I feel she will get some serious health issues which may lead to the inevitable or she will find herself in a scenario involving the law and that will send her off the rails because she will lose her license and job and having a conviction in the industry she is in is not acceptable so it would be a nail in the coffin..She also will not accept any external help as she feels this is the "weak" option even though I have emphasised over and over again that is it the harder choice to make I refer to help such as depression pills sleeping pills going to alcoholic meetings so I am lost as to what to do..Is it bad that I even think why should I help her and it is making me resent her for not accepting my help or suggestions and I think why should I suffer aswell if nothing is going to change my life revolves around controlling it it is my first thought when planning anything or when I am not with her I even think if she dies my life would be easier but that is a disgusting thing to think and I can't help it..Has anyone else been in a similar scenario and managed to escape ?..I would never wish this upon anyone it is so mentally and physically draining it feels like I am living a restricted life and I will never break these shackels..Also my grandparents and brother are the only ones who are aware of her problem but not to the extent I know as I hide it from them..All I want is my Mum to be happy and not have the need to turn to the alcohol which will make me happy and content..Thank youC

I'm sorry that you're in this situation. r/Alanon would be a good resource. 
I understand your situation as I was in a similar one. It is difficult frustrating and painful. It is natural to feel resentful when your heartfelt attempts at helping are rebuffed but one thing to always keep in mind is that it is not your mom but the alcohol that is creating the situation. From the outside it can be completely misunderstood and incomprehensible but her actions are not done out of spite lack of love or any other feelings that you might believe; alcohol is an addictive drug and will turn the most loving people into monsters to maintain its grip on them. They may say the worst things but again it is the alcohol that is talking. I wish I had answers for you but each situation is unique and all are difficult. Keep an eye on your own health and try to maintain compassion in even the most difficult times. I don't know that it will help but it sounds like she is still open to discussing the issue with you so maybe reading Alan Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Drinking can give you some insight and approaches to the topic and maybe she will be open to the ideas expressed therein. Best of luck and as another respondent stated perhaps the r/Alanon is better suited for the question.
