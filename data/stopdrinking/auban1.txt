Hello I need some advice for my friend and roommate. ..Background: we've known each other for 7 years. We went to college together and we went out a lot. We also pregamed together a lot. A typical pregame for us was 4 bottles of wine or splitting a 30 rack. ..Fast forward 7 years we live together both employed etc. He doesn't drink casually. Like he never comes home from work and has a beer or anything like that. But when we go out or have friends over he can't stop. He's broken down after everyone leaves and acknowledges he has a problem. ..I've had my own share of alcohol abuse issues but I'm pretty controlled now. If I go out I only have 3 drinks or so. And he's aware of this. One time he came home from work and I was trashed etc so he knows I've struggled before. ..I'm not sure if he's an alcoholic or if it's something else. ..Does anyone have any advice on how to help him?

Hi. Unfortunately we aren't really the best sub to offer you support. You might want to reach out to r/AlAnon.
