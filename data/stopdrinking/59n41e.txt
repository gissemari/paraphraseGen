Another Wednesday another visit to the alternate universe where the mad hatter has a shakedown machine that supposedly can smell pot residue on your clothes (as well as detect cellphones and other contraband)...It was set up in the hallway outside the classroom where we hold our meeting. ..We continued the topic from last week "Willingness" and the discussion revealed that none of us were completely willing in the beginning - we did not want to stop - that's what makes us alcoholics... Or if we wanted to stop it didn't last long..."I hate to admit it but prison saved my life. The way I was going I would be dead."  (this was repeated by at least three other men in the course of the meeting in one form or another)..preachybit/ comes early today.- this is why a relapse is not a casual thing - not a - "well I'll get sober next week after the concert or the date or the friend in town"....  **A string of sober days even if it's only two is a precious thing.**  Sure prison worked as a rehab for these guys but the man I was sitting next to has been in since 1985.  ..*Whatever you are struggling with is probably easier than that.*  Feel free to try and convince me otherwise in the comments below.....And if you do slip - get back immediately.  This is serious shit. /preachybit..There was a lot more - a good turnout despite the world series being on the tube some new (to us) guys the fact that some of the men were able to laugh at the search that had them coming into the room holding up their pants because they'd had to take their belts off.  But today I have to be brief as I have things to do early - life happens - but it's not something drinking would make better or easier (it never is).
