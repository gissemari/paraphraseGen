I woke up today and saw that the number enclosed by the little orange star is now eight. Eight! ..I've made more progress in understanding myself in the last eight months than I did in the eight years before that. Or eighteen years...These eights months have also been the happiest of my life...Sobriety works folks. Trust me. ..To those of you struggling know you've got friends in this forum who are thinking about you. You can do it. We believe in you...And to everyone else   I won't drink with you today. Ain't that the damndest thing?

I agree with you: sobriety really does work!   
Congrats! Can you explain "understanding yourself"? Sounds more than an alcohol related understanding. Curious.
I hear you about making more progress it's like opening my eyes and seeing better doing things with more purpose now... on a different level of intent.  I've leveled up quitting drinking.  No trades.  Happy 240 I am behind you!     .
I will trust you. Thanks for the encouraging words.
