For the most part I've really been surprisingly bulletproof. My temptations to have a drink in any situation have been almost nil. I truly can't see myself letting me or my family down (or any of you since we all share the same goal and support system via SD)..The past 2 days however really tested me with a few moments of where I wanted to say "screw it". I dealt with a couple heavy family issues that made me want to stop being so disciplined and perfect. I could get away with drinking a bit and nobody would know. ..I nipped it in the bud and while I know others have struggled more than I have it's simply a great reminder how wicked strong addiction is or how weak the mind can get when a stressor comes in to tempt you. ..Cheers!

Great choice on the gym. Each day you get a bit stronger coping with emotional drama. I will not drink with you today
