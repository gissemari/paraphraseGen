I have a brother who is pretty deep in the hole with alcohol. He and I share *many* traits and thought patterns when it comes to drinking. As you can see from my badge I'm about 40 days into my own sobriety. In the past I always found myself struggling to talk to him about his drinking because I knew I had a problem too. My drinking was not as excessive as his but I was very much a problem drinker no doubt about it. So that always prevented me from wanting to speak up. ..&amp;#x200B;..When I decided to get sober I told myself I was going to focus solely on myself for at least 30 days. Then re-evaluate things. I am feeling really strong and have no concerns that engaging with my brother would impair my own progress. I guess I'm just nervous about how to frame it. I don't want to make him feel worse than I'm sure he already feels. But I also want him to know what I'm doing in the hopes that it may give him the spark he needs to get things on track. ..&amp;#x200B;..He's a smart strong and capable person. He's got a beautiful family and a successful career. And I of course just want to see him get healthy. ..&amp;#x200B;..Any and all advice is tremendously appreciated.

I've talked to a couple people in my family and I found it helpful to put myself in their shoes (which is easy) and think about what I'd want or need to hear in order to feel loved and not attacked. You can relate to what he's going through and have seen how much better things can be without alcohol. He may be defensive or dismissive and ultimately he has to want to do it for himself but just think about what you'd want to hear him say to you if the tables were turned. Good luck!
I would consider leading by example.  Do some brotherly things together and see if your brother brings up the subject on how you are doing.  You can speak from the  I  about your recovery.  
I mean this as helpfully as possible   when I was drinking I would have never at all appreciated advice from anyone about my drinking. Just be ready that it might not go as well as you hope it will.
