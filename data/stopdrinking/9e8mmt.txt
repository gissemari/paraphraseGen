Hi all. I've been trying to get sober for a long time...a week here a few days there. I'm feeling strong tonight but am reflecting on how hard it is to keep at my sobriety when my spouse has a problem of his own. My husband is a good man but when I pressure or nag him to cut back on his own drinking it only causes tension in our relationship. I know that I I need to focus on ME but it's so hard to stick to my sobriety when I feel so alone in it. My husband isn't ready to confront his addiction (although he is aware that he is dependant on multiple beers a day. He admits he doesn't want to change). We have a five year old son who is a huge focus for me to maintain my sobriety..but how do you not feel resentful when your spouse just isn't ready yet (or might never be)? I guess I'm looking to hear that I'm not the only one struggling with this. Thanks.

You are not the only one it's hard to quit when the most important people aren't supportive...You can also try /r/alanon they focus on people affected by someone else's alcoholism.
My husband still drinks but he doesn't get drunk so it's not so bad. ..The problem I had was I don't like the temptation of alcohol in the house. So I did ask him to drink stuff that I don't like and that has been a big help...It took a while for me to accept that my drinking problem is MY drinking problem even though getting sober has definitely changed the dynamics of our relationship..
