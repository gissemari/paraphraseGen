2 weeks in (woo hoo!) and I am feeling quite optimistic. I am also feeling (and dealing with) certain emotions that I've been bottling in for a while that are not so fun:..* I have an overwhelming sense of ennui (I am not doing anything that excites me nor am I really learning)..* I have an embittering sense of lonliness (I feel disrespected and ostracized by those who I once felt a connection with)..* I feel a crushing selse of hopelessnes (the future does not seem to be very promising)...I've been having these feelings for a while only in the past I would drink to forget about them; to forget that I was doing a job that isn't fulfilling; around people who don't really care about me; and that if I keep doing this my future will be just as bleak as my present. ..So this week in my new-found optimism I've not only decided to change my life I am actually taking steps to make my future brighter. I am preparing to apply for a new job. I am pushing  myself to exercise daily. I am envisioning and planning a new life in a new place with new people doing new things and becoming a new better person...That's why this week my Sober Privilege post is about realizing you need to change your life then actually doing something about it...I wish I could end it there and be all "yay! optimism!" but I feel a need to also say.....I've been here and felt all this before. Multiple times. I've thought and done all in the past. Multiple times. Times in the past that I have been sober for at least 2 weeks I went through this exact same scenario. The same feelings the same thoughts the same motivations the same renunciation of the old and  the same embracing of the new...These times have usually been periods of incredible personal growth that I am very glad to have experienced. But they were not always without their painful parts either. For example almost exactly a year ago the last time I got sober [I quit my job and left my wife at the same time](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1nxxhu/quittings_easy_ive_done_it_like_10_times/). My point is not that I did those things nor that I regret those things nor that I'm scared about making choices now... but the fact that I felt the same way then that I do now; and that I am planning to do similar things now (changing jobs changing location etc.) that I did last year...Optimistic-me would like to think that sober-me is objectively assessing my situation realizing that this is not what I want to do anymore -- and is not leading  towards a future that I want to be living -- so is changing course away from the all-over-the-place route that drunk-me had been following towards something closer to  the life that I want to be living. That course-change just happens to be drastic because I have been off-course for so long...On the other hand pessamistic-me thinks that sober-me can't deal with the problems and bad-kharma that drunk-me racked up in a given place and with certain people and therefore feels  the need -- and is looking for excuses -- to start over fresh in a new place to try to prove to myself (and others) that I can be a responsible happy adult. Pessamistic-me also thinks that *when* drunk-me comes back (because pessamistic-me is a pessamist he doesn't use the word *if* when talking about relapse) he's just going to ruin that new life as much as he's ruined all the other lives that sober-me has worked so hard to put in place...I want to hear that I'm not crazy; that these feelings are normall; that sometimes it actually *is* best to start fresh; that if I am not happy doing something or living somewhere or being with certain people then I should do what I probably should have done months ago but was too passive/lazy/cowardly to do: realize I need to change my life then actually do something about it. And that maybe this time as long as I don't take that first drink I *can* have the new great life that I am craving and working towards creating...But since this is my 3rd time in about as many years I am at the very least skeptical...Anyways 2 weeks and a renewed sense of optimism. So at least I've got that right?  =).
