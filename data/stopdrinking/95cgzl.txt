Hello ..Just thought I would post in here to express some thoughts and feelings I've been having in sobriety recently. I've been struggling with the notion that my drinking was never really that bad to start with and just needed to be controlled. I never felt the need to drink everyday or even every weekend nor did I suffer any "real consequences" from my drinking. Rationally I know that this notion is pure bullshit and just a devilish trick alcoholism plays on the brain to give you the illusion of control. If I really had control I wouldn't find myself walking to the gas station to buy more beer after finishing the 8 that I only meant to drink. If I really had control I would have been able to say enough is enough in college and wouldn't have embarrassed myself by pissing myself in a blacked out stupor. If I really was in control I wouldn't feel the need to combat loneliness and depression by drinking alone. Any semblance of control goes out the window when I take that first drink so in that light I will not drink with you today.

I spent *years* battling this thinking.  In the long run I also learned..&gt; Any semblance of control goes out the window when I take that first drink..However I only learned after I tried to stop that despite the fact that I could go a week or 2 without drinking I only really was able to because I knew I would drink again.  In other words it was a **lot** harder than I thought it would be to stop.  .
