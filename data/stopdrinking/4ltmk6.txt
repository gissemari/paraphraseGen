So at midnight it will be 15 days since my last drink!. 360 Hours!  This is the longest continuous stretch in years that i can remember and I'm really proud of myself especially for making it through today...Up until today things have felt much different this time around... See I've tried to quit or at least moderate over a dozen times and I can never seem to make it more than 4-6 days before my resolve crumbles something triggers or I just say fuck it...This time I am making a sincere and serious effort to keep myself busy (biking new hobbies talking honestly with my very small handful of friends) go to meetings lurking /r/stopdrinking enrolling in IOP (start in a few days) and not giving in to cravings urges habits and routines that I know all too well.  i.e. not just going through the motions but doing it for myself and really understanding the reasons and process for getting sober...Tonight though I was really close to saying fuck it again.  A relative died last week and i'm out of state for the funeral in the middle of nowhere in a relatively boring place compared to home staying in a motel and catching up with extended family I haven't seen in years... all stressors and triggers or excuses to drink in the past.  ..On the way back to the motel I couldn't stop thinking about grabbing some vodka and getting blitzed.  Instead of saying fuckit though I'm talking to myself playing it forwards writing out my thoughts and just focusing on making it through the next hour or two and getting to bed. .."just one last time before outpatient starts" (why oh why.  I'll feel like shit tomorrow at the funeral probably hungover in front of my family some of whom know I'm struggling and also that I'm trying to quit (again..) and doing fairly well at 2 weeks sober this time.).."But But I deserve it! I made it two weeks maybe i'm not that bad after all" (I don't deserve to poison myself for the temporary and fleeting and imagined relief it would bring.  And while I may not be as bad off as some alcoholics I have had some pretty rough and scary periods and I need to never forget how much better I'm feeling today and how bad it has been and how much worse it could be if I go off the deep end again or even just dip my toe in).."you don't have anywhere to be till after noon" (I nearly "forgot" I made plans to have breakfast with my parents partly to hold myself accountable tonight. who I've been extremely honest with. and who have always been very emotionally supportive and patient whenever I'm repeatedly struggling with this and other issues).."No one would have to know you can get away with it" (Maybe... but i'm almost certainly kidding myself and it should be obvious how hollow I would look compared to the sober and not hungover and not shameful me they saw today.  Even if I could "get away with it" without family roommate close friends my LifeRing groups or anyone else knowing /I/ would know and feel like shit about it and start back down the sneaky shame and fuckit spiral.  I'd feel really bad if I had to reset my quit date and even worse if I lied about it to myself or others.)..Lessons learned... don't get complacent.  The first 2 weeks seemed really easy this time around till today but I need to stay vigilant stay positive and stay honest with myself and those who are willing to be helpful and supportive...I can't guarantee I won't slip and I am still pretty fragile in my recovery and other issues I'm working through but I can feel my resolve growing.  I feel so much better physically and mentally I do NOT want to give this feeling up..  .Next week will be the real test when I have to go back to work.  But for now I will not drink tonight I will wake up tomorrow and commit to not drinking as well.  One day at a time.  I'll deal with work when I get there and even if I have to quit or cut back responsibilities and pay I'm sure I'll survive and maybe even thrive if I can remain sober...I'm also going to get onto antabuse as soon as possible because as much as I don't want to drink in the mornings or when I'm keeping busy I think it might help curb some of the "should I / can I / will I" circular reasoning I put myself through for an hour tonight driving past multiple liquor stores in a moment of weakness...TLDR; Sober self > drinking self for another day but things are getting real again.  Thanks for your support fellow sobernauts...edit: typos rewording additional thoughts.  I'm leaving the rambling run-on sentences since that's how my thoughts are running tonight.
