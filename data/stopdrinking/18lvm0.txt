I just wanted to thank you all. I am having a much better better day today :) Good luck to all that are in this struggle to stop drinking and remember one day at a time!

I didn't see your comment yesterday so well done.  Everyday without alcohol is a triumph.  Keep coming back!
Good job for knowing what to do and doing it. When people slip up it's because they take themselves out of the game. You didn't want to drink so you asked for help and the help helped. Hats off to you for doing the next right thing.
Good work staying solid. Watch closely and that circle four by your name will explode into a star quite soon :-)
I feel ya. Broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. Feeling like shit all day today but i gotta keep it together not drink and get through today. I'll worry aboit tomorrow when it gets here. 
There ain't nothin that picking up is going to make better. You have this in spades. 
I just wanted to say: Me too. Thanks!
One day at a time friend.  One day at a time.
