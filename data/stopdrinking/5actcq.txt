So I'm coming up on a month and a half now which is historically about when I tend to break and pick back up. I've been thinking a lot about why that might be and how best to push past that (imaginary?) line into uncharted territory: two months or more sober in my adult life. I think it's a combination of factors which have always put me in a vulnerable position where I let myself fail. Part of it is that I always start feeling myself regain a sense of control over my life and I let that confidence suck me into attempts to "moderate" my drinking which of course quickly lands me back to sucking down several forties a night because I just do not possess a reliable off-switch...I think a big part of the reason I drink in the first place can be better understood by examining how I deal with people's expectations of me. I self-sabotage mostly unconsciously but sometimes I can feel myself doing it in the moment because (I believe) I try to keep the bar of expectations low so I never disappoint the people who have developed those expectations for me. The stupidity of course is that I am not only disappointing those people who care about me and want to see me succeed but I'm also wasting huge amounts of my own potential out of some sort of compulsive need to fuck up...So this takes me back to trying to explain why I use and relapse in the first place. Not only is alcohol a great way to sabotage myself it's a useful way to justify a broad range of other forms of self-induced damage without ever truly accepting ownership... Why did I come in late to work and perform like shit? Why didn't I setup that doctors appointment I've been meaning to make? Why did I flip out on my girlfriend? How did I wreck my bike and break my collarbone and wind up unemployed for two months? Why did I just wake up in a stranger's driveway in Japan-Town covered in vomit at 4:30am?.."I was drunk." *shrug*..Bullshit bullshit bullshit! I failed to do right by myself and others in all of those cases- including in drinking- by my own action and then blamed alcohol for these poor decisions...To combat this tendency of mine I'm calling myself out to you. I'm bringing attention to these ideas both as a way to commit them to the world outside of my own head to view them as a real thing and also because I think explaining this might give you a better understanding of why I use and what my process is like...I'm tired of denying myself the chance to see my real potential. I'm not sure if I've ever actually seen what my real potential looks like since I've never gone past 50 days or so in my adult life... probably since I was 14. I've made it to about a month and a half 3 times now and I always falter here. But this time I'm more committed than ever and I'm armed with more tools than ever before including meetings and phone numbers and a commitment to move into a more sane environment [which starts tomorrow]...My alcoholic friends can feel it too. Two other people in my life have followed my lead and quit drinking at least for now; a few others are asking about coming along to check out meetings with me; and those friends who still actively and unapologetically drink have told me they're proud of me and respect the changes I'm making. I haven't had anybody try to pull me back into it yet and it feels fucking great...So thanks for being there and reading this novel I just wrote you (sorry it's so long I've been thinking a lot and had a lot to express) and thank you for believing in me...Heaps of love.

Self-sabotage is something I think most of us can relate to.  Thanks for describing yours - it brings my own into stark light.
This is amazing and insightful and exactly what I needed to read right now.   Thank you for sharing.
