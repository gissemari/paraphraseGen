It was me waking up the night after a bender hung over and filed with despair. My conscious mind reacted and was crying out in my dream that this did not happen! !! .It was so intense i actually wonder up questioning whether or not i had drank the night before.. for two seconds before i recognized the now familiar rested happy good feeling after a full night of sleep and the relief swept over me like whoa..lol .I'm so over relapse dreams..

* woke not wonder
Yep I still get those on a regular basis!  They are horrible but important I think. It's a safe way to experience a relapse cause they really are so damn real.
I have just started to have these kinds of dreams somewhat frequently. It is nice to wake up and realize it wasnt real. I recently quit smoking weed too so they are extra intense.
