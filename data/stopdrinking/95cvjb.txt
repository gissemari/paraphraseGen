I used to think if I had a &lt;.5% nonalcoholic drink I'd want the real thing and relapse back into fun Peach-PearLacroix like the time I thought nyquil was triggering a relapse. ..But I've been getting these fruitbeer tasting kombuchas often with thirst quenching itxh scratching success and not craving anything more...Mmmm

Oh man the bar I used to go to all the time with my friends has kombucha on tap and it is deeeeelicious. I wanna wait a while until I try to go back there but I'm hoping one day the kombucha on tap will be A THING. 
I drink kombucha all the time. I even put it in a fancy glass. Replicating a glass of wine might trigger some but it satisfies the urge to drink for me
