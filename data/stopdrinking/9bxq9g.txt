There was a f***-up related to my work today.  It's not my fault for once - not sure whose (if anybody's) it is - but my email/phone are blowing up with messages and I'm struggling to answer everybody's questions without much information and getting my updates from someone who has very poor communication skills...I have so much trouble putting stuff like this down in my off hours even when my email account is closed for the night and my phone goes silent.  I'm going to be worried about this until it's resolved which is no sooner than Monday when the bank opens again.  ..My default response to stuff that I can't immediately fix used to be (you guessed it) drinking until I didn't care one way or another.  I wish that was still an option.  This is a particularly triggering weekend since my husband's going to be gone for most of it for work.  There's a ton of alcohol in the house - I'm not planning on drinking it but I am aware of it right now whereas usually I can put it out of mind...Four months in and I still don't have any coping mechanisms for "accepting the things I cannot change."  How do normal/non-anxious people do this?
----------immediate responses--------

I say  it's not my problem on my time off  and I divert my attention back to my zen weekend when it wanders.  It takes effort until suddenly it doesn't any more.  What do you do to spoil yourself?  Do that!   iwndwyt 
I can't really offer any 'normal/non-anxious' response to this and all of these suggestions are assuming you don't have kids/anyone else in the house. but if you're completely alone  sometimes what I find can help is doing some form of intense exercise but in a sort of childish way - like running up and down the stairs or jumping around/singing along to some music you know really well or punching something (as similar to a punching bag you can find) ..I used to do gymnastics when I was younger and I can't do them very well now but sometimes I find just attempting it is fun and gives me that small adrenaline rush I need..Another thing is if you have a car if possible go for a drive and find some fresh countryside air or drive to somewhere pretty that you love. As well as the fresh air helping clear/calm your head the fact that you were able to drive their at all (something you wouldn't have been able to do if you'd had a drink) can also feel a bit relieving ..I hope this wasn't too generic and I wish you all the best getting through this weekend :)
