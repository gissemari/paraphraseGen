This is my first time posting something other than a reply to this sub I wanted to set a new high-bar for myself before chiming in...I owe the chat related to this channel a great debt for assisting me - a former drunk with 16+ years of substance abuse issues - in getting clean and ready for the life ahead. If you are having troubles and want to talk to someone "right now" there are a lot of great people in there to help you. Pop on in and give us a shout!..A little more about my sober journey: I had 90 days once about 6 years ago and slid back into drinking when I thought I could "moderate". I will not be repeating that mistake moderation is not a thing for me at all. So this time after months of struggling with my inner voice to stop slow down and quit I finally had a confluence of events that got me serious. I had a bumpy start took a little bit to really get past it. Dealt with things I didn't understand and I still feel like I have a long way to go in rolling back what was done. But I've got the time now and I am ready to put in the work!   I am fully mentally committed to not drinking and it is so much more freeing to accept that than to try to torture yourself with the "one day I might...." thoughts...Stay sober have great days and I won't be drinking with you tonight.
