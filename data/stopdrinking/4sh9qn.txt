I've been in and out here (mostly lurking) for about 3 years but have been struggling with drinking for a lot longer than that. I'm at a point where I'm a little bit frantic to figure out how to stay off the shit for good now because it hit me (a few months ago) what a negative impact it is having on my life and my career...Three years ago I had a steady full-time job that I could go through the motions at and still earn praise - I showed up hungover on so many occasions but still managed to meet my deadlines and my bosses loved me (even gave me a raise one year when they were laying off everyone else - I laughed to myself because only I knew what an utter wreck I was on a regular basis). A little more than two years ago I quit that job to do full-time what I love and am truly passionate about. But doing that gave me way too much freedom to drink (not to mention what I do is immersed in a culture of addiction - I'm a writer). ..Over the past few months I've been working hard on establishing healthier daily routines started working with a writing buddy on a regular daily schedule been back to a therapist who specializes in addiction and most recently started listening to the audio program of "This Naked Mind" (thanks to recommendations I found here). I have been to one AA meeting and while I understand the power a support group can have I still have issues with AA. I just discovered that there is a SMART recovery meeting near me that meets once a week and plan to start going next week. ..But between now and then I need a little help. I am leaving today for a four-day conference in another city and there will of course be drinking there (I mentioned I'm a writer... it's a writers conference so it pretty much goes with the territory). The friend I am rooming with at the conference is a drinker and when I told her my plan was to NOT DRINK she messaged me back with a huge question mark emoji like "what in the world?" I reminded her how much I overdid it last year. Her response: "Two drink max." (We were roomies at last year's conference too and I puked on our last morning there after overdoing it the night before.)..So I can't really rely on her for support but one of my other close friends who will be there is not really a drinker so I can at least enlist her to be my conscience - it might distract her a bit from her own neuroses if she needs to worry about me. ..But I feel like I need more than that. I have learned that I can't be (nor do I want to be) codependent about this. I no longer rely on having my husband police me on the chance I have brought home booze. I don't HIDE it from him but I don't ask him to be a nazi about it either because I just wind up resenting him and lying to him and doing it anyway then feeling shittier and shittier about it. ..So I need your help in whatever capacity is acceptable to ask. ..Basically I intend to simply check in (in this thread if that makes the most sense) each day and report that I have succeeded in not drinking for 24 hours. I've managed the past 48 in preparation for this conference so I know I can at least do another 24. And this post is a HUGE part of that because I am actually VOICING A COMMITMENT TO STOP. Even if it's just for 24 hours at a time. (As opposed to just thinking "hmm maybe I won't drink this week".)..I have another trip at the end of the month to visit family which will be as much of a challenge. When I talked to my mom the other day she asked if there was anything in particular I wanted/needed her to have in the house when I'm there. I said no but that I'm trying to drink less. Her reply "Don't worry we'll have plenty of wine! But you and your sister will have to pick up what you want because all I have in the house is whiskey." /facepalm..Needless to say it's going to be a challenging summer so I will take what help/encouragement I can get. ..I have this subreddit set as one of my two default Chrome startup tabs so it's been the first thing I read every morning when I open my browser. I will be here one way or the other.

..one little thought: people EVERY walk of life thinks their profession has a unique relationship with drinking. roofers programmers pianists waiters salespeople runners nurses. you name it if the person in the profession is a drinker they see the drinking culture of their profession. oh man you should come drink with us actuaries man wild stuff!..my guess is that for non-drinkers they don't see this in the same way. either the odd conference is their only indulgence and they talk it up in that way or they are oblivious to the whole thing. .
I will check in on this thread. I will not drink with you.
So **Day 1** went fine. I arrived at the hotel exhausted jittery from caffeine and having to piss like crazy. I'd picked up my roommate at the airport on the way (she was flying in I was driving down and the airport was on the way to the hotel). ..Roommate didn't drink at dinner and I made a comment about seeing how long I could make it without booze. She told me she didn't bring any booze this time and I said thank you. We even talked about the booze her husband is making and I recalled a time when I used to brew/make infusions and the like (it's been over a decade). Fun times but I obviously kept none of the stuff. Talking about it didn't give me a craving...The hotel has a wine bar and I noticed in the couple little shops they have bottles of wine readily available. It was sort of a distracted awareness really like "huh it'd be really fucking easy for me to buy wine if I wanted to" but I was not tempted. ..Went to a 2nd dinner later with three other friends (dessert for me). Only one of them drank - she had two beers. I wonder if I'm going to be this hyperfocused on what other people are doing with alcohol the whole time. ..Today's going to be fairly relaxed but will pick up around 2pm and going on until late. There's a big book signing in the evening followed by a banquet...I think it will actually be a RELIEF to be unburdened by the need to drink. I am around a group who are largely strangers (though I am acquainted with a fair number) and I'd rather NOT look like a dumb drunk in front of any of them. ..Thank you for not drinking with me today anyone who's following!!
**Days 2 and 3** have run together so far. This is the first time I've opened my laptop since I posted yesterday morning. ..I survived Day 2 with no issues. Went to bed exhausted after a book signing and a banquet Wednesday night it was all so much of a blur - I just remember I didn't drink. ..Day 3 was fine until we went to dinner - it was a fancy place with artisan cocktails. I won't go into more detail than that and the fact that I at least didn't hurt myself. What I will comment on is my thought process - and how I perceived that first drink (once it was in me) not as the elixir of creativity or social lubricant it used to be but more as a kind of cuckoo bird hatchling settled in a nest it didn't belong in begging for more. The first drink wants a second so it's painfully apparent how important it is to never let that first drink hatch. I wanted more but stopped myself (they weren't cheap cocktails either). It didn't make me feel any better for having drunk it except that I wasn't the only one to drink (my roommate was drinking too). ..I'm conflicted between considering it an utter failure or a small victory in that I at least succeeded in remaining human getting to sleep at a reasonable hour and getting up without a hangover. The fight right now is rationalizing that "oh I did okay moderating last night maybe I can do that again" because I know how slippery that slope can be (I love Annie Grace's pitcher plant analogy)...So... not sure what else to say besides I'm still working on this quitting thing but every day gives me new insights. One of which is that I HAVE to keep believing I will get it right more often than not (and hopefully all the time eventually). 
**Day 4**..Nothing much to share today except I hate myself and this ridiculous weakness. I will do better.
