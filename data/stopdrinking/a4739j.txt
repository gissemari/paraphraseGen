It's impossible for me to feel alone here. ..When I first got sober nearly 5 months ago it was terrifying as expected. But a lot of you welcomed me with heartfelt messages open arms and words of encouragement when I made my first post...Each and everyone here should be proud of themselves. Even if you've relapsed after some time spent sober it's okay. There is no judgement here and that's what makes this place so safe and special...If you're new here you've come to the right place. If any of you are struggling or just need someone to talk to please do not hesitate to message me directly...I love all of you and I'm always here. ..IWNDWYT!
