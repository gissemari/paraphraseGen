24 days is the longest I've ever abstained. I'm not sure what happens mentally but I started drinking after work. Then continued all day Friday and made some terrible decisions. I have so much guilt letting my family and myself down. I was totally fine all day on Thursday too. Any words of encouragement would be appropriated. IWNDWYT

None of are perfect.  You didn't let anyone down; you just learned what to do next time.  We can only control the things we can control and none of that is what happened last Thursday.  It's what happens tomorrow the next day and the next.  We got this.  
Thank you! I'm definitely trying to move on. Past is in the past. Just sucks. On the bright side it definitely was a great reminder of why I quit. I'm back
One foot in front of the other. One day at a time. Mistakes don't define us. You goofed up but you're here and you recognized your mistake. I relapsed after 30 days once and then went a like a 15 month tear afterwards. I learned a lot from that. Fall down 9 times get up 10.
