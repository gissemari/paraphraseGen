And I feel like I've been accepted into some elite level of the recovery society. ..People I had seen in rooms but would only give me a glance and a nod sort of like "Ah he's here again let's see if he is here again" shook my hand and looked me in my eyes like they knew I was now serious about this thing. ..I have been coming in and out of the rooms for about 1.5 years. Three relapses that lasted a couple of months and now I'm back to 21 days. I have been showing up to meetings daily for the most part but not always at the same time (4pm 9:30pm 2pm etc) and am starting to talk to more and more people that I see consistently there. This book study though was on another level. We read a chapter from the book each reading a page or so and then after we all shared our experience or thoughts on what we had just read. ..It seems much more intense but in the most calm way possible. I think I liked it because it was one hundred percent recovery. A lot of times in the rooms I hear a lot of griping and whining or ego-padding and self-appraisal. None of that happened in this book study group. All these men seemed to genuinely care about each others well being and everyone had something very unique and helpful to say when it came to their time to speak. ..I feel a life for recovery stronger than I ever have before I believe it is because I am becoming more centered in the circle of the fellowship it feels great!

It's not always the case but if a meeting has "CMD" next to it it's probably a meeting where people are serious. That's not to say you don't get some that are just some old men chillin but the correlation is pretty strong
I joined Big Book Step Study. It's so focused. I love it.
