I managed it and I didn't struggle too much. Most difficult part was a couple of days in the middle of the week when my wife was out of town on business. Usually I'd buy myself a 6-pack or two but I basically just told myself I wasn't leaving the house...I feel different but not necessarily in a good way. Lethargic disengaged down. Anyone else gone through a similar phase? (At least I hope it's a phase).

Congrats on a week great job!..Yes those feelings are normal at this point in sobriety...*this too shall pass* ;)...I think [these timelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_how_long_until...) will cheer you up a bit!
From reading posts on here it seems like we fall into two categories (of course I'm absolutely no expert lol) some of us have crazy amounts of energy and others are lethargic. I'm on the crazy energy side hoping I don't burn out. IWNDWYT!
Thank you for sharing and yes we have one way or another felt and still feel the same...  you have the strength to resist that first drink. iwndwyt
