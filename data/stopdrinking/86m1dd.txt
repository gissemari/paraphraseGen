Hi SD..Work has been hell this week. It seems like every task I complete has 8 more behind it. When I make a mistake because I'm speeding through stuff it get immediately called out like the world is going to end (it's not they aren't big issues). Part of me thinks my job is in jeopardy but I'm not even sure that's a bad thing at this point. I don't feel like part of the team right now and managing people and constant complaints from clients has taken a toll...All of this struggle at work led to me really craving last night. I didn't drink and actually fell asleep at 845 before my kids even went to bed. I didn't wake up until 615 this morning which caused us all to run late getting ready for school. Today at work I am flying under the radar as much as possible. I just need to make it through the work day without more stress and more  reasons' to drink which I know won't solve the problem. ..I have a ton of anxious energy and need it to LEAVE ME ALONE already. ..I've gone through many of the posts here this morning and want to thank those of you that take the time to share your thoughts and stories. There are people like me who need this constant connection with like minded folks...I'm struggling but IWNDWYT

Hi 2legit. How's your day going an hour after this post? Did posting help at all? Anyway glad you're not going to let stress and work hell give you an excuse for drinking! Me neither. Yay us!
