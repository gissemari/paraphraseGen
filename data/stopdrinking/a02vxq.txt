I haven't been on here in waaaay to long. The lack of check-ins on my part have started to show their side effects. ...I had 3 sober months Jan-March slipped 3 more sober months slipped again sobered up just had 2 blackout drunk nights this month. Overall I've drank 11 times this year and I want to keep it that way....It is getting a bit easier than it was at first. Turning it down happens more often than caving in. I don't sneak booze around my husband anymore. I love the fact that I don't wake up hungover every. Single. Day. I guess overall this is has been MUCH better than 2017 so I have to keep reminding myself of that.....I'm here to keep myself accountable so I don't fall back into the daily blackout cycle (and also to read other's struggles and wins). ..I thought about resetting my badge but can't find the link on the app... Can a kind hearted soul help me out with this? ..IWNDWYT

Hiya! I think you can message "sfgirlmary" about your start date and she can update it for you! ..Welcome back! I'm glad this year has been good and as long as you keep it up we can all do this! Great changes you've made! I'm so happy for you and while slip ups happen it matters most you just get back to where you were going! Best of luck !
