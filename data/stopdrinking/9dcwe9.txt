After nearly a week sober for the first time in 7 months I drank last night and again this morning. Today was my day off which is when I always find an excuse to drink. Too much free time doesn't suit me it seems. Not asking for advice just posting fire accountability.

Good on you for posting. I didn't make it to day three today and I am sorry about that. I've requested a fresh badge. The last time I made it a week was over a year ago so congratulations to you for those days. ..Try not to be to hard on yourself. We can do this. I know we can. 
You got this. Me too relapse city. Live and learn i guess! 
Hey you had 7 days in which is great. You know you now can get through a week which is a big accomplishment. Sounds like last night was a learning experience. All we can do is move foreword. I will not drink with you today.
Lets do this!
I will not drink with you tonight!
Life and learn then.
It's called a dumbass attack just saying
I've had several of them in my life
