[Drinking dream information](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) from another SDer...I had my first drinking dream last night.  I have been here for ten days and have read about other people's dreams.  I expected it would come at some point and last night it did...I didn't dream the actual drinking of the beer but the empty can was on my desk at work (I was exclusively an evening/weekend drinker so this was also counterfactual to use the term from the link above).  What really got me was how vivid the **taste** was.  I miss the taste of a fresh IPA but never want to taste it again...Like everyone else I was floored with disappointment in the dream.  I was in tears.  I was going to have to reset my badge.  Then I got pissed in the dream and started to think about scrapping the whole sober thing.  Over one beer...Then I woke up.  There was a bizarre mixture of emotions but the one that was NOT part of it was any feeling that relapsing was an option.  Again in reference to the link above my unconscious mind seemed to be testing out alternatives and resolved that drinking is bad m'kay?..Now the karma part.  I have been kicking myself hard over a comment I left on Pony's post a few days ago wondering about the pink cloud.  I have been really happy and optimistic since deciding to stop drinking and while I made the comment thinking it was honest and my legit experience with something s/he was asking about and wanted it to be a source of hope it probably came across as boastful or uppity or at the very least unsympathetic to Pony's struggles with mood...Guilt was one of my triggers for drinking and I have been feeling guilty about that comment.  I woke up from that dream thinking karma was punishing me for something.  Since SD discourages PMs: Pony I'm sorry for being insensitive.  I'm glad you're here.  I hope your journey gets a little more sunshine day by day...My goal for the next ten days is humility.  I will not drink with you today and I wish you all the very best.

If this is what 10 days does for you I can't wait to see the positives that keep happening for me because all through reading this I kept thinking "If I were drinking still I would never have the guts to admit I was wrong to something like that especially to basically a stranger" Shows real growth.
Aw this post is so sweet
