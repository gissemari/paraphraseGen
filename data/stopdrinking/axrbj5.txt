I was dry for a year and three months until the other day.....Relapsed and had a mental breakdown. I ruined what was left of my life and support system. Went to the doctor to get a treatment plant for severe anxiety and depression which I think is the cause of my alcoholism. Back on the wagon again with the addition of a Prozac a day. Not sure what to do next if anything...Thoughts and support always welcome.  .

Hope you have better days ahead. Good luck!
Great job on going to the doctor and creating a treatment plan!..I was also prescribed antidepressants. In my experience I found that therapy meetings meditation r/stopdrinking and building a sober support network helped me significantly...If there's anything we can do to help let us know :).
