Those of a certain age may recognize the refrain from a song....I am 59 days and counting.  SO that is good.  No urge to drink or do mind altering substances.  But I am struggling with my emotions.  This is when I used to get drunk to just calm the voices and the crawling skin.  The bursting feeling...Today I tried going to the chapel in our medical facility the bible was opened to an ironic page \(I am agnostic\).  No peace.  The bible was opened to "Those who have clean hand and pure hearts..." \&lt;\-\- applies to me but did not find much if any solace or guidance...I tried mediating...no peace.  Still feel like I want to tear myself out of my skin......Reached out to my peers that I vent to for support and objectivity.....Feeling agitated and not focusing at work but home\-life is even more of a trigger right now so work is safe.  AA meeting tonight if family responsibilities can be delegated to another so I can go.......Any other original ideas?..Thank you in advance...Yours..Mr. 58 days complete and on 59.

What helps me in addition to my support network. Is remembering that  this will change. ..To alter the speed at which it changes internally I find the following to be helpful..If I am experiencing a  negative  emotion (sad despair anger etc) I find the more I  open  myself to it rather than denying it it will open like a flower and if I embrace it it will dissipate and wilt.... I think of a timelaspse photography of a flower blooming and then withering...If I am experiencing a  positive  emotion I focus on embracing it and it continues to grow and expand.  More like a majestic Live Oak...
There's no way to avoid "bad" days all we can really do is adjust our expections.  And ya know as they always say on this website alcohol only makes problems (and bad days) worse!  Maybe just roll your eyes and laugh at your classic bad day?  In any case I will not drink with you today amigo!
