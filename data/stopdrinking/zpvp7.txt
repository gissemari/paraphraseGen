I did well for the first two hours of the work party.  I should have just left at that point.  Instead I stayed and let myself be talked into just one beer.  Well we all know there is no such thing as one beer.  Eventually I ended up wasted at a downtown bar with some old drinking "friends" and made a fool of myself.  I woke up this morning feeling like hell and extremely remorseful.  I made it two weeks sober and ruined it.

I think the toughest lesson to learn early into recovery is that yes you are in fact an alcoholic. Almost without fail it's the reason people fall off the wagon; they handled it for two weeks a month two months and decided they were cool to go from then on. Considering that it never actually works it's amazing how often it continues to happen...You should find a little comfort in knowing that many many people before you have had the exact same experience. I wouldn't go so far as to call relapse a badge but there are a lot of false starts among us here. Just go back to the beginning. There's never any shame in that. You know what works and you know what doesn't. Keep doing the right thing and you'll get the right results.
You didn't ruin your two weeks.  Mistakes happen.  You made it two weeks.  Now you can start again and now you know what to expect in the first two weeks.  The opportunity for a drink always shows up and we all do our best to avoid it.  Some of us slip up (I have) but that doesn't negate the work we've put in to trying to stay sober.  Shit happens.  We fall off the horse and we can sit around crying about how we fell off the horse or we can say "Fuck.. that just happened... let's try this again" and get back on.
