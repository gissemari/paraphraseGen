Love that AA Agnostica site it really helped me get over my distaste for AA and start going again.
Or pick a recovery group that doesn't make God the focus of the program.  [There are some listed in the FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index#wiki_resources_and_groups)

Also /r/AtheistTwelveSteppers here on reddit..I'll add I am agnostic and have had no problems in AA over the years yeah some folks I avoid but at least here in NY state think am probably in the majority.
