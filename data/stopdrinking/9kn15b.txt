First I wanted to say thanks so much for everything you all do here. I would not be this far already but I'm still going to ask for some help sending some good vibes... The cravings right now are so bad -- but I know that I will throw everything away I've worked on so far if I give in...IWNDWYT

Congrats on your 31 days and be proud you have made it this far not a lot of people do. We are all different but for I have found things to keep myself busy. I've turned into a budget monster which I never was before because I never had any money to budget but now I do. I spend a lot of time in the evening ready on other subreddits such as r/Credit and r/personalfinance just for the fun of it or I will read other news articles about money but that is what works for me. I don't even think about drinking anymore in the evening because I want to budget...So hang in there find something to occupy your mind in a positive manner and dive into it that is what I've done...IWNDWYT
Keep it up and keep coming here! I agree that doing something else to stay busy is a good idea. 
Hey there!..Well done. Cravings pass honestly. I had then really bad and learned to play the tape forward...Do anything to just stay clear and they would fade longest fifteen minutes...Until they come back and then again...One day though....they stopped completely!..Now...there are still thought of drinking but it's not the actual craving for it. ..My mind tries to pretend that it would be nice...The cravings go. Onward.
The fact that you shared about it says a lot. I really need to do that when the thoughts come around... as they will.
