I stopped drinking and I've been on a roll since the new year. I'd just started a new job and re-enrolled in school for the first time in years to finish my bachelors. I've kind of tied my sobriety to those things as well as a new years resolution just to give myself as many reasons as possible to keep sober...Last night was the start of a 3-day weekend for me; I was feeling pretty accomplished about everything and thought I'd get a drink. I should know myself better but *of course* I was able to convince myself that I've reached some new permanent level of control. So I spent like $50 on booze and drank until I passed out...It feels like crap obviously but there is actually something different this time. Usually when I crack like this I'm full of remorse and self loathing the next day. But now I'm really just filled with an even stronger sense that staying sober was the right idea. I mean I have work that needs to get done and I have money savings goals and this expensive habit's just gotta go. I don't feel defeated as much as I feel sucker-punched and better prepared to not let it happen again...One tool I've been using in the tougher times is to remember the fact that my brain is **lying** to me about how much I like drinking. I was reading some books on habit forming and when you form a habit or addiction the endorphin rush the activity originally gave you actually starts happening *before* you partake in the activity. So even though the act of drinking is really not even worth the after-effects my brain makes me think it is. All my fond memories of those after-work happy hours all feel a lot more rosy and necessary than they really were. That thought helped keep me sober up until last night and now I feel I have the real proof. Even after such a long break I wasn't really even enjoying myself during the drinking...Sorry for the long post about nothing really; I just felt like getting it out of my head somewhere you know? Thanks...**TL;DR** - Though I relapsed I think I've been in the right head space that it might actually boost my ability to keep up with sobriety.

What's that saying? "Fail better"? Maybe that's what you've done. I'm impressed that you are looking at this situation so constructively. Now: Onward!
Hey as cliche as it sounds we do have to learn from our mistakes.  And including myself I can't think of any problem drinkers who quit without giving moderation a shot (and failing at it.)  It's almost like a rite of passage and good for you for not letting things get out of hand. 
Ahh yes the old drinker would have said I failed I'm depressed I knew I couldn't do it.  Whereas you've made this episode into a positive - like I'm not going to do this again for all these reasons.  Very uplifting for someone like me - thanks for posting :)
Good attitude and thanks for sharing. ..Our brains are lying to us! Because of all the dopamine we get from drinking they think that alcohol = survival. It's hard to get sober with a hijacked brain when we need that brain to get sober in the first place! ..I've been having a hard time today but I've been telling myself the same thing as you: my brain is lying! It is like a melodramatic kid claiming that if she doesn't get a pony she'll die. ..We can do it one day at a time! Good luck! 
The best motivation for quitting is a nasty hangover. There's just one flaw in using it as a tool... The most important thing for me is my own commitment and motivation along with the definite decision to never drink again.
I had a similar experience a couple weekends ago. Got drunk with some friends on a vacation trip. Really didn't enjoy the drinking at all; actually kind of resented myself for doing it. And it definitely detracted from the fun for me...Even though you drank it sounds like you are starting to develop a sober frame of mind which is great. Since I re-quit the hard part for me I think is going to be some time down the road when I *want* to drink (right now I definitely don't). That will be when I need my thinking brain to take over and ignore / push past it.
Some call this a prolapse. I say this is your journey! Glad you have your proof now :)
Great post. Thanks for sharing.
