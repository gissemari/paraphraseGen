I've felt a crazy swing of emotions lately. I guess it could be stress at work or just my benchmark level of crazy. Only one thing matters though...I'm still sober...***..No matter what life throws at me I know I can stay sober for one more day. I commit to one day and I always see it through. And damn if it doesn't feel like a great accomplishment...If you're new and struggling believe me - all it takes is the strength to make it through one day sober. It's where all of us started and it sure as heck keeps me going...See y'all at tomorrow morning's check in!

&gt; No matter what life throws at me I know I can stay sober for one more day. I commit to one day and I always see it through...**Yes.** Keep accomplishing!..If you aren't familiar with the idea [PAWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome) may be useful to help understand the crazy-feeling swings.
