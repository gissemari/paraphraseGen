I'm about to have six months of sobriety. I was given the chance to share my story of recovery at a meeting last night. ..&amp;#x200B;..Today I'm back to depression and wanting to relapse. I know six months isn't like... forever... but I am relatively young and to me six months is a very long time. I'm still depressed and I'm tired. Getting under the influence is what numbed me to the pain. Am I ever going to stop craving that?

Congratulations on six months that is an accomplishment!     ..I'm finding that sobriety has ups and downs for me. It's hard to get used to living with difficult feelings when I'm so used to running away. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and taking antidepressants. Getting sober has helped my depression but it's still an underlying issue that I need to deal with. And I'm in therapy which gives me an additional layer of support. Getting sober is giving me the opportunity to address my problems but it hasn't taken them away. One day at a time I guess. IWNDWYT
