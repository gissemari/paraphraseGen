I had my first relapse dream last night- including consequences of the relapse...Seemed so real and was absolutely terrifying.
----------immediate responses--------

I had one last night too.  In my dream I actually refused the shot after a good friend offered it to me.  I was terrified in my dream and almost crying when I woke up.  I'm a big strong guy and dont cry easily but this damn dream brought me to my knees...I don't think the dream was a negative thing.  I look at my dream as preview of what might happen in the future and how I need to handle myself.  Your dream is a warning...just remember that dream next time your are in a setting with alcohol present.  Learn from it.

After reading several studies I am wondering if these drinking dreams are our brain's way of testing out consequences and new strategies.  So ultimately my brain is healing itself I am hoping.
