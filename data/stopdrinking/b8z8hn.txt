Hi Everyone! Typically I am not a big Reddit user however over the last few days what has really helped me has been reading the struggles and successes here. I wanted to thank you all for posting and maybe share I bit of my own. In case it helps somebody out there even the smallest bit...I am 5 days sober today. This is the longest I have been without a drink in 18 years. I am 35 (m) married and have 2 year old son. I know its really not much time but MAN it feels good. This feels different too. My day-to-day life is filled with fear anxiety depression hangovers lethargy and stress. In just 5 days I feel as if I like I am experiencing the life I somehow built for the first time. ..In 1999 when I was 15 I simultaneously got into two fairly crazy scenes living in NYC. The first was the hippie Phish/Grateful Dead scene and the second was the New York Hardcore Punk Scene which had been thriving for a long time before I found it on the lower east side. Musically these two are pretty much the total opposite. Phish has long meandering songs full of freedom and fantasy while the NYHC bands had very short very aggressive songs usually about the harder aspects of life and oppression by the ruling class. However for me they both had an INCREDIBLE sense of community and lots and lots and lots of drugs and alcohol...Anyway I was off and running. Somewhere in between the booze and cocaine fueled mosh pits of the lower east side and the booze/lsd/ecstasy driven month-long nation wide Phish tours I actually managed to finish school get a job at a big bank in New York and not completely ruin my life...Over time I gradually quit the cocaine amphetamines MDMA etc. But as I got married and had a son the booze was always there. It came close to ruining my life more than a few times and I almost lost everything. All this gave me major depression and anxiety disorders. ..I am sorry this is rambling but I am sober for 5 days and if I can do it you all can do it (I know I sound like I have 5 years but I am happy about it). I intend to stay sober and live my life. I am seeing and smelling and tasting things for the first time. Stay Strong out there and good luck!! Please feel free to shoot me note if anyone wants to chat. Thanks again..

Well you have overcame a lot of things so I know you can conquer drinking! Congrats on making 5 days!! Be proud! You are def on the right road! I know right? Seeing smelling and tasting comes back doesn't it? I am staying sober forever with you my friend\~ We got this! IWNDWYT
I hear yait felt like when I gave up the "hard stuff" beer would be a good replacement.  Who's gonna say that an 8ball switched out for just a 12 pack is a bad thing?  In the end it's all addiction for me at least...What I would ask is that you not diminish your 5 days that shit is awesome.  My day 4 almost killed me so I appreciate your 5.  Enjoy this 24 hour increment and think of how great it is to be present and sober in that little boy's life.  I'm sure as shit proud of you I'm betting others in your life are as well keep it up and keep posting you never know who you'll help.  IWNDWYT.
