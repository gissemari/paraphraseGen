I am so thankful to be sober despite the fact that the feelings that come with sobriety are overwhelming at times. ..I just got back from spending a week with my parents (only child 29 years old for reference) for the holidays and man the emotions are hitting me hard now. ..For those that don't know I've posted about it here before my mom has renal cell carcinoma that metastasized to five vertebra over the course of seven years.  While she is lucky to be alive she is in constant agony and this Christmas she was the worst I had ever seen her as she was incredibly weak in such pain that she could barely walk and understandably incredibly depressed. (We'll know more after next week whether or not she is likely to have to have major surgery once again so keep the prayers and positive vibes coming please)...To anyone that has had a sick parent you know how brutal it is to see something like this and feel completely helpless. In the past I could not handle these emotions. Instead of allowing myself to feel things I drank as numbing the pain was much easier. I live on the other side of the country from my parents so I didn't have to worry about them witnessing my drunken misery in person but I was not a good kind person when I was drinking and I definitely was not figuratively there for my parents when they needed me...I'll be honest being sober through something like this fucking sucks. I think I've cried more this past week than I did the first time I got sober which is saying quite a bit as I cried *a lot*. I'm incredibly depressed and I want to just stay in bed all day; **however I'm not drinking** and that means that the rut I'm currently in is a million times better than prior emotionally-fuelled binges. ..To anyone out there that is also going through a difficult time full of emotions we must remind ourselves that drinking will not make anything better it will only make it worse. (Believe me as I relapsed after 7 months of sobriety due to overwhelming emotions and the temporary relief was so not worth it when compared to the anxiety disappointment and depression I went through as a result)...So I will not drink with you today and I am also going to check out a family cancer support group this weekend in the hopes that that helps. Thanks for the support have a great Friday!

So sorry for what you and your family are going through. I am finding it difficult to feel the emotions also I know I tried to drink them away. As you said it doesn't work. I've given myself permission to be sad cry etc. Whatever it takes the only thing I cannot do is have that first drink. I hope you find assistance in the support group my thoughts are with and I will not drink with you today.
I am relieved for you that you're able to be fully present.  **hug** .  sending you Good Thoughts and energy 
Thank you for sharing I'm glad you posted.  I'm sitting here not drinking with you today xo
Good on you.  It sucks to watch our parents in pain and to anticipate losing them.  But it sucks more to not be truly with them when we *can* be. ..It was hard for me to watch my dad over the past couple of years of his life (also from across the country with semi-annual trips back) and one of my biggest regrets was how much I was drinking when he died.  I *knew* when he was going to die (we had stopped his dialysis and I knew what to watch for) and I purposely drank that night.  I was still with him sang to him sent him on with blessings but I was not fully present.  It didn't make it better; in fact it made it worse and I even knew it in the moment. ..Blessings on your mom's journey and yours sober with her.  
Your strength is an inspiration...Prayers for your mom and I will not drink with you today.
I lost my Dad to cancer last year on New Years Eve. He died from oral cancer most likely a result of heavy drinking and smoking for most of his life- though he had quit 10 years prior to his diagnosis. We found out he had cancer and less than two years later he was gone at age 65. Watching him go through that and being present for his death is THE HARDEST THING I've ever experienced. I drank...a LOT. I drank knowing how much my Dad would have hated that I did it. And this last year I've noticed my drinking getting worse. Not more frequent- but more intense. Would get more drunk faster with more blackouts. Finally last week something broke. I woke up with a hazy memory of going to my neighbors after being out wondering what I had done and said (not the first time). I had driven home and did not remember it. I felt like shit and had to call out of work. I just knew I had to stop. Alcohol is no good for me. My father wouldn't want this for me. My kids deserve better. I'm 44 and when I read about all of these people quitting in their twenties I am sad and embarrassed it's taken me this long to figure it out...I know that's a lot and I don't know why I'm rambling...but I wanted to say I understand what you're going through. It's so hard! And so sad! I'm sorry. But you and I both know that drinking won't change it. And those emotions are better dealt with now because they won't go away until you do...Stay strong you will get through this. You're strong and you've come so far already. Sending good energy and strength to you and your family.
