I think I have come to realize that my journey to sobriety will always be this way.  But I guess it could be a lot worse and there are going to be times in life where I am just going to have to accept that my life will change and I won't be able to do the things that I use to.  Proud to be coming up on 60 days with those of you still going strong and for those of you struggling hang in there it gets different!..EDIT: I re-read this post and realized it may come off a bit uninspiring.  Life definitely gets better you get more done you handle challenges better.  However and I may change my opinion of this later it seems like due to society and just other things in general you never really quite forget your past or the fact that you're making a conscious decision to stay sober because you have to.

Different is better than what was. I get to focus on what is! Isn't that fantastic?!?!
I'll take  different' because it's better than  useless' and I am certainly being tested in my ability to handle challenges lately but I think I'm winning   . I will not drink with you today x
I like the uninspiring part of your post.  Don't get me wrong the purely positive posts on here inspire me and keep me coming back.  But.  For me it is important to accept that it isn't all roses and in fact I am losing some things in sobriety that I truly enjoy.  And that it may always feel this way.
I think for me it's more like the "pink cloud" is gone and I am not noticing the effects of the not drinking now vs the drinking before and now it seems like life is different now compared to before I began drinking regularly.  It's good to be back but it's also just... well different.  Lol.
