I've been quite the party girl for almost 3 years drinking shots of tequila very heavily every weekend. I realized I had a problem so I just quit last week and went to get a liver function test which came out fine but I did have two glasses of wine last night and boy I feel dumb af especially when I don't know if I'm in the clear of any liver damage bc I've heard you can still have cirrhosis alcoholic help etc and still have a normal blood test (My doc doesn't think I need a ultrasound and says im fine but I heard stories and he's no liver specialist lol) and I really don't want to kill myself I'm only 28

Yeah I am in a similar position. I'm 29 almost 30.   ...I don't drink every day. Mainly just weekends. But its like that game Minefield on computer. Most times you can click (aka drink) with no repercussions but there will be times when you do and hit the mine.  ...For me its basically I don't have a healthy relationship with alcohol and it's gotten riskier and riskier. Health wise I'm probably mostly ok but if I keep down this path I may not be at some point. What a feeling of despair that would be. Getting to the point of irreparable damage.   ...Good luck to you. We can both make this our first day. 
Hey there ..welcome to the group. So if you're interested in the liver its one of the best organs to learn about. Liver is one that gets damaged over time its wise to get tested but you can do a lot of repairing of the liver yourself through cleanses and remaining sober. The liver repairs itself so time not drinking will repair your liver and improve your health. Also need to know the Kidney function is as important as you have 2 of them that work to eliminate toxicity. ..If concerned on the liver definitely do some of your own googling on the topic as its an amazing organ in our body and we need to be nice to it which in western society we're not. :) Such as avoiding Deep Fried foods. ..Time off alcohol will help you and adding healthier options to your life will assist your organs.
