Last night I got one of those mini boxes of wine (the equivalent of three standard glasses) and drank it. As of now I have no idea what possessed me and will have to really take some time later today and reflect. I didn't enjoy it it just made me tired not even relaxed and I feel like an idiot for making it 16 days just to ruin it to sit on my couch with a glass of mediocre wine. ..Anyway just posting this for accountability and to remind myself in the future how worthless relapses are. So here I am again and I will keep going.

Congratulations on your 16 days! That's awesome. You drank you realized  it is not enjoyable probably just  a habit.  Keep going on your journey. An occasional slip up does not define the good work you have put in to being sober!!! IWNDWYT 
Congratulations on owning it. ..You will succeed.
