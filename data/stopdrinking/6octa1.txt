It's been a long time since I posted here and unfortunately I relapsed shortly thereafter but I'm ready to give it another serious shot...Yesterday I had a pretty serious wake up call. After drinking by myself until 2am getting up at 7 then dry heaving over the toilet by 9:30 at work praying no one would hear me... I'm done.  The job that I just got out of years of college to qualify for am so excited about I had to awkwardly leave at 9:30 in the morning. Because of alcohol. ..I'm done drinking every night and hating myself in the morning. I'm done being anxious for 5pm to come around so I can drink. I'm done constantly worrying if there's going to be alcohol at every event. I'm done depriving myself of a free clear mind and healthy body. I'm done selling myself short when I know I'm capable of so much more. ..I obviously have to reset my badge but here I am on Day 2 and more motivated than ever. I'm a sweaty nauseous disoriented mess but I know I can do it this time. I'm going to fight for the life I want. I'm excited to come back and commit this time. Not drinking with you all tonight!
