I reset my badge I feel awful and poisoned and I'm back. I'm scared though it was fucking scary seeing how fast it can go out the window. I was so happy so proud of myself. Don't know what else just had to get that off my chest. I don't know what to do from here.

.Yeah for me in about the last three cycles was kinda "showing myself" how fast it gets ugly indeed. ..So welcome back and maybe visit the chat room to grind out some of the issues! ..https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/..
Why did you decide to start drinking again? Do you have a plan to stay away from that first drink?
Welcome back.  Glad you made it back relatively safe and sound. ..What are your plans this go around? 
Welcome back- I know how hard it is to reset the badge and I understand how fast it can devolve once you take that first drink. Stay strong!
Nothing changes if nothing changes. ..What can you do so this doesn't happen again? Sounds like you could use more support. 
Stay scared. When drinking finally scared me that's when I stopped for good. I didn't know it at the time though.
