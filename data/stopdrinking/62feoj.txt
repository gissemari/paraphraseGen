I stopped drinking now 40+ days ago because it was giving me horrible headaches and I was drinking a glass of wine almost every night.  We were on vacation in Mexico with another family and it was tequila and drinking all day.  Even with our young children around.  I have gained 25 lbs in 5 years yes I have 3 kids 10 and under but it is no excuse...My "creation" is my amazing wine cellar and collection.  My husband and I share a passion for wine and I always wanted this beautiful wine cellar/tasting room.  We worked with an architect to create it and also now have quite a collection of wine and champagne.   One of my favorite things was having friends or my sisters over to hang out in the wine room to taste wine and serve food.   I really miss this and am having a hard time.  I feel that drinking was making me fat groggy and tired at night when I should be attentive to my hubby.  Instead of getting intimate I fall asleep and this bothered him.  He misses drinking with me but is happy that I am happier and more attentive at night with him.  ..It's been pretty easy up to now but right in my basement is my beautiful wine cellar and I really want to invite my friends over on Friday night and drink.  This is the first time I am really struggling with my decision to give it up.  It's hard.  Should I lock the room and give my husband the key? Or is this too extreme?  I am known among my friends and the community as a wine expert.  I feel like this is part of my identity and I know this sounds silly but it's hard.  I appreciate this community..

It doesn't sound silly. Stopping drinking felt like giving up part of my identity too. The good news is it turned out my friends didn't think of me as "drinking bsorbet" as much as I thought of myself that way...Instead of inviting friends out to bars or over to drink as I normally would have I started inviting friends out to workout classes or over to watch a movie and eat popcorn. No one really seemed to think much about it; it was just an excuse to spend time together after all. No one else was thinking as much about the alcohol element as I was...There's so much to do besides drinking. Sure lock up the room and give your husband the key. And then maybe brainstorm other fun things you like to do or you'd like to try with your husband your sister and your friends. You may find something new to become an expert in!..Congrats on 40+ days.
I hear that. . I feel it. Even now at almost a year sober.  But I love the new me .. Good luck. I wont drink with you.
