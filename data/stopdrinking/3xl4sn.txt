Hey!..I've been lurking here and making the odd post since the first day of my badge but have only had intermittent internet access up until now.  I want to get more involved in this great community so have been trying to write out (at least some of) my story but have been struggling with it - I also have a cast on one of my hand right now so it takes bloody ages to type...Since I'm also very interested in learning about you guys I thought it'd be cool to write sort of a paragraph-long blurb version - I'd love it if you did the same with your own story thus far.  Doesn't take too much of your time this way!  ..Here's mine:..I'm from England - on the outskirts of London - and developed a love for booze at 17 after not particularly enjoying my adolescent years.  Drank increasingly over the years with other people initially but progressed to hitting it pretty hard by myself too - either way was fine.  A variety of drugs entered the picture somewhere down the line but mostly just big benders now and then not consistent like the alcohol was.  Stopped for a few months after getting into competing in Muay Thai - suffered a detached retina as I was getting serious about it meaning I could never fight again - got serious about drinking in its' stead.  Worked generic office jobs and lead a passionless life (alcohol aside) eventually quitting to travel on a budget working for food and accomodation - currently doing this with a great family in Southern Spain on their farm - sober clean and happier than I've ever been...Hope you're all having a great Sunday - thanks for the opportunity to share I'm looking forward to reading about anyone who fancies replying!

Love that you're traveling sober. What was your motivation for quitting drinking? My biggest fear is that I'll afraid and shy when I'm sober and won't experience anything anymore so I love hearing about people who do neat stuff while they aren't drinking!
I'm from the Isle of Man but I moved to Canada when I was 6. Didn't have the best upbring fairly physically/emotionally abusive father and all that. Around 12 years old I started to develop some real bad mental illness (serious depression and anxiety) which I struggled with alone until I discovered the "joy" of alcohol when I was 14. I'd get older friends to buy it for me I'd tell 5 seperate people I was throwing parties so "if they could pick me up some booze it'd be really appreciated" then I'd just drink it all alone. I paid for it all with my grandmother's money which was supposed to be used for me to go to college. I drank with friends sometimes but I preferred it alone. Eventually I was drinking more than 750ml of whiskey daily completely out of control and spiralling deeper into mental illness. I tried getting sober a few times but it never stuck more than a day or two. About a week ago I almost died of severe alcohol poisoning and that was a wake up call. I'm 18 now and looking forward with hope and positivity rather than the nihilism and depression of my past. Sorry if this went on a bit long haha I get carried away sometimes.
