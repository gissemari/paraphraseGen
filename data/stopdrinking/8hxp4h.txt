After relapsing hard last Sunday and being disappointed in myself that I could so easily let my guard down and drink all afternoon on a beautiful Sunday.  I made it through the weekend without getting drunk!  Now to continue through this week and into the weekend.  I need to stay on top of my sobriety and keep the chain going!  A lot of my life is in disorder right now rebuilding it is harder when drinking but drinking also blurs our the bad parts and feelings even though dealing with things is easier when sober.  To me sobriety is a constant battle with oneself until you can learn to conquer your drinking self.  .I will not drink with you all today!
