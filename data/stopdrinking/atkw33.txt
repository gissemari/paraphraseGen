Not sure why I'm posting maybe for support maybe for accountability.  Either way I know it will help since this is my only outlet for my sober journey...2 days ago I told myself I could have a drink day nothing wild happened but I had a couple drinks and quickly realized that the buzz wasnt worth it. ..At first I definitely thought I would feel good and after the second drink I realized I've come too far in recovery for it to have the same effects.  ..Bottom line drinking doesnt even do what it promises for me anymore.  There was no sense of relaxation or ease just regret.  Oh well I have to move forward now and I need to depend on this community more.  Thanks for listening!

I'm dealing with the exact same situation. I've taken the longest break from alcohol that I can remember and feel really great. I don't need alcohol but I have this constant urge to drink a few beers in an attempt to "enjoy" what I used to or what I thought I enjoyed. Of course I might take a few sips or even down the first one be completely let down and stop because it's not what I was expecting - OK I blew a few bucks and poured the rest down the drain. Or I'll push forward drink all I have and risk feeling overwhelming guilt and regret followed by an even more hellish morning. Not drinking is certainly the best option.
Thanks for sharing your field research. Its a good reminder for me not to drink with you today. Cheers!
Yes buyers remorse as predicted you were right. .And the real pain is the array of drawbacks that manifest the days after. So there is a delay to realizing the drawbacks. This is why drinking for consultative days is much much worse!.You have come back stronger! Well come back!
