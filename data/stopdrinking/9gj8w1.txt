For the first time in my life. And I am not going to stop drinking non-alcoholic beverages. For all those who are struggling: it will get easier. Of course there are darker moments in my life but I am more present. I am kind of a living. Looking forward to next year! (and of course - the sleep low level of anxiety productivity at work). Stay strong my friends!
