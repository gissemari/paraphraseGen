It's just after midnight.  I've just finished some work for a rush deadline tomorrow I'll be getting ready to move to another city for a fresh start and new opportunity. Last month I got to travel to the Middle East in December I graduated from college and began selling my own artwork. I got strep throat on thanksgiving.  In October I rekindled an old relationship. In July I was in my best friends wedding I also got laid off. In June I had a huge breakup and pregnancy scare. In May I left the sober living house I stayed in for three months I met one of my best friends/mentors there. And on February 3rd I went to rehab. ..This year has been a huge amount of ups downs changes heartbreak celebrations new beginnings and adventures. And the best part is I was able to ride the wave be stable present and do it all sober. I wouldn't change any of it. ..I haven't posted very often or been commenting lately but I still come here and read all of your struggles celebrations and stories everyday. If you're just starting out it gets easier. I'm sure you're sick of hearing that by now but I promise it does. ..Stay present stay beautiful stay strong. ..Thank you SD! Here's to today.
