Hello everyone! This is my first post and my first real attempt at quitting. I've browsed this sub in the past looking for motivation to get me to this point and I'd like to return the favor...About me- I grew up in a drinking family with abusive parents (whom oddly enough didn't abuse alcohol just me). I've been drinking experimentally since the age of 15/16 and drinking regularly (and to the point of blacking out) since the age of 19. Alcoholism runs in my family and though my drinking has been a choice and not genetic misfortune I've seen drunk people acting out my whole life so it's a bit ingrained...My habit has ebbed and flowed. Sometimes (which was a lot more often than I care to admit) I would drink so much I was blacking out falling down and sick with a hangover for more than a day. Other times I would just have a few or none and go to bed. It was those days that I would tell myself "I'm not that bad off. I don't need to quit just control myself." But my drinking was not controllable. Even when I tried to enforce a strict two drink policy after that second drink- I didn't care anymore. I had a buzz it was on let's do this...I let my responsibilities fall to the wayside my house was a mess I was chain smoking cigarettes and pot trying to one-up my buzz which cost me hundreds of dollars a month and plenty more in wasted time (pun-intended). I woke up feeling terrible pretty much every single day. I posted stupid things online and in texts to my friends (though benign not the best representation of me and I felt ridiculous afterward). I was skipping meals to afford the booze and booze accessories knowing damn well I was going to be pressed for rent too...I was not attracting great people in my life. I subjected myself to toxic friendships and relationships built around getting drunk whenever and wherever. But I didn't need the toxic friends. I was more than happy to sit by myself with headphones on getting wasted. As a musician and artist there is so much I could have been creating and improving after all these years but instead I decided to do nothing most of the time. In fact worse than nothing... I used to be fun before I turned to alcohol. I was very energetic and outspoken class clown life of the party. So it only made sense that alcohol could make life that much more fun when I began abusing it. It was great for a very short while. Fast forward to now and I can no longer be happy without alcohol. I'm listless without it only feeling joy when I'm buzzed...Now that I'm in my last year of my 20's and have barely anything to show for it I made the decision to abstain for 30 days find a new routine and re-shape my relationship with alcohol. I'm on day three and I feel that 30 days isn't enough anymore and this could possibly be a permanent change in my life...Though mild my withdrawal has been very revealing about what my addiction was doing to me. I thought I let go of my childhood trauma turns out I was just drunk all the time and repressed it. I can't fall asleep and when I do I'm barely sleeping. I wake up crying and cursing my parents for not being better hating myself for letting it get this far thinking about all the terrible drunken things that happened to me in 2018 and prior. I want to crawl in a hole. I'm having mild hallucinations of bugs flying out of the corner of my eye occasionally or someone walking past my window. I've heard random shouts in the distance. I feel very jumpy and spaced out. I'm still able to work and function but the confusion is setting in. Oh and my pits smell like sulfur dipped in vinegar and hot garbage. Attractive...The emotional toll this is taking is worse than any physical symptoms I'm having but I'm okay with that. I've realized a lot in the past 48 hours and even though I wish this happened sooner I'm happy to be where I am *right now* and thankful for coming to my senses when I did...If you're struggling to quit please know it will get better. It's hard at first but there is life after alcohol. You can do this!

Those first few days can be rough.  It took me nearly a month to sleep through the night but many people sleep in a week or two.  The emotional roller coaster was as rough as the physical cravings for me.  I sweated a lot at night as my body was cleaning out..I will not drink with you today!
