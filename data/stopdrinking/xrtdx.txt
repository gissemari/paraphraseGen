I've known I have a problem for a while but I've always found ways to rationalize my drinking. Well after falling on my face and breaking my nose (a couple times) stealing other people's alcohol (pretty often) making a fool of myself at one of my best friend's weddings wetting the bed multiple times like a little baby almost losing my job and generally feeling like my life is going nowhere it's time to deal with this. Yesterday I was perusing other people's stories on here and I kept tearing up as I realized that I am not alone in my struggle. Thank you all for sharing I'm glad that I found this community.
