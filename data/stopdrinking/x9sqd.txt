This stuff comes out of nowhere! I have gone cold-turkey and intend for it to take. I was not a deep drinker beer/wine only but my 2-6 beer a day habit was pretty firmly entrenched. I've quit for over a month on a few occasions but always "to take a break" and never with the idea that it would be for good. ..So I thought this would be almost effortless.....Today at the grocery store I see a guy staring at the bottles an remember when I used to do that. Trying one micro after another trying to find the perfect hops flavor but always being disappointed. Always hoping for a new one I just "had to try". I was thinking about how cool it is that I am free of that now and can ignore the aisle...No more struggling over how to slowly kill myself one $5/220z bottle at a time. ..Then as I was just past that area of the store I started thinking "well I could easily grab just one 22oz. If that is all I have at home that is all I will drink. No problem having just one of those"...Took me a second to realize what was happening. I made it out of the store unscathed but I did buy some ice cream I probably shouldn't have...Just wanted to vent thanks!

Good job!  Enjoy the ice cream!
That was a close call! Really. That's how fast it goes and literally how nonsensical the decision usually is. Good for you for catching that! That's the kind of self-awareness that's going to pay off in the future.
Nice work staying stopped. It takes a little while for that sensitivity to start to fade. I don't go down the booze aisles if I can help it - out of sight really is out of mind. And as you said you never found what you were looking for anyway. Keep it going!
How did you win that argument in your head? Did you think of something specific?
