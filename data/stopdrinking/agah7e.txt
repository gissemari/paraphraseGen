I ended up binge drinking yesterday. I feel riddled with guilt and like I let myself down in a major way. It's such an absolute bummer having to start over from scratch after 2 hard fought months. Does anyone have any advice on how I can stop feeling so guilty? 
----------immediate responses--------

Most of that guilt is probably chemical affect from the alcohol. Like anytime I've drunken hard; I wake up with anxiety. ..Don't be so hard on yourself. Two months is still a great accomplishment. You dipped your toe back in that pool but that doesn't mean you're back in it. 60:1 days. 
I recently reset after 25 days which was troubling to me because I was feeling really good about things and didn't see it coming at all (I let my guard down from my own mind in a vulnerable situation etc.).. afterword I wouldn't even TALK to myself for three days.. but then you know what I did? I *immediately* turned around and put 10 days under my belt.. and now I feel even better now than I did before. In short: counterpunch; fight back.. and do it right away. that's how you can best quickly restore self-respect. get back on the good side and do it now
Give it a few days. Its a double-edge. U hate it now but if u remember this guilt next u feel like a drink it might help u to not have that first sip. Welcome back :) IWNDWYT
Starting over today also.
No no no no you are NOT starting over from scratch. In 2 months a great deal of physical healing has taken place. If you were on a journey of a thousand miles and made it 550 miles but then got lost and backtracked 50 miles would you say you had made no progress on your journey? Of course not.
