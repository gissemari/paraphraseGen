I know when I dropped the denial on the impact of what drinking was doing to my life it helped turn a corner. It's hard - but you can do this. I will not drink with you today.
I'm glad to hear that you're seeing a drug / alcohol counselor. If you haven't seen [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) yet have a look :).
