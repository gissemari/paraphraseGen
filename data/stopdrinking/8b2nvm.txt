Impulse choices...There was a time..when I had mine..And you had yours..And the bottle pours...You said no..I Fo Sho!..The shots came out..out of that glorious spout!...My memories faded.but yours held true..my thirst not sated..nothing debated..next morning I stated..I will never drink again!..My heart raced as I checked my messages..not again i'm embarrassed..I reached out for company..but was wallowing in my thoughts so faded..what did I do?..Why do i feel this way?..No words can truly say..how a few messages can ruin your day..I sought company..and now I feel self pity..coupled with the shame and lack of self worth..I endeavoured to seek out my main affliction..and sacrifice it by my own admission..I face the reality of every day..My broken teeth my confidence in a sheath..I ignore the sun ray-s..and try to breathe for another day...But my life is a testament..to the eternal struggle of well composed man..As i find myself on the embankment..looking down i forget my plan..and choose to live another day..
