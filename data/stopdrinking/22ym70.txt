I'm in my senior year of college. I drank fairly casually but still above average through most of my years. I ended up dating someone who drank a lot in high school people who shared a lot of drinking stories etc etc. It really desensitized me to drinking...My father constantly worried about me and warned me about the dangers of alcohol as fathers should but it didn't get to me much. When my girlfriend dumped me in January I started drinking a lot more. It became normal for me to finish off a bottle of wine on a Tuesday night. I started to go to more parties with the excuse that I went to socialize which was true I was lonely and wanted to be around people but parties came with booze and I drank. Where as I used to tell myself if I have something in the morning or have to drive I wold limit myself and sober up if I was close to home and had nothing the next day I would drink to excess...I never blacked out until I got home: if I ever blacked out it would be after I entered the door and I wouldn't know how I got into bed etc...This week was different. A large week of partying at my school I went over to my friend's Thursday night to have a few drinks. We had two shots at my house headed over to her house and continued taking shots. I don't remember going past the 5th shot and the next thing I remember is waking up in jail in jail clothes. Apparently we went out and got arrested for public intoxication. I have no recollection of the night and it's the first time I blacked out a whole night. It was very unnerving...Sitting in jail I made the decision to stop drinking. I called my father up later that morning (because I have a really close bond with my family) and admitted what happened how ashamed I was and how terrible I felt about stooping so low. We agreed I shouldn't drink for at least a year. I don't know if I'll want to return to drinking I loved good craft beers but my grandfather was an alcoholic and I don't want to go down the same path as him...What my father doesn't know is that not a month before I quit smoking weed. I was abusing it and becoming dependent on that too smoking to the point that I was high anytime I wasn't in class. It didn't help me deal with depression it helped me avoid it. Not smoking has made me feel clearer and able to be more productive and proud of myself. I can only hope quitting drinking will do the same for me...Thank you for reading I just needed to share my story and have some support because although quitting weed wasn't incredibly hard the smell of weed sets off a craving and I worry how drinking will be. I've talked to my roommates about keeping me from alcohol but they both still smoke and drink and I respect that. I just don't want to relapse...**TL;DR:** Senior in college woke up in jail for public intoxication trying to quit like I quit weed a month ago.
