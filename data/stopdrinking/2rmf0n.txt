Good morning /sd!..Welcome to the very first "[What's Up Wednesday](http://bigideas.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/hump-day.jpg)" of 2015! ..Here in WuW we all share our struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations. It's a place to check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other in our sobriety...**Triumph**: I haven't drank at all this year! For some reason I love saying that. :)..I'm struggling a little bit with some personal things and I think it's a triumph that I'm reaching out so much to friends to ask for their help and advice. This is something I *never* did when drinking. I hated to give the impression that I was vulnerable or needy in any way. And the amazing thing is my friendships get stronger and better each time I ask for help. WHO KNEW?!? (Oh yeah probably lots of you guys.) So newsflash suckers: sometimes /u/cake_or_radish is confused or scared or hesitant and apparently it doesn't kill her to ask for help!..**Struggle**: As I come up on half a year I'm feeling like I need to be "settled" somehow in my sobriety - like I need to formalize exactly how I'm going to think feel and talk about it for the rest of my life. I recognize this is a kind of cognitive distortion and that way can only lead to madness. I like having clear goals and finish lines and I'm already seeing that my life has changed so much in the past 163 days it'd be impossible for me to predict what the next 163 will bring. I'm learning to stand still in the discomfort (or trying to)...**General Chat**: How 'bout that snow! It was fun reading everyone's snow day plans yesterday since I know a lot of us would have just holed up with a bottle in the past. Here's to waking up the day after a snow day - refreshed sober and with a shoveled driveway! If you've got a great memory from yesterday (snow-related or not) share it here...Alright guys - it's all you! 
----------immediate responses--------

Day 5 and getting kind of lonely. I want to go and hang out with friends but don't trust myself not to drink with them around. Ehh...
Triumph: I made it back to Ohio after visiting my mom for a few weeks. The big deal of that was I flew with my kitten Omar and had him as my carry on. I was SO scared something bad would happen or he would freak out. Luckily I had some meds from the vet to calm him. Only problem is giving it to him. Right before our flight I went into the family restroom so I could give him his pill without the risk of him running away...We got into quite a fight. By the time Omar swallowed his pill I was soaking in sweat and had scratch marks.... He normally is such a loving kitty but having something shoved down your throat would send anyone over the edge...Struggle: I will have to reset my badge : ( I really freaking miss my mom. I know that drinking won't make my problems disappear. I know when I wake up the next day I will regret it. I just wasn't thinking straight. ..I never realized how much I miss living in NY with my mom. After almost 3 weeks I got too comfortable. On the flight back to Ohio I was a sobbing mess. Made the choice to drink on the flight. I feel like I am letting myself down by doing that and there is no way I can live sober. But you know what? One slip does not give me permission to give up. When you are working for a really hard goal you are bound to find some hiccups in the road. That doesn't mean I will turn back...General Chat: I hate winter. 
**Triumph:** I had a very relaxing holidays and not drinking wasn't an issue. Besides sleep I didn't overindulge on anything. I'm getting better at taking care of myself...**Struggle:** Winter. Not a fan. ..**General Chat:** I'm taking a course this weekend on woodturning. I like woodworking and have always wanted to learn how to turn bowls on a lathe so I decided to do it.
Triumph: yesterday I really wanted a drink but I did some pushups and yoga until the craving passed...Struggle: I recently moved into a new apartment &amp; its my first time really living alone &amp; I'm barely starting to enjoy it... But I'm lonely. I literally have no friends come visit me because I have no friends. I moved here from a failed relationship so the loneliness &amp; boredom makes me want to drink. But I don't and that's what counts...General Chat: I have a lunch date on Thursday &amp; i'm really excited about it. i'm such a better person than I was even a month ago so I finally feel like I deserve to be around other people &amp; that being myself is being my "best self". finally. ..I plan on not drinking today doing laundry and maybe watching a movie.
**Triumph**: I'm on day 8 &amp; this is the longest I have been sober since my relapse this year. ..**Struggle**: Where to start... I am having some unrelated health issues which appear to be a long term/chronic thing now. It's affecting my immune system which makes life 10x harder cuts &amp; bruises don't heal I am constantly unwell. It just sucks. &amp; I know drinking won't help but I want to forget about illness for a day...The other struggles being the massive mistakes I made while I was drinking. I can't change what I have done so I am not worrying about it like that. I am just struggling with the debt now...**Chitchat**: Good news is in 8 more days my long distance fianc  will be here for a month. I am looking forward to seeing him &amp; having his support &amp; love around me. &amp; the sex of course. 
Triumph: Day 6. Involved in many projects and exercising like a mad man. Editing a finished book. Winter cleaning like mad. Feeling mostly good about small accomplishments. ..Struggle: Endless pit of my stomach anxiety and quick to get irritable over very mundane things. Trying to stay busy and avoid things that work me up but I seem to still get way more upset than what is healthy over silly things. ..General: Happy new years. It's snowing and really hard to type on this exercise bike lol.  I do like challenges though. Why do they call it spring cleaning?  Wouldn't it make more sense to do that in the winter if your stuck indoors anyway? Seems like a good plan to start the new year as fresh and clean as possible and so that is one project I've been working on this week. 
Triumph:  I made it though yesterday and it was soooo hard. I didn't have a moment where I thought I'd drink but it was a day that I normally would have drank to curb all the feelings.  I am an emotional person naturally so becoming reaquainted with my feelings I haven't allowed to flow fully is painful. ..I too am working on being vulnerable.  It's always been an issue for me and alcohol allowed me to ignore this very important verb.  My hubby said that since I've started to work on myself and stop drinking I'm like a warm blanket he just wants to cuddle up to!  He's so good and I am so lucky. ..Struggle:  My child suffers from PTSD anxiety and conversion disorder.  We are a million dollars in medical and psychological debt.  It stems from her being raped by her first boyfriend at the age of 14. And some of it is probably hereditary mine has just been self medicated for some time. She just got released from the hospital (mental) yesterday and we entered into an intensive outpatient therapy program after school 5 days a week.  Going through the history from the eating disorder to   the suicide attempts the year of hospitalizations trying to figure out what was medically wrong finding out it was her mental pain causing her physical pain and everything else along the way reminded me that I have  made things worse by pushing down my own feelings with the bottle. As a survivor of sexual abuse there is nothing that I wanted more than to protect my child from this.. and I didn't.  It's the driving force of all my shame and it was front and center yesterday.  ..General Chat: I ate like a starving child trying junk food for the first time the first few days.  The last two days I've been trying to eat more heavy grains it feels like it helps curb my mood and my hunger.  Last night I made a soup with tomatoes saffron chickpeas quinoa millet and spelt.  So delicious.  Got myself a grow light and some seeds. I'm starting some rainbow chard and radish microgreens today.   
Triumph - Put in my two weeks yesterday after 6 years. Now Pursuing a career in personal training (well it's been in the works for a while but now we're putting it into action). The new girlfriend is amazing. So much yes....Struggle... - It's cold as fuck outside. Like windchill -10 or some shit. As someone who grew up in the Phoenix area this sucks. Also still working on the whole "don't be moody" thing. ..General Chat. - Recently I've been applauded for being a "good man" from a few different people for a few different reasons. A few co-workers congratulated me on resigning because they know it's not what I want and they know I'm going to pursue my dreams. My girlfriend's friends and family have also complimented me for being a good boyfriend and treating her well. Mainly what I have learned is that you should always be the man that you want your potential future daughter to introduce you to....It's been a long time since I've posted in here but I appreciate you all and read a majority of the stuff that floats around. Keep up the good work guys and gals. Y'all are inspirational as fuck.
**Triumph:**  I feel great. I'm focused. I've been taking my meds and I am productive at work...**Struggle:** All I want is some red wine. Because I'm trying not to think about alcohol it's all that I can think about....**General Chat:**  I'm finding that this community is helping a lot.
Triumph: I enjoyed a ski vacation with my extended family without strangling any of them....Struggle: For some reason I am completely unmotivated for 2015....General Chat: Winter is a great time to not have a drink.
\m/ You rock Cakes!..**Triumph**: I'm in what feels like an odd stage of my sobriety.  With certain people I've noticed I've been starting a lot of stories like "When I was drinking..." or "When I was fat...".  I believe it's because I'm comfortable with those people *and* I no longer seem myself as either of those (a drinker or a fat person)...**Struggle**: I've got nothing.  Life is grand!..**General Chat**: The snow was meh yesterday.  I'm ready for either a ski vacation or spring!
**triumph:** went to a SMART meeting and then home to a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's rather than the bar last night. I found myself thinking about the other bar regulars--who was there? How had they been? Were they laughing under the smoking heat lamps? Which was a train of thought I recognized as the beginning of an urge. ..**struggle:** I'm sleeping well finally but having trouble getting up in the morning. I want to get up and exercise and have some personal time in the morning before work but I'm having a lot of trouble getting out of bed until I absolutely have to. I'll give myself another week to even out I think. ..**general chat:** you never know where real friends can come from. This past weekend a ladyfriend who I know from the bars texted me to ask what I wanted to do for my birthday. I told her I was on a booze break and would love to see the new movie Wild. She took me and treated me and we didn't drink and had a great time and a great talk about life and struggle in light of the content of the film. I have had a few friends transcend from bar buddy to real friend since I've lived in this town and I think she will be one of them. 
Learned today that the flux capacitor doesn't work with -4 degree windchill--but I'm sober..Guess I'll go feed Einstein that little devil.
**Triumph:** Things are pretty good. Feeling nice and even...**Struggle:** Work... a couple situations have brought up intense and unpleasant emotions but I'm dealing with them. I'm now turning some attention to improving my productivity work flow and motivation...**Snow!** Chinook winds melted everything around my house yesterday. So much for skiing or sledding in the yard :(
Triumph: Made it to a meeting this morning when I thought I wasn't going to be able to today because my schedule is really hectic. That I just made myself get up and do it without making an excuse (usually I hate being late so I don't bother going at all) maybe small but it's a big thing to me. ..Struggle: found out yesterday I'm going to have to write a 25 page paper in probably less than 2 weeks while having to take a rigorous prep course. My fear of failing being a complete f**k up and people thinking I'm a complete f**k up is kicking in. I've come so far I feel like if I don't finish my plan I'm a complete failure...General chat: I managed to get my morning oatmeal the right consistency and not make it super dry. I think the key is adding more water to boil/cook the oats instead of adding less to make it cook faster...P.S. thanks for posting the format I really liked it :-)
**Triumph**: My blood results turned out to be okay. I was a bit scared because even though I'm young my doctor said my heavy daily drinking over the past years could still have done quite some damage. But almost everything including my vitamin levels seems normal. My liver function is a little high though but she told me that will easily turn back to normal in a month or two. ..**Struggle**: Saw a psychiatrist for the first time today. That on itself was not so much a struggle she was really nice and it's much easier talking about my feelings with a stranger. But the whole poking around in my past and trust issues was kinda hard. However it's time I start dealing with all those suppressed emotions and in some way I'm already looking forward to seeing her again next week. ..**General Chat**: Watched Gone Girl this afternoon. I thought it was really really good. One of the best movies I've watched in a very long time :)
Triumph: Tomorrow makes 2 weeks of sobriety..Struggle: I'm taking a job in Los Angeles and moving on Saturday. I'm scared that I will feel pressured to drink as it is very much expected in my line of work.
**Triumph:**  I marked my 1 year sober date (10/5/15) in my planner.  IN PEN.  I had been afraid to do it for fear I would slip up but suddenly I have so much confidence in my sobriety...**Struggle:**  Trying to quit smoking.  FML...**General Chat:**  I survived 10 earthquakes yesterday/this morning!
Triumph-Just did the math and SO is 19 years sober.  Gave him a huge pat on the back for this.  Not my triumph but worth sharing for me!.Struggle-Kinda funny.  I got instructions from my therapist this morning to go and have some fun. Not sure what to do when it's 20 degrees out but there is no snow to play in.  Any ideas?  I love being outside but brrrr and nothing to play with..General chit chat-What is the point of this cold without any snow?  And why is my darn kids school district the only one not delayed I sooooo want to sleep in. :)
First time poster hope to visit this sub more often now that I know it exists...Triumph: Next month is my 1st year anniversary of putting down booze! And I fought the DMV and won my right to drive again yesterday! (If bureaucrats and layers of automated phone lines don't drive you to drink I think you can handle almost anything at this point.)..Struggle: ...my car won't start. Blasted cold...General Chat: I'd love to post my story sometime and tell everyone what got me from crippling alcoholic to straight edge. So stay tuned!
