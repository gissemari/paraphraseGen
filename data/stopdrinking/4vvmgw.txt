Day 2 over and done.. I struggled the last two hours before the stores closed in my town. I was convincing myself to go but I kept myself preoccupied and once the time past where it wasn't even possible to buy alcohol I felt really good. I'm looking forward to waking up again with some energy in only 48 hours in but I feel energy finally coming back to me and the sleep is improving.

Congratulations on getting through day 2. The first few days are the hardest.
Congratulations! It will be great to wake up tomorrow sober. It does feel good. :) 
Nice work on 2 days! Keeping busy or preoccupied is definitely what helped to save me. And of course I was always here on SD :).
The main goal for the day is going to bed sober.  You may have obsessed over getting 'some' but you didn't!  You'll wake up tomorrow feeling very happy.  Great Job!!    .I remember feeling actually surprised when the first 'urge' had past --and I had four perfectly organized drawers to boot! The more times I resisted the urge the less power I gave it.  And if it didn't get easier I would not be at 339-Days today!    .Keep fighting the good fight!
