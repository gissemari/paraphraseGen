 - this isnt a secret or anything but not something I can talk about - ..I haven't had any real trouble quitting drinking. Not like all my friends have. I haven't spent an entire day fighting the urge I haven't impulsively broken sobriety (though i did have a drink when someone died). ..I haven't struggled with quitting. Even though my last house was named after my Natty Daddy habit. Because sometimes we joke about those of us who barely made it out alive. But it isn't really a joke because one of us didn't make it out alive. ..I still hear how him *begging me* to help him. I remember those 3 nights he asked crystal clear. I decided to quit with the love of my life and it fucking killed him. ..I don't struggle to stay sober. I have had absolutely no issue committing to it. How can I? This is my last commitment to the love of my life. This is the last thing I can do to show my love for him. How can I continue to drink after that? I felt guilt for a lot of things but going back to alcohol after we had been attempting to quit together was up there. It felt like I was betraying him. ..No i dont have a hard time saying no to a drink. But I have a hard time wondering why he isnt here. I have a hard time wondering why we all get to be sober. I have a hard time wondering why I had to want a sober life which I directly blame for his death sometimes. I have a hard time watching other people his age and older continue to live as alcoholics. I have a hard time watching us all sober up feel better act better get our shit together without him. And seeing those who have permanent health problems from it now like he would have. I have a hard time watching our dog. ...Idk. I guess it looks really easy for me. I just had to vent. Most of the time I tell people I just got out of control (which isn't untrue). But in all honestly i quit a year to the date he died in his honor. It got so bad for me because of his death. But i cant talk about it. I just say how I'm blessed blessed to have friends i resent for living blessed to have a dog who breaks my heart blessed to find it easy to do something a year later. Its not like I lie to people i just leave a lot out. ..

This is sad and not sad. I'm sorry for your loss. Kudos for your recovery in his honor. 
Survivors' Guilt... it's been on my mind lately too.  All I can do is be supportive of the people who need encouragement who are actively looking for a way out of the darkness and at least let them know that light really is a thing.  
That's a lot to carry. I'm so sorry &amp; I hope you can find some peace with it.
