I'm glad to have SD and I think it's the reason I've made it this long.  Mostly everyone in my life knows I don't drink now but I've never mentioned days or months to anyone so this is really my opportunity to reflect on the past year and what it has meant for me.  Everyone here has helped me to reach this milestone.  I do not really talk much about not drinking in real life and I don't go to AA or have a therapist.  I depend on you all you are very important.  Your shared experiences trials and triumphs falls and victories have paved this road.  Thank you...And for those that want to know what a year feels like; it's different than I imagined it.  .I thought that not drinking would be less fun.  In some ways this is true.  I'm working harder at making important changes in life to obtain goals and hopefully build a life that I am still trying to define.  I plan fun events and do things that I truly enjoy but there is less of the small fucking-off type of fun that I used to do.  Not drinking has allowed my focus to shift to things that were making me truly miserable and work to change them rather than escaping from them temporarily. ..I thought that I would be motivated to get in shape lose a ton of weight have all sorts of time to do my hobbies and be healthier.  While this is true to some extent there is less of a difference in these areas than I'd imagined.  Again this is due to working hard at other things mainly my career and family...I thought I'd be happier and I am but in the way that I am less hopeless and miserable though still a little hopeless and miserable.  The times of joy do come and go and I feel them intensely and appreciate them more.  ..I feel a desire to continue to not drink.  This surprised me as I always assumed that not-drinking would be a struggle and that I would want to drink and just not allow myself to.  I really don't want to drink.  Sure I have the occasional craving or romantic notion of a drink but my brain has finally gotten the message that drinking is not a good thing for me that the idea of it is always better than the reality.  I can remember the feeling of need the control that alcohol had over me and I don't want that anymore...My feelings are different.  I feel less fear panic shame and anxiety.  I am less defensive.  I am feeling better about myself and allowing myself to be flawed to see my shortcomings and hope to improve them. But I am okay with who I am.  I am not the same person I was when I did stupid shit in the past and I am sure I will do new stupid shit but it will be better and I will grow with it...So thank you again!  [Sparkle Cheers](http://i.imgur.com/nCZbq0l.jpg) to you..

Thank you for sharing your reflections. I hope to find myself in a similar place when I reach one year. What you said about getting in shape hobbies etc. rings true for me. I keep thinking I'll become this super human in sobriety. In reality I'm just more focused on my career and relationships. Sparkle Cheers!
Very interesting post! A quit heavy drinking ( 81 days!!! ) but Im still smoking dope... actualy I smoke more than before...But your post made me think about a life without ANY DRUGS .... When I quit smoking cigaretes ( 15 years ago ) I tought that I did something so big that I was " free " to other drugs... than came alchohol and the hangovers withdrawals dangerous situations etc... I will not drink with you today... and maybe one day I will not use any drugs with you also...
Congratulations on one year great job! Thank you for sharing. I will not drink with you today    
***Congratulations!***..&gt; My feelings are different. I feel less fear panic shame and anxiety. I am less defensive. I am feeling better about myself and allowing myself to be flawed to see my shortcomings and hope to improve them. But I am okay with who I am...This is awesome! I feel very much this same way. Admitting I am human and flawed has been very freeing. I *don't* have all the answers and **that's okay**. As long as we continue to improve ourselves and aren't stagnant (like while I was drunk) I feel we're on the right path. ..Keep it up! You're doing amazing things. I won't drink with you!
