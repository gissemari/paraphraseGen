I truly believe that the fact that we are here reading and writing on this page means that the worst is behind us. We have experienced a shift in point of view and no matter how slow it seems we are becoming better people. We used to accept misery as part of our daily routine but we now call it a relapse. Please don't be so hard on yourself when you slip up. You are traveling on the right path. Cheers to sobreity! Pop a Seltzer for me. (sober since October 12th.)

I love this! Misery truly was routine. Wow thank you :) IWNDWYT 
This is awesome. And this is why I love these kinds of recovery communities -- we are a bunch of people just trying to do better. I will not drink with you today.
Wow this was just what I needed to hear thanks!
Definitely!!
Well said.
