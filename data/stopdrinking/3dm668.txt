Last night I talked to my counselor who I've been seeing about family issues/depression.  I told him that I'd come to the conclusion that I was an alcoholic. ..He helped me identify when I started drinking when I started drinking heavily and when I went off the rails. Mind you I was a highly functional alcoholic. I kept my drinking largely private and off the clock. ..That said he also tasked me with getting into AA. I told him about the SD forum and how it is helping me (and it is) but he also pointed out that I'm anonymous here. If I don't sign on tomorrow - no one is going to call my house and say "Hey - I haven't seen you at the meeting." While AA is anonymous it is also face to face and has real world interactions. And I can get a support group locally and I can get a sponsor and working the 12 steps will be beneficial.  All good advice. ..He also said stuff that I hated hearing. I need to make a plan for if/when I relapse. Alcoholics relapse. My family is my support network for being an alcoholic. They have helped enable me to drink and we need to change that dynamic.  My drinking is a part of the family issues - not necessarily a cause but possibly.  The drinking is part and parcel of who I am/was and permeates all aspects of my life.  ..Accountability. Ouch. ..So I'm three weeks sober and happy to be there. But I walked into that meeting thinking "I've got this licked!" and walked out thinking "Don't get cocky old man." ..I'm not going to drink today. I'm going to find a meeting to get to today or tomorrow. I'm going to try to stay accountable and keep in mind that this is a journey that is far from over.
