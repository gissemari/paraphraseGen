So for the past 2ish years I have been actively trying to permanently quit alcohol. I have had ups and downs the whole 2ish years but I have not given up. ..I keep relapsing. Sometimes for days weeks or even months drinking daily followed by periods of sobriety. My number of days sober are something like this.... 32 7 100 14 7 20 12 7 7 14 7 14 12 and now 2... I get really depressed when I relapse until  I add up the numbers of days sober and realize that I have been sober for practically 1 year of the past 2! That is a huge achievement! ..Long story short don't get discouraged when or if you relapse. Those days off alcohol still count you have not lost them.

They add up !
Thanks. I needed this. ..
Of course they do!
Another relapse behind me as I nurse another dreaded hangover and this helps me feel a little better. Thank you
Quite right. 365/720 days spent sober is much better than 0/720
This is brilliant. I'm going to share with my partner...so true! "How do you kick the habit? Fall down 7 times get up 8."..Seriously you gave your body a lot of breaks in those two years and your liver pancreas etc. are definitely thanking you. 
This is so true. I wish I had kept track of stuff even if it was a couple days. I did 47 and 57 Days last year so it was almost 1/3 of a year which is very encouraging. But I was reading all my old posts just now and feeling horrible about how hard it actually was looking back on it. Same sort of cringe as when I would regret a binge. Like when I would remember the creepy feeling I had to fight when getting through a spot I got really anxious.
