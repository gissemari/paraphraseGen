Thanks to my drinking over the last few years I don't really have a supportive group of friends I can just "hang" with. In fact all I really have now are bar buddies. Now here on the weekend I want to just kick back and let off some steam. A change of pace from the rest of the week. After having built my life around alcohol as an escape I find that I am at a bit of a loss on what to do with myself. Netflix gets a little dull after a while. haha..It will likely be a battle tonight against that part of me that wants to make a short sighted snap decision to do something I will regret tomorrow. That said I will **NOT** drink. In the morning I will wake up refreshed and enjoy my coffee while checking-in on tomorrow's thread and smile at the "12 days" on my flair. I **will** do this...**EDIT**: Thanks for the tips and support everyone! I've decided to put myself to bed at a decent time so I will see you on the check-in thread in the morning!

You totally can do it man don't let that little part of your brain get the best of you. I support you and have a good weekend! 
Hi Johan.What you wrote is 100% me to a tee. (bar buddies stress escape.).And like you I will NOT drink tonight and we will BOTH look forward to making our pledge on Saturday morning with a clear head and seeing another day added on 'our flair'!....With this time under my belt albeit 2-wks I believe it's easier not to drink because I do not know when I would have anymore motivation to try to stop again...I truly feel great and I'm sure you do to.  Hang in there; we're in this together my friend!.Blessings.Lisa
I will not drink tonight in solidarity with you =) .I found making some tea putting on music and going to town on puzzles lego sets etc to be helpful in the beginning. I also started getting back into reading for fun instead of doing it because I had to (student here). I hope your night goes smoothly and I believe there's an SD chat floating around here somewhere in case you find yourself wanting to talk to people who have been through this. Take it easy!
Have you tried out any meetings? I struggled a lot with the loss of friends early in sobriety (and still get a bit stir crazy on Friday nights to be honest) but my favorite AA meeting is at 8pm tonight I'm meeting people for tacos first then hitting up a band at a bar venue WITH a group of sober friends. I tried to go to bars sober at first it just sucked way too hard and it confused my brain and I'm glad I have sober friends now. I met them in AA I have no clue where else I possibly could have gone to find them. I need social interaction as part of my life it sounds like you do too. Just take a deep breath and find new people to chill with. It won't happen overnight but it probably will happen faster than you think and the relationship with your friends will be of a higher quality and more fulfilling than the bar buddies. Good luck.
Hey if you need a phone number to call PM me and you can call mine.  Anything but drink. ..Stay with it!  Did you know that Magic the Gathering has a new set coming out?  It looks to be really cool.  ..Don't know what that is?  Look into it!  It's pretty neat. ..Or research how they make those rugs that look like tshirts all tied together. Or what kind of shoe is best for what kind of activity. ..Or why all porcelain is white. ..Or something else. Maybe just choose to learn something!  I don't know. ..Just don't drink. 
I replaced drinking nights with hobbies (music) and video games. I can only watch so much tv. Video games are great because they require some interaction and it's not as easy for your mind to wander and start thinking about booze..My weekends are waaaaay more laid back and relaxing than before now although I get much more done than I used to. It was a big adjustment but now I really prefer sober weekends - no contest! It actually feels like a weekend rather than just a blurry bender to recover from on Monday morning.
Video games! It helps me keep my mind occupied at night :)
You like podcasts? Or are you interested in podcasts? As an alternative to netflix I can recommend some really entertaining ones or ones that are very specific. 
dude books! books are awesome!
You'll feel so good when you wake up this morning ! Well done for making it. .The hardest I found was to change the habit of having a drink in my hand in the first weeks . Find something to do. Hobbies movies games sports. When you get into a proper new routine you'll find that you don't even have anymore time for that shit ! .Good luck. 
Like you I used alcohol as an escape. I too am getting cravings when I feel like I need that glass of wine to start my relaxation. What I have been doing is replacing the glass (or in my case what would end up being 2 bottles haha!) of wine with something else--a hot bubble bath with relaxing music and candles a walk around the neighborhood a glass of chocolate milk. It works to distract me and help me relax.
