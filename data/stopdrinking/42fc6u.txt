I was reminded this afternoon about the importance of keeping yourself with sober people at sober places. When everyone around you is drinking heavily it is much more tempting and nearly impossible to stay sober. I've been working on getting sober for almost 9 months and have relapsed several times since including recently. Today I was committed to staying sober for good but I'm starting to realize that there are some people and situations that I'm going to need to cut out of my life entirely for at least a few months until I get myself on track. I don't want to be at a bar anymore surrounded by drunk friends whose only thought is to drink more. That's not worth it for my own health. I don't want to be tempted to "catch up" to them or worry that I'm standing out for not drinking. Eventually maybe I'll get to the point where I can safely do that. But not yet. It's just not worth it.

I think you're absolutely right. I sometimes order carryout from a nearby restaurant and the payment and pickup happens in the bar which is usually crowded. It doesn't tempt me to drink but still makes me uncomfortable enough that I don't sit down. There are places I don't belong!
Great post.   To stay sober i had to change my life.   Its not about just not picking up a drink.
Oh the "catch up" game. That was killer for me especially if my spouse was drinking.  You've gained some important knowledge - best to remove yourself from situations you've already found to be too tempting. Time to find some new distractions in your life. My husband is back playing guitar and I've picked up some new hobbies too. I keep my hands busy and they can't reach for a glass... that's plan anyway.  Congrats on learning something important about  your own sobriety and good luck!
