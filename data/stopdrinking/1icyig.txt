Hi..This isn't my story or anything.  I will only say that I've drank too much for the past decade and struggled to curb it for quite a while...It was time to quit (again -- previous attempts always ended up being rationalized into "breaks" rather than quitting and it'd start up slowly again but sure enough end up habitual and regular)...I did something I hadn't done before.  I took the last beer in my fridge.  I looked at my girlfriend.  And I said I'm going to pour this out.  I want you to watch me.  And when I'm done I want a high five...So I poured it out.  She high fived me.  I felt empowered by this -- the pouring it out and also having a supporting witness.  All the other times I ever quit drinking I felt like I was just abstaining from something I enjoyed -- not *doing* something but rather simply *not* drinking and that bothered me.  But here I actually felt like the act of pouring it out was so substantially empowering that it felt good to me and I think it has helped me stay alcohol-free (I think I'm at week 4 or 5 not sure) and have no urge to drink anymore.  ..So I thought I'd post this here maybe something like this could help someone. ..*[edit]* I'd also add that this reminded me of a similar empowering action I've heard of with letting go of anything in your life: where you write whatever it is down on a piece of paper and then you burn it. I always thought it sounded kind of cheesy but now I'm starting to think there might actually be something to this kind of idea.

&gt; This isn't my story or anything..Whose story is it?
My last drink was with my girlfriend as well.  I was 3 sheets to the wind at the time but it will always be one of the most powerful moments of my life knowing that I will never drink again.  
I alway make a point to leave the last one ever in the pack. Smoking drinking psychedelics. I always left the last one available to me. If I can't control my behavior in my own home how will I survive in the world where I have much less control. ..Keep that shit around. Learn to ignore it. Learn to not want it. You might be better off in the real world.
great story. I've been thinking I needed to quit for a while as well and finally decided to do it. one of the things that makes it different from past breaks for me is that I told a few close friends (and my GF) in no uncertain terms that I needed to stop alltogether. having some backup from your SO and social circle can really help. ..congrats :)
