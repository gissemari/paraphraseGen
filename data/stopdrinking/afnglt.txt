I'm super big on Youtube videos in all areas of my life and so recently started watching a ton of videos from other people about all the amazing parts of their lives since they stopped drinking...All of the positive outcomes that are shared in these videos are super inspiring to listen to and really reinforces in my own mind the kind of lifestyle I'm searching for. Some of the things that are brought up are what you'd expect (ex. not waking up hungover all the money saved by not buying alcohol) but there are so many other things I've listened about that I hadn't even thought about before (ex. more easily being able to get in shape)...If you're struggling with not drinking or feeling like you're the only person you know who isn't drinking I really do recommend these videos for how positive and inspiring they can be :) And I think it's really awesome just how many videos there are like this out there it really shows just how many people out there have given up drinking and turned their lives around!
