Of my ex...Drinking problems strike my family left and right. I'm always surrounded by my family drinking. My brothers allow it it's a norm. We all grew up with my father being an alcoholic. The last time I drank was probably the week before I moved back home June 11th or the weekend before the 16th. ..I stopped drinking because I felt encouraged by my ex who explained to me that his father used to be an alcoholic and I understood. This made me a bit uneasy but it also messed with my flow of my own person. I stopped drinking to be more respectful with his perspective on how drinking appeared...Of course now that we're broken up I'm hesitant to even start up. I drank after my first break up with my first boyfriend and it was a terrible night/day after we broke up then too. I don't know what to do...I understand that it's my life therefore my choices as there was a point where drinking to me was something I never wished to pick up but college introduced me to a different side of things as I used to associate it with violence because of my father. ..I don't know what to do. I've been trying to construct myself back as a person and it is a struggle by itself so even thinking of drinking can disrupt the self building I've attempted though thoughts of drinking have trailed through my head every now and then.

I've done more 'self building' in the last month than I've done in the last 15 years. Alcohol was always there to tear down every good habit mental state outlook etc I tried to cultivate...Always back to square one. Always back to feeling like shit hating myself for what I'd done or even worse adjusting my moral compass to somehow accommodate my drinking and behavior. ..I know for certain that I'm better without it. Sounds like you might be too?
