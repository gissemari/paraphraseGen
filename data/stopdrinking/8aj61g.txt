Recently I've been working on controlling my emotions.  Seems like when any emotion hits me hard it triggers a relapse.  That's why I made an effort to stay calm and bite my tongue (despite having a savage comeback) when a jerk at work started pushing my buttons.  Controlling my anger is about as easy as dodging a wrench but with enough practice I hope I can dodge the ball that tells me having "ONE" drink isn't going to kill me...  I will not drink with you today!

In the first few months my emotions were ALL over the place. Brain is super reactive and silly with raw emotions. Don't let scumbag brain win. FTZ
You're doing so well! I remember those anger flares at 30 days. I still get them occasionally. I've become much less reactive without alcohol clouding my thinking. 
You can and will!!! IWNDWYT
