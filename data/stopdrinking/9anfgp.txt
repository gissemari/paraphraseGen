This is the longest sober steak I've had in years and it's all because of r/stopdrinking.  The last streak was a few years ago and that was only for two days.  This last week every time I felt like I needed a drink I just came here.  It helped reading about other people out there who are in the same boat I am and the ones who are still going strong being sober.  I just want to thank everyone here for sharing their life and struggles with others.  My anxiety won't let new attend AA or other self help groups but the anonymity of the internet has made the last ten days of my life something special..Now here's me not raising a drink in my attempt to go ten more!  IWNDWYT!

Hi I'am at day 54 and I feel as you do. You are in a place without judgement and ridicule. Here you will find kindness and encouragement. There is much to be learned from others that are working to be sober as well. I truly believe there is strength in numbers and the positive energy here is awesome. I have been checking in each day reading posts and responding to some- this has truly been my lifeline to sobriety. I'am so thankful to all that share here I couldn't do it without the daily support from all these wonderful people. Stick with the group-You've got this! I will not drink with you today.
