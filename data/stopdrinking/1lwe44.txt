I used to drink. Pretty heavily. I was depressed for a long time etc. etc. But I recovered from that and I'm living an awesome happy life...I don't drink anymore. I went through my extended party phase like many others and then one day a close friend of mine faced some serious consequences for drinking. Since then said friend has been sober and they've made huge changes to their life. From that day forward drinking never had the same appeal or allure and the amount of harm I noticed coming from alcohol as opposed to the amount of good increased exponentially. I just stopped pretty naturally. The frequency and quantity of drinking naturally ran down to pretty much nothing. I'll have a good beer or glass of wine just every so often for the taste -- once a month or less...It was a huge priority shift. I wanted to be supportive of my friend and I found that my life became way better. I had more money in my pocket I lost weight and I was more motivated to get fit and actually get out and do things with my day. It was a no-brainer...So when I had another friend whom we all knew had a problem admit that they needed help it was a no-brainer to support this friend as well. Except that after a stint in rehab and an emotional ceremony that many of us attended this friend willfully relapsed a week later and then lied to my face about it when I directly asked them if they'd been drinking...I couldn't handle it. If they'd told the truth I would have been disappointed. But the fact that they lied just cut so hard. I was furious and told them they needed to get sober and I didn't want to hear from them again until then. I was told that I couldn't give them advice because it's "not my disease." But this has been happening this constant denial that there's a problem even after rehab ffs and I will not get sucked into that sideshow any longer. This person has become an expert at emotionally manipulating those around them and selectively telling certain people certain lies to make sure no one knows about the extent of their problem. Their entire circle of "friends" has become a web of lies and it's really really sad...Is this typical of alcoholics? Should my patience have lasted longer? What can a "friend"/bystander really do in this type of situation?..I also wanted to say that I've casually lurked here for a bit and I'm really proud of the hard work you guys do in here. From what I've seen with my sober friend this shit is hard and you guys go at it every day. You should feel so proud. :)

This line is so relateable for me haha....&gt; and the amount of harm I noticed coming from alcohol as opposed to the amount of good increased exponentially...As for what you can do about it - even the maximum you can do for someone - is be there. You can't force your friend into anything and it's up to your friend only to decide upon his/her actions. Please don't take offense when your friend seems to ignore your suggestions or when he/she acts out saying "it's not your problem." Because it really isn't. But you're being a friend by being understanding and being *there* to help. Just don't take it personally ya know? :)..&gt; But this has been happening this constant denial that there's a problem even after rehab ffs and I will not get sucked into that sideshow any longer. This person has become an expert at emotionally manipulating those around them and selectively telling certain people certain lies to make sure no one knows about the extent of their problem...I know you are genuinely interested in helping but step back a bit. People are individuals with their own minds to make up. I think you've experienced a special case in toning down the alcohol in your life. A lot of people experience relapse denial emotional stress that reinforces the drinking loop etc. It's super rough and it takes some people years and it takes some people decades. I'm saying this out of observation. xD..&gt; Should my patience have lasted longer? What can a "friend"/bystander really do in this type of situation?..You care that's wonderful. You're a friend. Yes only time can tell so extend your patience... And don't pester your friend about it unless your friend comes to you first... :P
Congrats! You're a healthy human being and have boundaries and limits! You are unable to tell you're friend that what they are doing is okay or that you can stand it. Don't kill yourself emotionally because your friend is currently pretty emotionally dead...Walking away is a natural consequence. You should not be ashamed of that. My maid of honor/best friend/pledge sister walked away and said she was done and was. It was a wakeup call. She didn't talk to me for nearly 7 months while I was starting to get sober. It honestly was helpful. I couldn't be codependent on her. I knew and had real proof that my actions had caused real human harm. ..Know that addiction sucks. What looks willful to you really is desperation to them. There are days when I wake up and my God it's just a "WTF brain" moment. There was a voice in my head for a long time that told me that if I didn't drink well that wasn't an option but if I couldn't drink death would be better. To drink was to breathe. If you had out a fun to my head and a drink in my hand my first assumption is that you're lying and I still will find a way to that drink. It's like survival mode has been rewired to want alcohol...The lying while it sucks is almost a good sign. The person has shame about their drinking. Your friend knows something is wrong and will hurt you if he tells you the truth...My honest advice is to stick to your gut. If you're done with the web be done with the web. You can have compassion from afar and be willing to let this person be your friend in the future but requiring sobriety is a totally legitimate boundary to be in a relationship of any sort with an alcoholic. Take care of yourself. You are not a bad friend for having enough. Patience here sounds like enabling telling them that there are no consequences. You're not doing your friend a favor by staying around if you resent him/her the whole time.
