Was doing so well ( for me ...had made 75 alcohol free days) then consciously decided I was  allowing' myself drinks on recent Big Trip . But that was just 2 weeks . Of course I carried on once I got home . Nothing outrageous but every night. Fooling myself with excuses and delay tactics . ..So tonight is Night One . I'll  be fine . It's learning that I struggle to stop again so what's the point in  allowing' anything . That's too many rules and I can't do cut down  school nights etc ..Strangely feel glad to be back . IWNDWYT

Welcome back! 75 days is huge! I had about 11 days and for no apparent reason at all fell off the wagon yesterday. But I'm right back on with you! IWNDWYT!
We'll do it together . Let's aim for past your 11 day mark first .
