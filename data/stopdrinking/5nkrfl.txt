I've been struggling for awhile. Last night I fell in my bathroom and shattered my garbage can (plastic).  I'm pretty sure I hit my head because it hurts and I have a bruise.  I'm supposed to be at work right now but I didn't call in.  I am trying to do what I need to do to get healthy again.  I made a phone call to the nice lady at the treatment center I was supposed to go to a couple months ago. I hope she calls back before I change my mind.  Nursing this horrid hangover now. Just took a zofran and and excedrin.  I really need some help. I reached out for help this morning and I'm crossing my fingers someone reaches back for me.

We'll reach back for you until someone else does :-).  I hope your head feels OK; getting healthy was a great thing for me.  If you don't want to drink I won't drink with you today.
treatment was the best decision i have ever made in my life.  at the time it didn't feel that way.  i was afraid and full of guilt shame and remorse.  i was terrified of going to treatment.  but when i got there i surrendered.  i admitted i was alcoholic and accepted it.  my life changed at that point.  i was introduced to alcoholics anonymous and have been a member since then.  treatment was without a doubt the right thing to do for me.  
We all hit a point where we said "That's it I need to change." Unfortunately many of us said that again and again and again but didn't change. Congratulations on doing something about it...If you fear you may lose motivation if you haven't heard back from the nice lady try calling the main desk at the treatment center and ask to speak with someone. ..Please reply and let me know how it's going.
Congratulations.  I will not drink with you today.
