Hoping that someone can relate to this as it's a strange feeling to be sober successful and unhappy. I'm not really sure why but I feel like the novelty of sobriety has worn off these last few days. After a long streak of feeling better than ever I'm hitting a wall. It's not necessarily that I feel "bad" like sad or angry or depressed... More like everything about life has become gray and unenjoyable as of late. ..Where I was reveling in sobriety previously and breathing in each day like a breath of fresh air I'm feeling more like each day is somewhat of a struggle. I don't particularly feel like I need to drink but I have had the temptation to find a way to escape from the monotony in one way or another. ..I know that these feelings can lead to relapses or finding a way to escape but I'm certainly not going to do that. I won't drink with you guys today. ..Thanks for listening. You guys are the best.

Happens man.  When I quit porn their were these lull periods of overall greyness that lasted for a few days or a week.  They will pass and they will become less and less as the days go by.  Thankfully you have a nice place to come when depressed to express those feelings :)
