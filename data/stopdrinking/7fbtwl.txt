I had previously been sober for 5 months after about 7 years of drinking everyday. I hit a rough patch about a month ago lasting up until now. I've been drinking one week and trying to stay sober another. I don't really have any friends out where I live so I spend my days almost entirely alone. I'm 3 days sober and the boredom is crushing. I just feel so hollow inside.

Check out the chatroom in here in the side bar :) it has saved me many a nights when boredom was almost drowning. Six months always trips me up
Hi friend- don't be lonely. I'll gladly not drink with you.  Let's do this together. 
First off good work on 3 days. ..Second I noticed this bit:..&gt; so I spend my days almost entirely alone...Isolation is the worst thing for an alcoholic like myself to do especially in early sobriety  Here's some tips that might help that helped me when I was figuring out my shit:..This might seem clunky but find a local AA meeting. I tend to view AA like a grocery store: I might not buy everything in it but I go to get the essentials that will help me in my sobriety so if you find a meeting you like and you find some people in that meeting you mesh well with find out what meetings they go to. Great way to build your recovery network. ..Also think of a hobby you enjoy and type it up on meetup.com and see if there's a group in your area that pertains to that hobby. Another way to a get group of people to hang with. ..Stay strong and if you feel like drinking pour some cranberry juice with some tonic water &amp; lime. Great drink to have if happen to be out &amp; about and want to stay sober. ..Good luck and don't drink! :)
