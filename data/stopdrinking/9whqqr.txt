To start I spent a long time lurking and even a longer time an alcoholic. I started really drinking 5 years ago and its been a back and forth but I've always known. I thought the last time I got clean I was fixed and it wouldn't be a problem anymore. Currently in a mental space where I know that it will never be the case. I always struggled with depression after a string of suicides of close friends but made I it through. Now I feel like any stress could set me off. Just the need to not feel like everything is a drag. I'm in need of some major lifestyle changes but don't know how to get started...Any advice on what you lean on instead would be helpful.

Lifestyle changes? It helps but your goal here is to not drink no matter the circumstances..Keep very very busy. Do you normally drink in the evening? Plan a meal to cook treat  yourself to.Whatever foods you want right now  get a puzzle write a journal clean your house get a pet make a plan for each night of the week. .Get some LaCroix and enjoy a mocktail. I wish you the very best stay on this thread several times a day it's really .Helpful.
