Hello all.  I made it 60 days a couple months ago leading up to an IRONMAN race.  After the race (April 1st) I made myself sick drinking and have been in relapse ever since.  Depression has put me in a place where I either have no goals or rather cannot bring myself to be motivated towards goals...I will not drink with you today.

You can do this! Welcome back! I won't be drinking with you today!
