The big round numbers always make me happy but what got me here is celebrating every day successes...For y'all with your 1-day badge 2-day badge 1-week badge etc....just keep it going. The days will add up and you'll learn so much about yourself (sometimes more than you ever wanted to know). Every time you struggle and get oh-so-close to relapsing but don't is an incredible step. Every day you don't drink it is a victory. Every time you relapse but turn it into a learning experience instead of a negative spiral is a victory. These big round numbers are just daily victories strung together. You're already on your way.
