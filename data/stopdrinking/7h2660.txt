Hi all I've never posted before but today I feel so bad.  I got drunk last night in whats been my 5th time of drinking since I relapsed for the 2nd time after being sober for over a year in which I felt amazing I just don't understand why I keep doing this.  My husband is so sad and upset with me I just feel a bit lost and don't know what to do any advice would be great from you guys.....

A year sober is an accomplishment to be proud of. I had to change my way of thinking about booze before I could conquer relapse. Books by Allen Carr and Annie Grace helped. Meetings help too. Some folks have definitely figured out how to stop drinking. 
Hey remind yourself today that you dont go back to drink because you are a bad person or because you want to hurt or upset your husband. You went back because its a hard addiction to overcome. But you are doing a bloody good job of trying to overcome that. You managed a whole year and thats incredible...Be kind to yourself you are doing the best you can. Remember how you got through those first few hours/days/weeks? Lets start back there again and get through it one day at a time...You can do it again just keep trying..Good luck to you I will keep you company and not drink today.
I needed action to stay sober and for me that action takes the form of regular attendance at meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. It not only keeps me sober but increases my gratitude level and serenity.
Be kind to yourself - we are humans - we make mistakes. You've had great victories in the past as I believe every day sober is a victory! Get back to stay strong come here when you need support and maybe try AA. I know AA is not for everyone but it sure works for me. Wishing you success on your journey. I will not drink with you today.
