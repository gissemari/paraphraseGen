Not sure what else to say I only ever stop for maybe two weeks at a time. I got a dui in june which cost me 17 grand and ive been going to a.a. but I have trouble stopping for more than 14 days. My wife drinks daily and her drinking has been my excuse for relapse. Hope you are all having a safe sober day (just venting)

Since you're in AA my advice to you would be to get a sponsor and do the steps as soon as possible. Meetings alone couldn't keep me sober but the step work changed my perspective and removed the desire to drink really rapidly.  In the old days people would do the steps in a couple of weeks. Unless the mental fog from drinking is too heavy I encourage people to get stuck into it quickly because that's what saved me
I couldn't stop for a day until one time I did. I couldn't stop for a week until one time I did. I couldn't stop for 2 weeks until one time I did. Keep at it. It will eventually stick. 
I just thought I would chime in and say to someone like me who hasn't made it to day 3 without relapsing in over a year your post is still inspiring. Having a fortnight under my belt would be incredible. I think it's not so much the consecutive days as the ability and will to keep trying to stop. I can imagine it is super-tough to be around another drinker too. I don't have to content with that myself. I can;t really offer much advice but I wanted to say good on you! 
My husband drinks daily too. IWNDWYT.
You are hitting post-acute withdrawal. It can be a real danger for someone who is newly sober. .If you have an AA sponsor that is who you need to call when you hit 14 days. Also increase meetings to avoid relapse and keep pushing.
