Three weeks into this I was hit by the strongest cravings I've experienced. I cried. I raged. I paced and paced and cried some more. I just wanted to be *normal*. Just one beer. I just wanted to enjoy one beer...I got one beer...I opened the beer...I realized that I didn't just to enjoy just *one* beer-- I wanted to be *drunk*. One beer would turn into 8 one night would turn into a week and eventually I'd be right back where I started. Lather rinse repeat...Somehow by some miracle I poured that beer down the drain. ..After that things didn't magically get better over night. But they did get better. One night as I got ready for bed I realized I hadn't craved at all that day. I got home from grocery shopping one afternoon and realized that I hadn't even *thought* of the beer and wine aisle as I walked past it. Small things like that started to add up and they continue to do so. It's not always easy and I'm sure there will be more ups and downs to follow. All I can say is that this is absolutely worth it and that it *DOES* get better and easier...If you're struggling *hold on*. You'll be so glad that you did.

So worth it! Thanks for the reminder.
Congrats.  I remember when I realized I hadn't even thought about beer in a whole day...good feeling. 
Congrats on 60 days! You rock :)..I'm so glad you poured that beer out and are with us.  Have a merry Christmas!
Yes my experience was that once you power through the first real cravings you gain a strength and that it does get better and quickly.
That is how it is done - congrats on the 60 day milestone. 
Congratulations on your sixty!!!!
