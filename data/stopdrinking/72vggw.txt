Hey SD. ..Been here before maybe two years ago (under a different username) when I got my first DUI.  Made it almost to a week then relapsed...After another incident with the law almost two weeks ago I finally accepted I do have a serious problem.  I have been sober for about a week and a half.  The first week went decent.  I've been going to AA about 2 meetings a day.  ..But now I'm struggling.  I think it's because the withdrawals are finally going away and I feel like that foggy haze ( I don't know how else to describe it) I was in has lifted. ..As I'm sure many of you did I used to drink to suppress my emotions. To forget and distract myself from a lot of painful experiences thoughts feelings situations etc...But now that I'm sober they've all come rushing back.  My anxiety and depression is at a all time high. (The depression mostly only hits me at night when after I get home from work.)  I literally do not know how to deal with these feelings. I used to drink to drown them out and not deal with them. I had a complete breakdown last night after a meeting.  I've been doing okay mostly at work up until this week.  Now panic attacks are starting to come up while at work now too. ..I want to reach out for therapy but I don't know what type of therapy to look for? I need to learn how to deal with confront and cope with my anxiety sober.  Any help/suggestions/advice welcome...Thank you.

It can be hard to reach out for therapy but a lot of therapists out there know this. I started by sending out an email. It wasn't even very long. Just hi I'm looking to get some help with some issues I've been having lately. It opens the conversation and it made it a lot easier for me. I'm such a shy person that I really hate talking on the phone. It's so nice to have that option of email! ..I struggle with depression and anxiety as well. Have you found any new hobbies or places you can go to to help out with that? Maybe volunteering at the local animal shelter or playing music or reading books? It really can be anything. The trick is to find something that calms your soul and keeps you busy so that you don't focus on the booze or the anxiety. Therapy will also help you with coping mechanisms! Definitely recommend it. 
I hear you on all that coming rushing back. I drank to escape as well. One thing that helped has been therapy. Another has been just. not. drinking. I have to go through to get to the other side and drinking to hide was still hiding. You'll get a feel for what kind of counselor you want. A lot of places have addiction counselors but for me I've tried regular old counselors and they can help with depression and anxiety. Find someone you think may help try it and if they don't work try another one. That's what I've had to do. Good luck friend.
