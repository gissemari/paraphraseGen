I think many of you are familiar with this. It's a very simple scenario... I live with my longterm partner and the habit of drinking has formed between us. He drinks too much for sure but he knows his limits and he is not a drunk ass mess like I am. I go through these cycles of relapse where I drink a little one day until I drink a lot and get drunk randomly on a Monday by myself (partner going to bed early me not remembering half the next day) and decide that's too far stop for a few days to a month then have 1 occasion where a drink seems OK and there we go full circle. ..I have been very open about struggling with alcohol to my partner but because a mixture of the many circles the convincing power my alcoholic brain somehow has on both of us he not wanting false hope and the fact that simply he does want to drink... Well he kinda just sits it out with a beer/whiskey on his hand both the soberstreak AND the binge...Having alcohol in the house all the time makes it so much harder to keep it up..What can I say or do to make it a little easier for myself without demanding he stops with me or depending on him for my sobriety at all? I just want to come with a practical solution for this or even only giving him some peace because of course it is affecting him too especially if I keep blabbering every other day I'm going to stop again then next thing is a wine in my hands. I'm lots more subtle now as obviously all previous attempts failed and each time he's losing a bit more hope...

For me I had to have a serious conversation with my SO. He can drink but he could not leave anything out or unattended. (Now it's not an issue but it took a while.) .It wasn't something he took seriously at first because well I had plenty of false starts. So having to have more than one conversation about boundaries may be necessary for you as it was for me. ..It was also important to remove that thought of "we" when drinking. Alcohol is my own problem and his drinking has nothing to do with me. It's alot easier said than done sometimes. But practice makes perfect. You can do it. Hang on cause it gets better...I will not drink with you today  
My wife is a light drinker and I figured that this is my problem not hers  so I have not asked her to stop or to take the beer/wine out of the fridge.
