It's a dark comedy about recovering alcoholics who relapse lie and do what alcoholics do.  I watched it and was motivated not to make the same mistakes.

Love that show as well! I'm still working on the second season :)
Will check it out thanks for the heads up!
I'll check that out too. Thank you.
It's on my list! I love Will Arnette. I'm way too caught up in OITNB right now but I'll be checking this show out soon. Thanks for reminding me it's on there! 
if you want to really get bummed and not make the same mistakes check out Bojack Horseman dear lord.
Watching Maron and Flaked actually inspired me to start thinking about quitting for the first time. Great show!
Next watch *Love!* ..It got my wheels turning (really one my main catalysts for getting sober) and gives a weirdly accurate picture of 12-step programs and relationships around them. 
Watching Doug Stamper on House of Cards was part of my motivation to stop so I feel you! When you start to see yourself in the ugliest parts of characters it's not a good feeling. Definitely did help motivate me to change.
