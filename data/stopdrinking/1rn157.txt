Up before the sun. Still not drinking.
First sober Thanksgiving in 25 years.  I'll probably be the only one still awake for the Ravens game.  Happy non-drinking holiday everyone !.
Life is very good.  Fire in the stove is making the house cosy despite cold winds outside  dinner later at a sponsee's house so cooking is limited to our pot luck contributions dog is chewing on his bone no regrets no shame no fears.  Despite all this still not drinking.
Happy Thanksgiving... I finally had a moment of clarity 6 days ago at the end of my latest blackout asshat rampage. I am finally going to fully work the program instead of faking it. Despite my lack of dedication this last year it has still worked miracles in my life I was so blind. I love the things i have gained and cannot wait to see where I will go when fully dedicated. This year I am thankful that for the first time in 7 years I will not be alone drunk or hungry on this holiday. I even get to spend it with my sober other half who I swear was sent by God into my life. Today is a good day. Sober.
Thanks for starting this! I'm headed out soon and will keep an eye here for sure. Have a great day everyone!
Happy Thanksgiving. [I had no Idea what it was but now I do](http://www.brainpop.com/socialstudies/culture/thanksgiving/).  Enjoy your day folks. 
Good:Actually got some sleep last night .Bad: Apartment is level 3 biohazard and I have probably about 8-12 hours of work to do over my '4 day weekend'...**fuck drinking**
Gobble gobble everyone!!..I'm up getting ready to brine the turkey for an evening thanksgiving dinner. I overbrined once (was probably drunk) so now I don't do it overnight. Can't fix overbrining it's disgustingly salty. ..Wood is on the fire animals have been fed. It's gonna be a good day. And if by chance something goes terribly wrong Iike the dog steals the turkey off the table I will still be thankful for this life I've been given. ..HAPPY **THANKS**GIVING my sober brethren. Stay safe and sober today. :-)
Woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Gonna workout then do family stuff. Still not drinking!..Have a fantastic Thanksgiving everyone! You guys are high on my list of things to be thankful for.  .(     )           
My family is driving me nuts. Still not drinking! Actually easier to handle NOT drinking. Happy Thanksgiving! 
Going to stop today because it's getting out of hand. I recognize that I'm depressed and drinking won't fix it even if it lets me relax and enjoy things. I am a better person after a beer but I need to do it without it.
Today's drinking plans: coffee tea water and gravy.
Arrived home last night told my dad (big drinker) that I stopped drinking - as he was pouring me a bourbon. He said "good - we all need to take a break. Do what you gotta do." I was worried for nothing!

It's a great day to be sober. Started like every other day off. Will be biking in my camper watching some rock concert DVD. (It's fricken cold here.) Then off to friends house. They have wine &amp; beer but my wife is 34 years sober plus me. It's a no pressure relaxed atmosphere with no drama. I'll bring my Starbucks beans. The guys will be in the den watching football I'll be in the kitchen with my wife's friend because I am the one with the the thermometer. There will be good food good talk lots of laughs &amp; sweet desserts. No one will get drunk. I've drank there before but without incident. I don't care if I am an alkie or not I just feel better not drinking. Besides I can eat more calories instead of drinking them. I will check in today too. ..Happy Thanksgiving everyone and in all thinks be grateful. If you feel like reading how the other half lives check out http://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/. Most of them are well underway with lofty goals of consuming massive amounts of bottled self-pity &amp; false pride..Live well &amp; prosper. 
Still. Not. Drinking.
I'm in here checking on my new friends before I get my family ready for Thanksgiving at my brother's house. Still not drinking.
My eyes opened this morning to a glorious sunrise with the pacific ocean in the foreground!  Looks like my beach camping spot will work out for TDay after all.  No more rain in the forecast!  Time to go out for a 3 mile walk up the coast.   When I get back I will be **still not drinking** but getting ready for my day with my extended "less than sane" family.  Who could have ever guessed that I turned out to be the "normal one"!  Ha!  Happy Thanksgiving sober friends!
I'm going to attempt to eat my age in platefuls of food. 
Thankful for this sub and so so so proud of all of you. We inhabit such a small corner of the world but the ripples you guys make extend far beyond this place. Thanks! And have a wonderful day sans booze!
Still sober checking in~ Happy Turkey Day everyone!
Just got back from a 5k turkey trot.  Now it's off to my grandma's nursing home for lunch.  The real challenge sobriety-wise will be at my parents house tonight.  I told my dad to get some La Croix for me to drink so I plan to suck those down all night.
Happy Thanksgiving!  I'm thankful for all of you this subreddit and my eighty days of sobriety.
Last night was a giant steaming pile of dookie.  Still sick and my lung thing has dripped down into my intestines (I will avoid TMI) so I barely slept last night.  That resulted in runaway middle-of-the-night anxiety attacks.  Finally got to sleep around 4AM and my lovely wife and family let me sleep til 10 even though we are headed out to see grandpa...Quite a suck fest but **still not drinking**.  Happy and sober thanksgiving everyone.

Last night and this morning have been great! Not drinking cooking with my S.O and staying warm : )
Woke up without an alarm at my normal work time this morning. Going to work out then walk to family Thanksgiving buffet of deliciousness. Still not drinking!
Last year I was started drinking Thanksgiving week after 2 months of not drinking. Not this year. Going to work on taxes (!) and try to get the kids out for a run with me. ..I am thankful and humbled to be on this path and have good company on it.

Watching the dog show and **still not drinking**.
Helping my mom cook prepping her house for more family to arrive about to take the dog for a walk. ..I'm thankful that I have a shitton of housework and work work that I brought home to keep me occupied and out of trouble over this long weekend. I'm also thankful that this subreddit exists since I'm out here in the middle of nowhere and can't go to a meeting if I feel like it...Trying to decide whether to DD tonight for the bunch of friends from high school who are going to go out and probably drink their faces off. ..Still not drinking!
Short run this morning and now chilling and doing madlibs with the kids.  Someone else is cooking--huzzah!  Still not drinking and all is serene.
40 days sober today something to be thankful for. It's been easy this far but family has only been here half an hour and it's already testing my limits. I'm re-learning how to socialize. /sigh today will be long but I will be on this thread a loooot. Best wishes everyone!
I cannot drink and eat sweet stuff. If I drink no pie. Just does not mix for me. Also if i fill up on beer I have less room for dinner. These are the things I remind myself of today. I'm not drinking because I want to eat more!
Went to my first AA Alkathon today. I don't have any family to celebrate the day with but I've met some fantastic people I am meeting up with for dinner later. Day Two still sober and doing okay!
Still not drinking :)  .Fairly easy since my in-laws &amp; husband do not drink &amp; there's no alcohol in the house. I have had quite a few moments where I really wanted a drink but there's nothing I can do about it so just telling that thought to stop &amp; moving on. ..My 2 year old was driving me crazy earlier &amp; normally that would've been a good time for a drink. Well any time would've been a good time -but always better with an excuse for me. ..Good thing I stopped a few weeks ago or I'd be the one drunk person in a house full of sober people by now &amp; it's only 2 pm. ..I'm thinking of taking a nap now since my little one finally fell asleep....I made a few desserts earlier/last night so I don't have to help with any more cooking for now. ;)..Hope everyone is doing great. I've been reading this sub every day for the last 25 days or so. Thanks for being here! :).Happy Thanksgiving. 
I just was told "today is a special day have some wine then start again tomorrow." Ugh. 
Playing with my adorable niece while helping family cook while NOT drinking! I'm lucky though I've got family members in recovery so there's more accountability here than in my normal life. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!
Met up with old friends at a bar and didn't drink. To my surprise no one cared that I wasn't drinking and the night was even more fun that it would have been if I had. Success!
Relishing my family time and remembering that sometimes I have to chose between being right and being happy. These people won't be in my life forever and I'm learning to love and accept them the way I wish they would with me. Dad offered me some wine and I turned it down without even looking up from my phone (my /r/stopdrinking time is serious business dad!). I'm feeling really good and I'm REALLY looking forward to getting back to my group. I'm leaning on them really hard right now and I miss those people terribly. I'm lonely and getting texts from my ex but I'm not drunk texting people saying stupid things to family or making drunken culinary mistakes. The holidays have been a struggle so far but __I'm still not drinking!__
There's no fucking gravy and no green bean casserole at this horrible in-laws-friends-house thanksgiving I'm attending but there IS a fuck ton of really nice french wine. Half of me wants to have 30 days sober by christmas (had started 30 days on nov 10th fucked up on Nov 23rd) half of me wants to drown myself in red wine. I'm wearing a white fucking sweater to try to stop myself. White knuckle grip on this hideous sobriety thing. The world is a horrible place if I'm lucky enough to have access to booze why shouldn't I drink? Ffffffuuuccccckkkkkk the holidays. 
While having a drink has been on my mind often today I'm intent on not drinking.  This will the first Thanksgiving in decades that I won't be drinking.  Just the wife and the two boys so not a lot of booze flowing in house anyway so that's good.  I'm thankful for all of you at SD.  Your stories and committment have given me the courage to make this happen.  Happy Thanksgiving to you all.
My not drinking has become a way of life.  I have no temptation or triggers at this point.  Fortunately holidays were never drinking times... they were the opposite in my family.  Today I'm working at my EMS nursing job from 0600 to 1800.  I have a meeting at 2000 at which I hope a few people show up.  After that it's time to watch Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.  
1st sober Thanksgiving in over 30 years. 30. fing.years. Family issues and severely depressed wife. Couldn't even pop a bird in the oven while I was at work all day. "still not drinking" this sub is a great help thanks. the scales are finally coming off my eyes. I need to learn how to deal with things.
Well I came out on the other side. I was offered plenty of booze and turned it all down. It put me in a pissy mood to say no especially to wine. I was too busy to have my soda water so I think that might have been a problem. ..Oh well. At least I'm sober and I've eaten enough pie for 3 people. Happy Thanksgiving guys. Hope you all make it out :)
Home again. Safe and sober. It was a really nice evening. A dinner party of sober people extremely civilized. My husband and I have made some great friends in AA. They're the same sort of people we would have clicked with before sobriety but now a days no one gets into arguments at the dinner table. 
Had a wonderful Thanksgiving!  Went on a very long bike ride with my son and then had a lovely Thanksgiving lunch with my extended family.  Everyone was pleasant. The kids played nicely (for once) and I got to sit down the whole time!..Edit to add:  And after reading all the threads I am 100x more grateful for my sober family.  I don't have to white knuckle it because we don't have alcohol at family events :)
A whole lot of coffee today. 
I just completed my 1st sober Thanksgiving in over a decade.  I appreciate all the support from/stopdrinking.  I hope everyone else has a great and successful holiday!
Made it through a three-hour dinner with six elderly ladies talking about their myriad health problems and their favorite dog breeds.  .**Still not drinking**  I just have to avoid my old nemesis:  the leftover wine.

Had tasty duck with the fam. Cheated on Keto but that was the plan after all. Went to see gravity with my dad told him in the subway why I didn't drink at dinner and what's up with me. He's a big time oenophile so this was a bit strange to him but got it. 
I drank tap water black coffee green tea seltzer water bottled water coffee with white chocolate mocha creamer and chamomile tea...I peed a lot.
Last Thanksgiving we all got ripped. This year my mom and my boyfriend drank nothing but tea and soda and my dad who generally outdrinks us all had a single beer. I haven't really officially told them I'm abstaining but mentioned a few times that I'll be teetotaling this holiday. They've all mentioned a change in my demeanor and complimented it though. Did they not drink out of respect? Am I rubbing off on them? Regardless it warmed my heart. I am loved. 
Broke up with boyfriend. Sad but I think I'll be alright. Still not drinking.
My first successful Thanksgiving sober. God is so good.
Didn't drink today. Spent Thanksgiving with my family and it was so nice to see how they interact and how honest they are and to see how much love is in my family. We've never had alcohol at Thanksgiving so I wasn't worried about drinking today. But what was different this year is that I've been sober for a long period beforehand. I haven't been lying about what I've been up to and I didn't arrive here hungover. I am so happy. I went to a meeting Tuesday night and I plan to go to another one when I return on Sunday. My family is not aware that I have a drinking problem. But I'm so happy. This whole month I've been sober has been such a blessing - what started out as kind of experiment is maybe becoming something of a lifestyle choice. ..I mean an expirement in that I wanted to see if I could do it but also like what my life might be like if I cut out the alcohol. A lot of things are improving and I'm holding onto things that I've gained in this year....Still gotta clean house though. Thanks for reading.
Picked up a glass that I thought was my sparkling cider took a big sip - Jameson and ginger ale. Nope nope. Immediaite spit it back out and apologized to the owner for backwashing into their drink. Luckily it was one of my friends who knows what's up with me and told me "good job for spitting it out! i don't know if i could have done that". Phew! Close call and **still not drinking**!
