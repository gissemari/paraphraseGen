It is always interesting to see how people who actually struggle with drinking problems perceive shows/movies/stories about alcoholics. ..Here is a short film called "Surrender" which chronicles the life of an alcoholic whose sanity begins to slip away from him:..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN1QAq0KFiE..Any feedback?

Whelp. Now I'm crying and my anxiety is high lol. Very real portrayal oh the effects of alcohol. I only skimmed through the video it was too much for me to watch it all the way through. It hurt. It's an accurate of how my life was though.  Thanks for sharing Gave me an extra kick into gear on not drinking
