Hey all happy to say it's been a little over 2 months since I last drank. I have a few valiums from a script I got when I first stopped drinking to help with the initial insomnia didn't really take any because I didn't want to get dependent just took it the nights it was really bad. Yesterday was a very stressful day for me so as you can imagine getting to sleep was impossible so I took one of the valiums (first time in over a month taking one) and this morning I felt really bad anxiety and its persisted through out the day. It reminds me of the anxiety I'd feel the next day after relapsing after I'd go a few weeks without drinking from kindling. Thoughts?

Benzos are going to cause brain chemicals to rebound and increase anxiety. Alcohol also does it. ..They're scary addictive like build tolerance when used more than once a week so I'd research natural alternatives like glycine magnesium l-theanine and melatonin. Examine.com is a good aggregate site for studies on that stuff. 
I asked my Dr for something in the initial stages but she refused as she did not want me to substitute one drug for another. She felt there were better ways to manage my anxiety without meds and she was right. She pointed me in the 'mindful thinking' and meditation direction and after huge reservations I am pleased I followed her advice as both are helping me a great deal. Benzodiazepines are highly addictive so personally with my history of addiction it would have been a bad move. 
Yes this is the problem with benzos. They relax you at the time but cause more anxiety the next day. I was having them not long before I stopped drinking very addictive. Highly mind altering
