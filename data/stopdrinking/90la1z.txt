And had 4 beers. Part of me feels guilty  but more than that after 3 weeks sober I feel bloated as hell.  I'm not even intoxicated I just feel like crap.  ..Ugh...I do like people at the bar and suffer terribly from FOMO but next time I go I really do have to say  just a water  and maybe some dinner.   I know it's a daily struggle. For me it's more about socializing here and there.  I didn't go for 3 weeks so it was nice to catch up with people but I'm slowly coming to terms with it's ok to be missed and I don't have to see these people every day. ..On the flip side one of my bar buddies told me tonight he is getting a divorce and I've seen him spiral downhill quickly in his marriage during the past 2 years.  It's a big cautionary tale for sure. His wife is fantastic and at the end of the day he chose alcohol and cheated on her with someone else.  I truly don't believe this would have happened had they been sober.  It makes me so goddamn sad for her that that was the path that he chose.

Just a bump in the road if you truly feel this is your path then get back up and keep going. ..As for the social aspect. I get that 100% so goddamn lonely.. but then again it isn't the same scene for me anymore anyways but at least I was getting out and talking to people. ..As for the marriage I'm sorry to hear that.. one of the things I've seen happen and have worried would cause problems in my future relationships. Which is partially why I'm quitting now. So someone gets the chance to have the best version of me.. ..Good luck brother IWNDWYT
