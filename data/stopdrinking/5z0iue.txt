I've been sober since November and last night I had a few drinks thinking I would be fine. The feeling of regret I'm having is like carrying a fridge on your shoulders. I feel so terrible that I cant eat or leave the house. Falling off the wagon sure does hurt but I just need to pick myself up and get back to my sobriety. Thank you for listening.
