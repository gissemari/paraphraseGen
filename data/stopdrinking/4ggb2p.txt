Woke up this morning to find out my coworker died in a car accident last night. We were both out at karaoke. I had a DD. He did not. I've never felt like this before. The immense guilt and sadness. I feel sick. I don't know what to do. He was only 32...I've been struggling with my addiction for awhile now. I know a lot of people here have been sober for a very long time. I've been able to work down from daily drinking to once or twice a week recently which has been a great stride for me. This event that just happened though has given me the final push to cut alcohol completely out of my life. I hate that this had to be the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm just completely sick about it...Sorry I just needed to say something and I wasn't sure where to go.

I'm very sorry for your loss sincerely. It's a difficult thing to accept...I hope you can stay strong and become completely sober as a tribute to your friend.
I am so sorry. Our sober journey is sadly populated with losses sometimes tragic.  I got sober and stayed sober by starting with some simple sober actions that I summarize at [the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)
My sincerest condolences 
I'm so sorry for your loss. Please understand this isn't your fault. You can't let yourself feel guilty that you lived. Make you living *mean something*. *hugs* feel better my friend
