Have you had a chance to mosey over to the FAQ's in the side bar and read /u/gelastic_farceur's [Timeline of Recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2sf5jm/my_attempt_at_an_alcohol_recovery_timeline/) post yet? It's a compilation of some sciency information from various studies about what happens in the brains of heavy drinkers when they embark on the journey of recovery. I was lucky to read this post very early in my personal journey and something stuck with me all this time. It was the  lawnmower metaphor.  ..New sobernauts do you realize how much growth and repair is going on right behind your eyes at this moment? When I first read the timeline and then the discussion about the lawnmower metaphor in the comments section it created a vivid mental image for me. I likened the neurogenesis the hopeful bursts of brain rejuvenation in the first weeks and months off the sauce to shiny new leaf buds on a long-struggling plant in a parched garden row. ..The fact that I have all these new delicate sprouts in my brain right now is *awesome* but what continues to keep me from drinking on some days is the lawnmower metaphor mentioned by /u/gelastic_farceur. If I start drinking again today and douse my baby buds in alcohol I might sear their leaves prune them back or even create further damage to the root system. Then I have to start all over sew the seeds in the stripped soil and who knows? The growth may not be as hearty next time. It's a powerful metaphor for me. ..The cognitive quickness and alertness my healthy sleep/wake cycle my humor personality and mental flexibility - all these things have begun to return to me and the notion that this bright green progress might possibly suffer if I drink again keeps me strong...I will not drink today. I don't want to do that to my brain because it is working far too hard for me to sabotage it like that. I wanted to thank /u/gelastic_farceur. That post has helped me greatly.

Hmm. Looks like it's time for me to revisit the sidebar and see what else I've missed!
The [FAQ](http://is.gd/sdfaq) on /r/stopdrinking has some pretty cool information and one or two cat videos if I recall correctly.

Thanks for reminding me of this. Your reminding me actually helped me today.
