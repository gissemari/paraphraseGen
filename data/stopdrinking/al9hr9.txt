Does it ever get you down that we have to struggle with our inner demons and other people don't?  Are there people who just jump out of bed in the morning and are happy?.Asking for a friend of course.....

Some days yes some days no.  Everyone has ups and downs.  The cool thing about sobriety is now when you feel something you know its real.....And by the way Good job!!
Does it seem unfair at times? Yes. But that's my own personally invited pity party warming up for a grand entrance. I have to remind myself that other people have their own "invisible" struggles that I know nothing about couldn't even imagine and/or have no context for. 
I've been having quite the pity party recently but then again I haven't felt this low consistent for a long time. It's like when you get to this stage your depression starts feeding itself. ..Anyway I'm breaking today down into the simplest steps and trying to put one foot in front of the other in an effort to get moving.  A metal list of things I am grateful for also got me out of bed and eventually.
