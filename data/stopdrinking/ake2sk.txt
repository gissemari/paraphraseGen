I recently started drinking again after quitting for around six years.  I have been drinking around a bottle of wine every night and I really want to quit but it is like trying to stop a freight train

I've more of a binge drinker than an everyday drinker but we are all in this together . I've just joined today and I think the support is really going to help me.   
Don't discount your stress and feelings - someone told me a few years ago when I was really starting to enter the worst period of my life that my feelings and problems were just as valid as anyone else's. So make sure you let yourself "feel your feelings". If you try to downplay or stifle them you aren't truly dealing with them...it's something I've struggled with too. ..As for drinking my habits were like yours at one time but alcohol abuse tends to be progressive in that it will just keep getting worse until you take steps to stop it. So it's good that you are expressing these concerns on here - is there any one close in your personal life you could share the feelings with as well? I've found it's very helpful to just talk about what you're experiencing because there are so many others who have gone through the exact same thing. Keep coming on here each day and start reading and reaching out. It will help.
