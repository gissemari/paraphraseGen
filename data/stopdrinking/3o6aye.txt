On 10-4-14 here on /r/stopdrinking I wrote this:  ..*Just got to the beach after a very long drive. We are only staying overnight but this is my first time away from home overnight since I got sober. I went to an AA meeting this morning before we left I have supportive people on speed dial but I'm surprised by how much this is bothering me. There is a liquor store on every f*ing block.*..*Ugh. So I'm sitting in the hotel room reading my AA Grapevine and waiting while hubby naps. This is not fun so far.*..On Mini Vacation Day 2 I wrote this: ..*Yesterday I was sad at the change of the meaning of "vacation" in my life.*..*This morning I woke up at 6am no hangover clear eyed and ready for the day. The weather on the beach was very breezy but clear. My husband came with me and with hot tea in hand we were on the boardwalk by 6:30.*..[This was my morning.](http://imgur.com/aeo1Eo4)..*It is good to be sober.*...************************************..Little did we know the reason hubby was sleeping and not feeling well during that mini vacation was that he was dangerously sick with leukemia at the time.  When we got home he went to see the doctor had blood work done and on 10/17/2014 he was diagnosed with AML leukemia and we rushed off to the hospital.  ..So looking back that first night of our "mini vacation" I was MAD...I wanted to drink there was booze everywhere and my damn spouse was sleeping instead of taking me somewhere to have fun...but since I stayed sober I had my first sober vacation Sunday morning and watched the sun rise with my spouse from the boardwalk.  For a long time within this past year it was a morning that hubby and I thought might be our last vacation memory together.  ..****************..Tomorrow Spouse and I are walking with a team of almost 15 of our family and friends to raise money for leukemia and lymphoma awareness.  It has been a HELL of a year and with a second cancer diagnosis for him we have more challenges to come...but today as I look back at the photos from last October's mini beach trip I'm reminded that we sometimes miss the small blessings in life.  A cup of tea with a friend.  A beautiful sunrise or sunset.  The sight of a rainbow.  None of us are guaranteed any number of days or years of life...so make the most of it.  ..And for me to make the most of it I need to be sober and aware of the world around me.  I struggle to live in the moment...to live each day with gratitude...but every day is a gift.  Don't waste it!!..Stay sober my friends.  ..Mouse

Wow. It's crazy to see my reflection in your words on your first sober mini-vacation eve. Really puts things in perspective. I tend to respond reactively to "we never know how much time we have" by trying to pack more into my day being more productive. I should work on stopping more I think...Thanks for the perspective hope you have nice weather for the walk.
I always appreciate your posts. Thank you so much for sharing. Does your team have an online pledge for more people can donate online using credit cards? If so PM me the link if you feel comfortable and I'd love to throw in a few dollars. I wish I could give more!
I did not at all think that this post was about fundraising. I just wanted to contribute. My bad. Sorry!
Thank you for the inspiring post.  I have been having cravings but this will put them to rest...GW.18 days
