Even at 327 days I had a really bad relapse dream last night. It felt so real. I have been keeping a journal throughout my recovery and thought I was done with those. The last ones I had were one at 2 weeks and one at around 3 months then 6 months. I woke up scared and dazed as it felt so real that odd transition between did I really do that or was it just a dream. Yikes I will not drink with you guys tonight even if dream me wants to sabotage all these days I would never throw away :)

They still happen to me occasionally as well. When it happens I try to relish the sweet relief as I wake up and give myself a high-five.

I am always amazed by the impact those dreams have on me. A good reminder of how grateful I am that they are not my reality. 
I've only quit drinking for 7 days now and on the second night I had a dream I was drinking a bottle of wine with friends. Woke up so relieved! You're dreaming patterns reflect your past life not future. Keep going!   
I haven't had drinking dreams (yet) but strange dreams have been plaguing me. I dreamt my kittens pooped on the top of their litter box. I actually had to ask my family if it was real or a dream. It felt so real.
I just woke up ten minutes ago from dreaming I was on a cruise ship. Oddly enough I had fun and was mostly sober except for one beer for breakfast (?!!)...Clearly remember thinking in my dream that I'd have to reset badge and admit relapse...It was a sweet relief to wake up. Think this sub is affecting me more than I thought (  _ )
