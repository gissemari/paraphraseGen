Ever since I was a teen I struggled with opiate addiction.  3 years ago I kicked that habit and seemingly replaced it with alcohol.  I always drank a bit but it was this point that it became a daily crutch.  I didn't notice it to affect me until one day I was skateboarding and feeling shaky from drinking   this caused me to fall and smash my face into the concrete.  But I kept drinking and began to self sabotage myself socially.  Still I kept drinking.  Then I realized it was destroying my relationship yet I kept drinking.  Then I ended up in jail and on probation and still I continued to drink after that...At some point I tried running from the problem by moving around lots.  I would go through phases of sobriety and I would make progress in the things that mattered to me (skateboarding) but then I would celebrate and find myself in a phase of binge drinking again.  Now I've become someone who drinks at work drinks while skating drinks in any social situation.  And I try to moderate it but I never stop until I'm blacked out...So I decided to take a break from everything and come to a location where I can heal myself.  I stopped smoking cigarettes (it's been about a week) and last night I thought it would be fine to drink a pint of whisky.  Of course that led to me making destructive decisions on social media (typical me) and a following morning of guilt and self loathing...So I'm done.  I can't moderate it.  I can't just have a few drinks.  It's just not in my nature.  I don't want to continue this cycle anymore.  Here's day one and a longing to make up for all the lost time in following my dreams.
