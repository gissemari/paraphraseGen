So I've been conscious about my drinking being a problem for a number of months now. I'm one of those people who once they start drinking has to keep going until they are black out drunk/asleep. There is no middle ground for me. If I have a glass of wine with lunch I will carry on drinking throughout to day until I am totally smashed. This has caused me some problems in the past when I've done stupid shit under the influence and I am now at the realisation that I do indeed have a problem and should do something about it before something bad happens when I'm blacked out. There is also the damage it's doing up my body/brain/wallet making me want to stop...I've gone from drinking everyday to binging at the weekends. Last week I only binged on Fri and Sat and not Sunday. This week I binged on Thursday night and not Friday. After binging on Thurs I felt shitty and realised what one of my triggers is. I can hopefully now realised this trigger when it next happens and replay the tape of how shitty I felt on Friday and not have that first drink. ..Even though I relapsed I still feel that I have moved forward and will now be in a better position the next time a trigger occurs...I'm off to the Christmas markets today which is a MASSIVE trigger for me. Always love sinking a few beers and eating some hot dogs while browsing the stalls but today I will resist that first beer and keep my head straight. Tomorrow it will be worth it...Hope you're all having a great weekend!

Congrats for being so aware of your situation. It sounds like you recognize it's not really sustainable. Have fun at the market - eat some hot dogs and drink some hot cider.
Congrats for realising this - it's a big step to realise that you're a problem drinker. I'm confused though are you still bingeing on weekends or are you hoping to stop fully?..I ask because I was the same - one drink and that was me until closing even then I might get cans on the way home. I wanted to cut down and be sensible but I was in denial about how deep my problem was...It was after reading John Cheese's Cracked columns (http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-things-you-dont-realize-about-addiction-until-you-quit/ - see number 5) that I realised that I had to stop 100% and get used to life without alcohol...Good luck man have a good weekend.
