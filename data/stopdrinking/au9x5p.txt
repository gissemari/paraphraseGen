Hey everyone! Happy Sunday! I used to hang around here and in the chat quite a bit but life has been crazy lately. I was just reading through some old posts from about a year ago when I got sober. The pain hurt and loneliness was obvious. I struggled with my past and how to move forward. ..I'm now at the longest I've ever been sober since I originally started drinking. In the past year I've started therapy found an AMAZING group of sober friends and began dating a wonderful guy who 100% supports my sobriety. I feel like I always came here when I was at my worst and I wanted to post from the other side. It's still a battle but it's much easier when I realized how much better life can be sober. ..Thank you to everyone in this sub for all the love and support. It's been a great community. :)
