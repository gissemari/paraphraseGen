I'm so relieved - I've made it through the last week and a half with my husband and mother drinking every day (and my mother offering me many drinks despite being open about my struggle). A party last night for nye to top it off and I'm sober. It's been a struggle and I am feeling a bit flat and depressed for some reason but I'm now 36 days. ..For those struggling right now - time will pass just hang on that little bit more. Im with you let's do this. IWNDWYT
