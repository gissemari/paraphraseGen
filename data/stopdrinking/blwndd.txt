Last night I spent 5 hours in the emergency department of my local hospital with my 1 year old son. Luckily he is fine but the ordeal was draining and stressful. ..I got home at 10pm and I was already rationalising having a few beers. ..My wife went straight to bed and I was at a fork in the road. Did I put on my shoes drive to a liquor store get the beers come home and drink them by myself. ..I pulled out my phone and went straight to this sub. I read stories of other people. Both positive ones about the benefits of sobriety and negative ones about relapsing and how it wasn't worth it. This sub is amazing. ..I also have this app that has a daily pledge. I've recorded the reasons I want to stay sober:.."Alcohol and drugs make me weak anxious stupid fat and pathetic...I am strong confident smart healthy and a great leader when I am sober...My son needs me to be the role model I needed as a child."..I've also got a before and after pic from MyFitnessPal pal from my 4 months sober period last year. On the left is a fat blob I barely recognise. On the right is a dude who I'm proud to be (maybe a few extra pounds since my December relapse but we are working on it!). .."You never regret not drinking" is what another sobernaught said to me on here. I really liked that one. ..I was a little bit scared about how quickly my thoughts started to rationalise that beer. Clearly I can't trust my own thinking. Had the beer been under my nose at a pub I probably would have caved. ..I'm going to keep going. I won't drink with you today. I may need to look at AA though so I have a better program in place. ..Oh and this morning marks 3 weeks sober! I'm sipping a coffee and listening to music in a cafe before starting my day.

This sub has saved me multiple times in just the way you laid out. Thoughts come I pull up SD. The one time I caved and drank I did NOT go here first. Anecdotal evidence but still powerful for me. Kudos man. This is a great group of people who never hesitate to support us all. I'm grateful to be here. &lt;3
