Hello M/32/UK Dad of 2 - 31 days continually free of Alcohol...&amp;#x200B;..I lost my last job to alcohol three months ago. I took this as a sign to start this process and its not been easy in-fact its been bloody difficult I just wanted to share what has helped me...* Books - Naked Mind Alcohol Explained (great book).* Podcasts - This Naked Mind Recovery Elevator.* AA - Sponsor and Meetings (take what you need leave what you dont)..From the above resources over the last three months I have taken what has helped me and has stood out so far:..* Admitting to myself that I am an Alcoholic has helped massively I say it to myself when in my car and in meetings out-loud for my own accountability.* Moderation is hell and isnt an option.* You MUST get sober for yourself and not anyone else even your kids (close second however) .* Being Sober is my Superpower.* Look forward dont dwell on the past.* Pray (I was very uneasy with this but it doesnt matter who you pray to just pray).* ODAAT.* Alcohol is everywhere and is written into our society there is no escaping it - its ridiculous.* Setting my children the best example by not drinking is massively important  ..Its been a struggle and I found out yesterday I do not like non alcoholic beer. I will not drink again however I will go easy on myself and take ODAAT..Whilst sober I have secured a good new job which starts tomorrow - I will stay sober in it. IWNDWYT and wish me luck!!!..&amp;#x200B;..PS I am staying away with work tomorrow night with my new boss whose mentioned going for beers.... I will abstain any suggestions would be appreciated ..&amp;#x200B;..&amp;#x200B;
