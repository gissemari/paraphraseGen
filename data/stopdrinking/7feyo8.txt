I didn't realize how a holiday weekend can really mess with the structure I need! Reading other people's stories i'm not alone in that. I have a dear friend in town today and that little nagging ass voice in my head is there. "Just a few beers". However she is what i said she is a dear friend. Meaning she will want to know how i am doing and actually care. So no bullshit. i will be honest. It doesn't have to be the entire conversation it will probably be brief but I will come clean. .I am thinking of everyone who may be struggling this minute this hour this day and this weekend. Thank you for being here. It's a tough one but I'm still so very thankful and I will not drink with you today!.Share

That sounds like it'll be an excellent visit! 
Being able to talk to friends openly and honestly is huge! So hard to do it alone. 
Double digits!!!  Congrats!..Not drinking with you today.
I made it through thanksgiving passed up a night at the bar with friends and went to work instead. Worked all night in a new area then had to give report to a nurse with a really bitchy attitude. Man I wanted a drink when I got home! But... I will not drink with you today!
