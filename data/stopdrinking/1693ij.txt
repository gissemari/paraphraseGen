I haven't had a drink in almost a week which is great seeing on how in the past 5+ years I couldn't go for over a day without one. .   I am struggling to make right the mess I created while drunk. You see I have gotten extremely wasted in front of coworkers and even worse in front of my boss's boss several times. I have developed a bad reputation and it sucks. My boss spoke to me privately about some of the things I ranted about and is trying to help me out. But I am extremely embarrassed and am getting really stressed out. Alcohol is affecting my work which is frightening..  How do you all come back from damage that you caused as a result of your drinking?..**------------------------**..**Edit** Thanks all for the responses.  I feel like I have a plan of action and that many of you have gone through what I will go through. I also feel like there is a way I can redeem myself at work and it maybe a challenge that as long as I stay sober it can be accomplished. Thanks all for you time and support..

Man that's a tough one.  Especially if you've done this more than once (which having a reputation implies) you might have to show improvement through your actions.  One step my be to tell your boss that you've recognized drinking is negatively affecting your behavior and your work and that you are making a change.  If s/he's the kind of person you can open up to let your boss know about your progress...Talking the talk might not prove anything but taking actual action and making tangible changes show people that you really are trying to improve...I hope you can improve your situation and that the people you need to see it (besides yourself) are able to recognize it...Good luck.
Fix your alcohol problem first. You can correct all things once your sober. If you can't do it alone (few of us can) get some help. AA or some such program. Thats the best way not to do the same things again. 
It'll take time but if you're not drinking then you'll have the time you need to slowly repair your reputation.
Look good. Smell good. Be predictable. ..Those three things you can do. The rest of the amends come with time. Its a process my friend. I relied on AA and my treatment groups to really express the shame I was experiencing. 
Definitely take one thing at a time.  Once you start repairing yourself and your alcoholic tendencies everything else will be more manageable.  You may even find that others will observe your efforts on bettering yourself and forget all the "damage" you did while you were doing the opposite...Good luck!
You wear down/wear out a bad rep by developing a better one.  It time and it may be shorter than you think the better rep overrides. The trick is how to develop the better one and for you that begins with stop drinking (and doing drunk things). For many AA is the way to do that sometimes augmented/jump started by formal 'treatment'. Worked for me still is.  .

Congratulations on your new direction and commitment to turn it all around. I caution you against thinking that just stopping cold turkey will create a real change in your behavior and relationships. I was more of an asshole when I got sober. At least drunk I was not focused on wrecking havoc. It was just random damage. Sober I could plot revenge for perceived wrongs. Crazy and sober. I was a mess. Then I started recovery and I am trying to do it better...The amends you are talking about are the 9th of 12 steps. I couldn't start there. I had to work through all of the steps with another alcoholic. It was (is) not as hard or painful as I was afraid it was going to be. ..I would suggest you find a sponsor to help you. Doing it alone? Remember that "I Sponsor Myself" is the -ism in alcoholism. 
Do you have health insurance? If so you may want to seek an outpatient program which is completely confidential and could be free of charge to you. Get into a group setting and talk you may need professional help with this.
Staying sober and recovering is the best amends in a lot of situations. In some it is the only one
