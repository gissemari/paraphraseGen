I don't drink every day but when i do i tend to not be able to stop until I'm blackout drunk. I want to stop completely but i have no idea what to do or where to start. I have struggled with anxiety and depression so i have used alcohol to self medicate myself as well. any ideas of how to start?

I was a lot like you - I basically felt in control of when I took the first drink but not much else after that. I still feel like I can control when I take the first drink but nothing else so I choose not to drink at all...I started by reading and participating on this subreddit and reading the Allen Carr book on alcohol (linked on the sidebar) and it has helped tremendously. A lot of my anxiety and depression has become much more manageable since quitting but a therapist can help with that much more than any self medication will.
If you want to stop drinking I wholeheartedly recommend attending AA meetings. It saved my life and has given me more gifts than I can count.
I am like you with the drinking anxiety and depression.  I've been working on sobriety for four months and going to AA for three months.  I have found that AA works for me at least so far.  And not to get controversial but the whole higher power thing is really shifting my thinking more than years of therapy did.  That and trusting/relying on the simple program of AA.  Being sober and having a recent connection with prayer and a higher power has done more to improve my anxiety and depressions symptoms that anything else I have tried in the past.
