Long time lurker first time poster. ..I started my journey to sobriety on Saturday and made it through the weekend!! This has been my longest sober period in 5 yrs. ..Today my real challenge begins. I travel each week for work and the airport and subsequent 3-5 hour flight is where I have always struggled the hardest to avoid drinking. Any advice from other frequent flyers on how you have dealt with   keeping your mind off drinking while in transit?..IWNDWYT!

I saw this one sitting unanswered for a bit and didn't want to leave you hanging. While I don't have any expertise in the travel area I'm sure there are others who do. ..My biggest problem was being at home and home being less than 200 feet from a grocery and liquor store. I had to find some ways to fill my time that did not involve drinking. That involved a lot movies reading and audio books in the beginning. Just anything really to transport my mind away from the fact that I'm sitting somewhere not drinking like I normally would. ..Best of luck. IWNDWYT!
Unfortunately I don't travel very often either but I am terrified of flying so getting a drink always calmed me down. Some ideas that might work: take a Benadryl and nap through the flight put some headphones in and get lost in a game on your phone read bring some coffee or soda with you so you have something non alcoholic on hand to drink. 
i think the best strategy is to just do it once...be brave and go it alone without the booze.  Once you do it one time...then it will be easier the next...then the next...then the next.  Face it head on!
