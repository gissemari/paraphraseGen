Badge reset. My lady had a real tough day insisted we have a beer and talk about it. I wasn't opposed because I felt in myself it would be a beer and nothing else. Also obviously I would love a beer. So here I am drank that beer hours ago. Thats it. Didnt go for another. No urge to. Guilt sits on the situation because the number has been restarted but I wont call this a relapse. 12 days back to 1 for the beer. Honesty to myself is all.

Btw I love you all.. and will continue to build numbers as life goes on. Just felt like it wasnt fair to me or the community to not reset because one beer is alcohol afterall. Intention lies with a sober tomorrow and the next day and the next day. Just general excitement that the demon didnt take control. 
Good on you for just doing one. I can't do that. I will help you not pick up the next first drink. Today not drinking.
Bumma. I personally think she shouldn't have asked that of you. Aaaaanyway at least you're back (we'll never really left). ..I won't drink with you today. 
This is the thinking that has always tricked me in the past. "Yay! I did it! I only had one! I can do this." And that works for awhile but then the slope gets steeper. One becomes two two becomes three and three becomes infinite. It eventually happens every time. I can drink moderately for weeks and then something turns and I'm blacked out. At some point it just takes too much mental power to stop myself. No longer can I celebrate having only that one because I know it's a trap. Maybe someday things will be different but not today.
