One of the most helpful things I learned here at SD was planning ahead for situations that could cause cravings and urges to drink. The *how* I plan has evolved but the **why** has stayed constant. Having a plan in advance strengthens my motivation and means I'm not searching for tools in the moment. I'm prepared. I've also received valuable suggestions from other sobernauts...For my current preparation I outline my Struggles and worries. Then I come up with Strategies to address them making sure I cover HALTS and DEADS. I tend to catastrophize so my Struggles often turn out to be far worse than the actual event. It also means I am prepared for anything!..**STRUGGLES**..I'm headed to visit my dad and stepmom. I'll be staying in their small home with them for a week...My stepmom and I don't get along. That might be generous--there is serious friction. I've learned to not turn it into a fire but it's still not comfortable...My dad has health issues. One reason for the trip is to spend time skiing before he goes in for surgery and a long recovery period. My family doesn't talk about emotions so there's going to be some awkward conversations where neither of us are comfortable navigating...I made a similar trip three years ago when sobriety was still kinda fresh. I'm remembering the stress and discomfort from back then...**STRATEGIES**..**Hungry:** definitely packing some comfort foods and favorites  .**Angry:** This is going to be the tricky one. I'm hoping that daytimes separated from my stepmom will help.  .**Lonely:** It may be tricky enough to get some time alone to recharge. Being socially isolated won't be an issue.  .**Tired:** Planning for lots of *good* tired but I will need to monitor my mood in the evenings.  .**Stressed:** I'm dropping out of contact work-wise. That will eliminate a certain amount of outside stress so I just need to manage the interpersonal stuff...**Delay:**  I can drink in five minutes.  I know I can get through urges and not drink on a minute by minute basis. I don't expect to need that skill here but I have it.  .**Escape:** Physically tricky. I'll have a phone and can hop on SD whenever I need it. A couple good books too.  .**Avoid:** My dad has cut back on his drinking too. It will be around but not the constant companion of years past. There's only one bar/restaurant in their small town so no choice there.  .**Substitute:** Ginger beer! Dad's been drinking that instead of whiskey or beer. I'm going to bring a selection of brands to sample.

You can do it - 1351 days is a hell of a thing.
Good luck you seem to have a great game plan!
