Satuday I relapse and was really bad. I made a scene  in my house with my parents. I don't know how the haven't kick me out yet. Yesterday i spend all day in bed feeling bad about everything. Today i woke up feeling bad too. I need to go to therapy but I'm really ashamed of that. How can I let this be ? Not even 2 weeks and I relapse. I thought I had it this time...The good part is that I'm still alive and just have to get help it's the only way. Day by day. I'm really scared but there is thing that you just have to do...I will not drink with you today.

Not drinking with you today &amp; welcome back. You can do this :)
Good luck and do not give up. .
Good luck - keep coming back. I will not drink with you today!
Glad to have you back here.  One hour at a time if that's what it takes.  I see a therapist and take medication - both have helped tremendously.  No shame in getting yourself healthy!  I'm not drinking with you today.
Hey! I am in the same boat as you I had about 12 days under my belt and I drank (a lot) on Saturday. In my experience the best way to get over that terrible embarrassing shameful feeling is to face them head on and talk to whoever it was that I made a fool of myself to. I hope you find peace in this situation. Congratulations on making it back. You can do this don't give up on yourself. I won't drink with you today.
