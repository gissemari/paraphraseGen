I was struggling a bit last night. I chickened out over going to a meeting so i decided to go see a movie instead. The one I had planned to go to sold out and the next one wasn't for about 2 hours.  I was wandering around the city passing all the bars and thinking about how easy it would be to pop into one for a few drinks to kill some time. I decided to smoke a bit of weed instead. Ive been on the fence about doing this since I've decided to give drinking a break  because I'm worried about just replacing one substance with another. However I was able to relax and enjoy a walk and also found a really cool bookstore. It really took my mind off of drinking  and I was much more content to explore  the city on a warm summer night rather than sit alone in some dark nasty bar. .I don't want to employ this method every time I'm hankering a drink but for right now while I'm just trying to get through these first days I figure if I'm just taking a couple hits of some [very old and shitty] weed instead of downing however many boilermakers on a Wednesday night then I'm okay with that. That's all. Today I'm catching up on some shows and books and just taking it easy and drinking WATER and  having a great gd time. So grateful for everyone here! ..Also the movie I went to see was Eighth Grade it was fantastic

Congrats for not drinking yesterday! .And about the weed I did that a lot of times when trying to quit or moderate and at first it works but then I always end up smoking too much. So I guess  it doesn't really work for me. Maybe because before I was always drinking and smoking  at the same time. But I think it depends on the person. . Have a nice day =)
I'll still smoke about once every two months I don't find it a problem. Other people find it a trigger. It all depends on the person. If you can enjoy weed once in a while and doesn't affect you wanting to drink I would say do it. You didn't drink last night so that tells you something.
