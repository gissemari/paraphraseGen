Good Morning/Afternoon!..*Theme:* Freedom..**"There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires." - [Nelson Mandela](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/n/nelsonmand131681.html?src=t_freedom)**..*What I get from it:* There was a mention of freedom tonight here on /r/stopdrinking and I was struck by the fact that currently [freedom is my favorite part of my sobriety](http://www.coolnsmart.com/images/2007/05/Freedom-31.jpg).  I feel free from so many things these days; free from having to drink obviously but there is so much more.  I am free to really start living my life the way I want to and have wanted to for so many years but couldn't bc of the hold alcohol had on me. Free to enjoy simple things.  Free to get well and healthier.  Free to look into myself and really work on the shit I have been stuffing down for decades.  Free of constant anxiety and resentments and jealousy and fear....I still struggle of course but it is NOTHING like it used to be for me. And mostly I am free to actually give myself permission to try to like - even love - myself. The peace I am getting from this freedom is astounding.  ..I wouldn't give this up for anything.

He digs it so I thought some of you might too.  :)

Great post and links! When I was drinking and doing "what I wanted to do" I thought I was enjoying freedom but ironically it was bondage. There I was stuck inside 4 walls not wanting to go anywhere or see anybody or do anything other than drink. It was self-imposed imprisonment. ..I love to paraphrase M. Scott  Peck: "Only through discipline are you set free." In sobriety I wasn't giving up any freedoms. No instead I was getting my freedom back.
Thank you for all your work on this sub!
