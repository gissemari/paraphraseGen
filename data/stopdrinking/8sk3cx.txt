This is my second relapse. the anxiety and fear and uneasiness is back in my life and I'm depressed. I'm scared I can't be honest...Which is why I am going to come clean to my sponsor homegroups and some people I have started friendships with.  I am really scared about the judgement and what it's going to look like but if I can't admit that I am struggling to other people I will continue to hide...I've contacted EAP luckily I have insurance and can see a professional as well I'm scared I won't be able to do this. ..Any support advice would be really appreciated thank you.

Happens to lots of us it's the nature of the disease. Best thing is to come back in. We will be here.
My first sobriety date was in 2007. My actual sobriety date is in 2010. During those three years of constant relapse I found honesty to be one of my best friends. In particular with myself but also with others...Pain shared is pain lessened
AA ends every meeting I go to with Keep coming back !..From the stories I have heard in meetings  there are many people that relapse a couple of times before actually getting it ........ myself included if you are here and reaching out it means you want to stop maybe this is the time it will stick with you !..IWNDWYT
We all fall at some point; we can also get back up dust off and keep on trucking along our Path. ..Building healthy habits takes time; be forgiving towards yourself.
Those who get sober in AA and never relapse are a rarity. One such old-timer comforted me after a relapse. He said alcoholics drink it's their natural state. When alcoholics don't drink that's relatively a miracle. No judgement is warranted. I think everyone will be empathetic and happy for you for jumping right back in. All that said it's no picnic doing the newcomer thing again. Take it one day at a time.
