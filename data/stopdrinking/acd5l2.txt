Hey there everybody .First of all before I start please forgive my mistakes since english is not my native language..So after a long period of sobriety for my standards i felt good and decided to try and enjoy resposibly some alcovol in nye i had a hangover the other day but not a blackout so i thought this was ok but since then I haven't stopped drinking . This relapse also made me realize that people around me are kind of feeding on my misery and they aren't interested about me....So here is a promise to myself:.I will get my life together and enjoy every moment of it to the fullest !!.Any advice is welcome fellow redditors .

umm I can tell you that I've relapsed so many times it's shameful. I does not get better. You're playing with fire. There's an app I use called Sober Time or something like that. It will restart your clock every time you relapse. But it also keeps your original date so you can see how long of time you had and see how you're back to zero. I know because I had to reset recently.
