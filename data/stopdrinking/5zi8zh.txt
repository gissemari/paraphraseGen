So the whole family been struck with flu this week including a hacking chest cough that has made our house sound like its occupied by barking seals and not humans. ..Anyway I went to collect my daughter from her friends yesterday evening and was coughing away when the gran came in with a hot toddy for me. I did politely refuse at first but it was easier just to take it than argue. And it did make me feel better but I know there would have been a fair bit of whiskey in it. Hence the reset...Im not mad about it this time as I feel its a bit different from before but still its back to day 1 again for me!..Have a good day SD.
