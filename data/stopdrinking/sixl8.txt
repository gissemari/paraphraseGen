I am so happy that we have badges on here... I know my sober date my anniversary but the days get away from me. Feels so good to see 1000 on there. ..Keep going guys. Seriously recovery is so hard but SO WORTH IT. It took me relapses falls on my face hospitalizations and humiliations...  And now I can't imagine being the same person that I was then.
