If your badge is correct you are doing so good so far what's got you down today?
Fight your way back spend time talking to your sponsor if you have one.  If you don't go to a meeting and talk to someone. It's the part of recovery I struggle with the most. I have 396 days and find I'm at my worst when I'm alone. Good luck.
Welcome back /u/hiim_grouf.  You say that "out of nowhere you gave in and drank" but as you know it wasn't out of nowhere.  It is as you quickly added because you let your guard down which as you know means you stopped doing all the sober actions that work to keep us sober.  A conscious and deliberate daily decision not to drink; recovery meetings and other sober contact; going to bed sober; repeating.
