Hi r/stopdrinking!..I am pleased to say I have now reached two weeks of sobriety. This is the longest that I have been sober in at least 8 years and it feels like a real achievement to have gotten this far...I have been feeling real benefits in my mood my energy levels and my general zest for life. I have noticed many of the things that people talk about here like dreams coming back slightly improved skin and more emotional range. But a further significant benefit for me has been that I feel more confident and energetic in dealing with other people. Instead of taking a back seat in conversations and situations I am being much more proactive in voicing my thoughts (and in HAVING thoughts to voice instead of being passive!).  I have had comments from people that I 'look good today' a couple of times and that is a nice feeling. All of that reinforces my feelings of positivity about sobriety...I might be making it sound like it has been easy so far but it has not. If you were to look at my post history you would see a post from day 4 when I very nearly relapsed: I got so far as pouring wine into a mug before deciding to dump it away after all. And a few days ago I faced a big workplace social event sober while every one of my colleagues were drinking. It felt awkward throughout and I had a few strong urges. But I stayed the course and felt appropriately smug when everyone else talked about how bad their hangovers had been when we next saw each other on the Monday morning...At the moment my strategy is to keep a focus on the positives. And I have my last truly epic hangover as a horror story in the back of my mind if I start thinking of drinking again. So far I have been completely generous with myself when it comes to cravings for other things. I am geting through candy like nobody's business and have had a fair bit of Chinese food pizza etc etc over the past two weeks. I like to think that has been balanced a bit by not drinking and by actively seeking out healthier foods like salad and fruit as well that I would not be eating if I were drinking. But I will start thinking about tapering off the unhealthy stuff in the next few weeks...So that is where I am at. A long post I know. I do not know if anyone will read it all! But this is really just to get my thinking about my sobriety so far off my chest and put it 'out there'...And finally: I have been checking this subreddit often a few times a day. The stories thoughts and advice that you have all been sharing has been a real help and a constant reassurance. So thank you for that.
