Good thing we can only go for so long without sleeping before we're tired enough to finally sleep!  I went for about a week with very little of it myself then I slept quite nicely.  I still do
Tired is a big trigger! I am still realising this (tired yesterday and also right now and things seem like they're on hard mode!)
Almost to the weekend.... Hopefully you'll have some time to catch up on sleep nap at least close your eyes and rest. I am in the same boat starting day 6 (badge is off). Sleep has been horrendous.  ..Good luck...I will not sleep with you tonight. ; )
I had so many restless nights in those first few weeks and then when I did sleep well the dreams I would have were so vivid. I guess it was my mind finally being able to sleep after the better part of a decade. See I never went to sleep for the better part of 10 years I blacked out every night..Now I sleep deeply and joyfully..Hang in there those normal natural rhythms come back and when they do it's lovely. Until then rest you eyes and body try not to let your mind race and breathe..Take care
I go to the doctor and get a short course of sleeping pills. I don't see any reason to suffer when it's only temporary
I have insomnia and honestly just going to bed cures both my need for sleep and my trigger for alcohol. It's weird that lack of sleep stresses me out and is a trigger for alcohol. But just simply going to bed can basically cure both of those problems for me.
