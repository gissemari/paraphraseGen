Hi I am currently 22 days sober on my second attempt...On my first attempt to stop drinking I tapered off by myself and went to AA meetings every day (sometimes twice a day) for the first two weeks then my attendance started to dwindle and I relapsed after 25 days. I drank for about another 6 weeks and hopelessly tried to control my drinking to no avail and I knew I needed to get back to AA and to sobriety because things were getting worse even in that short time period. ..Now on my second attempt I entered a medical detox program which was extremely helpful for the first 6 days as I was suffering badly from physical withdrawal symptoms. I feel much more serious in my recovery this time around. I feel like I finally fully accept that there is no way I will ever be able to control my drinking and I realize much more how it has impacted my family my friends and my health...My issue this time is getting motivated and finding the emotional energy so to speak to get to AA I should mention that I have co-occurring mental health problems (severe anxiety and depression) My second unhealthy coping mechanism for anxiety after drinking is withdrawing from others friends family etc. I feel like just talking to others gets exhausting. And AA works so well in that I know if I show up at any meeting I'll probably recognize someone from my first attempt at sobriety and everyone at the meetings is so friendly and talkative (which I love). One of my favorite characteristics of AA is how welcoming and honest the people are. However just the thought of having to show up and talk to people and interact the anxiety of all of it just makes me want to withdraw more. This is a bad mind state to be in and I know I will be better equipped to recover if I attend meetings but I'm having a really hard time getting to one. ..I was wondering if anyone on here has had a similar experience or could offer some insight. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much for reading!

try to make friends at the meetings.  then you'll see it as going to see your friends instead of a chore.
Fake it till you make it? Not exactly sure what you are asking. For me I look at it clinically it is a disease. Not a great example but if I found out I was in need of a mastectomy for breast cancer do I WANT to have my breast cut off? Of course not will I die if I don't? Probably. Can I try a lumpectomy and or radiation instead? will it have the same effect? Maybe but not likely and if it did the road there was going to take A LOT longer than the mastectomy and will likely prove unsuccessful...When recovery begins we all have to find our groove no two recoveries are the same. I'm still making changes and adjustments my program today is nothing like it was November 20th 2013. It is my belief that recovery should not begin and "end" the same way I'm constantly tweaking some work some don't but I'm sober and I'm very happy and am pleased with how I have evolved in the process.
