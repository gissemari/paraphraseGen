Hey everyone!..Just wanted to check in and say I've been watching everyone excited to see people moving forward and seeing some names I recognize hit some milestones. I doubt I'm as recognized; I've drifted away with some ridiculous work things happening lately. Net positive it seems. ..I had to kind of stop watching for the run between Thanksgiving and New Year's; it was a little too intense for me to browse regularly. The panic of the early days and the extreme anxiety is apparently easier to relive than I expected and it was all a bit much to take in. ..Fortunately it's been relatively quiet on my front; continuing to work through things with my therapists; am overdue for a check-in AA meeting and I think hopefully this week or early next the opportunity will finally arise...As to the easiest month of sobriety: Yeah there's a DASH of "well it's coming up on five months" in there. The real reason? I've been laid out with the worst respiratory infection I think I've ever had. Tons of sleeping punctuated by hosing out my nasal cavities; a bunch of meds and then back to sleep. I've been feeling so crappy that drinks are about the farthest thing from my mind. If you're struggling bad I might recommend it but that's very tongue in cheek...Anyway... keep on keepin' on. You all are great to refer to and I scan through at least twice a day. Now that my schedule is settling down a bit I hope to be a little more hands on but I don't want to overpromise. (But who am I?) ..

Good to hear!..I have found that this month has been really nice too and we are right on top of each other date wise.  May the force always be with us!
