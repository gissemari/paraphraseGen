[It's that day again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T9Hv5TJXT4)..You guessed it. Happy Hump Day! What's Up Wednesdays are when we celebrate our sobriety see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-------------------------------------------------------------------------------..**Triumph:** I have decided that I am like an old computer that used to run on an outdated operating system but I bought a software upgrade. Now when I think of something stupid and drinking-related I did in the past instead of feeling shame I think  Well I was running an old software -- Mary 1.0 -- and that version was flawed. Luckily I am now running a better version -- Mary 2.0 -- so I don't have those problems anymore.  ..**Struggle:** I am struggling to find a job that pays a living wage while I also care for my 87-year-old mother. (I can only imagine how difficult this would be if I were still drinking.)..**General:** As a kid I loved to go to garage sales and search for collectible antiques. Now as a sober adult I'm rediscovering the fun of treasure-hunting. I just went to a yard sale and bought (for fifty cents) this antique [milk jug](http://i.imgur.com/yRSZu45.jpg) which is Burleigh Ware from England a pottery that Queen Mary apparently loved. It's not the Hope Diamond but it will make having my morning coffee more fun..
----------immediate responses--------

Triumph: I'm starting to get to the point where I'm not crippled by my anxiety. Everyday is getting a little easier and I just need to remember to do it one day at a time. ..Struggle: I'm trying so hard to not take out any of my frustration out by snapping at my beautiful and supportive significant other. I know I'm grumpy and she has been so supportive. ..General: I spontaneously got the next three days off work so instead of going on a bender my partner and I are found to South Dakota to see Mt. Rushmore for the first time and so some hiking. 
Triumph: I'm at home in my pajamas which means there's a 99% chance I won't drink. I'm way too lazy to get dressed and go buy liquor once I'm in the house and dressed for bed. ..Struggle: been obsessing about going to the bar the last two days to escape the current stress of clearing the wreckage my last run caused. I've made it through by reading this sub calling sober friends and going to a lot of meetings. These were things I told myself I'd do when the cravings got bad...General: my birthday is this week. If all goes according to plan this will be my second birthday in a row where I haven't taken a drink. A childhood friend of mine is having a baby shower on the same date. Thus I'll be celebrating my birth by celebrating  his first child. 
Triumph: I had a really nice day at work and laughed a lot. I was not full of anxiety and sadness...Struggle: I am dealing with some problems in my relationship and have been for a while. Things this week have been worse but I am trying to stay hopeful...General: I have my mind set on finding some hobbies that I enjoy. I looked at local Art Museum's website to see if there are any classes I can take. I didn't sign up yet but the idea sounds intriguing. I'm going to keep searching for new things to learn and do.
Triumph: I've managed to cut back more than I ever thought I could. I'm still working towards being entirely drink free it's just so fucking difficult with no support system in the day to day...Struggle: Making it through work sober. I love my coworkers but I hate my job. And none of them know that I'm working towards quitting so whenever I go to leave (supermarket) I get at least 4 "What?! No beer today?!" ..General: I don't know why my dog has decided to start chewing my shoes. I guess I'm going to Shoe Show tomorrow. 
Superficial triumph: People keep telling me I look healthy!! Me!? I posted a photo of me and a friend hanging out this weekend and the comments were so kind. Granted many of them were from girls I knew from rehab so they really know how jacked up I looked. It really made me feel good about myself. 
Triumph: I haven't had a drink and I'm still going strong. I'm feeling better physically every day as the poison leaves my system. Also I have some appointments this week that should help me move forward...Struggle: I am unemployed and looking for work is dehumanizing. Also I have too much idol time which I used to use to drink. Old habits die hard so I still struggle with the evil voice telling me to drink.  ..General: I'm doing my best to stay even keeled. Not too high or too low with my emotions. It's going pretty well. Better than I thought it would.
Triumph: It's been almost a year since I've stayed completely sober for this long...Struggle: Emotional friggan Rollercoaster. One hour I feel like I'm on top of the world- floating on that super awesome pink cloud. The next my anxiety depression and sneaky addictive thoughts overwhelm me. ..General: I'm okay today and will not drink. A piece of Costco cheesecake and a glass of milk sound better anyway!.
Triumph: There's a new girl at work and I made conversation and asked questions. Whee! I'm not good at that. Really trying to work on being less passive and shut off. I want to be friendly God damn it!..Struggle: Lyrica withdrawals have me feeling like I'm dying. Can't sleep which really sucks. I fell asleep once last night and had a horrific nightmare right away. The weird thing is I KNEW it was coming! Feels like looooong ago when I used to take drugs and the comedowns would give me nightmares and sleep paralysis. I'm just being gentle with myself until its over. Luckily its not a busy week for me...General: I think I'm going out for Thai food today! Yes! 
Triumph: I started weight lifting about a month ago. Always wanted to do that but apparently it took me over 9 months of sobriety to get the inspiration and motivation to actually start.  Pretty damn proud of it...Struggle: Working after summer vacation is a bitch. I have been at my current job for years partly because I could manage it while drinking every night. Now I see  that this really is not a place or job for me. Got to try to find another one...General: After kind of getting used to not thinking about drinking I've been lately thinking about how proud of my journey I am. I've been here everyday again and just generally more thankful of my sobriety.
Oh man I forgot about this board and just posted a separate message about how I paid of my student loan today!! Anyway.... I did it! I am debt free!!! Very pleased right now :)
I love the 'triumph' mindset there - i'm going to start telling myself that
Triumph - For the first time since quitting I sat quietly &amp; listened to a guided meditation = self care :)..Struggle - Feelings emotions the rollercoaster of new sobriety!..General - My dog thinks it's great that I wake up &amp; play with him :)
Triumph I've decorated my home. I've changed my job. I've finally cut all ties with my sons father and I've quit drinking alcohol. Plus stopped smoking over a year ago. Wishing you all well and today I Will not drink with you  
**T:**  I've been trying to get my life together and I feel like I'm finally starting to see results!  My kitchen is clean my bathroom is clean my daughters room is cleaned my bedroom is clean and my front room is clean.  Next up: garage and basement.  ..**S:**  I've been dealing with the state and child support.  They are saying that I owe $2000 in child support and I don't.  So yeah... trying to get this situation straightened out.  Not fun...**G:**  I love the outdoors.  I love being in natural areas and hiking.  I took my six year old camping.  The mosquitoes were well I don't really have the words right now to describe it.  It was really bad.  But we both had a good time.  I feel like it brought me back to who I am as a human being in the world.  It gave me the confidence to deal with my child support situation.  I also had some other financial problems that put a damper on my spirits but by going camping I knew that it was a situation I would survive.  I'm (and probably most people in western civilization) so cut off from who I am as a human in nature and instead see myself mostly as a human in modern society.  I feel like my alienation from the natural world had a lot to do with my excessive alcohol consumption.
Triumph: I haven't had a drink for over a week now even with everything that's going on in my life. Started seeing a new psychologist who specialises in alcohol abuse and PTSD...Struggle: it has come to light that my brothers wife is being mentally abusive towards him even claiming that he is abusive towards her. I'm trying to help support him but it's hard because it's bringing up memories of my past abusive relationship and all the events surrounding that...General: I have built up the motivation to start taking my dog for walks again! He is so happy about it and it makes me happy to see him happy.
Triumph: Meeting every day .Struggle: A regular Schedule.General: Relapse bites!..Smiles  
Triumph: my partner and I went shopping for wedding rings today. I was a little eeeek at the price and then thought 'no its exactly what I want it's handcrafted by a craftsman and its how much I used to spend on booze in 6 months'. I am allowed to spend money on something thst is important and meaningful...Struggle: my sleep seems to have gone down hill this week. I don't know what's causing it but difficulty falling asleep nightmares and waking up exhausted. Its been tough...General: i am loving reading everyone's updates here.
Triumph: I'm still sober! ..Struggle: I feel like my career sucks any and all energy out of me. I'm two days back in and I feel depleted. ..General: Ever have weekend plans that you hate but you have to do them? That's me this weekend. 
Triumph: decided to accept the extra 15 hours of work and move to the countryside. Feeling great about this decision...Struggle: the idea of moving next month and all the process it requires is stressing me out a little...General: feeling hopeful 
Thanks for the encouragement Mary 2.0.   Since sober my  health and fitness level have improved incredibly but not my financial health. But  I must not let my business / money anxieties overshadow the fact that this sober Dan 2.0 is more than up to these real-world challenges. Positive and focused  sober confidence will prevail. 
Fuck the zero 
Triumph: I'm new here but choosing not to drink isn't where I necessarily struggle. It's stopping once I start. Which is why I made the choice to not drink at all at least for a long while. Last night we had dinner with my mother in law in a very nice bar/restaurant with high quality beers and wines. I chose water with dinner something that was out of the ordinary enough to warrant a comment from the inlaws. Feels good man...Struggle: I don't want to call attention to my stopping drinking and with football season right around the corner I know there will be awkward questions. I'm still deciding how I'm going to handle that...General: My Brother in Law just got his first DUI over the weekend. It was a big part of scaring me straight and the poor kid blew a .09... I really hope there is some leniency for him but I also am so happy he didn't hurt himself or someone else. 
Triumph: I posted here yesterday about my weight loss which is a huge triumph I think :-) Other triumph: I'm enjoying the heck out of my homemade juices and cashew milk! I'm also going to look bomb at the Renaissance festival which starts next weekend!..Struggle: my roof is leaking yet again. Fortunately my contractor came right out to take a look and is sending someone to fix it. Thank goodness. ..General: I make jewelry and it's getting to the point where I have to sell stuff because I've made so much. Now I have a beading habit instead of a drinking habit! Hopefully I can make some money at it! 
**Triumph**: I ran a 10k in 57:40 at the weekend. I recently joined a running club which is forcing me to actually get faster. I realize that the reason I was so slow was almost entirely mental. It's quite exciting getting PBs on races. ..**Struggle**: I am attempting to finally stop smoking properly. I have reached a point where I only really smoke on weekends but I want that to stop too. I want to be free of it. And don't direct me to stopsmoking I have reset my badge there so many times it's ridiculous...**General**: I just bought an awesome jumper with a lobster on it for  3 in a charity shop.
**Triumph** I am on a yearly getaway with my sober SO same place we always go and I am happy to report that I have been having a great time sober and have eaten twice in the hotel bar (taco tuesday - come on!) and have not been tempted to have one of the specials beers! So happy about this!  .**Struggle** I am trying to not have anxiety episodes over my upcoming job situation. I work 3 jobs and one is hinged on grant funding which is up in the air at present. If the grant doesn't come through I will need to find another part time job. Part of me is scared the other part of me sort of feels like this might be the universe helping me through a change in careers one step at a time. (currently in school as well working for a B.A. in psychology - once I get there I am going on a whole new career path)  .**General:** As I slowly build sober time I am finding that I am more engaged in my family am enjoying having more time (yes I am realizing just how much of my time revolved around drinking...) and feeling clear headed and generally happy. Much calmer much of the time and for that I am thankful!
Triumph: I've been getting back into exercise and have either been to the gym or done something active for the past week. I'm already much less bloated and lost a little bit of weight...Struggle: Coming to terms with my debts. I'll have to live very frugally for the at least the next year if not longer in order to get straight...General: I've finally been getting around to watching films I've had on my DVR for at least two years. I've been watching something every night - Inception tonight!
**Triumph:** I sent an email to a local organization seeking information regarding SMART Recovery meetings. There used to be a SMART Recovery group in my neighborhood but it's unclear if they're still meeting. I hope they are so I can check it out. I've accepted that I might need a little help on this journey of not drinking...**Struggle:** I seem to be suffering from seasonal allergies and poor sleep. I've also had a tension headache for two days. I just feel generally run down right now...**General:** I recently made my own kombucha (with the help of a friend). My first flavor is now in secondary fermentation. I can't wait to try it!
**Triumph:** I've been feeling pretty positive lately. My routine is stable I have a girlfriend (although we haven't officially talked about if we're actually dating or not) and I'm making some good steps to improve myself. It's better than where I was at the beginning of the year!..**Struggle:** Even though I'm dating someone I sometimes feel like I'm going through the motions. There are some great moments but for every great moment there's plenty of times that seem almost mechanical or rote. Maybe that's just part of dating...time to find out right?..**General:** I want to start biking to work a few days a week. My bike should be repaired today after work so I'll bike the route this weekend to prepare for next week. Anything to save on gas/kick-start my metabolism/help the planet right?
This is day one for me again and I'm really hurting. Gatorade by the bedside. Taking the day off work. Threw up last night. Just... fuck. This is the worst part. How do you get through the shitty withdrawals and anxiety? I miss my sobriety. I will not drink today it's not worth it. My head hurts so bad. Luckily I got some sleep and ate some soup before bed so I feel OK. I mean horrible but OK. I hate hate hate hangovers. This is the most miserable feeling in the world. 
u/sfgirlmary I admire and respect the heck out of you for taking care of Mom. More than you know :). &lt;3..Triumph:     High level meetings with old colleagues are going amazingly well. I haven't run in this circle for a couple years and I feel respected and welcome just like I always was. Except this time I'm sober ;)...Struggle:     Mom's vascular dementia is getting progressively worse. I'll take her throwing spaghetti/meatballs in the sink and throwing Styrofoam peanuts like confetti all over the house any day - over drinking...General:     I'm finally getting my SO to let me help him with the books for his successful business which is growing exponentially. After all that he does for me (I'm very spoiled by him) it's absolutely wonderful to help him too :)...
Good day to you all!.Triumph: 24 days! And i didn't drink soda either in the last two days :) these are small things they're so small from the outside but these 24 days are so incredible to me. I feel like i'm starting to break free from the insecure lazy shell alcohol had made of me and unleashing my true potential. Also i was struggling with the fridge being always full of beer from my uncle's job at a factory but i think he had a party recently and all beer was gone. Yay! I have a few days free of it until the next batch comes out...Struggle: Well. I'm a 24 years old indie comic artist so that is a big struggle in and of itself. I work 9-10 hours a day without break or vacation and make less than minimum wage... That and my living situation is less than solid right now. But i'm already making more than i made at my old job so that's good. Maybe soon i'll be able to afford a room somewhere. I "broke up" with my best friend of years and feel lonely which is also a trigger for me. All i can do is hope tomorrow will be better...General: .I'm trying to start dating again. Excited to be able to hang out and remember the whole thing less excited that being a lesbian my options for dating are often relegated to bars. 
Triumph: I'm sober I made an appt with a new therapist I've worked out three days in a row and I started This Naked Mind last night and am excited to continue it tonight!..Struggle: My emotions are going haywire. I was chipper this morning until I discovered a meaningless mistake I made in a document at work and it made me want to cry. I can't wait until my emotions settle!..General: I took a walk last night without headphones and listened to the crickets birds frogs and the other creatures that were humming their tunes. It was wonderful! I can't remember the last time I unplugged and just appreciated nature. I will definitely be making it apart of my routine. 
Triumph: It's been over a week since my last cigarette! ..Struggle: Feeling disconnected from my SO. Sometimes our differences make for good conversation lately it just feels like everything is an argument and we have no common ground. ..General: I went thrift store shopping with my mom last night and she was thrilled to find little picture frames for 50 cents each. When mom told the cashier that she uses them as a craft for the summer church camp she teaches at the cashier knocked the price down to 20 cents each. It seriously made my day to see how happy that made her :) 
Triumph: I fell asleep without any anxiety attacks last night..Struggle: My husband drinks a lot but supports my sobriety and is proud of me. I still find it hard to be around him and his beer..General: I have so much more time for reading and for the things that stressed me out and "made me" drink. I am not anxious at work today in fear of someone smelling last night's excesses on me in our close quarters. My eyes are clear and my face is radiant. I will not drink today.
Triumph: Figured out a good way to balance vacation time this year. Taking Fridays off for a while. This way I get a nice long weekend but not the anxiety that would come with a whole week not knowing what to do with myself and wanting to drink to "relax"...Struggle: I hit a wall with weight loss...I know I don't need to lose more. I'm at the point I'm eating more to gain some muscle and get energy back for long runs... I need to learn sobriety should not equal "skinny" but "healthy"..General: Same! My sister in law is a serious antique/thrift store Jewelry enthusiast. I've been tagging along and been having SO much fun finding things! Waking up super early on weekend for garage sales would've never happened before. 
Triumph - I have been sober 16 days which is longer than I have ever gone sober since sophomore year in HS 20 years ago. I'm not having insane cravings though I do think about drinking but I honestly don't want to. I'm sleeping amazingly and feel good at work. Haven't had any anxiety or panic attacks since I quit either! I feel great!..Struggle - I haven't lost any weight which I thought would fall off since I was drinking so much beer. However I am over-eating as a "treat" for not drinking so what else could I expect. Also I have been chain smoking as an excuse to "get me through" since I am not drinking. I would never smoke sober but find myself buying packs and smoking all day long. Lungs hurt! I'm also getting a bit crazy with online shopping and spending a lot of money. But I was spending upwards of $500 on booze a month so I'm justifying buying myself stuff as gifts for doing a good job...General - Have been enjoying my weekends much more sober. I am productive I wake up early I have been exercising and taking care of myself which I seldom did when I was drinking. I have a 3 day weekend coming up which I am looking forward to! I feel safer with myself on weekends than I do on weekdays believe it or not..
Triumph: I went to my first SMART meeting. I was so nervous and my voice was so shaky when I was introducing myself. But I also laughed. I was sober and laughing enjoying myself! I'll definitely be going back. ..Struggle: Cross addiction. I'm going to have to ask my husband not to buy anymore cartridges for the vape because I just can't have it in the house. I hate that my addictive personality has to impact my husband...General: We're going camping this weekend with my 19-month old for the first time. Going to the town my husband and I met in and it'll be a struggle both with the general frustrations of a toddler and staying sober. 
Triumph: It's been over 100 days of sobriety. Not one drop of alcohol. I am surprised I made it since I loved to drink. I do miss it but enjoy the benefits of not drinking. No hangovers no bloating no blackouts no feeling guilty about going to the liquor store everyday no hiding bottles etc. I know I can't let my hair down though. I don't want to relapse. ..Struggle: Marital problems. They've been there and are getting worse. Don't want to be at home any more. ..General: Halfway through the week of my employee on vacation. It's been a rough week covering for him but it's almost over. 
Can;t even get through day one. I stopped on Monday and started hearing voices on Tuesday. Back to square 1 today.....I need to check into a clinic...
**Triumph:** Moving forward on work projects...**Struggle:** It's been VERY hard for me to juggle all the work efforts and family. Especially since we've been traveling for fun. I'm stretched thin. It's catching up to me but I think I'm in a spot to begin catching up...**General:** As a kid I loved to climb trees. I never quite gave that up but have a much better reason now my kids are climbing too.
Triumph: working with my counseller and going to meetings is helping.  I know this because the day before my counsellor appointments I am very on edge ready to explode.  I depend on my thursday meeting to fill that evening and push me into the weekend so I keep coming back..Struggle:  I'm feeling very very alone without drunk me to keep me company.  she was a lying bitch but gave me excuses to make bad decisions.  Trying to fill my life and time with healthy things and people.  Peopling is hard..General:  been separated since May.  There is no way i could be doing this if I had stayed with my husband.  No.  Way.  So I am grateful
Triumph: After a depressing summer I'm actually starting to find enjoyable moments in my day to day life and everything doesn't feel like a struggle 24/7 anymore. At the moment anyway. Could be the pink cloud as well...Struggle: I realize that I am still depressed and not drinking aside I need to find and make fundamental changes to my diet sleep rhythm patterns of self-isolating behaviour and finally my thought patterns. At the same time I don't want any more pressure in my life so it tends to get quite confusing. ..General: Is it just me or do the warm days always start when the summer is nearing its end? I'm not complaining though :)
Is the IRC chat not working for anyone else?..Triumph: Weight loss stopped plateauing which is a plus felt like I was putting in the work for nothing for a while there. ..Struggle: Still having issues finding social issues that aren't alcohol or drug-centric. Guess I should have had a little more variety as far as friends and acquaintances go before I quit drinking because it's been a hassle trying to make new ones at my age...General: I dunno nothing in particular. Job hunting mostly. 
Triumph: Wooo hoo. Made it to 2 weeks! Haven't gotten here in a while. Super happy. It's also side by side with me tapering off my meds so I'm in an all around great mood!..Struggle: Keeping my anxiety at bay. Also regaining my focus. Trying to train myself there...General: It's my birthday today and I will not drink! Going bowling however with friends. I do kind of hate being around alcohol but I'm confident I will be fineee!
Triumph: I just found this subreddit. Woke up early enough to get some chores done before work. Dumped out my last bottle of liquor. Now just have to get the recyclables out so the reminder is not staring at me every time I walk by the kitchen.  ..Struggle: Tomorrow is my 34th birthday. I have to work so there is no party planned. My last sober birthday was my 18th...General: See my doc tomorrow for a medication management appointment and my counselor on Friday for a regular session. Wrote a blog recently about my decision to quit drinking. Have no real support as all my neighbors were my drinking buddies but they are also supportive of my decision. However Monday night I dumped all the liquor I had left into a cup mixed it with Sunny Delight and drank it all. Must be the meds I am on because I was only buzzed for about two hours. 
Enjoying my last day off before I go back to work. I'd love a beer with my PB&amp;J right now but it's not gonna happen. Today I will not drink with you.
Triumph: Last week was really rough on me and I got through it- sober!..Struggle: My procrastination has gotten somewhat better but I'm still struggling with it a lot...General: I went bike riding for the first time in maybe 7 years this past weekend- it was a lot of fun! I'm gonna try to do it more often.
Triumph: Last night I went to a family gathering where most people were drinking. Stayed sober and even put some beers into the cooler. ..Struggle: While that gathering was my triumph it was also my biggest struggle since my sobriety. I am going to a wedding on Friday and my old buddies are going to criticize me for not drinking.  That will be another huge struggle. ..General: I started a new job as a phlebotomist on Monday and so far I really like it but my coworkers have been talking about drinking most of the day. Any tips for making friends who also don't drink?
Triumph: I've successfully made it over 2 weeks sober and I've made a regular practice of meditation for the entirety of my sobriety. It's like kicking recovery into overdrive: I feel great!! I can't recall ever feeling so present in the moment and calm. I'm not anxious about the future though things are "bad." I'm not remorseful of the past mostly. I'm not dwelling on it and when I do catch myself reminiscing I make a conscious effort to forgive myself. I'm only human! ..Struggle: maybe I'm a little *too* chill about things. I need to edit my resume and make it shine then start applying for jobs. I need to start looking for a place to live. Oh and I need to actually get a sponsor. Been hitting meetings hard but have a really difficult time approaching someone about this. Big things!! ..General: I'm making a conscious decision to keep my communication with my ex-wife as light cheerful and cordial as possible. It's just easier this way! Do I love her? Of course! I'm guilty! But she wants change and I have to respect that! So it's time to stop worrying about her life and start focusing on mine.     
Triumph: I'm able to get to the gym at least 3x a week instead of just lying in bed. Also starting a 2nd job ..Struggle: just found my fertility wasn't that great so my husband and I have to make some decisions. Going to be waiting till after my surgery in October for that. ..General: just taking one day at a time &amp; attempting to show up. 
Triupmh: Today is my 2nd 60th day. My longest has been 77 days. So I'm really looking forward to breaking that. I'm feeling confident about not drinking and I'm even going to an AA meeting despite never going to one. I just want to meet people in a place where I know alcohol won't be involved. ..Struggle: Well I suck at dating and when I quit drinking the first time the thing that got to me was just about all my old friends want to drink want to go to a brewery and meeting new people has been harder. Honestly of all the problems I feel more lonely than anything hence why I'm going to an AA meeting...General: I love August but with work being so stressful and the end of the month being part a huge part of a large task I'll be so happy when this month passes...Generally pretty quiet in real life and online but in this case I just want to say I'm glad this community exist and I will not drink with you today.
Triumph: Got to tell my OCD therapist today that I haven't had a drink for 8 days. Thanks to y'all! Things are still hard on the mental health front but oh my God drinking makes it that much harder! ..Struggle: Meant to finish my thesis this summer and did not as I spent most of it hungover and now I feel like I'm using getting sober as an excuse to not work on it - in truth trying to get myself together takes a lot outta me! ..General: I'm way better at video games sober than drunk. Drunk me was convinced that drinking made me incredible. It did not. Not at all! Haha. 
Triumph: I've had a drinking buddy visiting me and I've been able to hang out without touching a drop...Struggle: Still groggy fuzzy and struggling with withdrawal. I'm hopeful tomorrow will be better and I can get on with some work I've been putting off for ages...General: I gave the dog a nice big walk this evening. Poor bugger needed it. I took him to the dog park and he had a good play with a bitch he likes.
**Triumph:** I'm keeping myself sufficiently distracted and drinking enough coffee that I'm not feeling the loss of alcohol *too* acutely at least as a craving. I'm experiencing other responses but I'm keeping the cravings and temptations at bay...**Struggle:** I'm not loving my moods at the moment. I used alcohol very deliberately for mood moderation: If I was feeling bored/despondent/unmotivated/etc. I would have a drink to try to jar myself out of that particular mood/mental space. It worked briefly -- I could squeeze out an extra hour of work or reading or something positive sometimes when I had a drink. Obviously it came at a cost. It's never just a drink. The first sip brought relief; the second drink brought depression the third drink made me useless at pretty much anything I wanted to accomplish...and on and on.  Without that I feel emotionally listless and dissociated but am prone to angry outbursts at trivial things. I'm confident things will level out eventually but it's not a pleasant state at the moment.
Triumph: I've been noticing I have not been paying all that much attention to counting days this time around. That is because alcohol has just not been on my mind all that much lately a welcome relief. And with not paying attention I was pleasantly surprised just now to discover I'm only a few days away from my new record! ..Struggle: getting sucked into news articles and social media discussions about news articles a little more than is healthy for me over the past few days. That triggered some depression but I seem to be snapping out of it today.  ..General:  I am writing fiction for the first time in a while and it feels good like the muse is with me during the writing sessions. I'm doing a lot of pre-writing and wild brainstorming which is fun.  I seem to be circling in on a comedic story themed around some of my own experiences as a teenager who continues to attend Sunday School even after he stops believing. 
**Triumph:** I lost enough weight that I can conceal my weapon at work no problem. We've had many people retaliate violently against termination before I worked here so that's a relief....**Struggle:** Eating garbage. I really need to start meal prepping for work and dinner. I keep ordering postmates every day after work. I Justify eating garbage because I only eat one or two items from the dollar menu of where ever I order from but it's garbage nonetheless....**General:** I'm really happy to be alive. I don't know what it is but I'm feeling pretty good. I guess it's that "pink cloud" that people always mention.....
A.c. went out in Texas summer and money money money.  But we have cold water. I am still doing this.
Triumph: I seem to be getting lots of opportunities to make the most money I've ever made in my life. I can pick and choose what I'll be working on next ..Struggle: My sleeping has been crazy and I've been getting these bouts of low low feelings and anxiety. Sometimes I want to jump off a bridge or drive into oncoming traffic I feel so overwhelmed sometimes. I seem to be making lots of jokes about killing myself lately..General: I'm glad I haven't gone back to drinking or drugs and I have a supportive family and friends and a supportive sober girlfriend 
Triumph: While I am still having trouble coping with my stress in a healthy manner I haven't poisoned myself in nearly a month and feel far better for it...Struggle: At work I'm constantly inundated with advertisements for alcohol and people regularly ask me for recommendations since I was known for being really into craft beers. It gets grating...General: I had a nice walk home instead of taking the bus. The sun is out and the lake is lovely. I'm thinking about grabbing a can of fizzy water and walking back down to the lake to just enjoy the sun some more.
Triumph: I hit a new PR at the gym..Struggle: This is the first week since I stopped drinking that I've really felt like I've made a lot of poor decisions. It's weird not having "I was drunk:hungover" as my excuse to fall back on..General: I seem to be getting better at managing my time.
Love the software analogy.  I find it does help to shake that pointless shame to have some thought process checks like this.  ..**Triumph**:  I took my first of six license exams.  As I walked out of the test center I thought about how old-me would go get totally trashed.  New-me went on a walk with a friend to get a caramel coffee freeze thing at a local coffee shop.  With whipped cream!  It was awesome.  ..**Struggle:** This test has a 47% pass rate.  I'm a bit freaked out and I've been stressing and studying for too long.  It's hard not to check to see if they posted results every 15 minutes.  I was smoking a lot during study time and I've switched back to vaping again.  I have a hard time not turning to old habits when I'm stressed.  I am not going to drink no matter what though...**General:** The whole state smells like blackberries right now and I should be out there picking them.
