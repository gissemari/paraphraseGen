But went to the river today met some random people and ended up joining them had 3 drinks. Felt pretty buzzed probably drunk I never know the difference between the two because I usually don't stop...I did stop tonight luckily. After 2 weeks sober am I going to have to go through all the hell again the anxiety the depression from this relapse?

Probably not that bad. Might get a little shaky or sweaty. I doubt you're going to have anything near a full relapse. I'm not a doctor though.
Hopefully it isn't that bad..Anyway what is important is that you are back here and being honest - not at least to yourself - about what happened. Respect for that!.Maybe take a look back and see if you can point out what triggered this to happen so you can avoid a repetition..There's a lesson to be learned every time we stumple!.IWNDWYT
