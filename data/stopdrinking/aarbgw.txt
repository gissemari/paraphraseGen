First time posting so sorry if I break the rules please let me know if I should fix anything...I went to lunch with an old friend...After we ate I walked past a new sports bar on my way home. It looked so cozy in there they looked to have a bunch of good beers etc...So I walked in. I have been sober two weeks but I still walked in. I almost ordered a beer but then I realized it's a cash only bar and I didn't have cash...That was enough to get me out of the addict mentality. I was like what are you doing dude get out NOW this is your lucky break. So I walked out took a cab to my uncles place and then took an Uber back home a few hours later (both are  safe spaces  for me - my uncle and my wife know im struggling and are very supportive)...It's scary to think I almost messed up. It's scary how close I got to not staying sober. But a combination of tremendous luck and me deciding to just walk out (something I wouldn't have done ever basically)... means I'm still sober today...As I'm sitting here watching tv after making some pizzas with my wife and my nieces I can honestly say I haven't been this happy in a long time...I feel SO GOOD because I know I can fall asleep without any stress without any anger towards myself or self hate or shame. I tell my wife everything so I don't have to have the chat with her that I slipped...TLDR: tough moment good day. WOOHOO!

You're killing it bud. Keep it up!
Had a similar moment on Christmas day. The liquor stores were closed. The craving went away and I was able to enjoy dinner...Kind of felt like a slip even though it wasn't you know?
I'm late to read this post I'm very happy for you that it worked out.  Right on.  IWNDWYT
