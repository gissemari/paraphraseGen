Day two at the festival. Didn't drink yesterday wasn't really even tempted. Seeing people shambling around aimlessly this morning reinforced my resolve as did the fact that I had a pretty good time yesterday too - who knew that dancing while non-intoxicated could be even more fun? :D..But. I managed to lose my meds somewhere last night. They have a long-half life (diazepam) and I take a low dosage for GAD have been on them for 3 years. At first I was terrified but so far no wd symptoms. I doubt there will be any major ones either. Still there will probably be some tomorrow which will feel 10x worse if I relapse today...Some things I've noticed about this experience so far:..Conversations with drunk people are extremely annoying. I've probably been much worse when drunk though...Conversations with stoners are sometimes almost as annoying but usually ok...The volume levels are way too high. Earplugs are a lifesaver...I'm not 25 anymore and this will probably be the last time I go camping to a festival EVER. ..Most of the electronic music I used to like doesn't appeal to me at all anymore...If I was drunk I wouldn't have realized any of this.

At some festivals there are actually sober communities and sober camping options. If you are still interested in going to some look into the the wharf rats. I've camped in sober camping before. They even hold meetings during the festival and everything !
Great progress !!  Keep it up !
