It's that day again. Guess what day it is? [Happy Hump Day everybody!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LtjzQaFZ3k) What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life see how our SD family is doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general musings with us below!..-----------------------------------------..**Struggle:** I'm about to have another birthday.    As I get older I find that I just can't do things that I used to do when I was younger like dashing up an Adirondack Mountain. Recently I actually found myself shuffling along in my slippers in exactly the same way that my elderly grandmother did...**Triumph:** I'm about to have another birthday!   As I get older I find myself really enjoying life in a way that I simply didn't when I was younger. Recently I was talking with one of my best friends while we were walking down the street and we were both laughing so hard that a man passing by us said with amusement  Are you two okay? ..**General:**  Do not regret growing old. It's a privilege denied to many. .
----------immediate responses--------

I'm headed to a BBQ in the evening. Long time friends and some of the most hard core party people I know. Haven't been around any of this crew since my sobriety. I'm anxious to see how they respond. .I Will Not Drink With Them Today 
Struggle: I have a super difficult email to write to a family member. It's going to be long and hard to write but it's Stuff I Need to Get Off My Chest. I honestly don't even care about the response/reaction. ..Triumph: I've been under my daily calorie goal every day since Day 1. My resting HR has dropped from 92 on Day 1 (the day of my last hangover) to 77 today. I'm putting YEARS on my heart/life and this seems like real solid evidence that quitting is the best thing I've done for my health since giving up smoking. ..General: I'm stressing about baseball standings haha. 
I like your closing sentence ... 
Happy birthday!  ...Struggle: I'm feeling a LOT of shame today. Facing it is really difficult and the coming week just feels impossible to tackle...Triumph: I joined a book club and a gym this week...General: I'm trying to practice gratitude for the things that I do have. I'm taking a mini vacation to get out of my dark depressing apartment. I'm crossing my fingers for a better tomorrow   ..IWNDWYT 
I ended my streak tonight 21 days is by far the longest I've gone without alcohol. I feel kind of guilty for drinking but also refreshed that I was able to moderate. I plan on making sobriety the norm however. 
Happy Birthday u/sfgirlmary!!!!!!..**Struggle:**     Mom fell last night. She's OK but it's getting harder for me to physically pick her up and put her in the wheelchair...Meanwhile...lying/sneaking/stealing sister that stole Mom's estate just went out and bought a new SUV...with more of Mom's money.....**Triumph:**     Finally had my appointment with the orthopedist yesterday for the pain in my knee. Great news: it's either a torn/pulled hamstring or meniscus (I know it's not "great" but it's better than surgery!)...**General:**     Remember that Marconi Union song ["Weightless"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYnA9wWFHLI) that I posted about in AoK regarding it's ability to significantly reduce anxiety? *It's been putting me into a deep peaceful sleep every. single. night.!!!*
**S:**  Left car door and trunk open while unloading stuff from the car.  Cue torrential downpour!  I had standing water in my car. ..**T:**  I spent the last two and a half hours trying to dry out my car.  It's not totally dry but it's drier and I used a whole roll of paper towel and a bunch of bathroom and kitchen towels.  Not exactly how I wanted to spend my birthday evening but it could've been worse...**G:**  Happy B-day!  Went out for my birthday and my daughter and Dad bought me a birthday cake and candles.  Our waitress was a cute girl that I graduated nursing school with.  I was super embarrassed and felt like a big dork when I had to ask her for a lighter to light the candles.  At least I wasn't drunk I'd have probably acted like an idiot and hit on her and been so faded that I didn't have the capacity to be embarrassed until reminded of my behavior a few days later.   
IWNDWYT 
Happy birthday Mary! I love your take on this; there are two (or more) sides to everything...**Struggle:** I asked my son's mother if he could come in the joint celebration of his and and his little sister's birthdays (13 and 5 two days apart) even if it's not his weekend with me. She says no I ask again politely offering to pick him up and drop him off as usual she explodes and soon after my kid texts me asking me to please not mention his birthday to her again...**Triumph:** I've begun an 8 week program to deal with anxiety. I've also decided to pursue the dream of building a creative business. Today I'll take the first steps to seek/apply for start up help - if the anxiety doesn't get to me first lol!..**General:** They just cut the power to the house for the whole day doing some work on the power lines. It's cold quiet and coffee-less. Off to the library caf !
Struggle: Cleaning cat vomit out of carpet. Long fibred tufted absorbent carpet...Triumph: Not pouring a drink afterwards... ..General: I rediscovered baking this week?? Like of all the hobbies I gave up on during the past decade reading sewing writing a diary writing novels short stories and poems writing letters to my political representatives painting drawing walking and biking cleaning the house for a change. Baking is what I got back. Who'd have thunk it. 
Struggle: I dont know if it's the not drinking or what but yesterday and today I've had massive headaches despite hydration and no added stress...Triumph: after a few days of feeling genuinely blah about everything I found the motivation to clean my bathroom take a bath in the newly cleaned bathroom put lotion on brush/floss/mouthwash and moisturize my face. For some this sounds like nothing. For me this has been a night of seriously caring for myself...General: I just feel good.. other than the headaches. Happy to be around which is a new feeling for me.
Struggle: My husband is working out of town and it's just me and our 2 year-old daughter again. Second time this week. She's deep in a screaming phase and taking her out in public has been challenging. I adore her but motherhood drains my emotional stamina faster than anything lately. In for another long day and I'm stressing. ..Triumph: 4 days since my last drink. ..General: Pouring poison down my throat to get through the night is madness. Examining why I have this compulsion is extremely fucking key to my survival. IWNDWYT..
**Struggle**: I'm on vacation. It's hot! There's cocktails everywhere! I want to sit by the pool and drink damnit! Everywhere else is enjoying drinks! The fridge is full of beer and wine and vodka! And I have a UTI so I feel miserable and I would like nothing more than to get a bottle of nice ros  (dear GOD it's so CHEAP HERE) and drink it all and pass out. ..**Triumph**: I haven't had a drink! The antibiotics have been my  excuse  but tbh even after the first day of turning drinks down I haven't been offered much. I've been playing the tape forward enjoying other alternative soft drinks (iced tea is so good here) and it's been fine so far. ..**General**: interesting to be on holiday with another family and observe drinking habits. They've been here about four days and I think they've probably had maybe 2-4 drinks each MAX and that's it. Yesterday my partner's parents shared a bottle of sparkling wine then he had a beer. My parents would have had 2 bottles each. Then maybe some more. And if my sisters were here? We'd be buying wine by the case - yesterday we went shopping and they only had to pick up one. There's still beers and wine in the fridge from the first time they went shopping. It's actually astounding comparing things like this. My boyfriend hasn't been drinking because I haven't been (which is amazing) and it's so easy for him. Probably growing up in a different environment.  ..
**Struggle** Feeling the post weekend guilt where everything got a little bit too out of hand. Learning that no I can't moderate and if I'm going to be a better person I have to stop completely. ..**Triumph** Leading to the decision that I can't keep carrying on like that...**General** I've just started cross stitching which should keep my hands busy in the evenings. I'm working on a sunflower. 
Struggle: I find myself worrying about slipping back into my old mindset that alowed me to drink without care for anything when I had that mindset I craved alcohol and felt I was missing out on something and I never want to feel that way again or go back to that lifestyle...Triumph: These past 10 days have been incredible i've gotten so much done. I've exercised everyday prepared all my own meals everyday haven't used tobacco products which went hand in hand with alcohol and I really haven't had cravings like I have in previous attempts at sobriety I feel solid and confident my outlook on things is a lot different this time around. ..General: Life is a beautiful thing without booze.
Thanks mary! .Struggle: Trying to catch up on stuff neglected for so long in this heat is exhausting I too am getting older....Triumph: Little by little my lawn &amp; garden are taking shape (approx. 4 acres total). .General: Love this post. I am thinking that slowing down w/age might be a good thing. It allows me to observe &amp; acknowledge the wonderful things around me. No alcohol certainly helps! Yesterday while mowing I actually noticed several different types of flowers growing that I had no idea were there.  Peace
Struggle: I reconnected with a friend I haven't seen in two years. We used to be incredibly close but then at some point we just...stopped talking. I figured she didn't want to talk to me but never understood why and didn't press it. This week we met up and I told her I'm getting sober. Turns out...she stopped talking to me because of my drinking. It hard conversation and afterward I was so emotional and heartbroken that I fucked up a friendship over this shit. Lots of decompression time - but no drinking! I faced a lot of emotions head on and while it was hard it felt good to actually process everything and not numb myself with a drink. .Triumph: I opened up to several friends and family this weekend about my addiction. Everyone has been SUPER supportive. Some surprised...others not so much and all very happy to hear I'm getting help and getting healthy. With every person I told it literally felt like a weight was being lifted from my psyche. .General: I'm making new friends! And not drunk friends that say omg I looove you let's get together....and then we never do. I've got weekend plans early in the morning for the first time in forever! Crazy what you can do when you're not hungover from Friday night :) ..IWNDWYT!  
Struggle: I'm back at work after a few weeks signed for for mental health reasons. Been back two days and yesterday I felt positive today not so much. Feel anxious and uptight. The sort of day I would have happily drowned in a glass of wine or two later on. No longer though!..Triumph: I've just rounded four weeks without a drop of booze. Going forward will be stepping into territory not seen for me in five years...General: I feel a little lost in the world today. It sounds ridiculously overblown but I really feel like I need a purpose. I'm hoping sobriety can give me the headspace and energy to find it.
Struggle: I am feeling conflicted professionally. I have a job that's great on paper and decent in real life but my bosses aren't coming through with the promises they made me months ago. I need to be the squeaky wheel and I hate that. ..Triumph:  I'm far into interviewing with 2 other positions so I have options. And not drinking 3 of the last 6 nights has really helped me focus on what I need to do to really capitalize on the opportunities. ..General: My goal of being a moderate social drinker sets me apart from many here but I am glad to have found the community. It feels really supportive and I certainly appreciate hearing everyone's stories. 
Struggle: The other day was my 13 year wedding anniversary so of course my husband and I had a huge blowout the day prior. It was caused by our mutual frustration with dealing with his ex. We've been dealing with it for the past 20 some years and I'm sure we'll be dealing with it for 20 more. I've yet to find a way of not allowing her chaos to leak over into our lives. Given the situation that we're raising the grandkids with her I'm kind of just stuck with dealing with it. ..Triumph: I'm still sober and that's something. It feels like I'm losing control over everything right now; being at the mercy of SO's sometimes crazy ex my job is up in the air still due to company restructuring my health has been on the decline and I still haven't gotten a diagnosis as to what's causing it. I've grown a new appreciation of being sober. Not just that things could be far worse if I was drinking which they surely would be but it's something I can rely on for me and by me (if that makes any sense at all haha). ..General: Happy birthday SFG! I hope you have a fantastic day and perhaps some ice cream to celebrate!
struggle: I am waiting to hear back from a doc about the results from my ultrasound- I have a suspicious lump in my groin...&amp;#x200B;..triumph: STILL not drinking! I made it a whole summer...&amp;#x200B;..general: today is very busy and looking forward to the weekend! IWNDWYT
Good morning u/sfgirlmary! Happy Birthday! I'm having a birthday next week. Good quote about growing old. So true. ..**Struggle** Work as always. I have to do a huge accounting project like ALL day today but hopefully I can get it done and get past the fear of it. I've told everyone my door will be closed and I will not be taking calls or answering emails today. Wish me luck. ..**Triumph** I haven't been running as much as I was in spring and early summer for various reasons but I'm doing other workouts as I am now also a member of my local YMCA and they have some terrific classes. I'm a member because starting Sept 13 I'm teaching step there every Thursday night! Getting recertified to teach group fitness and getting going teaching step again has been a huge benefit of sobriety for me. Where I lived on the west coast no fitness managers wanted step on the schedule anymore as it was seen as out of fashion. Here in the upper midwest it is alive and well. Tonight is my usual night to teach it at my other gym. Doing some new choreography for the Fall starting tonight. Fun Fun!..**General** My loan officer says we are all set to close on our new house next week. Lots of good things happening to old Belinda. :)
Struggle: Finding the energy and motivation to workout and grocery shop ..Triumph: I decided to start Sober September early and I've started a list of what I want to accomplish...General: I'm working towards a career shift and getting out of the bar industry. I'm beyond excited and so ready to take back my life. 
**Struggle: Not sure if struggle but life as is. I had divorce papers drawn up and awaiting submission to my wife hesitating due to her terminal cancer. 26 years thick and thin blah blah blah. She actually served me first which is good. More so I have realized that I am an over-giver a fixer. This is not a healthy thing as long term it becomes exhaustive and essentially empty. Reading about being an over-giver and fixer I had a holy shit moment (u/ZippyTheWindUpClown you figured this out and didn't tell me. I'm sorry). Need to fix and heal from that. Add care giving and no emotional or physical needs and it leads to well this...**Triumph: I have been on a mission to get out and enjoy people every night. As an introvert that is both a struggle and great success. Been surrounded by new and different people every night which has been very rewarding. There are interesting people with great values and ideas. Many thanks to the folks sharing the tubing adventures camp fires concerts hiking clubs Sunday services and other special activities with me. Holy crap I have new friends!!..**General: Getting old? I'm turning 50 in September. Feels good. .
Struggle: I have been rather short with many people in my life recently. And I feel guilty for how I make people feel when I know I can speak in a kinder way to everyone. I just have felt incredibly angry recently. ..Triumph: It's my day 1. I feel inspired and I know I have the support of my boyfriend and my roommates. I have quit before and managed to get several months sober in the past. However the delusion that I can be a casual drinker always broke my steaks. But I know better now and I'm excited for my journey. ..General: I'm excited to be here. 
S: Both my kids have strep throat and are home from school again. ..T: I am not hungover and exhausted. If I was I would likely be in a downward spiral crying and hating my life and my children. But instead I am feeling positive and energetic and taking today in stride. ..G: The way the sun looks this morning. The sound of the cicadas on this summer day but also the little bit of crisp air that signals that Fall is almost here. 
Today will be day 9 because iwndwyt. Been working out and I'm so sore that a trek for a beverage would be like climbing Everest anyways.
Happy birthday. :)
S: I wish I had more free time. All I want to do is play Sonic Mania or AC Origins but I have no free time for that...T: I'm back in school and although I'm only a week and a half back into it I think I'm going to do really well. I seem genuinly driven to succeed in my clases. Hell I'm ahead in my spanish class. Usually I'm behind...G: I'm coming to terms with the fact that I just really don't like dogs. I like some dogs but I judge the dog more by their owner than the dog itself. 
Struggle:  All my friends have kids or just had kids.  The wife and I can't have kids and adoptions not huge in my book.  So now we're getting shrunk out of circles because they all go out and have play dates and dinners together with them and their kids.   It sucks and I could bet my wife would love to hang out with a baby and do fun stuff that she won't really get the chance to do.  ..Triumph:  Started a dialogue with the wife about the intimacy issues we've been having. Not much came out of it but I think she at least understands how bothered I am by everything. ..General:  I'm beginning to realize that I'll never be happy with my lot in life.  Is this why people take antidepressants?  I should probably be on some. 
Struggle: I've had bad headaches for the past 2 days. Waking up for work this morning was hard. Getting out of my cozy warm bed was harder...Triumph: I got out of bed and made it to work. My internship that I don't enjoy is over this week. I had pumpkin spice yogurt for breakfast...General:  Love is an action 
Love your post &amp; quote!!..**Struggle:** I need to move out. I love Boo dearly but I have zero freedom here and it is slowly but surely killing me. She is 83 and I take care of her but my mother is capable(ish) to do it without taking advantage I believe. We are kinda coddling each other at this point. She isn't exactly pushing me to move forward with my life and I am doing A LOT for her around the house soooo she isn't "working out" anymore.... (she is over weight and has many health issues her working out is walking laps around the kitchen lifting her arms/legs a few times and taking care of her self. IE getting up and making her own coffee/lunch etc. I am not saying she needs to vacuum her house or stand an hour to make dinner or anything like that) She is older and is pretty negative and I am kinda sensitive to the energy around me soooooo that's not good either...**Triumph:** I feel like I am finally strong enough to accomplish this or at least to get the ball rolling for real. I came here fresh from rehab fresh from jail in the midst of divorce from my abusive MP ex husband and my life was shredded into something I couldn't even acknowledge much less recognize. I have had the same job a year I have career goals/school aspirations decent support system IRL you guys and I just think that the time is approaching. Living in Orlando cost of living is ridic which has been discouraging me (unless I work all 4 jobs all the time I wasn't going to be able to afford it and if I could I would NEVER be there cause I would be working for the damn place I couldn't ever be in lol). Anyway he is moving out and asked if I would like to be his roommate whenever I am ready &amp; I think we could manage alright. We shall see but this is the first positive hopeful light I have seen in this particular tunnel...**General:** "Comfort is the enemy of progress" P.T. Barnum &amp; "All progress takes place outside the comfort zone" Micheal John Bodak  - saw a quote something [like those](https://steemkr.com/motivation/@datibomchic/comfort-the-enemy-of-progress) two a week or too ago &amp; it really struck/stuck with me...[High Five](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/7f/f2/dc7ff20e1af55e41e62b1c6c089cada3.jpg).
Happy Birthday Mary!!  Laughing that hard is so amazing...**Struggle:** I'm not feeling great today and haven't really all week.  I think too much work caught up to me and I picked up a bug...**Triumph:** I decided to just call in sick and try and get better.  There's no point in killing myself working.  I have a hard time taking a break these days since I want to excel at my job but I gotta slow down sometimes...**General:** I cleaned the hell out of my bedroom over the weekend and it looks so much better so at least I can be sick in bed in a room that is comfortable.
Happy belly button birthday!  ..Struggle: getting back into the swing of things post vacation. I have an interview for a position that will be a change for me. I'm struggling with with worrying about what others will think and say as I put in my two weeks at the toxic job I've been desperate to leave. ..Triumph: I've got a second interview for an amazing job opportunity!! Here's to giving up my control to my HP and hoping this is the right path. ..General: trying to allow myself to relax even though I always feel like I must be go go go after a vacation. A nap will be required and I won't take no for an answer!!
Well it's only my fourth day of sobriety but this is actually my struggle. It's a huge milestone for me because I haven't made it past three days sober in over two years. ..Triumph: I've started the day off waking up happy! I took an early morning walk and started laundry things I never did before used to make my poor bf do all the housework because I was either drunk or hungover. So I understand an earlier posters comment on the shame from hour behaviors during this addiction. ..General: I guess I'm just happy today and grateful to be alive and that somehow I was blessed enough to not run away all the people who loved me through my addiction.  IWNDWYT 
Struggle - On a short holiday. Second day here haven't spoken to anyone today. Going to go and sit in a restaurant and not drink.  Haven't done this before ever.  Feeling anxious. Keep repeating my intention; I am not drinking today. I find this especially hard in Ireland where the Guinness my great weakness is especially tempting. ..Triumph - I've taken a few days away to escape work stress and try and do things I enjoy. I meditated for an hour. I went for a jog on the beach. I read 200 pages of a great book. I worked on a short story I've been having trouble with and had a great afternoon pushing through the hard bits and not procrastinating. I might even finish it before I return...General - I'm sick of using alcohol to deal with stress and loneliness. Every Friday night I give myself over to it abdicating responsibility even though I'm disciplined in other areas of my life. These few days away are my first attempt to break the back of binge drinking. I want to get up tomorrow and enjoy the next day of my holiday without a fuzzy head and full of self-hate. Moderation has not worked. Bigger obstacles lie ahead (the first friday night after work) but I have to build willpower first. 
**Triumph:** My relationship is going well as is my diet!..**Struggle:** Work has been incredibly frustrating lately. It's a combination of not feeling appreciated/not feeling stimulated/challenged enough. I'm looking for a new primary job but it'll take time. ..**General:** I need to start sleeping more maybe turning off electronics by 11 or 11:30 to ensure I sleep.
Struggle: working on my day off..Triumph: more hours..General: I can't remember what being hungover feels like and so the siren song of booze is kinda getting to me
Struggle: My sugar intake is through the roof. Not losing any weight. Generally making bad food choices and still not feeling motivated to exercise. ..Triumph: The not drinking is going great. Feeling really positive about it. And whilst I do seriously need to get my food under control I still see my face looks slimmer / better and most importantly I am being a better mum to my kids. So this is a massive life-changing thing.  ..General:  new term at kids school next week and eve if the summer holiday. feels like a new dawn 
Struggle:  Day 2... I got stressed and **FUCK**I want to drink. ..Triumph: I left the house without my purse that is normally reserved for smuggling booze back in. ..General: Weird shit... I hired a random landscaper.  I went out to introduce myself and he asked me where my car was. ..Me: I donated it a month ago?.Do I know you?..Him: We crossed paths on rt 1 (mile from my house) and you waived at me. Unfortunately we never officially met.It's nice to finally meet me you have no idea...I awkwardly back up then go into the house... he kept working I put money in the mailbox and texted him to grab it whenever he was done...It gets weirder... .He texted and said  keep the money order the kids pizza to bad Mary's is out of business.' It has been for over a decade. He also said he's not a landscaper he's a realtor.     .    .   Nice guy or do you think he wants to wear my skin?...
**Triumph:** I'm struggling to come up with something specific. Things are pretty good and nothing stands out. That itself is a pretty big triumph...**Struggle:** I've got a huge project for work that is slowly getting further and further past-due. It's not all my fault--I've got outside collaborators that aren't exactly sprinting--but it's easy to focus on the delays I *am* responsible for...Happy birthday u/sfgirlmary !
Struggle: Work is stressing me the hell out. I need to get out of this field! Unrelated- I need to practice opening up to people when I'm emotionally struggling &amp; ask for help. Stupid stupid pride...Triumph: I am starting to put more effort into my wardrobe &amp; appearance and that makes me feel good. ..General: Rediscovered The XX Radio on Pandora that I used to listen to all the time studying &amp; it is so peaceful. 
Struggle:..Had to spend some time with my ex-wife today.  Not a huge fan especially because after everything she put me through she still sometimes mentions getting neck together...At this moment it's a struggle not to stop and have a drink on the way home.  I know better...Triumph:..The struggle above has a good result.  She told the local high school that her son (my stepson) will be living with me full time...She's moving away for good reasons and wants him to finish school with his friends.  And with me.  Looking forward to the next couple of years being a full time dad...General:..The two things I mentioned when examined together increase my resolve *not* to drink...Struggles often result in triumphs and this is one that I've been working towards for a few years.
Struggle: Need to call an old friend to find some better employment. I was on a much better path last time we talked and its going to be hard admitting how far I've fallen. I know he'll be accepting as he's a bit of a problem drinker himself but admitting defeat is not normally in my nature. I don't want to bring up sobriety as I know he struggles himself and don't want to inadvertently put him down with my new found success...Triumph: Coming up on double digits for the first time in at least 4 years...General: Happy to be here and happy to be alive. Happy birthday SFG!
Happy birthday Mary!  Slipper shuffling or no you are proof that wisdom *can* accompany aging (not always the case in my experience!).  As per usual I benefit from your learned experiences and appreciate your continuous presence on this sub (in other words I'm really glad you were born!)...**Struggle:**  Been having a few desires to use booze to relax as I watch my GF sip on a bottle of cold cider on a hot afternoon.  I play the tape forward and crack open a sparkling water and that takes care of things.  Just wishing I was free of even that little annoyance...**Triumph:**  In pondering my concerns about my relationship I asked my higher self for help during a recent trail run.  Got an answer towards the end of the run to do something I haven't done yet - lean into my discomfort and be even more loving instead of getting distant and too analytical.  I've been trying this out and "acting my way into better thinking" like I learned here.  Seems to be helping!..**General:**  My aunt is dying and I got a beautiful and poignant postcard from her that left me grateful to have had her in my life and sad as hell.  So yeah not regretting growing old at the moment just wishing those I love could stay here longer with me..
Struggle: This craving sugar and sweet stuff is killing me. I took much of the sugar out of my diet a few years ago so I feel  that the sugar I've been eating now is making me feel sluggish at times. I know my shorts are getting tighter as well-:( not happy about that!..Triumph: Investing in a rowing machine to workout instead of eating something unhealthy...General:  Working towards finding the old me-Hopefully  to reappear in the near future...Happy Birthday and grateful that you take the time to post What's up Wednesday-Thank you! :)
Struggle: Early recovery and finding out who I am...Triumph: I get to find out who a really am! As a husband and a new father I'm quite excited and have daily reminders in front of me that make it easier to cope. 
Struggle- My debit card recently expired and the bank sent my new one to the wrong address. Currently waiting the 10 business days to get the new one so I can pay my bill. Not the worstttt struggle in the world I would consider it a moderate annoyance... ...Triumph- I've been continuing to record my progress in my  positive daily habits  book. This is an incredible triumph for me because I've never continued journalling after 3 days in the past. I only write down the positive habits I had in that day if I sleep in or miss Yoga I don't write it down. It really has helped me stay attentive and responsible for my self care. I feel good man. ..I've been going to yoga almost every day this week which is huge for me. There's good and meh classes but I'm proud of myself for waking up early and going regardless. ...General- I'm leaving my seasonal gig and going back to college very soon. It's kind of a big transition but I'm anticipating it either way. I actually love going to college and seeing my friends. ..
Relapsed yesterday. Don't be me. It sucks. ..IWNDWYT
Struggle: Long shitty day at work. Argued with soon-to-be ex wife who I still love very much about stupid shit. ..Triumph: I eventually got off of work...General: It's rough guys 
**Struggle:** I'm sick. I feel like garbage. I'd want to climb under a boulder and wallow but that'd take so much effort...**Triumph:** I went to a meeting anyway. (It's chronic not contagious.) I gave myself permission to just sit there and not talk. I didn't put on a face like everything was fine...**General:** This spicy clams &amp; pork belly ramen is amazing. It's the best thing that's happened to me all day.
**Struggle** This Friday I'll be working with a boss that has admitted he does not like me and cannot say why. I could care less not to be liked but he's really abusive and belittling. At least I've develop the sense of  just grin it and bear it  and learn as much as I can. I just have to work with him 15 more than times over the next year. ..**Triumph** I'm happy to see that my confidence has grown to accept that dbag for what he's worth a dbag and that's it. As adults we all deal with difficult personalities from time to time. ..**General** Since quitting alcohol I've seen how strong my disciple muscle has grown so I've gotten into a bunch of health focused things. I'm now on Keto weight training and working on my mental health by going to counseling. My marriage is blossoming and I couldn't be happier:) ..IWNDWYT 
Great thread! ..Struggle: Newly diagnosed with frequent heart palpations and anxiety at a young age when my family history is otherwise rock solid. Realizing booze isn't helping but still used my b-day as an excuse to throw away a nice four-week sobriety stretch I had. ..Triumph: I am actually doing positive things like seeking help diagnoses talking about it and getting into a better mindset where I set goals and take action. Not mad I slipped up because it made me more determined about my goals. ..General: You all. You all rock very much. 
Struggle: I broke up with my baby's mother for no apparent reason other than that I'm kind of crazy. Too bipolar or unstable to know if I'm making the right decision. Early sobriety seems to be riddled with these kinds of ordeals. Trying to learn how to cope with these decisions rather than just drinking/smoking them away..I have a three day bachelor party in Minnesota for my best friend this weekend and I'm super nervous. Also ashamed because everyone else will be drinking and I'll have to admit I have a problem...Triumph: I'm three days sober and said no to drinking last night.
