I've been looking for a sober online community and I found you guys!! I quite drinking last year for two months but started drinking again at a 40th birthday. I now reflect on this as a relapse. On 12 Feb 2017 I quit again and I'm going strong on 5 weeks. I'm feeling like I want to quit for good this time. ..Just wanted to say hello! A little about me... I'm 39 F 2 kids married. My drinking 'career' started over 20 years ago. I hope to participate in this community so that we can motivate each other to achieve our goals. Well done to all of you that are making your life what you want it to be!...BTW how do you set the days counter near your username? ..:)

Hi and welcome from another mum. How are you feeling after 5 weeks ? 
Hey u/str3litzia! Congrats on 5 weeks sober that's awesome! ..44/f divorced since I was 27 no kids. My drinking career started at 27 (go figure!). I wound up trying to get sober many times after lots of fractured ribs unexplained bruising and concussions hallucinations and many lost items so I detoxed 2 years ago. Wound up drinking again. Went back to detox a second time and it finally stuck. It saved my life but MAINTAINING sobriety is where the work comes in...This community is amazing. SD has been here for me since the minute I got out of detox and it's saved me so many times. The people here genuinely care and want to see you get well. We also have lots of fun (there's a 24/7 chat - link on the sidebar) ice cream parties tea parties etc.). ..Check out the resources in the sidebar and pull up a seat make yourself comfortable. We've got your back :). 
Nice! I'm a mom too and felt that my drinking habits were interfering with everyday life living! It's so nice to be clear headed at night and in the morning when my kids need me the most. ..It's been kind of hard lately as I notice a craving creeping in for a drink at night. I don't know hat happened I felt strong for the first 75 days! I know I'll get through it though. ..Best wishes to you!
