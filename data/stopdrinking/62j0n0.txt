As I sit on my couch listening to music on my 15th day sober I realized that I'm starting to feel happy. I still have A LOT to work out/fix but man guys sobriety is starting to feel great. I have a sponsor now go to AA 4-5 times a week and rekindled an old friendship whom I'm getting into hiking with. Things are starting to look up. I'm not na ve I know there will continue to be some struggles but they'll be sober struggles. ..I've sobered up before but never with the help of AA and I know I'm only 15 long days in but AA helps in ways I could not imagine. This sub is also very inspiring. I couldn't do it without you guys and AA so thank you! I will not drink with all of you today!
