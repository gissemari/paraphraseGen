Having cash on hand was always a trigger because that was how I could Supply my habit without a paper trail. I was even stealing money from a forgotten bag of change that my father-in-law had brought over to our house and the wife had hidden. I found it and over the course of time stole almost $200 but I return that money in an effort to make amends. That was five years ago I continue to relapse even started stealing money from a cash savings that my wife and I started two years ago. I found that in my desperate search and it was hidden in the back of the closet behind everything else and I was supplying myhabit from that...Today I was at the car dealership getting ready to have a tire replaced when I ran into the young man who sold me my car and he knew about the tire and offered me $20 to help out to pay for it he insisted three times and I told him no three times and finally told him the truth that I was an alcoholic and if he gave me that money I would probably go spend it on booze. Today is the first day of the rest of my life and I wish all of you the strength that I was able to find in that brief moment because no one would have been the wiser...I will not drink with you today
