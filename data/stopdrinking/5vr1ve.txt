The longest I've managed sobriety is 8 months - not bad after decades of drinking heavy.  However the following 8 month relapse was a horror show - worse because my drinking went from constant to binging.  It was so hard withdrawing each week only to get back on the bull again for another wild ride...This time around I don't focus so much on the length of my sobriety (although yeah I do peek at my days once in awhile).  Instead I focused on today and setting myself up for tomorrow.  I'm grateful and willing to accept whatever life has to offer...I really don't want to spend another day on earth in a messed up state of my own doing...Happy 24 everyone!
