Started my day at 0430 headed to post for my husband's promotion ceremony which  unfortunately has been postponed. So up for no reason pretty grumpy had this stupid argument:..Me: Is your company the first on the right? ..Jeremy:  No we are the last one. ..He meant from the left.  Such a dumb argument it was the same frigging answer.  Lol..Anyway the cravings got jump started early today so I needed a reminder of why not to drink...[This](https://www.flickr.com/photos/142035160@N04/shares/dUWMyF)..That is me January first after who knows how long binge drinking... 9 months maybe... of waking up and drinking drinking all my meals instead of eating drinking to go to sleep drinking in the middle of the night to go back to sleep waking up feeling like shyt so I drank to feel better  repeat. 9 months... if not more of 2 pints of the strongest rum I could find every day. ..Looking at that photo even though I did have a bit of a relapse this year I have come so far. I never EVER want to go back to that. ..I was miserable I couldn't eat I had no energy I was hhuugggeeeee (kinda reminds me of Harry Potter when the sung blows up and floats away haha) etc etc. ..Yesterday was pretty sh_tty but in comparison to how I felt last year it was a vacation. Today Jeremy and I argued  but compared to last year that was nothing especially nothing to drink over. ..**When squats aren't cutting it nothing seems to get booze off my mind and I start to plot how to get some rum that photo will *always* do the trick.**..Happy Monday & high five sobernauts!

The change in your face is pretty astonishing.  A physical reminder like that would probably benefit me too - as my brain has a way of 'forgetting' that oh I was scared for my life 10 days ago but now everything is fine! High five to you too! 
Wow you look great!  Keep doing what you're doing.

Wow. On the fitness subs that would qualify as "mad face gainz"! You look terrific!
