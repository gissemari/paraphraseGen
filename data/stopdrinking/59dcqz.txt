I posted yesterday about my current struggles and got some fantastic support from fellow redditors. Today wasn't a great day but I didn't drink. ..I'm seeing a psychologist on Monday. I think a lot of my feelings that I'm struggling with have been with me for a very long time and I drank to escape them and now I have to face and deal with them. I've had these feelings of depression emptiness loneliness disconnection for years and years and I've tried to deal with it myself by drinking reading self-help books etc but it just hasn't worked. I'm frightened that if I don't try to address it now I could end drinking in the long term and I know where that will end.

I sympathize with those feelings and I'll bet many many others here do as well. Congrats on taking steps to deal with your issues. They'll be tough to face but rewarding. And the outcome will be infinitely better. I won't drink with you today!
Good job and good luck!
