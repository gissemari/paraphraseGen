Day 1 day 3 one week one month sober and so on. 13 years drinking two rehabs ($20000 + down the drain) AA counseling emergency room visits for alcohol poisoning. My longest sober is over 90 days and with more than a dozen relapses I'm sick of it! I'm sick of thinking and feeling positive that "this is the end of it"! Too many comebacks and everyone is frankly sick of my rising and falling again. To many Rocky Balboa moments going out for an early morning "Gonna Fly Now" "Eye of the Tiger" run!! Getting in top shape and health only to end up drinking it all away! Taking everything day to day now and I just don't feel like any congrats is in order until I can beat 90 days and blast through a triple digit 100 days sober. I won't drink today tomorrow or maybe even next week but so what?! I've played this recovery record too many damn times to start shitting any pink clouds or pissing rainbows at the moment. Day two and not counting until I can prove to myself that I really fucking want this!!! Maybe just maybe with all my relapses I can finally get this one right by actually learning where I had failed before. Ok end rant!

For what it's worth I think it's awesome that you are here and trying this again. It's never over. 
Then get to 90 days so I can properly congratulate you! 
It is awesome that you are still fighting for your sobriety. I had a friend stop fighting and passaway from drinking. IWNDWYT. Hugs.  
I think the fact that you're trying again is pretty badass. Getting back up after you fall down is a huge deal. Keep fighting warrior. 
...but you *came back* - that speaks volumes my friend...We're right here beside you. Hang in there!
Progress not Perfection.
I feel you. Keep trying don't ever stop. ..Hope you'll accept this song as praise for now: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zS0chgBD8Rs
