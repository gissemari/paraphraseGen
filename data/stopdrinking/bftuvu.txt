Feeling pretty hopeless at this point. A year ago I had a steady high paying job a brand new camaro and my own house. Fast forward a year and I am penniless and moved back into my parents house. I've managed to put together 2 weeks sober but today my anxiety got the best of me. Idk what's wrong with me. Idk if its cravings anxiety panic disorer..or maybe I'm just another hopeless alcoholic? All I know is that there is a pattern between my sobriety and relapses. The one thing that keeps making me relapse is anxiety. I get to about 2 weeks sober and anxiety comes flooding in. I tried this time..I really did. But it got so bad that I couldnt even handle an Easter dinner with my parents without having a panic attack and I caved into alcohol (my medicine) once again. I've put together significant sober time before but relapsed do to careless thinking and peer pressure but this time I've dug myself into a hole that I'm not 100% sure I can get out of. I know alcohol withdrawal is serious. But this feels different..Even after 2 weeks sober I still didnt feel normal I was in panic mode 24/7 for 2 weeks straight and finally caved again. All I can do at this point is pray and hope for a miracle. This disease is very real and very serious and I hope this post discourages anyone with sober time from relapsing. Sorry for the rant..any advice/kind words are appreciated..
