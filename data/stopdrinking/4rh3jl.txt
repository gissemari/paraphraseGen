[It's. that. day. again. Guess what day it is!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi9eTOqqTMs)..You guessed it. Happy hump day! What's up Wednesdays are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations with us below!..**Triumph:** I'm sober and happy to be able to celebrate my friend's passing by continuing to help others when I can. I'm trying to stay positive this week when all I want to do is crawl into bed and not deal with things. ..**Struggle:** I lost a friend last week to heroin addiction and I'm still sort of down about it. I try to remember the good things we did together in recovery. I don't think I'll be 100% at work this week but I'll hopefully get through. I haven't been sleeping well. ..**General:** I got nothin this week. Free-for-All! 
----------immediate responses--------

Happy hump day!..**Triumph** Passing the 6 months sober point for the first time since I was 15. Sober feels like the new normal now...**Struggle** Sugar. In the grand scheme of things I probably don't have much refined sugar usually a couple of biscuits a day. I'd like to quit them though. My SO just laughs at me when I ask for a biscuit barrel that isn't made of glass. I know that if I don't see them winking at me everytime I walk in the kitchen I'll find it much easier to pass on them...**General** We've booked our family holiday. I'm taking my kids to see where I grew up. It'll be the first sober holiday for me in nearly 30 years. Lots of outdoor activities planned I hope the rain holds off...
Triumph: I am at 85 days of no drinking; the longest I've gone since I was 18 (28 now). My biggest triumph for the week happened last Hump Day; my daughter's mother was stressed about her $$ situation and decided that the place to dump all that stress on me was at our daughter's gymnastics time--not in private not over the phone or text. Since I was mentally and physically present it came naturally to listen to her vent explain myself when she went into accusatory-bitch-mode and when she couldn't handle an actual conversation and decided to end it with "fine we will just go to court then" I was able to keep my mood stable respond with a "lol alright whatever you want" (side note; court would have gotten her nowhere and I know this--thanks not drinking--cuz nothing about my financial situation has changed since the last set child-support arrangement) and continue on with my evening. The next day she texts me apologizing and explaining she's just super stressed. I was able thanks to clear thinking since the first convo to accept her apology explain that we should talk in private about that kind of stuff and arrange some increased $$ help for her cuz I get where she's coming from; ending the convo on a civil/pleasant note. Before...I would have blacked out immediately after convo 1. Spent all night being furious/sad/depressed/raging. Repeated the next day. I sure as shit wouldn't be the one getting APOLOGIZED TO!..Struggle: r/SD (paraphrasing here) has introduced me to the notion that 'quitting drinking doesn't fix your problems; it just allows you to confront them with clear perspective'. I know I have a ton of work to do: on myself on my apt. on getting a new job etc. It's been a struggle to start major work in these areas while balancing the regular stress/day-to-day obligations. But I'm back in the gym I've got the next two days off and optimistic that I can get rolling on some of this stuff!!..General: Thanks r/SD. Some days are great; some suck. But through all these past 85 days I haven't drank and I'm infinitely better off for it. It may sound small but I have a clear perspective on my life and situation. This wouldn't be the case (and wasn't) if I was still drinking. This sub has been pivotal in helping me get here. I need to get a therapist (so much work ugh where to start and am low income) but everyone sharing here has been so helpful and I can't thank everyone enough.
Triumph: starting my 2nd full day of sobriety...and I will make it through today! ..Struggle: fighting the thought that I'm doomed to drink...General: Things are good. Trying to bank the positive thoughts for the inevitable tough times ahead.  
Triumph: 5 days sober for the first time in a while. It's really nice coming to the sub and seeing the smiling face next to my name on the sidebar :)..Struggle: I am so tired. I don't know what it is I get my 8 hours but lately I've just been tired all day. It's really affecting my work performance and I hope I can snap out of it. Coffee doesn't seem to help...General: I've got no plans this weekend and I'm actually pretty excited about it. I like to play video games every once in a while and maybe I can sit down and enjoy some.
Good morning!.Triumph: One Week!..Struggle: I'm impatient. I read through SD and see all of these people who have made huge strides have a big number of sober days behind them and I want what they've got.....I want to not think about booze every second I want to work things out with my wife I want to magically be in better shape etc. etc. etc. I know it's all going to take work and patience but that's my struggle today..General: I've got the day off tomorrow and I have no plans. I'm thinking a trip to the beach is in order...
Morning!!  ..**TRIUMPH** ..Fourth of July weekend was a raging success. Not drinking feels utterly normal. Especially in situations like that when I see people getting HAMMERED. I'm amazed and embarrassed to see how stupid they sound and to know that was me any given weekend. Ugh.   ..**STRUGGLE** ..Vacations coming up! A whole week down at the jersey shore with my boyfriend's family. I'm really looking forward to it.. I've *never* taken a vacation and it's never been paid. Oh I've taken time off (food industry people here will understand the fundamental difference) but never anything as long as a week. A whole week!!! However. Itll be a booze soaked week I'm sure. I don't worry overmuch about that they've largely given up asking or including me in their booze calculations (how much wine do we need well there's 7 of us so that's ....etc etc) but my boyfriend's step mom is .... Stressful. She's that cliche Bronx Italian you see on like. Real Housewives or something. I know it'll be a week of hanging out with her while my boyfriend his brother and dad go fishing surfing riding etc and listening to her gossip all day. She can also be  cruel in a thoughtless sort of way and her and her husband cat at each other constantly. As a people pleaser I'm often caught in the center trying to smooth and defuse their near-fights. I'm bringing my knitting though and plan to just...leave if the fighting gets to be too much. It's my vacation too.   ...**GENERAL**...I finished my silk blouse!!!! I'm [pretty happy with it](http://imgur.com/K9CSxRd). It's my first lace project and my first like. Small yarn project. I'm a cabled sweater girl usually. Next on my list (seriously I cannot wait to just sit at the beach under any umbrella and knit all day) is the gorgeous cabled bed spread with a monogram in the center. It's gonna be a Christmas present for my mom:) 
**Triumph:** I finally started training again! I hadn't been to the dojo in over a month...**Struggle:** My girlfriend and I broke up. I feel betrayed angry lonely unloveable...**General:** For the past couple weeks I've been slowly making my way through the infamous "Throwaway Time!" Askreddit thread writing TL;DR summaries for every single top level comment in a .txt file. I don't know how or why this started but now I have to finish. Some people make jigsaw puzzles I index peoples dirty secrets.
Triumph: I had a good week being there for my teenage kids. Simply be sober and emotionally available did wonders. ..Struggle: Anger/depression/anxiety have entered the room. Telling myself lies that this whole endevour is selfish I dont have a problem and am being a wuss. My SO decided it was time to ramp her poor me up and I am resentful...General: I guess par for the course knew this week would be like this. Thankful for the support team. Bought a giant 5-1/2" showhead that makes a rain shower for the kids. Found it makes showering a joy.
Triumph: beginning of day 2 of no drinking. ..Struggle: currently trying to get out of bed and not let shame/guilt regret and other negative emotions bring me down too much. My body is hurting after the gnarly sweats and shakes yesterday. Very exhausted today. ..General: looking forward to camping in a few weeks. Nature is the most healing to me during times like this. 
Holy it's Wednesday already!..**Triumph:** Nothing in the fridge went 'bad' aka thrown-away worthy. Plus I made lunches for my girlfriend and I which is a solid reason why I actually eat lunches. ..**Struggle:** The power went out for five hours last night due to the storm and it was humid as fuck outside (and inside). It reminded me of when I lived in Ghana. ..**General Chat:** I so close. 
Triumph: I'm sober! I haven't had any physical withdrawals..Struggles: Falling ASLEEP sober feels so weird and seems to take forever. Unisom is helping a lot..General: "playing the tape forward" and remembering I won't wake up wishing I had that drink have been great for me...I've never tried to stop drinking before and I think my friends think I've jumped the gun on deciding I had a problem but there's a lot of addiction in my family and I don't need more than a few nights where I feel like I couldn't stop once I started to decide to get off the Ferris Wheel. You guys are great.
Triumph:.  I went to a party on the 4th and didn't drink!  Also went to a swing dancing lesson with my wife which made her so happy...Struggle:.Mood swings.  Happy sad anxious angry.  The back-and-forth is very frustrating and I can tell that it's taking a toll on my wife.  Not sure if it's from not drinking or not.  ..General:  I'm excited to see what not drinking is like.  I keep hearing people say it helps with their anxiety.  I hope that's true.
Triumph: I made it through the long weekend! I had such a bad feeling about it when I left work Friday like I pretty much had myself talked into drinking. But I did what I had to do and now here I am!..Struggle: Right this minute being back at work blah no motivation. But it's only a 3 day week and I'm not hungover so I've got that going...General: I've temporarily replaced my nightly ice cream with fresh strawberries sooo good. 
Anxiety spike today - sat an interview. Now playing the waiting game. Both a triumph for doing it and a struggle - navigating some difficult holes in my CV. Whatever comes it's made me a little bit stronger!..General: great to be home from a very lovely sober vacation. Super grateful for my sobriety.
Triumph - I overcame a lot of negative and hurtful feelings of my own .Struggle - I feel more alone than ever despite my usual loner-ness.General - It's already Wednesday! 
Triumph: A distinct lack of homicide in my life... but more seriously I got a ring that's been in my family for four generations repaired by a professional silversmith who attends my AA group. He wouldn't take any money for it so I plan on giving him a few cabochons when I get my lapidary tools set up again. I actually have some free time today for the first time in weeks after catching up on work...Struggle: Home situation is tense as hell but it seems to be calming down. I admittedly flew off the handle but I can only take so much insulting disrespectful behavior before I explode...General: Waiting on a background check for a job. It's irritating me as I need to know whether or not to expand my writing business to the level it was at before this last bender or hold tight so I don't get overwhelmed if I get the job. No idea if it'll go through or not our court system is kind of screwed up and while my charge is supposed to be dismissed I'm still trying to figure out what's going on with my license since all of my fees were supposed to have been covered by community service. 
Triumph: Was able to beast out last nights hill workout in awful humidity - and wasn't dehydrated from drinking the night before! Running has become enjoyable again. ..Struggle: Work is pulling me in multiple directions this week - all morning I kept thinking "you only have to make it til 4 then there's happy hour". BUT. I'm ignoring that voice as much as I can and plan on doing housework instead. ..General: I started reading again! It's been nice to relax with a book before bed. Currently reading "The Martian" because my friend loaned it to me forever ago and I figured I should read it so I can return it! 
Triumph: Today is day 12 of sobriety! I've been going to meetings and really feeling optimistic about my new clean life. :)..Struggle: I'm finally trying to make sure I deal with all the stuff I had been ignoring. Namely hospital bills. It's not fun and stressful as hell but I know in the end I'll feel more relieved to have gotten it sorted out...General: Today is my first day of therapy. Wish me luck!
Struggling past the 48 hour mark now. Saw a doctor turns out I have crippling anxiety. I'll get through today. 
Triumph: Got (yet another) draft out to my thesis committee...Struggle: I'm tired. ..General: Making big changes to up my serenity game. 
I'm still hanging in there. Three weeks so far.
**Triumph:** six months wooo! feeling a strong motivation to keep moving forward. ..**Struggle:** I'm so far behind at work and my brain keeps panicking that I'm terrible and everyone hates me. BRAIN. STAHP. no one is going to die if Excel spreadsheets are a few days late. it's just so hard to catch that auto-panic before it happens. (deep breath)..**General:** ahhh summer in San Francisco.... that lovely season when we pair cute dresses with wool tights boots sweaters and scarves. wait what?

Sorry for your loss straty. I've lost too many friends (and my uncle specifically to heroin--he celebrated 8 years sober as a recovery counselor with a needle that killed him) that way and I'll certainly never get used to it--I hate it when it happens but I always try to squeeze some good out of any bad occurrence and it looks like you've managed to do exactly that...Me? Triumph: I'm just coming off of 3 good days in a row of some much needed quality R&amp;R...Struggle: I'm a time pauper. I have no time. I notice it more when I get a little time like those 3 nice days of R&amp;R. I also have zero room to complain as it is a choice completely of my own making and I do not "have" to be so involved. But just because I'm not complaining doesn't mean I don't struggle with the issue sometimes...General: Bad is good because bad makes me learn and become stronger. Good is bad because good makes me complacent and sometimes gives me the tendency to become self-congratulatory. 
I'm in my second day of sobriety. .Triumph: I feel good about myself today..Struggle: I worry about my strength in the evenings to come..General: This sub has been a great motivator for me over the last month. Thanks everyone! (I created a new account to post here I usually lurk)
Triumph: All alcoholic bevs are out of house- I have a great outlook and no time to be not clear headed.  ..Struggle: I have to file for divorce.  I just have to do it. I moved out a year ago- and parents offered to pay for lawyer.  But I know It's going to be ugly. 
Triumph: I have five days of sobriety  .Struggle: I left an AA meeting during the break last night because I saw someone I new from a past job and couldn't handle it. Going to a different meeting tonight.  .General: I finished Dry by Auguesten Borroughs and started Blackout by Sarah Hepola. Getting back on my reading grind.  ..Hope every one has a great Wednesday!
**Triumph:** Made it through a 4th of July weekend with absolutely no desire to drink - huzzah!  In fact I was grateful to be sober...**Struggle:** How to fit in everything I want to do with my life?? And how to get organized??..**General:**  I seriously need to get outside more often for days into nature.  It makes such a huge difference in my mental state!
Triumph: Had a nice laid back Independence Day weekend. No fireworks no cookouts but lots of reading...Struggle: I've felt a bit at odds with myself lately. I'm working on staying cognizant of my mood and keeping myself in check. ..General: Might be time to find a new job/position. I like 90% of what I do but work for an asshole. 
Triumph: Officially got hired with a great company that has had me in a holding pattern for 3 weeks and I'm sober today..Struggle: Wife still not talking to me as a result of the bender that convinced me it was time to quit a week ago..General: something feels different and better than 15 years ago when I last tried to quit and failed. I have discovered a sense of gratitude and optimism.
**Triumph** I realized I actually *want* to stop drinking. I have confidence that I'll be able to now that the desire is there...**Struggle** My longest success thus far has been...1 day. Day two is very hard; I just fall back into old habits so easily (it's "just" like 3-5 beers a night...)
This is my first time participating!..Triumph: went to first AA meeting this week feeling really good so far. No withdrawal symptoms or anything and I'm just really proud of myself...Struggle: I'm overall just sort of terrified of failing in the future but I just gotta take it one day at a time. There are also a couple celebrations this weekend that I have to go to. My husband will be there to make sure I don't drink and I really don't think I will but I'm nervous about being sober at a party. I haven't ever done that.
Triumph: This is my first post on SD though I've been a lurker for several years. This is my 2nd day without alcohol and I feel pretty crummy. I've reached out to a couple people in my life to let them know that I have been having problems with drinking and now I am ready to stop...Struggle: I have for some time told myself that I needed to "take a break." Now I'm coming to terms with the idea that maybe I need to just cut it out all together. Day 2 and I'm feeling anxious jittery headachey. I should be feeling great. I just sold a big project I'm flying to Costa Rica tomorrow for work etc. But instead of being excited I'm worried that I'll be irritable throughout the trip (with my client) that I won't be able to enjoy myself without an Imperial (or 6) with dinner...General: Work is great. I'm an MBA student in between first and second year and I'm running a small consulting business. I've sold 35K worth of projects in the last few weeks. I'm almost on top of my finances and I'm excited to form new habits. I feel like I have every opportunity in the world and not drinking will help me take advantage of them.
Hi y'all I'm new...Struggle: still unsure if I should be here but I think that since I am I probably should be. I don't drink everyday but when I do drink I tend to binge and I'm just so sick of it. Feeling bad for myself and trying to fight the thoughts of "you're not an alcoholic you don't drink every day you should keep drinking." Also I've failed multiple times to stop drinking so I'm scared to start up again and fail. I don't know if I will have the support I need...Triumph: Day 2 without alcohol and everyone I have interacted with on this sub has been marvelous. You all inspire me...General: Can't really think of anything. 
T:  I made it through the weekend and Fourth of the July!..S:  The weekend and Fourth of July.  I ended up having to pick my daughter up at a wedding on Friday.  I was planning on only staying for a few minutes but ended up staying for three hours.  It was really rough...G:  I made it through!  No hangovers no blackouts no alcohol!  I couldn't have done it w/out this sub!

Triumph: got my white chip yesterday and got a great sponsor today. Met a lot of great people in AA who are constantly checking up on me. Feels great to have that network. Told my gf in getting help and she was really proud of me...Struggle: just got off a 5 day bender on Tuesday and I'm really feeling the anxiety and depression hard. Ended up having a huge panic attack on Monday night because I smoked pot during a moderate withdrawal that bled over into the past few days and I'm feeling like my brain is broken/ having some memory problems. Sponsor says this gets better with sobriety. Just wanna feel normal/like myself again. ..General: I'm getting there and I'm committed just feeling scared as Fuck that I might have fucked up my brain for good. Going to meetings for the rest of the week with my sponsor.
Triumph: one year of sobriety is almost here! Happy to be living life to the fullest..Struggle: realizing that I will never drink or take intoxicants again.General: I've been practicing daily meditation. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to reign in unwanted trains of thought.
