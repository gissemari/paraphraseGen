I will not drink with you today. Good luck to you too.!
Geeze when you bottom out you don't fuck around!..I often look at homeless drunks and know that I'm about three bottles of vodka away from being there.  I've been within $100 of being homeless but somehow found the wherewithal to pull myself together even though I was shitfaced...Speaks volumes for your character and fortitude that you are here.  ..Congrats on your journey to sobriety let's hope all that shit is behind you (and that all our shit is behind us)...I'm proud to not be drinking with you today!
Solid list brother..Welcome to stopdrinking..You pretty much just shared your 4th step with us..Glad your here and hope to keep seeing you..I will not drink with you today.
We all have our lists and the memories are so painful. It is a privilege for me not to drink with you today and to work on our new lists. It is never too late to start with a new list.
It's good to make lists to identify patterns in behaviour but make sure to also make lists about the things you're proud of/grateful for and lists of goals &amp; rewards for the future! It's easy to get caught up in rumination cycles where you focus on the bad/pain &amp; naturally want to drink that away but it is possible to train yourself to focus more on the good. Making "good lists" helps create brain pathways so it gets easier and easier to think about the good in life and easier and easier to manage the bad/painful times when they arise. It's a slow process for sure but I wish you all the luck in your journey! You've overcome so much here's to a bright future ahead! 
Thank you for sharing this. I'm glad you're here. As other people recommended make a "good" list. ..Good luck.  IWNDWYT.
