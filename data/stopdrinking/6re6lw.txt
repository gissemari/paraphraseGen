Great job! Getting into PJ's drinking soothing tea and hitting the bed always works well for me too :).
Thanks :) I am really liking tea and it seems to be working :)

We have the same quit date! Won't be drinking with you tonight.
I have rediscovered tea in my early yet another attempt at sobriety. It's so good.
