I didn't partake in 4/20 festivities yesterday. I have almost never missed 4/20 but this time I didn't and I still had an awesome time last night (No contact high either purely high on life). I admit I have been struggling a bit in my personal matters but I'm getting through it one day at a time. I really don't think I would be sober from alcohol if I didn't have this sub supporting me. I have never been so serious about not drinking my life but the cool part is that I'm not tripping over it. I just don't drink anymore. While my life is totally different from when I was drinking everything has pretty much stayed the same I still have the same friends and they all know that I don't drink anymore and it hasn't been a problem. I'm very grateful to be sober today thank you all for being here.
