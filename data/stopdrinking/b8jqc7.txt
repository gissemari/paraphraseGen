&amp;#x200B;..There I was being me more or less when I felt a tug. Something was entwined around me a vaguely pleasant feeling. Then I felt a gentle pulling also quite pleasurable. I let the thread pull me and felt even better! Then I was enveloped in a pleasurable soft and thrilling little nest-like place and I noticed others around me also enveloped in a sort of cocoon of soft fibers. So nice! They were smiling and laughing and talking and feeling good and so was I!..&amp;#x200B;..Then the threads started tightening and squeezing and it felt not so nice in fact in hurt! so I reached for another soft thread and the unpleasantness abated. But then it in turn started to squeeze. Damn! Ouch! Eventually I fell out of the cocoon and landed with a harsh thump. Ouch! My head hurts (a lot) my stomach hurts (oh no I'm going to puke!) and I'm so tired! My Significant Other wants to know why I was so bitchy to him when I was in my cocoon? Why did I say those ugly words? I feel ashamed and sad...&amp;#x200B;..A while later I felt the soft tendril again. I forgot my previous experience; that was just a fluke anyway. I gave in. AHHHHH! Then the cocoon opened up and slammed me on the floor! Harder this time!..&amp;#x200B;..This happened again and again...&amp;#x200B;..Once day I tired of this cycle and when I felt the tendril of Boozilla touch me and wrap my arm. No! I pulled on the filament to get it OFF me. This hurt! I wanted to give in so badly. So I did and I ended up broken on the floor again...&amp;#x200B;..Eventually I decided to endure the pain of removing the first strands of Boozilla from my being. Ouch! It hurts. A lot!..&amp;#x200B;..Finally it let me go and I was OK! I was able to go a different way that time! Yay me! I'm free! I'm free?..&amp;#x200B;..But it came back! Again I struggled. NO! NO! Not you again...&amp;#x200B;..In time I learned less painful ways to remove the grip of Boozilla from myself. Each time I got better at it. I developed MAD SKILLS! Oh yes I did!..&amp;#x200B;..Eventually Boozilla stopped sending out its spider-web-like strands...&amp;#x200B;..I was free. For real...&amp;#x200B;..Others enjoying yielding to the sweet pull of Boozilla called to me:  Come be with us! It's so fun! We miss you!  But I said  no thanks! ..&amp;#x200B;..I said NO THANKS!..&amp;#x200B;
