I know the first week is the hardest. I've quit several times and some periods of my sobriety lasted for half a year and more. I always relapsed and kept drinking for months and months after that. This weekend though I came face to face with the horror that alcohol can be. I'm sure many here know what I'm talking about. It's a dark and scary experience. I'd always buy a lot on weekends because my mind would be worried that if I ran out I'd drive drunk to get more which has happened many times too. So my mind would rationalize that it's better to get more and not have to drive drunk than to drive drunk to get more. Well...every single time I'd drink everything I had or until I blacked out. So last Saturday was the same story except this time I was so tired of drinking beer that I decided to get a big bottle of vodka. Big mistake. I knew it before I even bought it but again my mind kept telling me that it's better to have more and save some for the next day than to run out and drive drunk... I drank most of the bottle and blacked out. Woke up vomiting in the middle of the night and hallucinating with an insane headache. I thought I was going to die. Spent all Sunday in bed and in pain contemplating how scary this substance is. It's been responsible for so many deaths and has caused so much suffering in my life...So here I am again at day 3 after being a semi-functional alcoholic since last winter. I'd like to believe that each time I start over I learn something new. That it's not in vain and I'm just doomed to fail again in the future. ..I don't know about others but I find this community deeply spiritual. Not in a religious way but in an inner-journey-though-life kind of way. We're different from most people on this planet. We understand how destructive alcohol is and that the ONLY way to live a fulfilling life (at least for us) is to be completely sober. We know that it's one of the hardest challenges in life but the reward is beyond what any substance or even material possession can provide. It's the joy of feeling alive in your own skin. ..I will not drink tonight and hopefully for the rest of my life. And even if I fail I'll keep trying and trying. .

I'm glad you are here. I won't drink with you either.
