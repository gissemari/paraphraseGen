Oh to wake up feeling up for exercise rather than yucky slightly nauseous and lethargic. I've had periods of sobriety in the past but have had trouble staying on the wagon in recent months. This time I'm reading 'This Naked Mind' made a $500 wager with a sober friend to stay sober from 12/3 to 1/23 (we'll see what happens after that...planning to keep off alcohol but may allow some cannabis into my life after that point...) and hope to make it to a Refuge Recovery meeting this week. All hands are on deck and I'm ready to do this thang! Thank you all for your support for posting your own struggles and successes and making me feel like part of a group. Have a great sober day!
