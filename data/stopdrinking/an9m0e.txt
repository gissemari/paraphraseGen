After being alc. free for almost 2 years I fell off the wagon two summers ago and didn't get back on for a few months. Had my last drink last year during the Super Bowl and have managed to persevere for another year. I guess the point of my post is to give my personal experience as an example for anyone discouraged about relapsing or feeling a lack of resolve. As much as it might suck to break a chain of sober days the important thing is getting back on the sober pony and continuing the drive.
