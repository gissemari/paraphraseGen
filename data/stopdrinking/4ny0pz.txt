Just wanted to reach back out to this sub. I was sober from Jan-April this year then drank again in early May and did so steadily until last night...The four months of sobriety were the longest I'd been sober and were most certainly the most creatively and artistically satisfying period of my adult life...I was very active here in the early days of my sobriety checking in and participating regularly doing the daily committment every morning. My cravings though difficult early on waned down to nothing and I would often have days where I didn't even think about alcohol at all. I'd been seeing a therapist regularly (prior to getting sober) which was useful for exploring and examining life frustrations/difficulties/etc. as opposed to avoiding and fearing them...So what happened? And how to answer the inevitable "what will you do differently this time" question?..I think that over time certain frustrations-- (namely career vs dream present life vs a life imagined feeling I'm wasting my life not pursuing what I love not knowing what I should do with myself...wasting time and potential essentially...) did build up. Despite venting about them here sharing with my partner and therapist not drinking exercising regularly-- those subtle fears and pressures accumulated inside. Despite the creative successes and breakthroughs and the good stuff of life I began to long for a release from them (the subtle fears and pressures) and the release wasn't happening. It got to the point where I didn't care that I would be breaking from the sobriety I'd grown so proud of-- I just wanted a break from life. ..Also I had a change with my job that took away much of the time that I was able to give to personal creative endeavors-- the projects which really had me thriving and which took over in lieu of drinking. My opinion is that this loss contributed massively toward my relapse. ..So I think that prioritizing time I can devote to new habits-- ones that are fulfilling ones that effectively replace drinking-- is what I need to do differently this time. If an inevitable schedule change takes away a window of time I need to respect the great and very real importance of that time and work to rearrange life so that I am able to work it in elsewhere. ..Thanks for any thoughts and perspectives. I'm glad to be back.

"So I think that prioritizing time I can devote to new habits-- ones that are fulfilling ones that effectively replace drinking-- is what I need to do differently."..THIS!  I'm still working on this myself.  I also have frustrations about not doing what I love and wondering when I'll have it all figured out.  Taking small steps TODAY to be the person I want or live the life I idealize seems to help keep me from that frustration.  Meditation recovery work and exercise seem to keep that feeling of purposeless at bay while I take baby steps to find out where I want to go in life.  I can't take away a major coping method without replacing it or I will find a way to justify the first drink. ..Welcome back!
Glad you are back. Four months is the longest I have gotten to as well. I feel fear of relapsing at that time and to me it makes sense since at that point sobriety has lost some of its novelty. ..Good luck and have a great day.
