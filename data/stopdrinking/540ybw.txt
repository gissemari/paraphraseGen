Thanks to SD and determination I've not drank for 10 days. Before that I went 7 and before that 4. I don't intend to relapse again though...My habit had been to binge drink two or three nights a week. I never got to the point of drinking every day or drinking before/during work. It was always when I got home and typically Sundays and Mondays and some Thursdays. This had been going on for about a year - before that I was a social drinker and it wasn't an issue at all. But alcoholism runs in my family and some bad stuff happened in 2015 - and I slowly but surely began sinking into that pit like past family members had. ..I really didn't think that it was having much of an impact on me beyond being hungover sometimes and gaining weight. But now that I've gone 10 days without any it's incredible how different I feel. Work is still a bit boring for me (i'm working on expanding my skills and finding something better) but it doesn't make me angry or upset. I have no problem working and I'm enjoying talking to my colleagues again. What I thought was normal "not being a morning person" blues and crappy feelings is GONE. It's still hard to get out of my comfy bed in the AM but I don't feel like shit anymore which is just fantastic. haha..I love to write and read - and I'm finally feeling creative again. It's been so long since that happened...I'll be facing my toughest challenges in October. I'm going to see a friend in a different state for my birthday. She's a big wine drinker. Then later in the month I'm traveling with my aunt who is a big vodka drinker. I'll tell them I'm not drinking. They know I've been trying to lose weight and be healthier. I just hope it isn't an issue and doesn't make things awkward. I'm almost looking forward to those trips being over with even though they're supposed to be fun and fun and more fun. I feel bad even thinking that way...Well thanks to everyone on here. I couldn't have gotten this far without y'all. I'll not be drinking with you today!

I hope the trips are more fun than you expect. I will not drink with you today! 
I handle all future events the exact same way: I don't drink today and I plan to make the same decision tomorrow.  Then when that anxiety provoking event comes along I have the momentum of my daily regimen in auto-drive.  I keep today's commitment and I'll be just fine when tomorrow comes.
