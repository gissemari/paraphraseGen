Hi I am new to this site. I have battle with alcohol addictions for five years. I've relapsed at least ten times. I went through AA it was good. However the support from this group might be a better fit. Today I am 20 days sober. Any advice or suggestions about this site would be great. Is there and app for this site? Thank you!!! Strop095 :)

Welcome! And congratulations on 20 days sober. I am using the site with in-person meetings. There is lots of information in the sidebar and I really like looking at the "posts in need of attention." Helps keep me engaged. You can request a badge in the sidebar too. 
Welcome /u/Strop095 to /r/stopdrinking --at this [link is the Baby Steps post which describes some simple starter "actions"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that I did to stop drinking and get sober.  I hope something there is helpful to you.
hi there and welcome! I use AlienBlue on my iPhone to access reddit but there are lots of other reddit readers available for both iOS and android..Congrats on 20 days. Glad to have you here
Despise some recent articles this site is not an either/or with AA or other programs...I like going to AA AND using this site AND doing some other things to support my recovery..
Please do not think this site is a replacement for AA. This is not a "program". I do AA and I post here (and read lots).  They complement each other very well...Congrats on your 20 days!
This site is fantastic in that many people use it in different ways. Start reading and you will find how it can work for you. The sidebar has a ton of help and FAQs. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;..My favorite app to view and use the site is "reddit is fun" I use the paid version worth the couple bucks.It is way easier faster and nicer than the web browser IMO.
