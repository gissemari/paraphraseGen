. . . try different meetings...I totally get those who don't want to do AA and am by no means trying to convert you. This is for those of you who want to make AA work or those who (like me) are required to attend while in treatment/for court/whatever. ..I'm in treatment for the second time in my life and a requirement of my program is AA meetings on Friday nights and the weekend. This is my first weekend and I was DREADING going to meetings. I've done the AA route before and had some bad experiences. Big Book thumpers judgmental people cliques. I was so adverse to going that I couldn't bring myself to go to one last night. Thus I had to go to two today to make up for it...The first meeting embodied everything that I hate about AA. I won't go into but I left and cried in my car because I want sobriety SO BAD and if this was "the easier softer way" than I'm screwed. There's no way I will continue to go to meetings once I leave treatment if they're all like that...I dragged my butt to my second meeting later in the evening expecting another awful hour. Instead I was blown away. The second meeting was small a discussion meeting and made up of welcoming positive REAL people (that's my chief complaint about certain AA meetings - I've seen people speak almost exclusively in AA-speak so they seem like sober robots who don't have original thoughts.) These people one after another shared intimately and honestly about struggles both in and out of sobriety. They listened. They shared earnestly. Afterword everyone stayed for another fifteen minutes just to talk more and reach out to one girl who was having a particularly hard time. The level of support and understanding in there was unbelievable. I left feeling better than I have in months. ..On the way home I was thinking how AA is kind of like church (ignore the religious aspect of this metaphor.) There may be a hundred churches in one city all practicing the same religion but each church can offer a very different experience for those who attend. For me it's about trial and error trying out many different meetings until I find the ones that truly make me feel at home.

Good for you I went to a lot of meetings before I feel into my usual suspects. I look forward to meetings. I stay away from those high brow country club meetings and commune with my working class peeps. Good luck.
Very true. I had to search for ones that work for me. I also want to try some S.M.A.R.T. meetings.

I was court ordered into it the first time back in '99 near Akron OH which is where it started. There were a ton of "old timers" who made the meetings hell. Even when I tried to go back in the south a few years ago I was still put off by the religious aspect of it. It wasn't until a couple of months ago that I found an agnostic AA group in my city. I actually enjoy going to meetings now and they are really supportive. I've seen more than once someone return the day after they relapsed. In Akron people didn't come back for weeks or months because they feared being shamed by the "old timers". I think it's important to find a group that works for you or it won't work for you.
&gt;I've seen people speak almost exclusively in AA-speak so they seem like sober robots who don't have original thoughts...That bothers me too. 
My second time around too - and this time I've been shopping AA-meetings like crazy. Right now I only have one night/day off all others are filled with meetings in some rather different groups. Primary Purpose Vision For You Blue Book Taleban and most of all meetings like the one you described as your second that night..And all of them have something to offer - mayhaps not exactly what I specifically want but most of the time exactly what I needed :-)

I like the flip of that too if you like everyone you meet in AA you haven't been to enough meetings....
Yeah but it wasn't the meetings that were the main problem for me it was the ideology. Including the atheist and agnostic work-arounds. ..AA just isn't a fit for some of us...So if you don't like AA by all means try different meetings. But if that doesn't help it may actually be that AA is not the right program for you.
