I have a lot going on this Christmas...Turning 25 leaving the military and losing my job and being alone on Christmas was tough enough but I lost someone in my immediate family on Thursday and it sent me back over the edge. The fact my resident AA meeting cancelled their meeting for the holidays immediately after didn't help. ..Anyone struggling this holiday? We're all gonna make it!.

Yep. Had 3 drinks last night over 6 hours of dinner and family movie night with my ex husband. Happy to report I did not get drunk and feel fine this morning but bummed the anxiety and awkwardness of the situation got to me enough that drinking was once again my crutch. Today is another opportunity to keep moving forward. Merry Christmas to all who celebrate and hope and love to everyone. 
Yes drank all day yesterday :( pissed of everyone last night. They have forgiven me now. I'm not drinking today 
Yes. I had a bloody Mary that my brother handed to me without asking. Sipped that while playing a board game. Then had a beer when we were opening presents. Could have been a lot worse but I'm still bummed about it. Hasn't changed my conviction that I'm happier not drinking. It wasn't worth it.
