I had been sober for over 2 weeks and then relapsed with a 2 day bender. I am not seeing this as a defeat but I am seeing this as a learning lesson. I now understand myself more and I understand the things which trigger my drinking and how to avoid them. Namely thirst hunger and tiredness (unsurprisingly!) or a combination of all three...I know that moderation does not work and I have complete belief that my life is better without alcohol. It has no benefit for me anymore! ..I am even more determined to beat this addiction and I know I can do it. Day 1 is the hardest and that is done and dusted...I will not drink today and I will take each day as it comes!

I think one of the most important things I've learned is that once I started learning from my relapses I started changing mentally and really wanting to change for the better. So congrats on seeing this as a lesson and learning something more about yourself. You got this! IWNDWYT
