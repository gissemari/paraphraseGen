Meant to add that I haven't drank even though it's free and around. 
I'd just go to sleep man. See how you feel tomorrow!
Thank you. I already talked myself out of it with a few memories of what it feels like to wake hungover and toss and turn with beer in me. I went to bed super early last night but my hotel neighbors were up so late walking around. Maybe tonight will be quieter. Thank you!
