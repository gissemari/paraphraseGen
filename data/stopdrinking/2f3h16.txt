It feels great to achieve the star badge after my recent relapse. I'm loving the gift of sobriety! Just wanted to mark the day with a post.

Thirty days is a huge milestone man. Huge ups to you for that. I remember it being around 30 days that the thought started creeping in that "holy shit I could actually do this." Very empowering feeling. ..Congratulations. Hope you do a 90 post in a couple months. 
Congrats on the star!
Way to go! Keep up the awesome work!
Woohoo! Congrats!..Man I can't wait to hit my week month months...ah!
