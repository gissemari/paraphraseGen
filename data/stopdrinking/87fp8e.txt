Whoo hoo i didn't drink I'm not gonna drink i kinda don't wanna drink. Gotta be honest and say kinda cause I'm struggling. Big I'm doing the thing!..It feels different this time i was thinking just now about how many times I've wanted to quit but I've made excuses for up coming events! There was a whole period of time about 2 years ago where i had my whole future mapped out in upcoming events weddings concerts trips... whatever - but like - places where i just haaaave to drink at. I remember feeling like - well how am i supposed to get through the rest of life without drinking at events? Why can't i just drink normal?  Normal ...I love that the naked mind and on the naked mind podcast (sorry for the lack of capitalization typing on my phone) - anyway love that she talks about how the alcohol industry spends BILLIONS in advertising because they know they'll make their money back. And commercials for alcohol - wowwww. I watched a Dos Equis commercial earlier that had me wondering if it would give me magical powers or something. It will not. And how many people per day die from alcohol abuse. FUCK ALCOHOL. FUCK BOOZE BRAIN. ..I have some hesitation still when i think about future events. This little nagging voice that asks me how i will enjoy doing things with people and going places without drinking. Will things still be fun?  I don't even care things won't be broke and hungover for damn sure.  ..And onward to another day of being sober tomorrow!!

I've found I enjoy things more without alcohol.  Alcohol makes me fight to stay awake or obsess on how much I can drink and I miss the thing I was supposed to enjoy.  Congratulations on 3 days! Keep it up!
I love your outlook! I also struggled with wondering what I would do at events if I could not drink but soon found that I enjoyed them more while sober. Concerts and art related events without alcohol allow me to actually become fully immersed in the experience. Grats on moving forward!
