First post. I've been lurking here for a while and I can't adequately express my admiration and respect for this community.  ..I want to quit.  I need to quit.  I'm a 31 year old female and have been drinking heavily on and off for eight years.  I'm functional (for now) which means I'm able to hold down my job and none of my family or friends suspect I have a drinking problem.  I drink mostly alone and I seem to hold it reasonably well when I am around other people. ..Currently I can sustain a few days of sobriety but eventually I cave in and drink and the cycle continues.  I hate myself the way I currently am.  I've had so many day ones I'm beginning to lose hope that I can make this happen long term and it's starting to scare me.  ..I know all the advice - one day at a time play the tape forward etc. but for some reason I can't make it work.  It's so simple yet so difficult at the same time.  ..I could really use some support tonight just to know I'm not the only one struggling. I'm feeling so alone and hopeless. ...

Welcome! I identify with a lot in your post:30s functional in work drank alone.  I tried to stop for over 2 years and never could make it more than 13 days. ..This community made the difference for me. I'm 98 days sober and my life has turned around.  I went from wanting to die to being full of peace hope and life.  This can happen for you too.  Reading and posting here really helped me.  ..I wish you the very best on your journey.  You can do this! A better life is just waiting for you in sobriety.  I will not drink with you today.
You're not alone. My story is very similar. Tonight's been hard for me too but we can both do this. I will not drink with you today.

Hi! I was 31 when I had my last drink too. In the early days using the daily check-in was sometimes the only reason I didn't drink on a given day. Once I was able to string some more days and then weeks together it started to feel much more attainable to really stay stopped. Iwndwyt  
Definitely not alone. I am functional and able to hide it from everyone except myself. It's dangerous as fuck \-\- I know I can get away with it \-\- until I don't. I told some people: my boyfriend and this group of people here and it's already so much better just not being trapped with it in my own brain. You can do this. Stay in touch here stay engaged figure out what replacement activities you can put in place of drinking \(I have taken I think 1000 baths in the past week sorry environment\) and know that it gets a little better all the time. I will not drink with you today.
I too was functional and I think that sometimes makes it harder to quit. I'm sorry you feel alone and hopeless. We would love to have you join the SD gang. 
Hi there ..i'm new here too its day 1 for me and trying to do a month of June as a test then continue further. I am with you tonight in not drinking. Friday/Saturdays are my social nights with weekdays my alone nights which all have alcohol. ..I will not drink with you tonight. 
Your post really spoke to me this is my third try this year... can't count how many others... I also have always held down a job easily do almost all drinking alone but slowly drinking became almost a second job/partner/life I am constantly having to keep up with...You are not alone I am also scared I won't make it another day... I have a wedding tomorrow :( it feels almost unreal I'm going to attempt it sober but I will do my best and not drink with you. We can do it.
I have this same issue that I was good at hiding it all. Sure bottles were found from time to time but it was hard to pin down the volume the habituality of it. That's what makes this struggle 100% for me and supported best by my relationship with this sub...This whole time my first real try and longest stretch since I became legal has just been trying it out really and having this badge that I'd rather not reset. And for what anyway? The high from being drunk was just never all that great in the first place...Every sober day is a personal victory. Ndt. 
You are not alone. All those "rresponsible" drinkers out there?  Half of them are in it up to their necks and don't know it or won't admit it. How do you know the friends who sip a glass of wine with you at dinner aren't going home and killing another bottle at home? You don't have to see the problem for there to be a problem.  Kudos to you for stepping up to this now. Keep posting here  it's a great support.  
Your story sounds so familiar... because it's my story too. Run a business. Drink hate myself rinse and repeat. Want to. Need to. Scared to. I lurked for awhile and was also so inspired by this community I finally took the plunge as they say and committed to making changes. Only a couple days in but I do feel stronger in my resolution thanks to hearing others' stories and learning about their journeys to find ways to help me stay the course. It's awesome. Glad you're here. You can do this.IWNDWYT 
For me the hardest part was the day I stopped and then the first few days staying that way.  It was an epic battle not to go grab a bottle or three.  I hear you it's a tough one!  But it is well worth it.  It's funny from this side of the habit life is just so much better and I knew it would be *i just could not imagine what it would really be like*.  I want to assure you that it's really good.  Even my bad days are much better in comparison.  Keep making these efforts!!! Someone wrote here once:..**if you can chase sobriety as hard as you chased booze you're golden**..Someone else wrote:..**just don't put the booze in your mouth**..Both of those helped me immeasurably to simplify my mission...Best wishes calicoLady!!!.      I will not drink with you today ..
