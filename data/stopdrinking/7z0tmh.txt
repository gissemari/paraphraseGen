So here I am at two years alcohol free and I want to thank all of you who submit to this sub.  Your stories of success and struggle and failure and misery and hope and wisdom have helped keep me "plugged in" to my sobriety.  I never want to return to the prison I lived in for so long.  For those just starting out;  it's so worth it keep fighting!
