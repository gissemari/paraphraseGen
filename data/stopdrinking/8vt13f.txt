Tried a million times to stop. Always reverted back. I was a once a week binger usually cycling between relapse and re-entering recovery zone. My brain fooled me into think I could be like a "normal" drinker but alcohol is incapable of telling the truth. It's a liar a thief and a cheat. I mean is it any surprise that a poison could be anything but corrosive to your body and soul? Anyways I feel good again being sober. I read Harry something's book (doctor at betty ford) and it really resonated with me. I guess going in a circle isnt going to get me the life i thought i was on my way to in my early 20s. No coincidence that this was before i got addicted to beer and could take it or leave it. Those days are ling gone and there's no moderation in me i have proved that time and time again. I have a close friend who is a daily drinker shakes without it. Drank daily for 20 years at least. Met up with him whilst i had a family friend in town who hadnt seen him in years. My friend normally has a ridiculous tolerance but with the heat nips red wine beers.... Well he suddenly leaned over like he wrenched his back or something. His 5 year old daughter said "daddy is going to throw up! And sure enough he threw up his meal and anything else. I left with my family friend who asked if he is normally like this. I said no havent seen him puke in years. He also  added "notice how his daughter knew exactly what was going on?" I missed it the first time myself. Sigh. Can only change myseld but i would rather give myself a chance at happiness and maybe have a family of my own... But i aint getting there unless i stay on course. Alcohol sucks and robs a person of their soul.

You are so right about alcohol being a big thief of quality of life. I'm sorry about your friend; here's hoping he joins you in sobriety. 
I agree.  It robs a person of their soul.  I'm on a salvage mission to bring mine back   iwndwyt
