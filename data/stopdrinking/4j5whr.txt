At 5 weeks sober I am feeling pretty great even though I have a head cold it's still beats drinking or being hungover. I'm from Sydney and currently 3 hrs north in Wine Country staying for the weekend to attend a wedding at the Lindemans Winery tomorrow did I mention that I am staying in a room above a pub. Although I am in the danger zone and always believed in removing myself from dangerous situations with readily available alcohol I don't have any thoughts of or temptations to drink this is a very weird but great feeling. I couldn't have achieved this without AA SMART meetings my psychologist and especially r/stopdrinking and the amazing people succeeding and those people struggling and anyone that is making an effort to get sober I'm a newbie on here been around for under 2 weeks and find it such an awesome community. You guys are awesome! Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but I will not drink today!

Good job on your five weeks and feeling strong. That said - do you have any plans for how to handle temptations? 
Thanks mate I'm actually taking Antabuse so it knocks temptation out as soon as it pops up. If you drink on anatabuse you become violently ill and might end up in hospital.

Hah I went to an inn with a room above a pub for a wedding too. Was very tough to resist the atmosphere and temptation but I kept busy with socializing and had a supportive wife to help me.
