Do you ever feel that concentrating on NOT drinking is a replacement obsession for drinking?..Sometimes it seems as though some people are absolutely obsessed with recovery. While I understand that each struggle is unique and we all need different coping styles to assist us in recovery it seems as though sometimes alcohol is still the main focus of even recovering alcoholics...I'm not discounting a recovery system or AA here just wondering what you all think about it...

I've come across this thought as well. I may not be drinking but I'm on here all the time working the steps trying different AAs constantly aware of triggers excetera.  And honestly I thought about drinking all the time. Where I was going to get my next drink how soon until my husband comes home how much I had that day how much money do I have left in the bank account where can I get more money which stores open at this hour should I get an extra one so I don't have to drive again etc. Anyways I'm assuming it's going to be like my health lifestyle change. I kind of relate sobriety to someone losing weight. In the beginning you're very aware of what you're eating what you're doing what the scale says and how you're feeling. Eventually though it just comes naturally and you don't even think about it because now it's a habit and a routine. ..Just my thoughts.  Happy Monday
I think that what you have mentioned is also just characteristic of addicts generally. Naturally different people experience this to varying extremes and likewise can also aid one's progress. But it is all relative at the end of the day...I've only recently decided to try stop drinking again but I quit opiates a long long time ago and still sometimes think of that/those times...
I really struggle with this. The last time I had some extended sober time I got to a point where I stopped thinking about stopping and realized that I had stopped. There is a big difference in getting sober and being sober different methodologies. Its hard I am getting really good at stopping but I am still not sure how to live sober. Not just get by soberly but actually have the sense that I am alive. 
Stopping drinking has left me with plenty of free time I try balancing it out with a whole mixture of things. I've got years of faulty wiring laid down so even if I don't need it I feel reading and reflecting here is helping lay down healthier thinking. Thinking about recovery sometimes won't land me with regrets debt sweats hangovers and risk of liver disease :)..I tried real life recovery with SMART once a week or so for a while then I ended up skipping it due to other priorities in my life (which is fine because living a balanced life is the end goal in that program anyway).
Here's my experience/thoughts.....  I found that I went through phases as I worked on my stuff...There have been 4 stages in my relationship to alcohol so far. ....Stage 1 - "Stopping" (the early going).  OMG......white-knuckling trying to ride through this craving that craving......man took a LOT of ENERGY!  Needed vigilance.  On edge for potential slips.  Changing all my patterns.  Just getting through the cravings at night and the habits at night so I could go to bed and get up and go to the hospital the next morning.  Days were pretty easy because of work.  But right after work:  "BAM!"  The patterns struck.  So I 'beat to death' that recipe which was "stopping" me having the FIRST drink.  But it was a lot of energy to NOT DO something.  A "negative" energy.  Against something.  A Struggle...Stage 2 -  Building new patterns.  After a few weeks of "not" doing things my focus shifted toward 'increasing the positive tools resources activities and fellowship'.  That was a POSITIVE energy in that I was now *building* something.  The struggle *against* alcohol-patterns was subsiding I was beginning to get positive energy from the *new* activities.  Sort of similar to a new exercise routine - really hard at first but then when some results start coming in you get a little excited about it - looking forward to going to exercise...Stage 3 - Living Sober.  I now was no longer focused on "stopping drinking".  There was no 'struggle' anymore.  The urges the cravings were virtually non-existent.  An anomalous little twinge here and there but fleeting.  Now I'm **getting** energy from my Sobriety as opposed to being drained from the struggle of Stage  1.  The Sober energy is feeding me...Stage 4 - Living and Giving.  I'm living Sober and Giving Service.  Service to others.  Service to people with Alcohol Use Disorder who are struggling.  "Whenever someone reaches out for help I want a hand to be there."  Not only have the urges evaporated I stopped thinking about alcohol at stage 3 but now.....and I never thought this possible......I have an **aversion** to alcohol similar to second hand smoke.  ..Wow!  Just Wow!  If someone told me that early on I'd have said "yeah man but you didn't drink like me.  You're different from me."..But it happened.  The promises do come true...Just for today I forgo ONE drink - The First One
Totally my opinion but I find it very disturbing when I see people become as if not more so zealous about their recovery then their drinking...It's almost like they make recovery a religious experience. ..I remember being shocked when I saw a woman repeated congratulated when she skipped her daughters play to attend an AA meeting. There were literally 8 time slots that day and you bailed on your family???? That is not correct prioritization IMO...I personally find that a lot of these people are still kind of slaves to alcohol......just the lack of now. Still not healthy IMO.
