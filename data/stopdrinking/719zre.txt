I did it through AA. I was on here early in my sobriety but I discovered the social connection in AA is what I needed. I know AA is not for everyone or maybe there are those that are out there that have tried but didn't work/had a bad experience whatever...I still trying to figure out my higher power and I'm probably more spiritual than I admit. I only read the big book once when my sponsor took me through it and I'm not sure I can even recite all the steps in order...But what did keep me in the rooms are the stories. Men and women that had it much worse than me. Homeless. In prison. Close to death. I was a high bottom drunk. But I knew I couldn't drink again...However you can stop drinking just stop drinking for today. It really is one day at a time. If you're lucky enough you might find an AA meeting that you like. Everyone struggles some more than others. It's not so bad and once you get your mind clear you have a chance at a wonderful life...If you don't stop drinking it will end badly. I know that. In AA people will do anything to help you if you need the help. If you truly have the desire to stop drinking please give it a chance...Good luck to everyone
