I am in my late 30s homeowner good career financially secure. But I don't have a lot of friends always struggled with social anxiety and meeting people mainly women. I guess I have just been terrified of both being alone AND also intimacy at the same time. And it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. But beer has been my once or twice a week friend for a while now. I swear off drinking then revert back. It's also the only time i crave cigarettes too. No beer no cigs. I wish i could knock them both out but I know i don't have a healthy relationship with alcohol and the only way ill find inner peace and love is to quit. I am a binger and don't blackout or anything like that and have gone a couple months on a few occasions. This is a powerful addiction and i think i use it as a masking agent for my loneliness and depression but i am sick of feeling like shit and being stuck on the hamster wheel.  It is depressing and also keeping me stuck in a bad cycle. I want to be the guy who beat it and i am sick of being an addict. I just want to hole up somewhere and go into seclusion so i can beat this inner demon somehow.

Thank you for your post!  ..&gt; gone a couple months on a few occasions. This is a powerful addiction..Quitting is easy staying quit...well that's another story. Knowing my triggers helped know when I was most in danger of a relapse. I learned that the triggers did not force me to take action. In fact the best action when I am triggered is to notice that it happened take a deep breath or 2 or 3 and remain calm. No other action is needed and may actually be dangerous or stupid for me. Triggers to watch for are easy to spot on someone else but trickier when doing it for myself.

&gt;I want to hole up somewhere and go into seclusion ..Alcohol wants me isolated.  Alcohol is a jealous lover cruel warden and merciless executioner...There's a body of research that indicates that  connection  is the antidote to addiction.  (You might google  Rat Park  for a summary)...While I wanted to hold up I did the opposite and was for the first time able to break my cycle...I went to meetings.  Got a sober support network.  Started to heal!
