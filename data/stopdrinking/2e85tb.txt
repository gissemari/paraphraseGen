I'm struggling at the moment with AA. I just don't feel that it's very female-oriented. I've read "The Woman's Way Though the 12 Steps" by Stephanie Covington but I moved location and don't know where my copy of that book is and I'm loathe to buy ANOTHER copy to be honest. Does anyone have a free pdf of it? ..Thanks! :)

I love this book. I read it after going through the steps the first time and I feel like it filled in some gaps in my stepwork that the bb &amp; 12/12 didn't cover. I have used it working with sponsees around the 4th step because it specifically addresses shame (as opposed to and separate from guilt) and trauma which I think is something a lot of female alcoholics experience. I'm glad it's being mentioned here
