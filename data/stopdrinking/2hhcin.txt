Hello ya'll .So a little background I guess I am a 21 yearold rugby player who is currently in university in the US specifcally at the University of Missouri Columbia. I recently fell off the wagon after  6 months sober for the past two months which culminated in me drinking two bottles of super cheap red wine in an hour and a half. I'm struggling to figure out where I fit in right now both in life and my team. .Some of you may know drinking and rugby go together like hair metal and cocaine and I also was the team heavyweight like the go to guy for all things drinking involved. My teammates can't seem to understand why I am not drinking anymore I got pancreatitis about 9 months ago and went full sober but then I thought hell what will one do. Now it's to the point where I'm not sure if I can be around booze and people at the same time. I'm trying to figure out where my place is now I know this isn't a rugby space or anything but I was wondering if any of ya'll had any advice for stuff like this.

One I would do what ever it takes to avoid another bout of Pancreatitis. This alone should be a wake up call for you. Sure the Dr.s must have told you that. If you start to drink and over do it you could end up in some serious trouble. 2 jugs of wine in 1.5 hrs??? A fellow in my group was in the hospital for 17 days with it he was told if he drank again... it could kill him. That was his 2nd bout with it. You are young and may be able to rebound but what is the sense in destroying your organs and compromising your LIFE? Best part is you are posting here and you realize you have a choice. My take on it is don't throw this opportunity out the window over a couple bottles of cheap wine. You are worth way more than that. Read all you can here  there are many wonderful folks and this place is overflowing with support and wisdom. Keep an open mind and listen to what your brain/heart is telling you. Best of luck on this journey my friend keep us in the loop!
My thinking is do what you have to do for your health.   Maybe you can be a role model for other rugby players!?.Best Wishes to you!
