----------immediate responses--------

Starting Day 2. Feeling good. I went to the doctor for a physical on Monday and we had a very frank discussion about my alcohol use and dependency. He said he doesn't normally do out-patient detox but he gave me a prescription for Clonidine anyhow. I still slept like shit but the urges seemed less than they have previously. Lets see if I can get another day under my belt....
Same to you. We're doing well.
Hey everybody. Triumph: I'm kicking alcohol's ass it's not kicking mine anymore. Struggle: My 14 year old daughter. She can be pretty difficult. I find myself counting the days until she goes to college! And I dreaded that day with my older two. I think part of it is the stopping drinking and part of it is I'm so damn old! General chat:The facility I work at Tuesday and Wednesday has a small service elevator up to my area. Used to be in the morning if someone got on with me I would wonder if they could smell the vodka/beer/wine on me from the night before. Small little part of my week but I don't have to worry about that anymore!! I raise my cup of coffee to all of you- have a great day. 
triumph: n/a..struggle: i'm so insecure all the time now that i don't get a break from it when I drink. i feel completely unbearable to be around. it hasn't gotten better even though I am trying so hard. i hate myself
Good morning!..**Triumph**: I've been working really hard to fill my time with productive things this week. Lots of time spent writing trying my hand at book reviews (spoiler alert: still not good at them but getting better) and I even started blogging again. It's really nice to feel creative again...**Struggle**: Still looking for a job and really trying not to let the slow progress get me down. I did have an extremely positive interview Monday morning so my fingers and toes are tightly crossed that it works out. Still no regrets about leaving the alcohol industry I just wish this process was a little easier...**General chat**: I'm going to see one of my favourite local artist's holiday show on Friday. My friend's birthday party is happening afterwards at a bar and my other friends' band will be playing. I hummed and hawed over whether or not to go and I've decided to skip it. I'll see her at the show and I know exactly what kind of drunken mess I'd be walking into if I went to the bar portion of the evening. It's not worth the risk and with the kind of sleep schedule I've been keeping lately I will probably be dead on my feet by the end of the holiday show anyway. I feel pretty good about my decision. I'll feel even better about it when I wake up early Saturday morning without a hangover. :)..Have a great day everyone!
Triumph: COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE. I had my first cup of coffee today since I got wiped with the stomach flu on Saturday. Oh sweet sweet mercy. [Trigger warning?]..Struggle: Being physically ill especially with vomiting brings back bad memories. I find it a little traumatizing because I am in recovery from an eating disorder. I'll be doing quite a bit of writing in the next couple days keeping myself in check...General chat: coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffeeeee
Good morning everyone! If you got up before 8 you've got more sobriety than I do today! I hope everyone is feeling happy joyous and free! ..**Triumph:** I've gotten into the habit of calling three alcoholics per day and I'm building a support network IRL. I've been sober for a month for the first time since high school *holy shit*. I've gotten active in my program. I've learned to be quiet and take in info at meetings. I'm so fucking productive! I can plan for my future. My figure has improved and I'm back to regular exercise!!!..**Struggle** My lack of a job is getting me down. I've been (officially) single for a year and even thought I've dated two people exclusively during that period I feel both lonely and smothered. I decided to stay single and celibate until I have a year (intense right?) And I'm stressed about it already. I can't stand the holidays. I hate this time of year...**General Chatter** I'm so glad I'm not a drinker anymore. Life isn't what I want but its good.
Morning!..Triumph: this week I took my dogs to the vet to get caught up on all their shots after putting it off for the last couple months. Also got them groomed and I put up a second Christmas tree in my tiny apartment. I'm having a small get together with my closest friends this coming weekend so I'm scrambling to get my place looking decent. I also finally finished editing and uploading a short wedding video I made for my best friends. They got married two years ago and it took me this long to finish! But I finally am in a motivated enough mood to start ticking items off of my very long very old mental to-do list and it feels great. My perpetual anxiety is decreasing everyday that I accomplish something else. Tonight I go to group treatment and I wrote a recap of an awesome online AA meeting I attended that I can't wait to share with the group. ..Struggle: nothing too bad just stressed that my work schedule this week and the rest of the holidays is kind of weird so it's messing up my routine which makes me feel a little panicky. I want my apartment to be perfect for my get together this weekend. I told my friends to bring whatever they want to drink since my house is dry. I'm not anxious that I'll be tempted to drink I'm just anxious because I don't usually entertain in my home (but I LOVE entertaining and playing hostess) so I want it to be perfect and not lame. I'm worried my crazy work schedule won't allow me to plan everything. ..General chat: how's the weather where you all are? Here in florida people are still rocking shorts and sandals. It kills me. I've live here my whole life but I have a wintery woodsy soul and I long for the cold. I hope things work out so my boyfriend and I can visit his family in Wisconsin or my best friend in Boston before winter ends. Have a wonderful day everyone!

**Triumph**: Just about everything's going well.  Been a weird few weeks but I guess holiday time will be like that.  My routine is off and I haven't been to Krav Maga since Thursday.  But I'm still solid in my sobriety and feeling great...**Struggle**: Went to see my quack of a doctor today.  He again made sure I knew it was important that I don't ever drink again (got it Doc).  He then proceeded to tell me that I needed to lose weight and that I have "rolls" in my stomach area.  My wife laughed at the idea.  But I'll do it and see if it does bring down my cholesterol some (it's a little high)...**General Chat**: It feels weird to be so out of my routine.  I won't make it to KM today either but I'm going to try to go to the gym later and run on the treadmill.

Triumph: feeling good enjoying life...Struggle: not a huge deal but a close friend received a large disappointment and has some (in my opinion) misplaced anger toward me and a mutual friend.  I know it'll blow over and I know I didn't do anything wrong but I don't enjoy the tension...General chat: really enjoying this time of year.  The kids are very excited and their excitement is infectious.
Triumph: I made 30 Days this week! I made 30 days a while ago but relapsed this time I feel more prepared and more hopeful...Struggle: I'm physically ill have been for like 2 weeks unrelated to drugs. I have some kind of unknown physical condition that's unrelated to everything else. It's been testing my patience...General chat: I hadn't even realised how close it was to Christmas. 
Triumph: I've stayed away from drinking for 18 days even though this has been some of the most pressured weeks of the last few years. Feel i'm making some progress with handling life in a more constructive way...Struggle: I found I failed one assignment. I can still pass my course fine with one fail- if my other three assignments are passed and all my teaching is passed. Teaching I know for sure has been and one assignment but I don't know about the others yet. Last teaching tomorrow have to make sure it's 100% best. And then just curl up somewhere and pray the other 2 assignments were ok. I can't afford to fail this course... so yeah struggling with that. Sometimes I feel ok it'll be fine--- the rest of the time my paranoid brain is telling me all sorts of god-awful crap. Keeping reminding myself that drinking will just make it worse...General chat- One way or another in 1.5 days it will all be over and I can go home and distract myself with festive stuff till the results arrive. Ie manic Christmas present hunting. Is it really only 13 days? wtf :P
Triumph: Have picked a majority of myself out of the depressed slump I was in...Struggle: I let my focus at work (independent contractor) go due to said slump and I'll be a little tight on money in January...General: Taught my dog a new trick which makes me happy (She spins in a circle now).
Triumph: Kicked ass at work today worked ahead so I can take the next few days off to do Christmas stuff without massive stress...Struggle: Whee! I have the next few days off so my brain won't shut up about how it's a perfect time to pick up some booze. No one will know! Except I will know. Dammit. .
