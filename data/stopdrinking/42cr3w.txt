So it's been about ten years since I've had my first drink eight years since I started drinking regularly and six years since I started drinking daily...I managed to string together a couple of weeks of sobriety over the summer of 2015 but have been in a full blown relapse since then...I had a wake-up call this past week; after a major binge I actually experienced shaking nausea and more excessive sweating than normal coupled with a lack of appetite. After a couple days of that while still consuming alcohol I returned to my normal drunk self. ..Last night I told myself that I would only have seven beers but ended up drinking everything I had in sight. As a result I missed my chance to do some awesome things this morning. ..So it's the end. I can't drink anymore; I can't keep myself down to any arbitrary number of drinks in a given sitting. I need to abstain. At least for today. I'll see how I feel tomorrow but today I cannot drink.

I talked to a doctor. Withdrawal is no joke...Edit: Fixed to speak from "I." Thanks to /u/finally_woken
Seven is a pretty big "only". I remember when I planned to have "only" a 6-pack or "only" a bottle of wine (to myself of course). It's quite an interesting interpretation of drinking in moderation. I found that the easiest number to keep track of is zero...Today is a good goal. I'm also not drinking today!
You can do it! One day at a time.

.Yeah it's these points of no return that finally kick in when the fuzzy approaches begin to collapse. ."10 8 6" - a fairly standard slow progression that creeps up on you over time. ..Then the trouble is that the quit process has to be really fast comparitively speaking. ..Ps We need more people in the chat room! .https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/stopdrinking/?nick=pick_a_name..Tell 'em Rhino sent ya!
