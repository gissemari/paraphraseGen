On Day Five and it hasn't been too bad but I've been busy and that helps. I wanted to have a glass of something when I got home yesterday but I managed not to. I don't know how really.  However I am feeling a bit overly emotional and can feel some anxiety. I don't cry easily but all I wanted to do and still do is go somewhere and cry. This weekend will be hard but this community has given me more hope for myself and I don't feel so alone in this struggle.  I'm getting to see all of my sons and their girls but it will be a big party and I don't want to drink.  I'll be posting a lot this weekend.

You can do it!  We will be here for you. Distraction don't sit idle. Talk but throw a football or anything to keep yourself a bit busy. It helps for me. What's the saying  idle hands are the devils play things  or something like that.
