To make matters worse my new roommate "drinks socially" and there's a couple beers in the fridge. I refuse to look at them or interact with them when I'm getting food but the thought keeps bouncing around in my head... ..He's out of town for a vacation but when he gets home I think I will ask him to store his alcohol elsewhere so I don't have to deal with it. I hate tests like this because the stakes are too damn high - it's the rest of my life on the line here. I've gotten to where I am (in part) because I have made it a point to write alcohol out of my life. ..In the meantime this new beginning is a chance to present myself as I want to be and *I don't fucking drink*. I'd swing by a meeting for the support but there's like a foot and a half of snow outside... so I'm posting here and will go by a meeting tomorrow.

If you really feel overwhelming temptation would it be out of the question to write down the names of the beers (brand or type or whatever) and toss them and then buy your roommate replacements when he returns? The whole scenario might even serve as a good ice breaker to let him know your situation. 
&gt;but when he gets home I think I will ask him to store his alcohol elsewhere so I don't have to deal with it..Your sobriety is not your roommates concern. It's equally his fridge and he should have the right to store his beer there. My wife is able to leave a bottle of white wine in the fridge for days on end...I choose to ignore it and recognize that this is my thing not hers. I am the one with self control issues not her - she should be able to store the wine she wants at at a temperature she wants. ..Maybe a sober living facility or dry house would be a better situation for you.
