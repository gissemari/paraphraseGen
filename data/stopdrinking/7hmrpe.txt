Hey SD I've been watching the sub for a little bit now so figured I'd chime in and introduce myself. ..Tomorrow will be day 14 completely sober which is the longest I've gone with no booze or anything else in about three years. Before that three year long relapse I had a little over a year which started at the end of 2012 with the most recent of three stints in rehab. ..I got drunk for the first time at age 16. I loved it. I was never a  normal  drinker though. From that first time on I almost always got hammered when I was drinking. In high school it didn't bring my life down too much simply due to lack of consistent access. Even then though I did get behind the wheel and had to leave work shortly after arriving once due to a terrible hangover. ..It really ramped up when I went to college at a big state school. Drank almost every night almost never went to school had a terrible GPA which would've been worse if I hadn't dropped at least one class each semester. I also added regular drug use especially weed and cocaine at this time...I left college after two years and was convinced to go to rehab through a family intervention. I finished my treatment there but I wasn't ready and was back to old habits pretty quickly. I floundered around for about a year and then joined the military...I miraculously got through my enlistment despite multiple major catastrophes caused by my drinking which easily could've resulted in dishonorable discharges. I was spared that by some very compassionate leaders. I did however get forced to go to rehab again and was then dry for about a year until I finished my enlistment. If I were to drink during that year I'd have almost certainly been dishonorably discharged as I was in a mandatory substance abuse program which involved weekly testing so that fear kept me dry...After I got out of the military I once again floundered for a while. The drinks and drugs came right back. I divorced my wife of 4 years. Drinking didn't help our relationship but that certainly wasn't our only issue. I actually regret that relationship starting much more than it ending...Finally I threw in the towel and went to rehab for the third time. This time it was my choice. After completing treatment I moved many states away to a sober house I dove into AA got a sponsor got a job waiting tables and went back to school. I had a great year the first one I'd really call sober as it was entirely my choice and I was doing great. But I got lazy about my sobriety and so I relapsed...As they say it was far worse this time around. Over the course of about a year I racked up two DUI's and so much debt that I had to declare bankruptcy. And even all that wasn't enough on its own to stop me...As my badge indicates tomorrow will be day 14. The bankruptcy and most recent dui were both a couple of years ago now. I did manage to finish my degree and had a couple of good jobs which I lost due to absenteeism (care to guess why I was missing so many days?) ..So now I'm at almost two weeks completely sober for the first time since my sober year. I have a couple of good job prospects so that situation should be resolved soon. Luckily there was no catastrophic event that broke me out of it I just knew enough was enough a couple of weeks ago...It's amazing how much better I feel already. Im sleeping better already and have way more energy and less anxiety. My skin looks better I've lost a little bit of fat already I'm working out and eating better. I get a ton of intrusive thoughts of drinking but luckily I know from experience that they go away...Relapse is a reality but not a requirement. Seeing as I can't change it I'm grateful for mine. I know what I'm going through right now as I've been here before. But this time I know what's waiting for me if I go back. Happy to be here with you all and happy to be sober again! IWNDWYT. ..

Congrats on almost two-weeks!!  We know how hard it is so keep up the good work.  The more times I resisted the urge the less and less power I gave it and the easier it got.  The first few weeks are HARD but once I accepted that alcohol is Never EVER an option for me things started to get better because...One of the most powerful tools I used for the first 7-8 month is [The Daily Check-In](https://redd.it/7hf8so).  Committing each and every morning to not drinking for that day set the tone.  If I felt the lizard speaking to me later in the day I remembered the commitment I made to myself and kept EXTRA Busy and/or went to a meeting.  Good luck and I'm happy you're here!
Thanks for the introduction -- and so good and so valuable for everybody of us to have an experienced scout with so much knowledge of the terrain. Thanks for coming here and sharing that knowledge...&gt; Relapse is a reality but not a requirement..That's a gem. Noting that. Using that...I'm not drinking with you today
