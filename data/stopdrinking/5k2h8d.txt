Sort of slipped back into drinking quite a bit. Realised I needed to stop but thought I would do it in January as that way I wouldn't need to explain myself to anyone. ..But had an argument with my wife last night and realised I was really angry with my family because of stuff that was actually down to me. If I want to get on better with them it's down to me and I need to make the changes today. ..So every day I am going to write down how many drinks I've had (zero) what I have done for them how I have helped others and how my mood has been. ..That way if this anger and blaming others takes me again I should have some warning signs a pattern to look out for. ..I don't feel elated or happy about this. But there's a weight that's been lifted and I know that I need to approach things differently. ..Before I thought I would struggle to stop drinking. Now I am sure I can stop drinking as long as I spot the changes in and deal with my moods before they take over.

I once read a quote along the lines of 'You can only change the world one person at a time. Start with yourself and be the change you want to see'. I guess it's a slightly long-winded way of saying 'treat others as you wish to be treated'...I know that doing something for somebody else helps lift my mood what can you *do* today?..I will not drink with you.
Sounds like you have a plan!
ID love to see a plot of those moods at the beginning. good decision mate we can do this ! ..I for one have broken every new years resolution so this January I resolve to only reset the year on my microwave and stove clocks 
Awesome work. I am a much better family man sober. It is of course still super challenging but I am way better at it...Congrats!
