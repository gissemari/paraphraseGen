For context I'm in my mid 20s. Moved back home a few years ago due to a mental breakdown got clean a few weeks later. Been sober ever since but I struggle with it particularly when I'm alone...I would really like to move back on my own but I have a lot to work on before I feel I will be ready. ..One thing I'm nervous about is relapsing...to be perfectly honest I still have a stash and think about it often...So how did you guys handle it? What things helped you prepare to be independent again? Have you relapsed and if so were you able to get clean again?..Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.

I haven't been in that position so I can't offer any relevant feedback just that it sounds like you are being generally very thoughtful about your situation which bodes well. ..Except for the part about the stash. I know that getting rid of anything related to drinking and drugs has been really helpful to me. I cut up my medical marijuana card. I've basically made it difficult to relapse and removed all reminders that would contribute to ruminating about drinking and/or drugs...I'm coming back from a planned relapse which is basically what you're describing - I acquired a stash and I thought about it until at some point it seemed like a good idea. And once I broke the barrier it was easy to keep going. I *really* wish I had addressed it honestly when I was still at the obsessing &amp; planning stage...Getting real life support via support groups has been really helpful to me in getting out of my relapse. I'm sending you good vibes and I will not drink with you today.
For me I had to pour the booze down the sink. Oh I might have held on a day or two but the same thing that happened every time before would have happened again... I would drink it. .As to your question I don't know either. Depends to some degree of your comfortable being alone.  .Iwndwyt
