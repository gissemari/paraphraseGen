I closed out 2016 without a drink. 125 days. The holiday season offered many temptations and opportunities to drink but I didn't. I've been fortunate that I have not struggled very hard. I'm happy not drinking and don't miss it. My thoughts are with those of you who do struggle and struggle daily. I will not drink with you in that struggle. ..Social anxiety is still an issue but I face it sober and without the regret of doing something drunkingly stupid. I'm learning to breath and be present...Thank you all for your support on this helpful forum. I will not drink this first day of 2017!

I also got through part of the holiday season without drinking (as my badge will tell you I stopped right before Christmas). Here's to a sober 2017!
