So I have been clean with a few slips here and there for almost a year. Recently got a new job that includes travel for a week or two at a time. While my old job was aware of my drinking problem essentially keeping me honest I never told my new colleagues that I was on the wagon. Needless to say I've been traveling the last two weeks drinking almost every night and spending time with a man who isn't my husband. This is not the first time I've been unfaithful to him while I was using. ..I head home tomorrow where I plan to get my head straight and get back to my program but I'm feeling lower than I've ever felt. Not only have I messed up my sobriety I've done an awful thing to a man who loves me. ..Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

I am sorry you are going through this.  But it's great that you came back so quickly.  I've heard quite a few stories in aa about people who fall off the wagon and are years to get back.  
Sorry to hear about your developments...Just one more reminder that alcohol's uninvited companion is misery.
I am sorry you have to feel that way.  Business travel is not a healthy place for sobriety for sure.  I know that's how I always treated trips - nag-free drinking holidays with a free rein to act single.  I have some coming up.  I'm going to try planning nondrinking activities ahead of time.  And I'll be glad to join you in not drinking today.
