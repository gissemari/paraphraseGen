Made it 7 days. Most days I have had a strong urge to drink in the evenings and today is the worst of all because I woke up today feeling like shit and just haven't been able to get over my negative mood. I am so tempted to just go have a few beers at the bar down the street but I know I will just wake up disappointed in myself. Really struggling with the idea of never drinking again.

Excellent! You are off to a great start!! The first 4 weeks are the worst and the cravings can hit you from nowhere but common triggers are situations you've associated with drinking in the past. The cravings don't last for more than an hour at the most and trust me each craving u ride without a drink your mind becomes stronger and anxiety levels dramatically decrease. Good luck!!
Also a short exercise such as a walk or a run or weights will take your mind off the sauce and provide a healthy buzz!
Congrats on your week. That is a huge victory! Don't even worry about the idea of never drinking again. Focus on the idea of not drinking today. Day by day my friend! You GOT this. I am not drinking with you today. 
Thanks for the support everyone! Went to the gym and now it's getting close to bedtime so I think it'll be alright today.
It gets better.  Hang in there.  :)  Just don't have the first drink don't worry about the others.  
You got this! 7 days out of the darkness. Each new day will get brighter and more clear. I won't drink with you today.
