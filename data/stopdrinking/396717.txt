Previously I wrote about my DUIs and my struggles with alcohol.  This thread really helped me and I wanted to give an update and talk about how I have been feeling lately..After my DUI a little over a year ago I stopped drinking and decided I needed to get sober.  That lasted for about 1.5 months and then I started giving myself excuses about why I needed to try and drink how I needed "to learn and control it."  This quickly escalated to drinking more than I was before which was already an insane amount.  I started drinking everyday at lunch again and then when the snowboarding season began I had to have my gondola beers to get ready to snowboard every morning.  I started sneaking off from my friends and people I cared about to pound a beer or two and pretend they didnt notice.  I went to work drunk daily and drank nonstop at work as well.  My boss gave me multiple verbal warning about not drinking on the job but I ignored them all..Things spiraled out of control extremely fast I drank and drove every day somehow not killing myself or someone else.  On February 14th of this year I hit rock bottom and had my very last beer.  I showed up to work blacked out drunk 3 hrs late (I worked at a hotel) I still have no idea how I got to work.  Guests called the police to report how that the front desk worker was wasted yelling at strange things and banging around the property.  The police showed up had me call my manager to come and replace me at work.  They let my best friend come pick me up and take me home which I am forever grateful for..That night I sat up for hrs sobering up and talking with my roommates and talked about my problem and I decided that I never want to touch alcohol again.  .It will be four months sober on the 15th of this month and I am happier than ever.  I am so motivated and driven and have an amazing support network behind me.  I cannot and will not fail.  I recently had someone very close to me tell me they wanted to stop drinking and that I was his inspiration he hit one month sober the other day. This is even more motivation for me and I am proud of the fact that I could have a positive impact on someones life after I caused so much pain with my drinking..The craving for a nice IPA still pops up in certain situations but the want and desire to drink/get drunk is completely gone (if that makes sense).  I know that I cant drink and dont want to.  The feeling is interesting because I consciously can tell when the craving is there but I know it will pass and that its not worth it in the end.  Sorry for the rant I thank you for reading..

Wow!  You're very lucky things didn't get worse for you (unless you're leaving that out of your story).  Did you lose your hotel job?..It's great that you've got four months under your belt and that you're doing well.  And it's absolutely fantastic that you're inspiring your friend which is inspiring you!..Keep that up!
Happy almost 4 months and HAPPY CAKE DAY!  (Reddit Cake Day!)
