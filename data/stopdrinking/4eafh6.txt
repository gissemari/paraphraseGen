Work has been incredibly stressful lately. I handed in my notice to get out of the environment but my boss convinced me to stay on and give it a go. Saturday night one of my co-workers suggested we go out and just have a night to unwind with a few drinks. I reluctantly said yes and had my first few beers in a long time. I didn't get blasted but I did have a few.  Of course I felt like dung yesterday and today I'm still struggling.  I'm going to rest my badge and move on. Coming here everyday at the beginning is what helped me. I then let work take over and stopped being accountable. It sucks cos I was super proud of myself and now I feel like I've failed. That said I completed a lot of days and will complete a lot more...Stress and anxiety is a mother f'r that disappears briefly under alcohol but is back today with a bang...I won't drink today and will move on

Welcome back comrade!.Get right back on that wagon!.
Thanks for posting this reminder. I will not drink with you today.
Hey man...Good to have you back! No one can take away or diminish the days and weeks that you stopped before. And you already know the long term benefits of not drinking. Lessons learned...onward and upward we got this!
