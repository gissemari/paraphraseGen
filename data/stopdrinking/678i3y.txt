Wow. I had never believed I could have gotten to this point. I don't often say this... but damn I'm proud of myself! 720 days I've gone without a drink I'm happier healthier and making connections I never would've dreamt of I'm more social (at times) more in control of my actions and have experienced so much more than i would have if I were still drinking. I have a huge vacation coming up with 500ish saved up for and that'll be far more than i need since I won't be struggling with an 80 bar tab every night. I'm looking forward to so much more than I have in ages. ..Things are looking up SD. Two years sober. And It's just the beginning!

Proud of you. That is amazing.  Have a wonderful vacation- I am counting the money I am saving (its not much my binging habbit for the last few years cost me like 40 bucks/week) and gonna put it towards a new motorcycle.

Great going.  I'm a little over two years myself and it's the best decision I made back in 2015.  I wish you the best and a road forward never having to look back.
