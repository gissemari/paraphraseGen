i have a truly horrific sinus infection with the added bonus of a cough that makes it impossible to sleep. i got nyquil and only thought of the alcohol factor after i took the recommended serving. i am not considering this a relapse. i intended to take it all weekend to sleep this thing off but stopped after i saw the word  alcohol . ..i will point out that the following night my sleep was more disturbed than it has been since i stopped drinking. it could be my mind playing tricks on me could've been the illness but i do believe that tiny amount had a role in it. ..it did however  make me grateful that i don't live in that prison. at least not for today. ..sick-squid signing off. with used tissues and cough-drop-breath: have a great monday!

No worries on your sobriety Squid from my point of view. I just bought DayQuil the last time I was sick. I think they also make alcohol free NyQuil pills...I will not drink with y'all today
Sorry you are sick Squid.  I think that Nyquil has its own side effects.  It's just potent with or without alcohol.  Feel better!
I took NyQuil this past week with a bad sinus infection and it didn't enter my mind that it has alcohol until I read this. I wasn't thinking of getting drunk I just wanted to be able to breathe and sleep. I'm pretty sure as long as you're not doing shots of NyQuil to get drunk you're ok.
