67 days since I put down the bottle for the second time. Jeez...Thing is it's been so much *easier* this time. I've been trying to figure out why...Is life easier right now? No not especially. ..Do I have more support? No in fact I have less since I currently haven't returned to AA...Is it harder for me to get alcohol? Not really. I *HAVE* stopped keeping it in the house so maybe that's a factor but if I wanted I'm 90 seconds from beer at any given time...So I've been musing on what it could be...There's a couple reasons but the one I wanted to talk about was the difference between thinking and knowing. (Segway to the title! Yay literary technique!)..I suspected relapse was possible. It wasn't like the idea never crossed my mind. I read everyone's posts about their relapses their "PLEASE DON'T BE LIKE ME!" posts the saying that "Watch and others will make the mistakes for you."..I understood that I could relapse but I didn't *KNOW* what would happen if I did...I believe the term 'grotesque shitshow' sums it up nicely...But why? Why did I fail when I had all that info and I am not having any of the same thought patterns...Because now I **KNOW** what will happen when I pick up that first drink...I've never been to Egypt. I know about it. I've learned about it from movies textbooks firsthand experiences of others mythology college classes etc. But I've never been there. In a way to my mind Egypt is no more or less real than say the Star Wars universe...I've read about both. I have memorized a decent bit about both. I find both interesting. ..And I think part of my mind doesn't really believe one is more 'real' than the other. Since I've never actually been to either place as far as my own mind is concerned either might not really exist...And I think that's a huge part of what contributed to not just a relapse but one that sent me to roughly drinking DOUBLE what I did before. I didn't *know* that all that I read about relapse would apply to me. Hell it's really hard to let go of those special feelings those "Maybe I am the ONE capable of moderation!" or "Maybe I am not an alcoholic anymore!" ..These are the things I **THOUGHT**...Now I *have* been to Hawaii. I remember the beaches the volcanoes. I remember the little things like the insane prices on some groceries due to importing. The wonderful weather. That stupid jellyfish that attacked me and left me blind in one eye for a few days due to swelling...I **KNOW** Hawaii exists...Now I **KNOW** what will happen if I pick up a bottle. No 'probably'. No 'best guess'. I **KNOW** what chaos comes from relapse...And knowing as *absolute fact* that my life will spiral into pain regret fear bloating unexplainable bruises and all the metric poopton of stuff that comes with it makes looking at that first drink just....(I can't even think of a word I just literally sigh)..There is no moderation for SoberApok. There is no 'someday I can drink again'. There is no regret for that realization because it is what it is. ..I can't do a lot of things. I can't fly. I can't catch fire without being really annoyed really fast. I can't dance (except bad white guy dancing and that's just horrible). I can't drink certain non-alcoholic drinks due to a food dye allergy. I can't go back in time. ..And I can't drink...And I **know** that now...

Great post and fantastic thought process! It took me many relapses to learn that lesson...Excellent work my friend.
This is great!! I wish I knew the trick to MAKE myself know or at least remember what I DO know when I'm feeling better and the urge returns. 
Great Post!
Really good post. Thank you :)
Nice post - thanks!
Great analysis.  Thanks.
Great post - thank you! 
I can totally relate to this. You almost have to quit twice to put it away for good. Im on attempt 2 and stronger than ever KNOWING that i literally can't drink any more. Thankfully there is much more to life.
Thinking can get me into all sorts of trouble.   Thanks for this.   Relapse posts like these are really necessary for me to read. .The posts that trivialize relapse are dangerous for me.  I start to think. I think well I could just have a few and start over.
Thank you for this...I'm on my second go and you're right. Knowing makes thing so much easier. It drove me crazy the first time thinking I was different. 
Great post! Looking forward to more since you said there were a couple reasons it's easier this time. 
This would make a great Saturday Share!  It took me 6+ years this time to get back but I think you've exactly captured why I believe it's the last time.  Thanks Apok.
Thanks for the post what you have stated is all true. However in the past i have known that I can't drink and that the inevitable chaos will ensue but f**k it I have done it anyway. Even as I'm pouring it down my neck I'm thinking " Shit shit what am I doing ". I guess the obsession to take that drink and the craving for the feeling that alcohol gives as it enters my bloodstream and washes over my brain have been too strong to resist in that moment. Simply the knowledge that I cannot drink and the attached consequences were not a sufficient defence from relapsing in and of itself. Completely irrational...I have been a serial relapser over the years and I have found that  personally I need more than just self knowledge. I also need accountability acceptance of my condition personal growth connection with others life goals and other such things. Self knowledge didn't work for me by itself...Thank you for giving your perspective I enjoyed learning from it. I thought I would share my own experience with you. It has really got me thinking about my own sobriety and what I need to do for  myself going forward...All the best.
My experience is my most valuable asset. This is especially true for someone like me who doesn't believe things until I see it for myself. I probably could have saved my more time and trouble if I trusted others more but I didn't. ..I do now. I didn't experience every bad thing that could happen to me from drinking like a DUI or doing jail but I have completely lost my remaining curiosity skepticism and reservations and the day that came was like winning the lottery!

Really cool post.I will not drink with you today.
Agree that "knowing" is an important key to acceptance and surrender.  I also know that I have a tendency to conveniently forget what I already know to satisfy my addictive urges.  Lets try not to go down that path........again.
There are What 12 inches from head to the heart?..For me it was a very long journey.
I'm really hoping I don't need to relapse to get that feeling of knowing.  I'm glad it became so clear for you though.  I will say that I spent about 10 years trying different forms of moderation and rationalization so I do KNOW that none of that stuff works.  I suspect those experiences have been key in my ongoing commitment.  There's no fooling myself anymore.  I do love reading your musings keep it up!
