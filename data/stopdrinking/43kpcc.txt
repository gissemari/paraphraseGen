Relapsed the past few weeks.  Today I will remain sober!  Wishing each of you a wonderful sober day!

Welcome back!! I know the feels of relapsing. You're no longer alone! I'd grab myself a shiny new badge wipe the dust off and never give up! Do you have a plan in place this go around?
Welcome back.. It's not the fall.. But the rise.. You are not alone in this!
Think I've done better this time around cos I had a bit of a plan.
