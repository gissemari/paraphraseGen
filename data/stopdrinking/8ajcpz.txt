Just had to re-set my badge. ..Last weekend I had friends in from out of town. My friend asked to stay to save some money and I obliged wanting to see him his sister and spend time with them. I naively thought we'd be able to spend time together without getting wasted but despite me telling them about my sobriety and clearly saying that they wouldn't be able to party at my place out of respect to my neighbours things got out of hand...I ended up babysitting both of them while they railed drugs off my living room table at 5am despite me asking them not to. Not to mention being up until 5 or 6 am every night even on nights when I was working and I had asked them to keep the drinking and partying to a minimum. I was stuck between wanting to be a good host/friend and wanting to keep things stable and keep them quiet. It was hell. I was pushed into the 'mom' role and I felt weird and out of place while I was with them...I drank one of the nights just to numb myself to everything that was happening and it was the lesser of the evils as there was plenty of drugs to go around. I hate to say it but while I was able to stick up for myself in some regards the constant pressure to drink drink more do more got to me. "Fuck it" set in and I felt like I had no option but to go along with drinking or else end up hating my friends. I ended up feeling really resentful and disgusted anyway in not just them but myself. ..I couldn't help but feel that one of my friends was even attempting to antagonize me into a fight about my sobriety. The next afternoon after waking up hung over we decided to go for brunch. As I was getting ready he slammed enough tequila to be staggering drunk and was wasted for the entirety of lunch. He was belligerently telling me this while we waited for our food. He seemed to be almost bragging about it. "Oh I just slammed so much tequila hahah I'm so cool" was the jist and I guess he must have clocked the look on my face (disgust) because without me even saying anything he launched into defensiveness and again restated his ongoing mantra of the weekend: "Hey - It's MY vacation." That seemed to be the theme of the entire weekend - me biting my tongue while they sneered...The moment I realized I was entirely done with the situation was in the uber on the way out on Monday night listening to them proudly proclaiming that "no one parties like (insert small town name here) and I just can't handle it like they can" - then watching them slur their words trip over themselves and witness one of them legitimately have a seizure at the bar which being the only sober one there I was the only one who noticed. I saw her slumped over for more than a normal amount of time shook her and asked if she was ok and saw that she was having a seizure and freaked out. She sat up and started crying out of either embarrassment or fear and once she was alright we had to carry her outside while I called an emergency uber back to my place. My friend seemed mostly unconcerned with his sister and continued to drink and laugh when we got back to my place insisting on going to get food being loud etc...I had to get up at 7am to make sure they didn't miss their flight as they were too drunk to be trusted not to miss their alarm. They packed up and stumbled out still drunk mumbling apologies and I then half asleep went around and collected all of the bottles and cups and cleaned and opened all the windows hoping to get the reek of alcohol out of my life once more. I felt so dirty and furious. I felt right back at square one. I felt like I had time travelled back to the place I'd been in two years ago. I felt shook to my core that these people who I used to call my best friends were inconsiderate selfish jerks that I didn't even want to know anymore. I felt so sad and lonely. Then proceeded to have to go to work for 8 hours struggling to get by on 3 hours of sleep...I am still so furious I can barely think about it. I sent a strongly worded text to my friend explaining why he would not be welcome to stay with me again while he was in town for a bender and that I am absolutely disappointed in his behaviour and that I hope he gets a handle on his substance abuse and that I hope his sister's health condition serves as some kind of wake up call to him and he starts to seek some kind of balance in his life. Not surprisingly he told me to go fuck myself and to "have fun on my high horse." He then wrote me a lengthy email detailing to me how "he only wanted to spend time with me and that's why he booked the trip etc." when I know for a fact he had his flights and some concert tickets booked before he asked me to stay...The silver lining is that I am now more focused on my sobriety making healthy choices and finding like minded people to spend time with than ever before. Prior to this weekend I had been sitting on the fence thinking that I could drink casually once I had my own habits under control. I didn't like the idea of exclusion I thought that I could still be around those who 'partied' while I stayed sober. Sadly I now see that the two lifestyles are very different for a reason and are divisive just by the nature of what they are. My old friends CAN'T drink in moderation and aren't interested in doing so or moderating their behaviour in the slightest for ANY reason - even out respect to their host/friend who has to work...TLDR: Had some old friends come and stay with me for a weekend debauchery ensued and now I don't even feel like I can have these people in my life anymore at all due to how disrespectful and antagonistic to my sobriety they are. I feel sad pissed off and ready to take on my sobriety with more commitment this time around...IWNDWYT.
