11 days only and 2 badge resets already . I'm struggling. I'm trying to move on from the past but I am constantly being reminded of it. ..I went to the specialist last Friday my partner was with me. I was completely honest regarding my alcohol issues how long it was going on and quantities etc. It was a 3h assessment. Doctor advised me I should have in no way quit cold turkey due to the risk of me getting severe withdrawals but I was already a few days in so I carried on. Doctor saw I still had the shakes and suggested I tapered but I was already a few days sober so I carried on. Partner was extremely supportive and understanding... ..Until the next day. I had so much thrown back in my face and it hurt. I just took it because apart from already having apologised for getting myself into this situation and getting help properly I don't know what else to do. ..I did own up to it I know I spent money I shouldn't or we didn't go out on a Saturday because I wasn't feeling great. I just wish he didn't constantly remind me of those things out of nowhere because I don't want to go back to that place. ..Sorry for the rant I'm just having a hard time at the moment .

It does sound like a tough spot. You are working to get sober and your partner is reminding you of things you did when you were drinking right? If that doesn't make you want to drink then I don't know what will. The guilt and anxiety one can get from mistakes made when drinking is of the worst kind. But guess what? That's OK. It is fine to feel guilty or ashamed. I know I do for some things. Being able to reflect and accept the past without letting it affect my present is what I am working towards.
