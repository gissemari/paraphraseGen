I love to drink. The feelings of joy and happiness enhances my ability to be outgoing and generally be a joy to be around however I know the moral decay involved will lead to let's say unsavory results. I know I am great at my core but am struggling to harness that without said augments. My question is what devices have you all learned to integrate with great people with a sober approach?

One thing to consider is looking at both sides of the mental ledger.  ..You've described what you like about drinking.  What do you dislike about it?  Is it worth the costs?..I used to think there was something valuable about drinking as well but it was illusory.  The truth is that I drank for the alcohol and any other reason was an excuse.  Any supposed benefit had an cost of far greater magnitude.
