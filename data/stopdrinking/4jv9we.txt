[Guess what day it is....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPxV8eRtxEE)  ..Let's hump it out on this happy day! Hump days are when we calibrate our sobriety check in see how our /sd buds are doing and support each other. Share your struggles triumphs and general chat-type contemplations in the format below...**Triumph:** I am working with another person at my company as a peer mentor. We had our first meeting this week and it was really exciting to work with them on a plan to help them improve their performance. [Have I mentioned I love plans?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwozVKOkzz4) They were really receptive to the feedback I offered and I even learned a few things myself! ..**Struggle:** I'm still having a tough time with my late night snacking. I've made sure to keep a lot of healthy options stocked but I find myself leaning towards the ice cream at 4AM. It's something I'm working on still. ..**General:** What projects do you have in store for this spring?!? I'm slowly making progress on cleaning up a portion of my back yard to make a new patio area. Last week was the giant shrub in the way this week leveling ground and picking out stone to lay. I will hopefully get some pics as I go along! ...More important how are you guys doing? How has this week been for you? Let us know your triumphs and struggles!
----------immediate responses--------

I have a triumph! I had crazy cravings today but luckily I was by the gym. I just sat on the exercise bike and pedaled as hard as I could for 40 minutes. 11 miles! And the cravings subsided. Yeah I went home and ate some ice cream but better than the alternative. Gonna be a tough week/weekend ahead but I already feel more confident! 
I'm moving into a beautiful new condo and it's wonderful to think that I will never be drunk in my new home. I feel very lucky and grateful. 
Triumph: made it through first portion of the work training all still alive  :) now the next part a new challenge. Being on time getting money learning the new things- is all good. Nearly finished organised plans to pay the debts. Not dreading the postman everyday and worry about nasty letters- cause it's being dealt with! Phew it's great. None of this is possible 28 days ago...Struggle: emotions all over the place. Struggling with the social side of work- some alcohol related but mostly to problems alcohol was being used as a crutch for. Struggling to start gradually eating less sweets-- while it was good to distant from cravings they make my insides very sad...Nonsense: 5c here rain pouring from the sky and supposed to go to work wearing "beach theme" clothes.... And so I'm on a train in a full length pink sarong (with huge pineapples on) under my trenchcoat. The schoolboys appear alarmed. Fabulous darling!..I have projects abs things want to do but take it easy for now. Trying to do too many things was my downfall in the past. Day by day when I get debts and work sorted then I will see the rest. Am playing some music again though.. .
Triumph: I am on day 7! 
Triumph: i got under the 210 pound mark this week.  Pretty happy about that  60 pounds gone. ...Struggle: grandmother passed away this week.   I  was very close with her and i don't think it actually has hit me yet that she is gone. Also still questioning my marriage at random times. ..Random:  75 hour work week is starting to catch up to me only 2 weeks left though.   I'll be glad to get back to a normalish shift.
Fought through my mind games as I was driving to an open mic. Did not fall into the idea of "one won't hurt" and got my ginger ale on. Glad to finish out day 10 sober. :)
I'm doing some pre-planning now in order to plan to schedule a planning activity to come up with a response that includes a meta-analysis of a scoping activity that would produce some deliverables focused around categories of *Triumphs Struggles and General*...If that sounds like non-specificity it's because I'm in healthcare and we're trying to understand the impact of moving to ICD-10 a "new and improved" coding scheme!  The government guarantees it will reduce the amount of time providers spend with patients increase the costs of care by about 30% through non-value added administrative burden and irritate everyone!  If you wonder why your provider wheels a little computer into the room when they're supposed to be looking and talking to you now you know what PACA has wrought!..I'm just happy to be here with all you Fine Sobernauts this new day!  ..You know what?  I think I'll just go play golf this morning instead!  ..Yeah!  That's the ticket!   Can get off at 6:50 and watch the sun come up and see the deer and Hawks and the turtles in the lakes!  Watch the squirrels and be the first footsteps on the dew kissed landscape.  That's my Triumph!  To hell with any struggle!..Hey maybe u/jet9RDO can join me!..Peace be with you.  Just for today I don't drink with you.
**Triumph:** I have an interview this morning and made it to TWO NA meetings last night. ..**Struggle:** I have an eating disorder. Once I quit drugs and alcohol I reverted back to my oldest way of coping - starving. So I'm trying my best to make food go into my stomach regularly and in healthy quantities...**General:** I'm making my way through THREE books. I'm learning so much! I also have been brushing up on my knowledge of personal injury law for my interview today. I've been super busy!
Also tackling the evening snacking thing. I am now trying to eat well and limit my snacking to a single yoghurt pot plus unlimited carrot batons and much chamomile tea as I can drink :)..Edit: I don't eat ice cream at 4am because I luckily don't really like ice-cream an am fast asleep too :)
What up Wednesday? I will not partake in libations today  
**Triumph:** OMG - I start my new job today! It's been 10 years since I've been in the workforce so I'm a tad nervous but also excited...**Struggle:** Getting up extra early to exercise before work is a real drag. I hope I get the hang of it 'cause I really want to keep my exercise regimen going.....**General:** Still trying to conquer the wild roses in my backyard. Have the last bit to rip out this week. My backyard has gone from crazy overgrown mess to semi-tamed garden with flowers and potted herbs.
I'm on day 4 and can say that both my struggle and my triumph is not drinking but I can say that at least for today I will not drink. Good to you all on your struggles and congratulations for your triumphs. 
Triumph: This is my eighth day today! I'm starting to move into the "longest I've gone in years" territory...Struggle: Lots and lots of fatigue. I don't work and I'm on my school break. With no structure in my life I'm finding it really hard to get up off the couch.
Triumph:  My husbnd is out of town.  In my drinking days this would be when I went off the rails since I didn't have anyone watching.  However not this time... I've been going to bed by 10PM each night totally sober...Struggle:  The people at my job can take a long walk off a short pier.  Seriously I work with some evil fu*ks...General:  I'm working on a project in the spiritual group that I am in.  Its really very enlightening and uncovering some really interesting things about why I have an addictive personality.
**Triumph:** I'm now down to 85 kgs from 94 kgs on New Year's Day. My knee is getting back to normal so I can cycle short distances again...**Struggle:** Keeping a proper focus at work. I'm here I'm doing (sort of) just with a little less energy than I had a couple of weeks ago. I'm sure it'll come back in a day or two...**General:** Starting to work on a new premium service to offer potential clients. Need to have it ready for September but I'm approaching my busiest period of the year too. 
My triumph is 11 days! I am still amazed!..My struggle this week is handling anxiety while I wait for the decision about a federal job. I'm very hopeful that I'll be offered the job but then my "what if" brain kicks into overdrive. What if they reject me because of that night I spent at the hospital on hold because I was blackout drunk and called 911 while suicidal? What if my credit report is unacceptable? What if I can't get approval on an apartment (the job is in another city)? Or worst of all what if I don't get it? Can I handle that? What if what if what if?..My monkey mind is exhausting and I can't even shut it down with alcohol.
**Triumph**: We went to the cigar bar AND the sushi bar last night and I was DD and didn't drink. And most importantly had a good time...**Struggle**: Can't keep out of the chocolate!  Trying to limit it rather than cut it out completely...**General**: Working on getting the backyard done too putting in flowers and potting up plants and clearing out an overgrown corner.  We have a graduation party and a pool party coming up that we're trying to get it ready for. We get new patio furniture this weekend.
Triumph: it may sound odd but everyday I make it to work and stay sober is a HUGE triumph.  Raised 10000 for the american foundation for suicide prevention (don't get uber pumped I have been at it 10 years).  ..Struggle: Paranoia from the non-memories when I was a black out drinker new found energy is being misplaced and I hyperfocus on depressive things tons of obtrusive thinking.  But I know its all in my head I trust it will settle in time the guilt and shame from the manufacturing of my own misery is a jerk though...General: If everything tomorrow goes wrong should that happen I have had 178 days where nothing went wrong I behaved in ways I support/remember and I think about it every day.
Triumph: Finally getting my house put together. We bought in Feb. but just now having energy enough to focus on painting picture hanging and ect......Struggle: Curbing my insatiable hunger for sweets since quitting alcohol....mainly nightly ice-cream indulgence. I have been kind to myself here in the beginning due to dealing with the withdrawals from alcohol but Ive been trying to start limiting the sweets. Quite a struggle for now. While drinking I never had a sweet tooth which why would I when I was consuming 2 to 3 bottles of wine a night. I will continue to slowly limit though...General: As soon as our monsoons quit(lol)...I plan on landscaping my yard. This project will probably take the majority of the summer but instead of dreading it Im actually excited about it. My head is clear and I have so much more energy. Im also going to try a boot camp starting the 1st of June. Not sure if Im ready for that or not but going to give a try....Also plan on being the best Mimi around to my precious grand babies.
**Triumph** went to Team dinner last night and very happily drank lime spitzers.  Rest of team had multiple cocktails/glasses of wine.  I wasn't tempted!..**Struggle** Still having difficulty sleeping so tired always...**General** Looking forward to getting out on the sail boat!  Not looking forward to sleeping on said boat because the kids are too big to stuff into the vberth now?
Triumph: I'm SO productive recently. I've been working 70 hour weeks and actually enjoying it. ..Struggle: I need to exercise more. I know this and yet I'm still having a hard time actually doing anything about it...General: It's my birthday on Friday and I'm super excited to remember it!! :)
Triumph: Got a star with a little one inside it!
not drinking today.
TRIUMPH:  I am finally getting over my cold...STRUGGLE:  sleep and exercise..GENERAL:  I have to come up with a way to keep those stinking squirrels and racoons out of my garden!!!!
Triumph: Told my mom I'm not drinking anymore and the conversation went better than I thought it would...Struggle: Worrying about things that I don't have control over such as other people's reactions to my sobriety...General: Going home for my younger sister's graduation next week! I'm going to be sober totally present and most likely in tears when I hear her name called. I can't wait!
**Triumph**: I stopped procrastinating and finally completed my urgent tasks. ..**Struggle**: Anxiety and sleep. I'm having a hard time falling asleep. I'm anxious all the time so I'm eating a lot and since I have a new tattoo I can't exercise or be out in the sun. It's almost healed so i'm hoping this will change soon..**General** I'm trying to read more and improve on my Spanish. ..Also last week I stayed home and I was bored out of my mind. I realized how much time I've been wasting and I've been thinking a lot about my long term goals and career and I have noticed how much I've been hindering myself from accomplishing a lot of things. I am my own worst enemy. 
**Triumph:** Still floating on that [pink cloud thingy](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/5e/90/ae5e90e0870082731a9b3c5bbde8d5b4.jpg)...**Struggle:** I'm struggling to hold my calm center. I'm easily perturbed and react to quickly. The great thing is that I'm more a Weeble wobbling instead of Humpty Dumpty. Little things used to send me crashing down...**General:** Patio garden treehouse remodel... trying to keep the project list reasonable.
Triumph:  Picked up the guitar a little last night instead of just going to bed at 8:15.  It was good to play some again...Struggle:  I'm just completely fucking lost these days.  My job seems stagnant and the forecast is for more stagnation.  I'm bitching and sulking so much it has to bore my wife.  I'm not as patient as I should be with the kids.  ..General Nonsense:  We moved into our house in November and have been storing a bunch of shit in the unfinished basement which needs to reorganized and removed.  I am hopeful that at some point this spring I'll be able to muster up a fuck to give about that.
**Triumph** Last night I nearly drank even got to the point where I poured myself a drink. Then I figured out that I needed to stop and poured it down the drain ..**Struggle** I'm having a hard time making myself stick to any sort of schedule. My schizophrenia is acting up and I've had to cancel a few trips to the gym because of it
Triumph: Went to my nephew's college graduation. It was a tiring but good weekend and was easy to stay dry. ..Struggle: I've been invited to a birthday party this coming weekend. I went to it last year and woke up in the grass soaked in my own piss. What I want to do is stop in wish a happy birthday and run for it. And maybe explain why they've not seen me in over 11 months. ..General: Life is going well. 
Called my peice of shit professor just now.  He was out "sick" for 4 god damn weeks.  Then he wants to throw an attitude with me on the phone.  Fuck this guy.  We don't know what our mid-term grades are the discussion forums don't work and we've been teaching ourselves for the past 4 fucking weeks.  This motherfucker.  If he wants to dick me on my grade i'm getting everybody in class to sign a petition and get this fuck fired.
3rd day today and I won't drink
**Triumph**: I bought my first dresser and first lawn mower as an adult. Starting to feel a little more ensconced in my new place. And the sun is finally out!!..**Struggle:** worried about my girlfriend still not having a job and the possible negative outcomes of her moving in with me in July...**General:** Community garden will be commanding my time shortly. As a new homeowner I will also soon be inducted into the weekly mowing ritual.
Triumph- day 14 under my belt ..Struggle- the emotion of fear..General- lots of mountain biking again and feeling lots better!
Triumph: juice fasting. Going strong. One and a half days in. One and a half to go!..Struggle: Not feeling well. Allergies or cold or something took me out today...General: Some things are going great. Some things are going terribly. Just trying to stay in the moment breathe stay in today and do my best.
Triumph: Went to see a very very good play at a local small theatre with my mom even though I felt really anxious and spent and aching all over - and after the play I told her explicitly that I'm truly serious about this that I don't want to drink anymore and told her I was sorry.. For everything. We had a good talk she got emotional I got emotional afterwards too and for the first time in a long long while I felt really relieved probably because I said it out loud that I have a problem and I'm making sobriety my main priority no matter what. Also started seeing some of the "old" (true?) me at work aka making jokes not being so awfully grumpy and moody at least not the whole day....Struggle: Aside from sleep issues and stress I had a gnawing back ache which turned to sore shoulders and at the end of the day a really intense tension headache and I had thoughts about drinking one that I actually contemplated a bit when cycling back from work. I played the tape forward said fuck that in my mind and bought a Sub + some sparkling water and got home and engulfed them. ..General: I need to go to the theatre more often! Tonight was awesome. And now I can actually afford it without counting cents since I've already saved roughly 60  (using the I am sober app) already :)
**Triumph:** I'm down to ~240 lbs from 290 last year! I basically had to trade in half of my wardrobe for smaller threads. My gout is also nearly gone and I'm finally able to run again...**Struggle:** Swinging emotions are still plaguing me. Yesterday I was absurdly happy and today I've spent the entire day in a really dark place obsessing over the future of my marriage. Guilt is a bitch...**General:** It's a terrible and wonderful thing to experience these emotions without turning to a bottle to average all the feelings out to "inebriated."
Triumph: I'm nearly through my second day without. I went to a friends for dinner (they aren't really drinkers and weren't drinking though offered me one). I wouldn't have gone given the circumstances/temptations but we'd planned it some time ago and I hadn't seen them in ages. It was a nice feeling to decline a drink and it was nice to be around them...Struggle: Given the early days I'm just a bit tired although I slept well last night. Looking forward to sleep tonight. I know from experience this usually gets to 'approaching normal' for me after about 4/5 days...General: I've done 'this' thing before I've stalled for one reason or another on past attempts. With each attempt I've felt different and more focused on the goal in some way but I think I get a bit cocky in myself once I physically feel better and get overwhelmed. This time around I'm trying to just think of today. Trying to read around this sub and stay positive.
Triumph: Day 15 without a drop longest I've gone in 6 years. Work is going well getting a bit mundane but school will start back up soon so that should help tremendously. I will actually be able to focus rather than not caring and getting blasted...Struggle: Days off are a bit tough for me buuut come Friday I will be investing in some new exercise equipment and try to start working out regularly. I would just go to the gym but I don't have a license (due to alcohol). I have also found myself eating crazy random things throughout my day often un healthy. Hopefully this will curve with the exercise but all of these things beat having a drink...General: School starts the middle of June ready to get in and knock it out! I love SD and am so thankful for all the support everyone here provides. If I need to vent I know where to go and get great responses. It helps coming from people who have/are going through the same thing. Cheers to another sober day folks! 
just checking in not drinking today
Triumph: got some positive feedback at work had a good workout tonight...Struggle: random urges still hit but I've been successful at delaying/distracting them and replacing with healthy habits and coping tools for the underlying issues. (HALTS has been mentioned and is an acronym that helps me)...General: I've got plenty of spring cleaning to do but also have some redecorating plans as well. Good time to freshen things up around the house.
