Hi I have never posted here but all of you have helped me so much reading about your achievements and struggles has helped me stay on track I'm on day 138. I feel great so great I quit smoking too 30 mins ago. Feel also that focusing on the quitting smoking will help me continue my sobriety. Just wanted to say thanks all. I will not drink today with you all.

Hello and welcome! How have you been able to stay sober?  I'd love to hear your experience.
Hey!  Personally I found the nicotine cravings to be worse than the alcohol ones.  And if quitting smoking is too hard there is always vaping. You will still crave all of the additives in cigarettes for a little bit but can start with a higher nicotine level then taper off 
Hi and thanks for your first post! Congrats on 138 days I'm so glad you're feeling great. Happy to have you here on this journey...staying active here was key for me :).
Hi! I will be happy not to drink with you today!.
Hi Luckystars. I'm glad you showed up.  I like how you've stayed sober. And I hope you show up again! Congratulations on 138 days!
