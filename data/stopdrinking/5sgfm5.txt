Hello..First I am happy to say hello.  I quit for two months and tried the moderation thing last year. Then I started again nothing crazy happened but I started to slip back in the trap...I'm a long distance runner and starting to get sick more and could not run as hard.  I was never a daily drinker but a binge drinking 8-12 beers at least once a week and the most two times...I started to think the drinking would catch up to me later in my life.  I was with my GF and got too drunk.  We did not fight but I passed out in bed. ..I woke up feeling crappy and wrote list of what was important to me..1.My Gf ..2.  Health and fitness..3.  My music..4. Saving money..Drinking would not help me in anyway with those things...I am 29 and will be 30 in 4 months..I looked at my bad habits.  I wanted to give up drinking snus and cut back on my caffeine...Booze is such a trigger for nicotine so it made sense to quit that a month before stopping snus...I quit booze and read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Control Drinking...It took away the guilt and let me see what booze is...is there really anyone who drinks that does't go to far sometimes?  Don't normal drinkers get too drunk sometimes?..It clicked that I would save a lot of money feel better and reach my other goals...It has been two weeks and I have had no urges.  I went to a bar twice and just had one cola.  I legit have no urge to drink.  It is like a light switched in my head.  Not saying it was just the book but right time and the right mental state...I have slept better and felt much more rested on the weekends.  I  am lot more positive.  I can see now how I hated Mondays.  I have been way more productive at work and read a lot more.  (About a book a week) It has been much easier to hit the gym on a saturday if I missed a workout during the week...My Gf rarely drinks and really does not care if I quit and nobody has made a big deal of it.  I just said I'm running a marthon and wanted to get more healthy and not drinking just makes sense...Crazy thing is I called my best friend to tell him about the book and my choice.  He has always been a heavy drinker and has struggled.  He was getting ready to come out of the closet to his parents...I called him and found out the week I quit drinking he crashed his car and got a DUI. Crazy!  No one was hurt thank God.  The positive is he told his parents about the DUI and then said he was gay.  He thought what the hell haha.  I was able to support him and he was going to AA and quit that day!..We both agree that in today's world people get married a lot later in life and it has become normal for late 20's people to party while they are single.  With no kids and no wife it becomes easy.  It just makes sense the more you party the more you drink and start to loose control.   ..I'm happy for my choice.  I am sure I will have good days and bad.  I see now how nothing good will come from drinking and it was never fun in the first place!

Sounds like you are really on the right track and have a great support system (as well as being one for your friend). Congrats on your 2 weeks!
