Doctor couldn't make it to the appointment.  So I will see her next week.  I've been on quite the emotional mental rollercoaster. I had the day off from all.3 jobs because I committed to my PTA that I would help distribute the orders. Out of over 300 students 86 participatt. I though that was low. Turns out it's good compared to.the national stats. Anyway there was a lot to do. Unloading putting together the orders and checking people out. It made me feel good though. To be there to benefit my kids school. Gave me a good boost and since my husbands truck is back at the shop and his public defender from 13 years ago turned his answering machine off and hasn't returned my call since he said he would fix his mistake I needed it. ...Side note: someone approached me today and asked if I was Mr. X's daughter. I said yes I am. They wanted me to pass along a message. A little over a year ago a ladies daughter was struggling with alcoholism. They asked my dad to speak to her since my brothers are both alcoholics. He went and talked with her. The message "she's just over a year sober and we wanted to thank him"

Keep your chin up my friend. Helping others really does help doesn't it? :-) I hope you find that feeling carrying over into today. 
It helps to get out into the bigger world. We can lose perspective when our focus narrows to only our own problems. Good choice.
