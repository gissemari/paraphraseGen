After getting out of inpatient treatment about a month ago I relapsed on Thursday through to Saturday. I feel pretty bad about it but I have taken the steps to tell people that support me and they sill do. I did not drink yesterday and I will not drink today. Looking back at the events that lead up to the relapse I realize that I was isolating again getting complacent with recovery being lazy not doing the required work and trying to do it on my own. From here I plan to use my support network that i have built get out of my own head and start working the steps again. I am off to a 9 am meeting. Thanks for listening.

I did pretty much the exact same thing.  Keep on going we can do this. We need to choose ourselves over the alcohol. 
 really happy to hear you're hitting a meeting.  while treatment was the best decision i have ever made and it changed my life it was only a start into recovery.  it was not a one and done not a cure.  i needed/need continued real life connection with others in recovery.  i like you get this through meetings.  alcoholics anonymous for me.
Good for you friend. That is a great frame to view recovery through. Pick yourself back up be honest and keep on walking this journey. Congratulations!
