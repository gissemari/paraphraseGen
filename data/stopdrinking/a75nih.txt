Two gifts 1 bottle of top shelf tequila and another custom made beer mug with a sixer of some local craft beers.  Of course I acted surprised...grateful even I mean afterall it's the thought that counted.  Felt bad on my way home but not bad enough to par-take in the devils candy. A couple of good re-gifts already set for this year!  IWNDWYT

yup!.REGIFT!
I love that when it's happened! (Despite relapses this will be my third sober Christmas in a row). Free gifts for others! Often pretty nice ones! I'm not one of those people that thinks of alcohol as an evil poison. Just something I cannot handle myself.
One of the girls laughed and said "I knew you loved it..I remembered you loved tequila"! (In my head...sure do and brandy whiskey gin vodka beer wine champagne....followed by blackouts bloating hangovers anxiety regret desperation....)
Depending on what the booze was I am not sure I would have brought myself to regift. ..Alcohol still tempts me but it brought me nothing but trouble.
