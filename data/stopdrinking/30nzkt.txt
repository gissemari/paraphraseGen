I just learned tonight that a good friend who was sober for **28 years** relapsed and attempted suicide. He is in a coma on a ventilator in another city several hours away. Last year he was very helpful to me with good advice during a difficult time and now I can't even go visit him because I have to work all weekend and next week. I mean I'm grateful it's not me in there but shit I wish I could have helped. I didn't even know he was struggling. This is a shitty fucking disease.

Wow....very sorry for your situation!
Cunningbaffling and powerful- there by the grace of God go I
Very sorry for your friend's situation. This is a disease that is always in the other room lifting weights to be stronger and ready if we stumble. I'm so sorry for your friend's struggle and I am sending positive wishes for healing his way. Remember to stay strong through this. Stay sober my friend. ..Edits: because I can't read apparently.  
A reminder that none of us are safe from the thinking that puts another drink in our hands. Sorry to hear about your friend I hope all turns out well.
