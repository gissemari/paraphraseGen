And I'm not talking about after a binge or relapse. When I'm sober I have nightmares at night constantly and then I wake up with the worst anxiety and dread getting up and going to work. Any advice?

I have had lucid dreams my entire life except when I was drinking heavy. It helps to wake up sober but the dreams are back more frequently. I do not have anxiety anymore though in general that feeling has left me. IWNDWYT ..&amp;#x200B;..Hang in there.
