Tl;dr of the last 15 years of my life is party drinking becomes steady drinking becomes increasingly hardcore thanks to mental/physical health and external factors until I finally realize it's a problem that's crept up on me and somehow become massive (like drinking first thing out of bed sneaking it into work literally drinking *while* driving etc kind of massive problem) and decide to quit in large part thanks to this sub. Maybe I'll spill some ~~more~~ dirty details another time...Tl;dr of tonight is my kid being bitten by our dog (new addition to the family after the dog-love of my life passed away just a little over a year ago) and me spending most of the night in the ER watching my son get stitches and struggling with the realization that now I have to lose another dog and this time by choice...I feel very much like I cannot make good choices like everything I touch turns to shit like nothing can ever work out like I ruin everyone and everything around me. I am afraid of losing the dog because he's really my only friend and steady companion. I am afraid of being alone again. I am afraid of living with the guilt of feeling responsible for his death and for my son's injury...Still haven't touched a drop since Monday night/early Tuesday morning but what was feeling like relatively smooth sailing is turning quickly into stormy seas and I'm afraid most of all that I'm going to lose myself to it all again...Funny how life just seems to know when you're down and could use a good kick in the teeth.

Sorry to hear of the situation that must be tough!..Drinking isn't going to solve any of those problems in a useful way they'd still be there tomorrow with a hangover on top which would be no good at all!..Have you thought about trying an AA meeting? I'm not an AA-goer myself (this sub is my 'AA' equivalent) but it might be a good way to find support and friendly faces IRL among folk who understand what you're going through? I know a lot of people on here really find it helps.....It's understandable to worry about the dog I'm a dog owner myself... hope your son will suffer no lasting harm from it these things happen unfortunately.....At least you were sober to deal with it appropriately so that's a positive right?..I won't drink with you today hope you'll stick around here and let us know how it's all going?..Best wishes ..Woody :&gt;)&gt;
I was at an AA meeting once an all-women's group. One woman shared with noticable shame. that it got so bad she was drinking while driving. We all nodded knowingly. She said "no like actually drinking in the car while I was driving". We all confirmed that that's why we were nodding. I think many of us thought it was so secret shameful and borderline too bad to admit and then we realized all dozen of us had done it many times. That was a great meeting....Love to you!!
