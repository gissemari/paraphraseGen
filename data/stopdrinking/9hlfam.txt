I quit drinking a few years back. I made it 8 months. I felt great I was running my skin looked better I lost weight. All that good stuff but I was still miserable. I was still fighting with my boyfriend still annoyed with my step kids un challenged and angry in my job. Struggling to find time for myself and trying to find time to stay back in school. Eventually I gave in a glass of wine here or there became binge drinking to avoid life again. So here I go three years later 5 days sober and things are so different yet still the same. I still fight with my boyfriend we bought a house. I moved out I moved back in. My step kids still annoy me no matter how hard I try to just love them. My job is now extremely challenging. So much so I think I can't handle it some weeks. I had to drop out of school because I could never find time for it. And still can find no time for myself. I'm not sure how long I'll actually make it without drinking this time but I know I need to keep my head clear. Something in my life has got to change because I am so depressed and miserable and anxious and overwhelmed. I keep trying to kill it with self medication but it's just grown stronger. .I started mood stabilizers with anti anxiety meds I never wanted to do this but I gave in I'm giving it a try. I'm finding my diagnosis hard to except my mother is bi polar so I know what that looks like. Im starting to think being an over worked over whelmed woman is cause for people to call you crazy. This medication isn't making me not want to drink or feel any better so far I'm just too tired to give a crap or try to do anything. .I'm not sure why I'm writing this or what I'm even trying to say I'm exhausted and no one around me seems to care. I really don't want to die this way.

I know how you feel. Life isn't easy and there is plenty to get you down. I know this is a cliche thing to say but drinking wasn't my problem it was my solution to life's hardship until it stopped working the way I wanted it to. I realize now that I have to change my thought patterns how I view myself and just my outlook on life in general. I've been around AA for about four years now and yesterday I met with my now sponsor. This is the first time in my life I am actually willing to do the steps and go all out. I've tried just about anything to get sober and nothing worked so I figured fuck it might as well eat my pride and give this a shot. Maybe it's something that would work for you? Reading your post made me feel for you. I hope you can find a way.
Hey there. I'm sorry you're feeling so worn down by life - it sounds like you're in a grim place...Someone here described drinking on depression as 'trying to put out a fire by pouring fuel on it'. That really resonated with me a few months back. I don't know if I was bi-polar or depressed (or what sort of label a Dr. would have given me) but I was also trying to drink it away.  I was exhausted during the day asleep for much of it and drunk at night barely keeping my head above water mentally...I can't remember the exact sequence of events but when you said "I really don't want to die this way." That was pretty much the thought that got me on a roll. Not exactly hitting rock bottom just tired of being tired...A very good friend of mine - a fellow fan of self-medicating - once told me that he'd left drugs behind by 'walking through the door when it opened'. I kind of think that's what happened to me the door opened - I just walked through it...I'm not sure if that's where you are but I really hope you find a way back to your previous energy levels and positivity soon. x
