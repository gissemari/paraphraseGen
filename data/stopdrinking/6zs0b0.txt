I've just past the one year mark and looking forward to many more years of sobriety...Some background as to how I got here.  My drinking was such that I had alienated my family.  Physically and mentally I was deteriorating and I knew it but failed to take real positive action.  (Abstain for a week feel better no worries back to drinking.)  ..So about 10 years ago I began the journey.  I tried moderation two types of prescription medicines (topiramate &amp; naltrexone) AA meetings abstained for a week or so then relapsed (countless relapses) nothing worked.  Then one day I could not sign my name on the credit card machine - things had gotten worse.  I knew it was just a matter of time before I physically hurt myself or worse hurt someone else.   ..So I went to an addiction recovery center.  Their assessment was that I was close to becoming a full fledged alcoholic.  I could go into the IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program - 4 nights a week) or the OP (2 nights a week).  I opted for the OP with the condition that if I failed a sobriety test then I was going into IOP for 30 days.  Six month later I left the OP group and I now attend Life Ring meetings...I hope this helps those who are struggling to realize that it takes time effort and determination to rid yourself of this affliction.   Keep the course and stay strong.
