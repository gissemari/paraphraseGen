I've been in a cycle now awhile 2 weeks sober- 1 week full on relapsing. Want to break that cycle. Heading into Day 12 and I feel good but I know that "one" drink is out their waiting to pull me back. Hopefully not this time. If I can make 30 days I think I can keep it going. ..I feel good but the next few days are the danger times. Constant vigilance!

What will you do differently this time when the urges hit? I'm glad you've figured out the pattern but that was only half the battle for me. Best wishes!
I think the best reminder or coping mechanism for that is how you felt the morning after the day you relapsesd.. The guilt and the unravelling of all the progress you had made. ..Tell yourself that that one drink won't even feel good (perhaps not even taste good) because the moment it touches your lips you reset. You've gone way back to the beginning and you have to endure those awful first days all over again. ..Stop that one drink from happening and you don't have to suffer day 1 - groundhog day...Good luck.
