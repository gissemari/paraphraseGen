Today was my follow-up visit to my doctor after my hospital stay the first week of January. Since I had laid it all out finally in the ER she had all the information and knew what had happened and the cause behind it. I was able to tell her that I'd not had a single drop once I'd gotten sick...First my blood pressure was 105/66! This is really good for me since when I was in the ER it was in the 170s/?something and they struggled to get it down to 150/?something. I'm still on high blood pressure medicine but hopefully I can eventually wean myself off of that...She reminded me I need to also follow up with a gastroenterologist which I don't want to do argh. I still have eye and dentist appoints I need to make that I've put off too long due to being a drunk...But I started the gym Monday! 30 minutes of cardio 30 of strength training Mon-Thur. I want to try and do yoga on Fridays since I'm at home and use Youtube. I feel great! I was so sore those first few days though. But my muscles already feel tighter...And soon it will be 4 weeks sober. :)

Great news and great job!
Did they run all sorts of tests on you while you were in the hospital? They did on me and diagnosed me with alcoholic hepatitis.  The gastroenterologist visited me a few times while I was still admitted. Then I had to go to a follow up appt with him. He didn't run any further tests and simply told me that I had to stop drinking or I'd die. I'd never have to see him again if I stayed sober and so here I sit... planning to never see that guy again. ..Hopefully that eases your nerves a bit. Don't talk to me about the dentist I'm still avoiding that one. Good luck! Keep up the hard work! ..
