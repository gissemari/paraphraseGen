it started with some morphine pills and i thought well at least it's not alcohol. then a friend's 30th and well... i just haven't stopped drinking since. i tweaked my balls off last night and now i'm suffering the aftermath that always comes from uppers. i'm not gonna bother resetting my counter thing yet because i don't know when i'm gonna stop. it's been a couple weeks now i guess. maybe three. ..i thought i was doing so well? i don't know how i got here... to this. ..obviously i'm not as bad as i was a year ago but i see the pattern. i see the slope. my friends that i drink with say i'm too hard on myself my opinion is that it doesn't hurt to keep an eye on my behaviour and... try to put a cap on it while i'm ahead? before it goes too far. ..i had a really uncomfortable experience with a creepy guy at aa and then when my friends 30th happened there was another guy from aa who stayed sober but yeah... i didn't. and i gave him an earful about how much of a creep i think this other guy is and yanno... was all "and YoU CaN TeLl ThEm CuZ I'M nEver ComING BAck LOLLO!1" and ugh..bridge burnt ..and i miss aa but i don't blame my lack of meetings on my relapse. i think maybe deep down i'm just a masochistic piece of shit. ..i don't really know what i'm asking for here. ..sigh ..i just want some comfort and this is the only place i can get some understanding i guess.

I'd suggest some na maybe and some counselling. Sometimes it helps to get a professionals opinions
We all do stupid things when drunk.  Go back to AA your bridge is on burnt.  Any how good luck I hope you get back.
