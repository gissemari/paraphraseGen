Hello! My name is Ryan.  I have been drinking heavily for about 7 years.  When I first started I would drink a half pint of jager just about every night for like 3 years.  Then I started drinking a bottle of wine a night.... wow this all sounds terrible.   I've slowed down a lot over the past 2 years. I had some bloodwork/scans done a few months ago and everything checked out fine.  I've had some relapses of binging.  I went to a psycologist who told me to go to AA.  I went to AA for the first time I liked it.  I had my final alcohol amount last night because it was my birthday.  Now I am trying every possible resource I can find to stay away from that nasty poison.  I have a good job kids and a loving/supportive wife and I think I should try my best to stick around for them.  ..Thank you very much for your time!

Welcome Ryan! Looks like you really have your ducks in a row that's awesome. Let us know the best way to support you. Alcoholism is a greedy bastard takes everything from you and doesn't discriminate. You are lucky that  you still have a lot to lose. Let's do this!
Good to have you on board.  I bet the dark seasons turn bright very soon.  Good luck on your journey.
Welcome /u/darkseasons to /r/stopdrinking -- it sounds like you have already discovered a good path.  Let's do this thing one day at a time.  Get to bed sober.  Make a decision tomorrow morning not to drink all day tomorrow--this is a program that works to stay sober.
I also just turned 30. It's a great time to get sober. I don't remember most of my 20s but I'm sure as hell not going to let that happen to my 30s! I have found this subreddit to be really inspiring many wise words and lessons to learn from. Welcome! :)
