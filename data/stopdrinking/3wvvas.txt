I was nearing the end of my workout at the gym and thought to myself how great a cold beer would be while I caught the end of monday night football.  Then I started to think about this sub and how not once have I read a post about how it was worth it.  Not one person has come here to say that that relapse and night of drinking was fun and that maybe they're not an alcoholic after all.  Not one person has come back to say they have found that sweet spot of moderation and that it is working wonders for them. That was enough for me to just come home and have a ginger ale.  I know I will continue to be tested I'm just happy that I won today.
