First time posting here I've been drinking about 12-18 beers a night for over a year now and have finally decided to call it quits. Over the past two months I've been suffering from panic attacks at work and while driving. I've never had these issues before and believe it's from my excessive drinking..So I quit drinking on Sunday and Monday but relapsed bad on Tuesday. I woke up Wednesday afternoon and felt like complete garbage and thought maybe a few more drinks to get me over this hangover. Boy was I wrong. I had only 5 drinks but immediately felt ill like the room was spinning and I was exhausted. I spent the rest of that day and all of today in bed sweating it out feeling dizzy shortness of breath and a pounding heart. However all of that has finally gone (hopefully) and I know it's time for a change. I wanted to make this post as something I can look back on in the first few days to remember why I'm doing this.

i too suffer from anxiety caused by drinking. ironic how at first we self medicate to escape anxiety and in most cases it actually perpetuates it. personally i am on a mission to stay sober and kick anxiety's ass. first by not drinking today and second getting to the root causes when i am sober enough to get help.
Great job! Glad you're here :)
