I recently moved to the sticks (from socal so everything feels like the sticks) of Texas. The reason behind it all was due to my alcoholism. While it helped 95% to be in a different place with different people I had forgotten that I brought me with me. There aren't many options for meetings seeing as aside from a small town I'm immobile due to a case in Cali suspending my license (paid attorney is handling). I know if I worked as hard for my sobriety as I did for my addiction there wouldn't be a problem. Problem is  I tried being active in the local AA open minded to the fact that I related to no one other than the addiction.  It's so small that NA and AA are coupled and the sponsor I did find ended up relapsing with meth.  My question is would it be out-landish to ask if someone here could sponsor me? I got serious with my sobriety in August 2018 I've had a couple relapses every three or so months . The guilt and shame of relapsing keeps me in the dark. I just want a sponsor. I want to be accountable. I don't want it to feel okay to be able to hide this my life depends on it . I can't use my own thinking right now it doesn't end in my best interest.

Hey applejacks thank you for this post!..I highly advise you to read or re-read the book Alcoholics Anonymous from the title page through page 44 to get a complete understanding of the view Alcoholics Anonymous has on the physical and mental problem that is alcoholism...Once you've done that and answered the  two propositions in the first paragraph on page 44 to self-diagnose you will *know* what your situation truly is...The rest of our book is designed to show you *precisely* how you can recover from alcoholism and the sole purpose of having a sponsor is to have a recovered alcoholic take you through that process known as the 12 Steps. ..There is plenty of great solid 12 Step sponsorship available in Texas. Finding someone even in an isolated town shouldn't be extremely hard if you have the willingness and now what you're in need of. Again I emphasize that specific reading in the Big Book because it will help you be crystal clear on your predicament and on what it is you're looking to find in a sponsor - someone who has recovered and who can show you how...When you return to a meeting use that language ask around for someone who can take you through the Steps. You will find someone. Pray for a teacher to be put into your life and to be open to recognizing them it will happen. As our basic text makes clear even if you have only the *willingness* to pray without knowing if anything or anyone is listening from that willingness and action great change will commence.
