So far I'm managing my sobriety well I've had up days and down days but overall life is great sober is great and I've never been happier. Incredibly though I'm finding work harder and harder. ..I am really finding it impossible to do anything at work with increasing regularity. Just not got any motivation at all and am finding it very difficult to deal with... I've done 5 meetings this week already and been meditating etc but can't get any inspiration or drive. Emotionally I'm trying to remain calm about it but am aware that I am not doing anything and obviously can't go on line this indefinitely... I'm going to talk to my doctor to see it is aligned with reducing my anti depressants but as time goes on it's becoming increasingly frustrating...Work was particularly significant catalyst in my alcoholism but it's a supportive environment in a field I have seniority and experience in...Any help appreciated.

I have experienced this. It seems as though the healthier I get in AA the less ambition and motivation I have in my professional life. I don't feel depressed the way I did when I was drinking (suicidal cry fits etc.) but I feel apathetic and ... could I be lazy? Anyway for me it is kind of a difficult side effect of now having self worth via a spiritual awakening. I'm no longer an over-achiever pointing to my accomplishments to prove I'm not an alcoholic. I don't have the  I'll show them  drive I used to have. Now I have to be internally motivated and that's somehow much more difficult. My approach has been to take work one day at a time have something to look forward to when I get home (a hobby or plans) that way my whole day isn't just one long blah. Also and I cannot recommend this enough regular exercise is transformative. The energy and endorphins it provides are a healthy high and the sense of accomplishment I get from having gotten off my ass for a while makes the day seem productive. Good luck!
Just thinking about this post... Is it really only 3 weeks ago? Was going to say how the situation is still ongoing and hasn't improved and feels like it's been like this forever...3 weeks isn't anytime at all. I'm surprised it's so recent. I'll continue working on it.
