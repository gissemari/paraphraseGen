How's it going? Any struggles or triumphs come your way?...I'm on day 18 and feel refreshed. I go to meetings everyday and feel excited to share my day count. I used to be embarrassed but now I feel and know the people in the rooms are excited for me as well.

What was your first meeting like? 
Congrats!!!!
Day 280 or so. Someone tried to rob my apartment yesterday. My roommate shot him. Not gonna drink about it.
I'm at two weeks today:) I feel like I finally have a community of people who understand. I also feel like I'm finding out who my real friends are in my day to day life. .For me the hard part is that the gaping hole I was filling with alcohol is still there. So I just feel empty. Hopefully working the steps will help with that along with therapy lol .Good luck and I am glad you are sober! .
I'm on day 8983 and when I remember to stay out of the way life is very good. 
Day 74 here. I'm right where I should be. Working on my 4th step and battling a bit of complacency. But that's normal I'm told. It's not even the nature of the work it's just simply because it's work...Beyond that I just got some tax stuff together and sent it to my accountant. I'm uhh in quite a hole by cashing out 401ks not withholding tax and then looking ahead to the $10k penalty on top. This would send the old me in a straight up panic as I'm not working yet (full time recovery - also in IOP). But I'm not worried. It's crazy. I'm living in the moment doing the right thing and the rest will fall into place.
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
