Hi I'm really sorry if this doesn't fit into the guidelines of this sub but I'm running out of options... I have a friend who's around 30 struggling with alcohol addiction/depression/anxiety. He's living in hotels because he has no place to stay his parents are sick of lending a hand. His friends are busy and have things going on. It's a constant cycle of waitlists and the constant need to drink to avoid DTS. I'm running out of ideas. Located in Illinois are there any rehabs/communities that can help him find a place while drying him out??

He needs to reach his bottom. Don't stand in the way of that. When he's ready you can help by suggesting he go to an AA meeting and going to a detox. But people at meetings would be better equip to help someone who is suffering from DT's. By that I mean can point that person in the right direction. We aren't doctors.
If you go to alanon and explain this situation they can help you.  ..&amp;#x200B;
aa is free. 2 meetings a day for that person for the 1st year. also it might be time to look into al anon for yourself.
