Hi my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic. I'm 37 and was just watching the film Beautiful Boy with my wife. I had read both of the books on which it is based a few years ago and had forgotten how moving they were until I saw this film. Seeing the young man in the film (who is my age now) go through the addiction while looking like I did (then) and basically living the way I did (then) is harrowing. Now that I have two sons I want for them to so badly never go through the pain and sorrow I went through and brought upon other people. I know that it is out of my control and that terrifies me. I know I need to give it to my higher power and I will work on that every day. ..Seeing them lying in their beds tonight (my boys) and they are so sweet and innocent and seeing what the family in the movie (and so many families) have gone through with addiction just makes me so sad. I hate addiction and what it does to people and their families so much. I am so very grateful to be sober (6 years in 10 days God willing) and I am terrified at the thought of a slip or a relapse. I love A.A. and will forever marvel at the Good it has done in our world...May all those struggling with addiction find the hope and path they need to sobriety...And may God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference...Peace.

My name is Just I'm an alcoholic. I also read the book and saw the movie. I work with youth in rehab ages 12 to 17 and the journey told in Beautiful Boy has changed my outlook and the way I work with the kids in rehab. ..While closed borders and punishing drug dealers will help out system is sandy lacking with these children. We send them back home into the same playground and with the same playmates and same broken families. It breaks my heart. ..I recommend the film to every person I can and love to hear how it affected them the change it might make in them. ..Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
