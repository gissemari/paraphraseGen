first time since february 7 2018 (that's when i walked into my first AA meeting) that i have made it to 4 months.  actually tonight is my three month celebration where i will get my medallion.  my sponsor celebrated 3 years yesterday.  ...i have struggled throughout 2018 only getting to 2 months once other than that i have a handful of 24-hour and 1-month chips.  but i kept going back.  time after time.  it sucked so bad after a few falls to show up and again say 'i drank yesterday'.  but i knew real sobriety is what i wanted.  and i wouldn't quit trying.  even when on december 23rd when i was so low so depressed so lacking any sense of self-worth or confidence i picked myself back up the next day and said let's do this again.  but let's get this right this time.  i don't want to ever go back and live in that drunken depressed mind again.   ...started a new job last week after being off for a year feel super every day loosing weight exercising more met a new woman who is just amazing.  that 'one day at a time' is no longer a daily jail sentence i have to live through.  my days are just free now this is my refreshed life and outlook.  ..&amp;#x200B;..if i can offer any advice it would be to take the advice of everyone else that says "keep coming back!".  i didn't care for that saying but man-o-man it rang true for me and i am finally reaping the benefits.

Do you have a sponsor?  Why step are you on?
