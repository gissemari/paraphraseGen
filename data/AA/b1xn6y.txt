I am struggling. I have 6 days after having 2 years after having 2 1/2 years after I had 11 years once. Drinking and using is all I can think about right now. Just trying to get through the day. Not going to meeting yet with my new daycount. Feel very embarrassed and ashamed. I will go in a few days.
