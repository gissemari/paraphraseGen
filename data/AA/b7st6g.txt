Has anyone had luck finding an AA meeting online? My schedule does not allow for going to meetings. I am struggling staying sober and would love to find something to help me. Thanks!!

My schedule does not allow for me to go to meetings either.  I do it anyway. 
You are going to get a lot of comments like the first one you got...I am very busy as well and meetings are always better but when I can't make it to a meeting I listen to a podcast called sobercast it's a podcast if recorded speaker meetings. Almost as good as a meeting for me. 
They exist but in my experience they are not nearly as effective as in-person meetings unless you have a long history of attending meetings and are moving to online meetings because of health reasons or similar...I do believe that it is possible to have a schedule that "does not allow" for attendance at in-person meetings but I would make the suggestion that you really challenge that. Most cities have meetings every of the week at different times (often 7am to midnight) and in different locations. Many meetings are okay with children being present if childcare is in issue. If transportation is a challenge you can find AA members who will help out with that...I also think it's worth considering that one marker of alcoholism is an eventual loss of social and occupational functioning. Things like parenting children and going to work are eventually impaired by untreated alcoholism so if those are the barriers they may just become irrelevant at some point if you can no longer do them...If you truly cannot get to in-person meetings try [In the Rooms](https://www.intherooms.com/) but if you are making excuses (it's one of the things we tend to do a lot) then I'm not sure how useful online meetings will be for you.
Refuge Recovery has some good online meetings of different formats.  Not AA but more to my liking. https://refugerecovery.org/virtual-meetings
