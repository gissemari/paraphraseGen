My sponsor gave me some activities to do in the BB. ..For instance from pages 1-8 highlight what you can identify with; what you feel think or how you drink. ..I also did work in the NA basic text on chapter seven "Relapse and Recovery." I had to find all the instances where we "forgot." ..I was wondering if you guys know anymore of these searches to do so I can expand my knowledge of the book better..

Highlighting every "must" and "had to." As examples: page 55 says  "Sometimes we HAD TO search fearlessly but He was there." Page 66 says "We saw that these resentments MUST be mastered."
Page 100 working with others " When we look back we realize that the things which came to us when we put ourselves in God's hands were better than anything we could have planned. Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently live in a new and wonderful world no matter what your present circumstances!"..Write down your dream life... And loook back on what you wrote in a couple of years or so and see if God's plan was better than your plan...Also turn statement into questions here's the big book laid out in questions. Here's a study guide http://www.ppgaadallas.org/study_guide.htm
Find all twelve steps in Bills Story is one I get my sponsees to do.
Read from just after the three pertinent ideas on p. 60 throw the Third Step Prayer on p. 63 changing everything to singular first person.  That's always a good exercise to through into my 10th Step efforts...Also find the bedevilments in We Agnostics and see if they're in your life.  That's another fun check up from time to time.
