I sobered up on February 15 2018 and relapsed on February 14 2019. I am so pathetic I couldn't even make it one year off by one day. On the 14th I had 3 drinks and I've been able to keep it at about 3 drinks on and off for about a 2 weeks. Today I decided to buy a quarter pint of whisky and am currently drinking it as write this. I'm. not going to lie I love the way this makes me feel but feel like a piece of sh*t for letting down my AA group and parents. Anyhow thought I'd get that off my chest. I feel like a fuc*king failure. I feel like my life is a joke and that I have so many mental issues that I should just drink. I'm to ashamed to turn up to my AA group and tell them the truth. Thank you for reading this. Any advice would be great. Thank you and god bless.
