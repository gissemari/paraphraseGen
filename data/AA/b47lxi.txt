 NO MORE STRUGGLE. . ...*And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone even alcohol.*..  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 84..When A.A. found me I thought I was in for a struggle and that A.A. might provide the strength I needed to beat alcohol. Victorious in that fight who knows what other battles I could win. I would need to be strong though. All my previous experience with life proved that. Today I do not have to struggle or exert my will. If I take those Twelve Steps and let my Higher Power do the real work my alcohol problem disappears all by itself. My living problems also cease to be struggles. I just have to ask whether acceptance or change is required. It is not my will but His that needs doing...From the book *Daily Reflections*  .Copyright   1990 by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc.
