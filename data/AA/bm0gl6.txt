As the poison makes its presence I feel so calm within seconds. Anxiety goes down and I feel so calm movement slow deep thought comes on. I reflect on my ways and choices I've made. Who the hell am I today? A worthless man a wreck fueled by boos? Where's my free will why can't I choose? I lay my head weary to rest. I'm sorry Lord I have tried my best. Feeling weak and feeling alone not just people and substance make you feel alone. It's when you are trapped in your own thoughts. Screaming at yourself why can't I stop? You sit and you pour another drink you sit and you think and you think and you think. Where's my will to pour this drink down the sink? I once was a child with a simple dream. Now I'm being torn apart at the very same seams. Like every alcoholic that lived before me.

There is a way out.
Thank you for your kind words. I have made several foolish attempts at suicide while drinking. I feel that same darkness close in when my anxiety kicks in. All I can do is try my best at the program again and keep taking it a day at a time. Thanks again.
