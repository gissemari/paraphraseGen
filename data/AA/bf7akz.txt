Like I said I'm u/Arrest_thePresident and I'm an alcoholic. My sobriety date is 2/25/2019. I've been in and out of the rooms for the past 4 years and I love the AA/NA fellowship. I am more than willing to share my Experience Strength and Hope with people in DM's and always willing to give support to those struggling. Much love!
