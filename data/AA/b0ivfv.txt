Today was a really emotional day overall I'm finally at the point where I'm mostly settled into my apartment but I struggled with sadness and loneliness today...Today was the first women's stag meeting in the area that I wanted to start at I'm 19 days sober...I messed up the time and showed up early and spent 30 minutes doing the mental dance of how I don't need to be here I don't really have a problem this isn't for me etc but I managed to get inside...I am so glad I did...The ladies were friendly and made me feel extremely welcome...I decided to share even though it was my first day because I personally needed to confront my problem and accept that I needed help and take responsibility for my recovery and I felt sharing my story was a good way to accomplish this...I cried I cried a lot to be honest but I made I made it through my story and found only support from these amazing ladies. ..This was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me on a rough day so seriously THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO ATTENDS MEETINGS AND MAKES NEWBIES FEEL WELCOME!
