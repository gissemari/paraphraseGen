 ..AN UNSUSPECTED INNER RESOURCE..*With few exceptions our members find that they have tapped an unsuspected inner resource which they presently identify with their own conception of a Power greater than themselves.*..  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS pp. 567-68..From my first days in A.A. as I struggled for sobriety I found hope in these words from our founders. I often pondered the phrase: "they have tapped an unsuspected inner resource." How I asked myself can I find the Power within myself since I am so powerless? In time as the founders promised it came to me: I have always had the choice between goodness and evil between unselfishness and selfishness between serenity and fear. That Power greater than myself is an original gift that I did not recognize until I achieved daily sobriety through living A.A.'s Twelve Steps...From the book *Daily Reflections*  .Copyright   1990 by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc.
