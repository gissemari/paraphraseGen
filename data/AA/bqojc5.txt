I have just recently started step 4. It says make a list of people institutions and principals that you are angry with. I understand the people and institutions part but I am struggling with the principles part. I have tried reading online but I just get more confused. I was wondering if someone could give me a few rough examples. Now I know this is highly personal stuff and I am not asking you to dispose details or anything. I am just so confused. Thank you all.

I looked up the definition of principle...a fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning..."the basic principles of Christianity"..Hope this helps
Do you have a sponsor?  Have you asked them?  ..Principles are basic ideas. One I have trouble with is respect authority.
*Women should be subservient to their husbands.*..*Wearing fur is acceptable/unacceptable.*..*We live in a meritocracy.*..*Honesty is the best policy.* ..*Homeschooling your children is the best way to ensure they get a good education.*
