Hello all! I'm on day three of sobriety after another relapse. So far no withdrawals and yesterday was my first day back at the gym in over 2 months. I'm on anti anxiety meds from my doctor to help get me back to meetings ( social anxiety is crippling) and I'm really trying for just one day  at a time. Any thoughts or advise you guys can give us be grateful. Thanks!

Did you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?  ..What are you going to do different this time?
Glad you are back and I hope you keep coming back. My best advice would be to hit a meeting every day share in meetings if things are troubling you as well as if things are going good grab a sponsor (don't be too picky just get someone you can trust and who you know works a good program) and work these steps! Then get a home group to commit to every week and then enjoy the ride! Trudge if you have to don't give up before the miracle happens. I have before but this time as tough as it's been I've buckled down and put one foot in front of the other and I feel so much better! Good luck friend!
