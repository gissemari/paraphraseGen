So im on day eight and still craving feeling anxious. I did 30 days previously then drank. Going to a meeting shortly...hoping it gives me the kick up the ads I need!

I had cravings until I committed to doing AA. I did that by getting a sponsor to take the steps with and committing to 90 meetings in 90 days. I did that by keeping track in my big book. ..Another thing that really helped was getting down on my knees daily and asking that the compulsion to drink and use drugs be removed.
Just an update...I feel good today no cravings..the meetings are like magic to me. I cant believe im in such a different place within 24 hours
