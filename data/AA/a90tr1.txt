BACKSTORY (to get to the point scroll to revelation):..I got a dui four years ago and part of my mandated classes included going to two AA meetings. I found both meetings awkward and not natural for whatever reasons and never went back...Two weeks ago I decided to go to another one with my partner. I thought it was better and the people were more welcoming but it still didn't feel like a complete fit...This morning I decided to go to a different AA on my own (partner is now drinking again) and I must say it blew me out of the water. ..At first I felt like I maybe attended one specifically for the opposite gender but then I found a few of the same gender. That's beside the point...The people were down to earth and just genuine in their speaking. One person even mentioned the first time saying they were an alcoholic feeling like it didn't match I totally related to that. ..The topic today was the holidays...MY REVELATION:..Initially I browsed through my thoughts and concluded that I was doing JUUUUST FINE and that I had no struggles regarding the holidays...Then as I listened to others I was reminded perusing the grocery store after thanksgiving and seeing the peppermint vodka and wanting to craft a cheery drink. ..Then I remembered telling my mom I don't drink and her coming over sloshed with spiked eggnog...I remembered my partner relapsed and is now drinking daily again. ..And then my uncle offering me weed...THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I VOLUNTEERED TO SPEAK...I conveyed all of this and they totally could relate...I then asked about sleeping medications being off limits and got TONS of natural options and people reaching out giving their own two cents...People even felt compelled to come up afterwards and comment on my story and exchange numbers...I wrote off the people before who said you have to find the group that's right for you but IM HAPPY TO SAY I THINK I FOUND IT...This feels like HOME.
