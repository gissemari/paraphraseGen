Thanks to this subreddit I was able to find the greatest Alana club. The last house on the block in Anaheim club 202 :). I had lost my job rooming and sense of hope because of alcohol. I was able to find a place with my aunt and cousins(one is and addict) . I got a sponsor day 4. my cousin in Virginia of who's family I live with tried to kill himself with a gun to the chest day 28 and I was hoping for more from my sponsor but it's like he didn't know how to handle the situation. I know I push people away with weird test and it happened. I was able to get to day 90 with only 2 meetinga in between. I wanted to get the relapse over with and started drinking 11/18 and I haven't been able to stop because I can ask for a drink here and it'll be given to me. I was able to get my old job back part time and have been giving 300 rent I can't make the 500 a month at a sober living around here. Boy this feels like a meeting and I'm blessed. I went to a meeting over a month ago but boy was it nice seeing a few familiar faces. Higher power reach out to those that you have put there for me. I'm sorry I went so astray. This is a nice site. Haha I'll be on here for the next hour and treat it like a meeting.

Study the big book like your life depends on it because it does... Once you know that book inside out that book and God run your life not some sponsor...... No human power can relieve our alcoholism. 
202 club. Got clean there myself back in the day. Came for meeting from the Salvation Army ARC near there.    ..Salvation Army was a real bitch. Working all the time. Meetings Groups and they gave zero fucks for how I felt that day. If you can not swing sober living in the area try them out. Other than every free minute you have it is free. When I was there 20 years ago it helped me.  They had AA meeting on site and allowed (Encouraged and Demanded) you to attend outside meetings as well.   ..Also I had a sponsor that went to Woodglen in fullerton and I think that they have some county funded beds.
