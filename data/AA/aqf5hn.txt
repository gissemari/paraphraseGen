I chair a lot of meetings and I often struggle to find interesting topics. 9/10 times other members haven't got any so I go to the daily reflections or a step or two. So do any of you have any novel or interesting topics I can dip into?..Thanks for your time and good luck on your journey.

I always love topics that are solution based. I love step 8 and 9 topics as well as 4 and 5. I know as a newcomer those were the steps it was easy for me to buy into because of the tangible action my skeptical newcomer brain could latch onto.
Powerlessness resentment fear God character defects prayer meditation spiritual experience humility ego willingness honesty sponsorship action change selfishness anger.
My home group reads a selection from the big book; our meeting is closed discussion based on that topic. ..At other meetings I've chosen the spiritual principle of the month or something out of As Bill Sees It or the 12 and 12 or an excerpt from a story in the back... AA literal is rife with topics for discussion. 
The 12 and 12 is great for this 
Anything from pages 60-63.
