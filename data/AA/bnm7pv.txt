Hey everyone..My fianc  use to be or is an alcoholic. I don't know how to put it.. she was heavy drinker a year ago and something devastating happened to her that made her stop for almost a year.. then She went back to drink 2-3 months ago but only wine once every weekend.. Today she was with her friends girls chilling and she came back late home drunk... it really broke something in me when i saw that.. she was telling me how was her night then after like 10 minutes she repeated the story as if she is telling me her night for the first time.. i don't see my self struggling with this my whole life because i already went through alot with her and i think i have enough. We were planing our marriage next month or so and now i am totally turned off. I don't know what to do. I told her that i am not happy seeing this she cussed me and she said all kind of things and it is a compliment for her when i told her  you are drunk .. i don't know how to deal with this.

See how you feel tomorrow. Talk to her about it in the morning. Make time to have a conversation about it before you make a decision about your relationship. Good luck!
If your partner wants to stop drinking and needs help AA is here for her. We can't give relationship advice though...For you look into AlAnon. It's a program for people who are affected by someone else's drinking. r/alanon
Might be good to get out while the going is good.  ..You might want to check out Alanon they are experts in your situation. We're just a bunch of drunks trying to stay sober.
AA for her and Al-anon for you. I wouldn't plan on marrying a person in active addiction: just my two cents. Usually doesn't end well.
