I copped to my wife. She's understandably very angry with me. Gonna hit my first REAL meeting tomorrow. My brother said I should reach out before the meeting so someone holds me accountable. So I guess that's what I'm doing. But I'm scared that I'll just relapse again.

Alcoholics drink.  It's what we do.  A single day sober is a miracle for us....How far along did you make it in the steps?
you can prevent relapse by taking antabuse. 
I recommend telling some of the men in the group that you relapsed. Find others who have done the same and then found success...Good for you for being honest and for going back!! ..The 4th step is scary. But the 5th step is worth the work. Good luck!!
What happened doesn't have to happen again. Do all the usual stuff and make the call to talk with a member before you take the next drink.
