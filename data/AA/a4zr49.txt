did an inpatient program had a relapse close to getting out then cleaned up then had ONE night where I had four beers a month ago and it was unpleasant. so really like 85% of the last THREE months were osber which is an achievement. i like to be a stickler though...life has been so much better happier and healthier than I've been in years pursuing hobbies and passions again sleeping well eating three meals a day- life is good...=..won't drink with y'all today. or tomorrow
