Would it be acceptable to ask for support as a non alcoholic? ..I have family and an ex who can't stay sober calls me every name in the book when they relapse and gas lighted all of my insecurities. It's F\*\*\*\*ing difficult when I have looked up to these people (family) or have had feelings for them because they were wonderful until they broke their sobriety (ex). (Ex was sober for a year+ when we started dating)...I have been reading all of your success stories and your learning experiences (pitfalls). It takes guts to do that thank you for sharing your stories.

Check out al-anon. They have meetings and a sub. It's exactly what you seem to be looking for
AA it's for people who want to start drinking.    Alanon is right up your alley.
