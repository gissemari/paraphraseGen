Hello everyone ..This is a reflection of the journaling i just got done doing.. I want to share it with anyone who may be struggling. Recovery is a whole new way of life changing everything.. people places and things. We were ripping and running for a long time our lifestyles were everything to us.. We became adapted to this way of life for 7 years for me. Changing all of this takes time to get used to.. the feelings of being lonely sober and boring... often cross my mind. A more simple way of life my life was like a TV drama... sometimes i tend to find myself missing the chaos and attention of false gratification. I find myself like this when I am NOT putting my sobriety into 100% effort and working my life first with recovery second making my sobriety my priority the other things seem to fall into place a lot more simply and smoothly. The feelings of change are normal. Only being 4.5 months sober i am still pretty new to this thing but I know my mental health is becoming more stable because i am able to reflect upon my actions and fix them. This process is a day to day journey with its ups and downs but YOU ARE WORTH IT so just keep coming back and DO NOT USE.... I talked about this on my last episode of the podcast and would love to share it and hear How do you get through the days you may just want to drink? AA has given me a toolbox and I always have it sometimes it is hard to pick it up and use it but AA is always there for me...&amp;#x200B;..[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rowdy-ep-5-the-good-and-the-bad-days-in-recovery/id1438250340?i=1000422710647&amp;mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rowdy-ep-5-the-good-and-the-bad-days-in-recovery/id1438250340?i=1000422710647&amp;mt=2)
