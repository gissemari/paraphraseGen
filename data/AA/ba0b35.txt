The big book is an obvious answer of course but I want to know what other literature is important to you and why. ..I'm really loving Came To Believe... As someone who still struggles with trusting my Higher Power (God) who still struggles a little bit at "the God thing" (although it's getting so much better and for that I'm grateful) it's really helping me.

I like  Drop the Rock . It's a deep dive into steps 6 and 7.

I like issues of the Grapevine. A ton of perspectives always!
