Ten years ago I rang deaths doorbell.  Never would I have ever imagined that I could have hit this sort of milestone in my lifetime today.  Through the grace and support of Alcoholics Anonymous family friends and a lot of hard mental breakdowns I am proud to say after hitting rock bottom not just once twice I am proud to survive and grow into the person I  have become.  I admire all of the posts I read on this subreddit from someone first day of sobriety to someone saying they just reached their 40th year.  I encourage and will always support the determination and willingness of the alcoholic that still struggles.  I thank this subreddit and will always read the daily wisdom that inspires me and hopefully everyone will keep sharing.........peace and love!
