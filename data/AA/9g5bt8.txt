Hi! My name is Bella - I'm 26 &amp; have 3 wks sobriety as of today after a few relapses....Moved back home to live with my mom after her having a stroke in March to take care of her - &amp; there are no AA meetings nearby or can drive to. (My car is busted ATM)..I'm reaching out now after coming back from a wk of witnessing my best friend relapse &amp; flooding the rest of my time w/AA meetings/being around my first real family - my rehab people. Realizing I can't do this alone - and having been trying my best to continue my walk w/God &amp; keep myself involved in AA through the internet. ..Hope to hear from you soon!.Bella

You might have some luck getting connected with an online or phone meeting.  https://aa-intergroup.org
Good luck. Get on your knees and pray daily for the obsession to be lifted be genuine. Your life will infinitely improve if you stay sober. Hugs &amp; good luck.
Message me... I'd be happy to chat and connect. 
Long distance is harder but I'm sure it's possible.  I would be very surprised if there is not a meeting nearby and several folks willing to pick you up and bring you home.  AA is just about everywhere.
I could use more AA in my life and all definitely able to sponsor. Feel free to message and we can see if it'll be a good fit!
