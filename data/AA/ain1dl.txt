7 years today. Went to my first AA meeting back in 1983. It took a while but once I honestly worked the steps and did what was suggested in the rooms I managed to stay sober...So if relapse is a part of your story like it is mine please; I beg you......Keep. Coming. Back!!

Good going. I'm personally thinking about doing steps. 
**High^Five for 7yrs /u/nwgiantsguy!**         ..You give hope to others because you are proof that recovery is possible. 
Seven years Sober! I can't wait to hit one month!! Good job man!!
im over 1 year 2 months...loving sobriety. relapse was a part of mine..but it was what i needed to understand the disease.  thank god docs opinion. question...did ur financial stuff grow happiness grow and spirituality grow immensely?  are u doing what u love for a living?..im working on my goals right now in terms of career...its exciting.
Thank you for sharing. It took me 13 years from introduction to meetings to finally working the steps and following suggestions. My experience is like yours. 5+ years and counting. Never thought I would be able to do this... Turns out I was right. ;)
In and out since 19 (currently 30). I guess I needed more pain and humility to see through this beast in my brain. Thanks for your commitment to sobriety!
