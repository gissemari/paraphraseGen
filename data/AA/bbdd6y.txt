Hi fellow AA members...Today is my 75th day sober... and I bought a bunch of nips. I haven't drank them yet. ..I am in a drug addiction program and just got some freedoms back this past Saturday. I know that I have been  pre-lapsing  for about a week and on my way back from the gym the urge became overwhelming and I turned into the liquor store. I know I should tell someone but I'm struggling to care. I know I can get away with it...I really need someone to smack some sense into me... before I actually drink them

Hey AddictMinded. It's ok. Just take a minute and breathe. Now the next thing you should do if you choose is to  out  yourself to a trusted sober/safe friend who knows your story and your sobriety. Take away the secret and put it out there so there's nowhere to hide. .Play the tape forward so you can see where this is gonna land you if you choose to go down this path. .And last but not least know that the craving will pass. You've done it before- you can do it again. I believe in you.
I mean maybe you can get away with it while you're drinking them. But what about after? What about when you're tipsy? What about when you realize that you didn't buy nearly enough? What about the next time you wanna get drunk? ..It's not the 12th drink that gets us drunk; it's the first! I strongly recommend handing them over and hitting a meeting!! Remind yourself what happens when you drink. Talk to your higher power and then *listen* to it. Your higher power is already trying to make you hear it. If you truly authentically without a doubt wanted to drink today you already would have and you wouldn't have bothered posting on Reddit about it...Now that you've got the booze in your possession it's just going to gnaw at you. I recommend getting rid of it!
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
Look you made it through yesterday. You **can** make it another ten minutes today. Spend that ten minutes pouring the nips down the drain.
Dude. You've got this. Remember why you quit. Remember that you are your worst self while drinking. Go grab some ice cream and watch a movie and distract yourself until the craving passes. Do not allow your cravings to control you. You are in charge.
When I was in sober living in a long term over a year ago I had a few months was working the steps and when I got my first bit of freedom  I bought a nip...I didn't get caught. I kept doing it and eventually relapsed back on heroin overdosed in a city far from home kicked out of sober living and wound up homeless. I'd really really reconsider those nips man.
Pray.Help someone.Rinse and repeat
If you want to talk I'm here to listen. Sounds like you're playing with fire right now and I've done it myself. I'm no expert I have 8 month clean and it has been difficult as hell. Just want to give a listening ear if that will help even a little bit to keep you going.
Hi hope i'm not to late  wind the film forward see disaster before it happens  take care
Find your version of God and pray. Talk to your sponsor and don't drink the first drink. Start working the steps.
Put some music on and go for a walk. I'll stay sober with you today.
Unfortunately I doubt anything any of us would say is going to stop you if you are alcoholic like me. ..I had to concede to my innermost self that I was an alcoholic and for me to drink meant disaster and pain. ..I wish you luck.
Hey! Sorry for the late response but I did not drink thanks to you guys. I prayed and then I gave the package to my house manager who disposed of the poison. Then I went to two meetings last night. I feel fired up and strong right now. I sincerely owe all of you my life. I will pass it on to the next struggling alcoholic. Thank you again :)
You can get away with it with respect to other people. But you can't get away with it regarding yourself.  You matter more than drinking. I don't know you but I believe that. I'm newly sober and had a total s*** day. It's so easy to want to say f*** it but I truly believe that  I'm here to do more than be a selfish drunk bastard. I believe we all are.  You included. Definitely not judging. I feel you.  Just trying to help.
