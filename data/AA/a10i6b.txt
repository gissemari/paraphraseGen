I'm a former NA member who is struggling with alcohol. I've been looking for an NA sponsor but I'm not clicking or finding a good match. Anyone in AA in Amsterdam who might be up for a coffee??

Went to a few at this hall...Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 282 1012 RT Amsterdam. Noon and eve meetings in English. Very friendly and lively group. Let them know you're new and it's likely you'll get an invite to coffee after.  .
