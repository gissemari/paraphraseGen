I'm in my late 30's haven't touched alcohol since 2013-2014 sometime. Don't even remember when I stopped. I just remember at some point I quit and put it behind me and it wasn't a big issue. I wouldn't say I ever had a massive problem with drinking only had my first real drink on my 20th birthday and throughout my 20's drank socially and recklessly on no more than a handful of occasions. For a few years I was a daily drinker when I lived and worked over in Europe. But for some reason now years later I'm obsessing over alcohol. Even find myself browsing through liquor aisles but never buying anything. Thinking about getting a bottle and making it part of my life again. I just don't understand where the craving and mental itch is coming from...? Only thought is that I've been working on getting into shape this past year and maybe I've lost enough weight that maybe I'm down to the fat layers where a lot of that alcohol energy was stored from years ago and the residuals are being released into my system. Is that totally crazy or possible? I've heard of similar things happening with addicts who go through fasting protocols and the toxins from drugs release into their system. Anyway I'm struggling but so far haven't gone back to it. Hopefully I'll resist until I overcome the obsession.
