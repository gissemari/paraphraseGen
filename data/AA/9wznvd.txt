INTUITION AND INSPIRATION... . . we ask God for inspiration an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don't struggle..  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 86..I invest my time in what I truly love. Step Eleven is a discipline that allows me and my Higher Power to be together reminding me that with God's help intuition and inspiration are possible. Practice of the Step brings on selflove. In a consistent attempt to improve my conscious contact with a Higher Power I am subtly reminded of my unhealthy past with its patterns of grandiose thinking and false feelings of omnipotence. When I ask for the power to carry out God's will for me I am made aware of my powerlessness. Humility and a healthy selflove are compatible a direct result of working Step Eleven.
