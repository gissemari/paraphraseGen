This is actually my first time ever posting on Reddit. I wanted to go to someone in the AA community here in my town but there's no one I can talk to that wouldn't tell everyone else we know in the rooms about it. My partner is in AA I am not. We started dating when he was two years sober. Been together almost three years he'll have five years sober very soon. I've noticed significant changes in his attitude and behavior recently. Increasingly quick tempered confrontational apathetic. Doesn't care if he's late to work(it's a terrible workplace environment so I partially understand that) sleeps and watches tv a lot sedentary. Complete lack of spirituality. His attitude is night and day from what it was even a year ago. When I try to approach this(gently) he says it's because he's overworked which I don't doubt at all- he definitely is. But he seems to blow off these concerns. I'm worried that his mental and emotional states are putting him at risk of relapse. My question is- what do I do(or not do) about it? Since I'm not in the program I don't really feel like it's my place to call him out on his program or behavior. I feel sort of helpless. What steps can I take to encourage him? What are things that I definitely should not do? I considered talking to his sponsor but after some thought decided against it. Any advice appreciated! Thanks!

This might be better directed at Alanon...
