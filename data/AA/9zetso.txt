ONLY TWO SINS... . . there are only two sins; the first is to interfere with the growth of another human being and the second is to interfere with one's own growth..  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p. 542 (Third Edition)..Happiness is such an elusive state. How often do my "prayers" for others involve "hidden" prayers for my own agenda? How often is my search for happiness a boulder in the path of growth for another or even myself? Seeking growth through humility and acceptance brings things that appear to be anything but good wholesome and vital. Yet in looking back I can see that pain struggles and setbacks have all contributed eventually to serenity through growth in the program. I ask my Higher Power to help me not cause another's lack of growth today or my own.
