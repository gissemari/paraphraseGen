I'm 23 and have never gotten a tattoo. I've always felt like I might want one I just don't want to get one I would regret or that would go out of style or just be lame. Since I've gotten sober (53 days first timer) I've been struggling with the idea that maybe I can go back out there. I think having a tattoo that says "she's a drunk" in a different language would serve me well to remind myself of my allergy and the gifts that sobriety has given me. it would be a bit of an inside joke with myself and since I live in America it wouldn't be obvious if I were to get the phrase in another language. Open to thoughts or suggestions and if anyone knows the correct way to spell and phrase it let me know. Please don't fuck with me I don't want to end up like Ari lol.

Consider posting this in a French language subreddit. ....Also consider waiting till you are a year sober. Just to make sure you aren't being impulsive. 
That seems like an impulse decision I would think a few times about in very early recovery before rushing into it.
A good friend of mine got a folding chair just like the hundreds of thousands in church basements all over the country (sorry for the long link I'm on mobile: https://www.instagram.com/subversivetattooparlor/p/BtUdHVBFGVg/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=b6xyed1614ia ) I'm basically in love with it and want one just like it. ..My own recovery-related tattoo says  I swear that I'd like to change  which is something I wanted long before I got sober but holds a much different meaning now. I got it at 5 months. ..Agreed that you should try a French language subreddit but whatever motivates you to get and stay clean go for it...(Shameless plug for Subversive tattoo in Brooklyn NY it's a sober shop full of badass women. Marz did the chair Myles did mine)..
I don't know in French :).  When I first got sober I wanted a tattoo on my left wrist that said "sober".  I'm glad I waited because now 8 months later sobriety is becoming so ingrained on my soul and in my life I feel it all the time and am glad I don't have or need the reminder. To each there own I firmly believe your body your choice.  BTW  I started a new subreddit for women in recovery.  It is not exclusively  for AA members but many of us are in the program.  Hope you can check it  out [r/women\_in\_recovery](https://www.reddit.com/r/women_in_recovery) 
Elle est saoule!
Rather than getting a tattoo at 53 days sober I'd recommend getting a sponsor and working the steps.
