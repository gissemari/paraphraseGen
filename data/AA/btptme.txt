I'm having a horrible day. I'm a Veteran and can't stop ruminating about how I treated my family during my active addiction which involved 5 combat tours. It was a total shit show and I burnt every bridge that took me over a decade to build. Now I'm all alone with no family on Memorial Day wishing I was someone else or dead.And what's worse is I relapsed and made an ass of myself yet again by getting mad at my ex wife and running my mouth...Can anyone relate? I don't know how I can ever show this woman that I'm sorry let alone drop this worthless/unlovable feeling
