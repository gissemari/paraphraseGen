5 months sober and am still struggling. Dealing with depression daily
----------immediate responses--------

I am. You can message me if you need someone to talk to. I haven't had much consistent sober time but I can still be there to listen.  
Absolutely. 
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?  Going to AA but not getting a sponsor and working the steps is like going to a restaurant not ordering food and wondering why you're still hungry. 
How long did it take for you to not have suicidal thoughts regularly?
Feel free to hit me up. I still struggle with it and my sponsor isn't very understanding.
