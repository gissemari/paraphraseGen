I have been sober for 35 days and tonight is the first time I have been "out" in that time. I am attended a show of a guy I went to school with who I hope makes it big. And of course it is at a bar and pub. I'm posting here just as a way to hold myself accountable to staying sober tonight. I have no intention of drinking but do we ever really when we relapse? I have a soda water with lemon and lime and my one month chip in my pocket. One cool fact though the show is to promote his new single which happens to be about his girlfriend dying of an overdose so I think I will be safe.

I'd suggest leaving a little early and doing something nice for yourself after you do so.
35 days! Stay strong! IWNDWYT!
Thanks for the kind support. I did not drink. However I left early because I really want to go out dancing and this guy is playing at a reallbar tomorrow where dancing should happen. Tonight's venue was actually a Country Club so there were a lot of older folks sitting around eating dinner. Tomorrow will be the real challenge as the bar I'll be going to used to be one of my old haunts for years and years and there are likely to be lots of triggers (aka people) floating around. So I am going alone so that I can leave anytime if I start to get an itch I struggle to ignore.
Try going with someone else who is sober. If you must go at all
always good to be well fed as well. ..h.a.l.t..
What's helpful for me in similar situations is to have a (nonalcoholic) drink in my hand at all times.
Please take a sober member of AA with you.  
How did the second night go?
