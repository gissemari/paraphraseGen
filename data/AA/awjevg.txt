Yesterday was a struggle i wasn't sure i was gonna to overcome. I hit 3 meetings back to back to back and still felt weak but i prayed and found the strength. One day at a time.

Hang in it won't feel as hard next week as it does this week.
One day at a time you can get there. You're doing all the right things! 
Stay strong my friend. In times of stress I find myself a calm spot and quietly say the Serenity prayer to myself two or three times. It works for me. You only have to be strong for today.
Take it easy. You don't have to figure it all out in a hurry. There is a lot of pressure in AA surrounding a higher power and the steps. Don't let that become an impediment to your early recovery. Just go to meetings and listen. You will hear people say things that resonate with what is in your head. There are many paths to recovery in the program..For now choose what seems comfortable to you.
Great keep going   the Journey has began  remember Swings &amp; Roundabouts  
What do you pray to? I'm a fucked up atheist who won't take anything spiritual seriously and I'm desperately trying to change that. Any advice? (p.s. it's totally chill if you don't) 
God will lift you up like Hydraulics if you let him
