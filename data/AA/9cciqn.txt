I've been a heavy drinker for years. It got worse when I started swing work. It's how I shift myself to the hour flip every week.  I haven't shit in 3 days because I can't keep friggin food down. I always get to work function fine but feel like trash obviously. ..I'm at times struggling to keep water down. Is there an approach to this without hospitalization?  I'm currently trying to wean myself slowly as i recognize at this stage I'd likely die cold turkey. My enzyme count is HIGH. ..Thanks for any input. I have a serious fear of doctors and am basically housebound outside of making myself go to work.
