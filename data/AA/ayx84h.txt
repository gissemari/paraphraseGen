I was about to hit my 5 month mark when life got crazy and I caved. One night of drinking ended with a DUI a crushed family and going back into rehab. I'm home now back living with my family no car no license and no job. I'm struggling thinking nothing will be the same again and the time I lost I worked hard for.

What step were you on when you got drunk?  
I had a lot of sober time and then went back out. At first it felt like I had "lost" all of that time but now I'm grateful that things happened the way they did. The willingness that came out of that experience had totally changed my recovery...Just show up at a meeting tomorrow. Re-commit to your program. Do 90 in 90. Talk to your sponsor every day. Start a new set of steps. Reach out to newcomers. Get in the middle and make your program of recovery your first priority. It won't be the same it will be better.
Stop thinking and start moving. Go to a meeting tomorrow get right back in it. It's all in your head so you need to get out of your head and start doing the next right thing...That's what's been working for me at least.
