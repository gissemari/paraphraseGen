I'd be lying if I said the last nine months had been easy. I've cried struggled considered taking my own life and shouted. In the last four months I've noticed it's been improving significantly and I hadn't made the correlation that it was this time I started helping out the new members in the rooms. It's no wonder that the last two weeks where I've withdrawn been dealing with my unwell partner and stopped talking to newcomers that those feelings returned. My sponsor gave me an emotional kick and told me to help someone immediately and what do you know? Not only can they see me within the hour for help with their step four but they can replace a lot item ive been missing that they had spare. The connected feeling is returning because I've made myself useful. I have a place in the world because I made a place for myself. My higher power has me in his care and I have finally chosen to accept it again..God bless to all I hope you're doing well. Share what you find happens with helping newcomers if you wish and newcomers please ask for help! You have no idea how much it can be of assistance.

\&gt; The connected feeling is returning because I've made myself useful.  ..&amp;#x200B;..This happens outside of AA too. BECAUSE of AA I learned that if I'm feeling uncomfortable when I'm at an event or social setting (party whatever) *helping out* makes me feel like I'm part of the group and not an outsider. ..&amp;#x200B;
I have 9 mo too!  Thanks for the post I can so easily get stuck in my selfish ways and that's when I start to feel disconnected and want to drink. I go to a lot of meetings which always help and try to be as welcoming and helpful as possible- us newcomers have to help each other.  I started a new subreddit for women r/women_in_recovery if you want to check it out.
