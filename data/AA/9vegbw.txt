I'm in a situation that is emotionally harmful to me but I can't remove myself from it. It involves someone that may have a mood disorder of some type but I cannot diagnose someone. Either way it would be damaging to anyone that is forced to endure the relentless attacks gaslighting intimidation and manipulation. Does anyone else have tips on dealing with this in sobriety? It takes immense strength and will-power to not internalize everything and it is incredibly draining. I know I just have to keep trudging on. I pray for acceptance that this is the situation that I am in but I still struggle. I wonder if connecting with others that have experienced this would be helpful. I do discuss it lightly in meetings in hope of finding others that have made it through this challenge but haven't found many. Any help or encouragement would be appreciated.

Take this with a grain of salt. I certainly don't have all of the pieces in place as I'm no longer sober. While I don't know your situation I do know this.. You're probably going to drink again if you stay in an abusive relationship.
