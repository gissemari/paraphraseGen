 When you get what you want in your struggle for self  .And the world makes you king for a day  .Just go to the mirror and look at yourself  .And see what that man has to say.  ...For it isn't your father or mother or wife   .Whose judgment upon you must pass  .The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life  .Is the one staring back from the glass.  ...He's the fellow to please   never mind all the rest  .For he's with you clear to the end  .And you've passed your most difficult dangerous test  .If the man in the glass is your friend.  ...You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years  .And get pats on the back as you pass  .But your final reward will be heartache and tears  .If you've cheated the man in the glass.  ..\- Peter Dale Wimbrow Sr.

This poem used to make me cry every time it was read! So powerful.
There is no point in hitting bottom if it doesn't connect the deepest part of us with the truth of our situation. Hitting bottom must produce a real result: surrender. http://WorksPublishing.com
