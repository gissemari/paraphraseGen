My SO struggles with alcohol. He gets it from his mother.  We have been together 6 years. When we first met I didn't really know he had a problem. ..He took vacation from work and I would get home at 5 and he would be shit faced slurring his words stumbling around. At first I thought it was just vacation drinking. After the first few months of our relationship he moved cross country so I only interacted with him through Skype or phone. Usually when we talked on the weekend he would be drinking or drunk. Sometimes he wouldn't call at set times because he was drinking instead. .. A year and a half after we met we got married and I moved cross country to be with him. It was then that I realized he had a problem. Some weekends he would drink a 5th of Jack every night plus his beers. We were spending exorbitant amounts of money on alcohol every month... I grew up super religious so I don't like drinking very much. I enjoy sangrias and the occasional very specific brand of beer. He gets condescending when he drinks and would basically shame me for not drinking with him.  ..Eventually it hit a head and every couple months we would have a fight over his drinking. Now I have to say it's not bad per se. He only drinks on the weekend it's not every day. He thinks he has a high tolerance for alcohol but a drink in I see the change in his walking. I hear the change of his enunciation. He gets super condescending. No matter how much I tell him he has a low tolerance he thinks it's high. ..We have tried moderation two beers per night or one 5th for the weekend etc. But it never works. If he runs out he will go buy more. Or he will take any of my beer that I may have. He always tells me I won't drink this weekend and then comes home after work with a six pack and a bottle. He has asked me to cut him off and when I do berates me or says hurtful things. ..The worst was when we found out I was pregnant. He was in a  sober  phase. He hadn't been drinking in about 4 months. I found hidden mini bottles in the trash. He says he treated himself to one congratulatory shot- a mini bottle he got at the gas station. But then it persisted.  Im not sure how long it lasted before I found out and called him out. ..There has never been violence just him blacking out and passing out at peoples houses children's birthday parties Christmas celebrations. His friends learned to tell the early signs of his drinking and would give me pitying looks. ..So ultimately over the last 6 years we have gone through this cycle of sobriety for 2 months here 5 months there etc. I got fed up and wrote him a very long letter detailing my feelings. It seemed to snap him out of it but of course a few months down the road more drinking. I've stopped saying anything. But he knows my silence. He knows. And yet he doesn't care. ..He hasn't really hit  rock bottom  but I don't know what to do to help him. Im not going to continue raising my children with someone who thinks being shit faced is the best way to spend a weekend. When my due date is here and I have to drive myself to the hospital because he has been drinking. I've suggested hobbies counseling AA and yet he does nothing other than tell me he is done drinking. ..This has turned into a ramble I'm sorry. ..Is there anything I can do to get him to get help? Do I have to leave to get him to know I am serious? Does he have to get there on his own?

Go to an Alanon meeting 
AA is for alcoholics to share experience strength and hope with each other. If your partner wants to quit drinking AA could be helpful for him. AlAnon is for friends and family members of alcoholics who are affected by their loved ones' drinking. AlAnon may be helpful for you.
