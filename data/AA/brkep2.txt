I've been sober for one week short of 6 months. I moved areas a couple of months in which was a challenge for me because my first few weeks are marked by the people I came into the fellowship with. Now I don't see them very often. One guy who I used to drive to meetings had a couple of busts really early on. A few weeks ago he returned to work and told me he was really struggling being back in the old environment. He asked me to check in on him every day. I'm not at Step 5 yet and he has a sponsor (actually he's onto his second sponsor). With my own life being pretty dramatic I haven't been able to call every day let alone send a message. I found out yesterday he had another bust this time enough to put him back into detox. I feel responsible.

In the end a person's sobriety is only up to them. You offered the help you were able to. His relapse is not your fault.
Show up early and leave late.
We are not powerful enough to control other people. You are not responsible for someone else period. He is safely in detox so that is good.
