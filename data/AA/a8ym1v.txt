Sober since 25 Sep 18 and first time without alcohol for the holidays and I'm struggling.

Why did you choose to stop in the first place?  I find remembering my WHY helps me. 
Hang in there. Can you make yourself useful? Contribute with the cooking the cleaning something else? 
Hi .Yes I am the same .. I am coming up 9months.. been to a meeting this morning which was great.. but now feeling anxious and don't really know what to do with myself.. about to go to the gym and then beach... .seem to be sitting in a state of suspension.. want to do something but don't at the same time. - totally wasted yesterday and did nothing all day....Won't pick up a drink and keep saying the serenity prayer.....Just wanted to check in and say I hear you and understand... this is just going to be another of many firsts! Stay strong :) ..One day at a time 
Absolutely no better way to destroy the holidays than to pick up a drink.  .  .That's the truth although I'm sure your mind is telling you otherwise. .  .   
most aa meetings hold xmas potlucks this time of year go out and have yourself a bite to eat with other AA'ers.
