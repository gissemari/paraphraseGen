Good for you.... Its gets easier I don't even think or worry about it anymore. The desire to drink has been removed 
Time for a drink to celebrate!
Well done! I've avoided work Xmas parties for over 20 years in case I get shit faced and make a fool of myself. I'm hoping in years to come I can go sober without fear of drinking. 
Way to go!  Another living sober well lesson mastered.
Thanks to all of you for support. You are amazing!
