Hi everyone...When I first was trying to get sober I was in a treatment center for 3 months and did 90 meetings in 90 days with the occasional extra meeting per day. Once I got back home I was going to 5 meetings a week... then 2... then none. A few months later I fell off the wagon and relapsed. I only went back out for a couple of days before the reality of what I was doing hit me I called my sponsor and got my shit together...Since then though I've been going to a meeting every day again but sometimes I'm going to 3 or 4 meetings a day. I'm doing this because I feel safe there and boredom and loneliness are huge triggers for me so I need to keep myself busy. It's working so far...How many meetings do you normally go to? Did the number of meetings you go to change a lot as you progressed in your sobriety? I know I can't keep this up forever but I feel so fragile right now.

Sounds like you're doing the right thing then! .I went to outpatient rehab so it was pretty much like 90 in 90; thereafter I've been averaging 3 meetings a week. .It's been working for me but I could easily see upping it by one. I've been sober for 14+ months. I imagine when I've got some solid years under my belt I could go down to 1x a week. Lots of folks in my step study group are 1x a week folks. 
Great you keeping meetings up  i was something like you  but you seem to taper off as time goes by to what your happy with  i hammered the meetings at first got a Sponsor asked to slow down  it's a personal thing  i do 5 meetings a Week different times of the Day  Keeps me Sober  i could Never do it alone i just Love not all but Member's who gave there time to me i'll never forget those Guys who 12 stepped me 1987  My what an Adventure &amp; Journey  its been  I Thank you All 
In the last 13 years I've fluctuated between 2 a day (when I got sober the first time without going to treatment) to 3-4 a week to none (don't recommend this I relapsed and stayed out for a long time) to about 5-6 a week (was mandated to attend at least 3 a week after treatment) and right now I'm around 3-4 a week...Are you working the steps with your sponsor? I find that working a good program helps me to find the "right" number of meetings for me. When I'm in contact with my higher power involved in fellowship and doing service the answers are there for me if I'm willing to listen and that includes how many meetings I need to go to...Sounds like you know what you need right now and you're doing it. Work the steps maintain contact with your sponsor and stay "in the middle" of the fellowship and you'll know what you need to do.
4 or 5 a week at 7 years sober. ..&amp;#x200B;..Started out going every day then tapered down over the first 2ish years to going about twice a week. Did that for a while but really knew it probably wasn't enough so I picked it back up.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I'm sure I don't **need** to go to 5 a week but I'm also not really interested in finding out how few I **need** to go to and doing the bare minimum.  Seen too many horror stories happen that way...&amp;#x200B;..Sounds like you are doing the right thing going to as many meetings as you need to. Early sobriety is all about building a foundation. You'll know when you're ready to cut down a bit (hint: working the steps with your sponsor will likely have a lot to do with it). Also the more involved with other aspects of AA like service and fellowship will help a lot with the boredom and loneliness. It was uncomfortable for me at first but worth every bit of the effort it took.
5-6 a week for me.   The only way I know to find out the minimum I need to go to is keep cutting back until I drink;  I'll know that was too few.  
Typically four including the one I chair. I have the option of going to ten per week.
When I first started the program in September I was going to one a day then fewer then rarely around the holidays and ended up relapsing 3 weeks ago. I've been going to one a day ever since found a homegroup and looking actively for a sponsor now. It seems like a lot to go to a meeting every day but it's really only an hour and a half of my evening. If I can make time to work out or watch a few episodes on Netflix I can make time for meetings. 
Thanks for the answers everyone! I still feel a little crazy going to multiple meetings per day but if that's what it takes for me then so be it! 
Good you're doing what you need to do right now. Soon you'll OD on meetings and scale back. When new I went 5-6x a week kept 5x  until I was about 10. 4x until I moved to a non-English speaking country for some years with limited meetings. After returning to the US and turning 30 I keep a 1-2x schedule. If I get to turn 40 in a few years 1x should do me more if needed for emotional balance. YMMV.
My journey has been a bit different. I came into AA with a lot of trepidation and initially went to one meeting a week then two then three before finally getting a sponsor and doing a 90 in 90. I now go to five or six a week on average when I'm home and 1-2 when I'm traveling. I could go to more but I also have a full-time job a relationship friends and exercise to consider. Sobriety comes first but it isn't the only thing.
I usually do three meetings a week.  It's really hard to do any more than that with my schedule.  I'm 7.5 months sober.  When I first came into the rooms I did 3-4 meetings a week but I called my sponsor every day for those first two months.  I have a full time job and other responsibilities so it's hard to do a meeting a day and keep up with general life things.  Sometimes I think of going down to two meetings a week but I think I need that third.  I find three to be a sweet spot for me where I feel engaged with the program but I'm also able to have time for life duties non AA friends and family.  
I have 6 months and I'm on my third 90 in 90 :)
get a year under your belt do the steps in full.  once u have a year you can go 1-2 times a week for maintenance.  i went to 2-4 meetings a week for my first year. and honestly it was nice to learn and have sober network.  and actually find a higher power.
"Once I got back home I was going to 5 meetings a week... then 2... then  none. A few months later I fell off the wagon and relapsed." I hear this frequently from people who have relapsed. At nearly four years of sobriety I still go to meetings almost daily. Last week I had a bad day and went to three meetings that day.
One. I used to go daily at the beginning then I settled into a solid 4 per week for a couple years then 3 then 2 now it's my one for the past 6 months. I definitely feel less connected to AA but no closer to a drink. At 8 years sober I know how to live without picking up. I keep going to keep the lights on for the people getting sober now so they have one more meeting to hit up if they need them as much as I did when I was new.
