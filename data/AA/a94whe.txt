Hello friend yeah you I want to share that no matter where you are in your journey: whether you're reading to learn and understand thinking about getting sober recovering from a relapse in your early days of sobriety or many years in and still growing it DOES GET BETTER. Please keep that in mind when you are going through rough times. But it doesn't come magically. It takes willingness and some work! Doesn't have to be a ton of work just a little work. I've seen it happen this way for many many people. Don't give up it will be worth it. You can feel better. You are worthy and you deserve to be happy. Sending you much love.

Very well said indeed. Thank you for sharing.
I currently am hosting folks who drink and I'm early on in recovery.  I really want too but I know it doesn't help anything.  Thanks for sharing!!
Thank you 
5 years in and idk things just aren't happening. I won't blame AA but I'm disappointed how little life has come together despite all the work I've put in to it...If I knew it would have been like this I would have taken the overdoes...But I'm more of the exception I know of many others that have put together great lives. God favors some more than others apparently...So don't give up I'm soaking up all the shit so others won't have to.
