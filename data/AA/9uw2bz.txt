I had plans to post something much more thoughtful today since I have had this possible milestone on my calendar for a while now but alas today was spent working hard with my job (which wouldn't be possible but for recovery) and visiting my sick aunt in the hospital (which I probably would not have been present for if I were still drinking)...Either way today I am sober productive in society valued at my job respected by my colleagues trusted by my family and friends and none of that would have been possible except for AA...I am so thankful for the people who welcomed me into the physical rooms of AA back in late 2011 waited patiently while I stumbled around with many relapses gave me as many desire chips as I wanted and didn't ever judge me...Thanks to you all as well for continuing to show up.  **I am filled with gratitude today!**..Be blessed! :)

I needed to read this today. I've just gotten 60 days and the thought of 2500 days fills me with a fear that I've not felt in a long time. I have a sponsor and I'm trying to work steps but that doesn't make it any easier LOL. It's good to know that there's people out there stringing together thousands days! Sometimes I got to break it down minute by minute. Congrats!
Gratitude is so right!! Congrats.
Good job. Congrats. 
Awesome to hear...God is amazing...Congrats!
Nice job I didn't realize that I had hit another milestone last Sunday. It was just another day in sobriety.
