Can't get ahold of my sponsor tonight and the idea came to me to just post here. I've admittedly been complacent with step work over the last few weeks. Today at work I picked up a bar of xanax off the ground. I held it in my hand for 30+ seconds and had more than a fleeting thought of just popping it into my mouth. I snapped out of it and threw it away but it really freaked me out. I'm terrified of relapse and living in that fear has felt reassuring but this experience today solidified that I am only an arms length away from my next drink when there's too much of me between me and god. Faith without works is dead. Thank god I didn't choose to give up my sobriety date today.

Hey friend breathe. You're okay.   Compulsions are common they're okay too. Look at your fear and look at how you handled it! Some days where all we do is literally not put poison in our bodies are also GREAT days where we accomplished something. You're in a good place and reaching out is the best thing you can do. You've got this.       
If your a real alcoholic you've lost the power of choice to get loaded or not.  ..It's not surprising you slack off step work and nearly relapse.  Looks like you dodged a bullet.  Question is are you going to dive back in to the solution?
