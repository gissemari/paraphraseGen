I just watched this show about recovery kind of like intervention or whatever. This lady was literally knocking on deaths door 80 pounds lost her kids and was a hopeless addict. Her friend got her into detox then sober living and at like 20 days sober she was asked if she's going to stay sober. She said yes but "I'm not going to be all Bible thumper crazy like those AA's". At that moment I knew she was going to die. She did die. .My two best friends are both dead they came to AA but could never completely give themselves to this simple program. .It took me ten years in and out of AA before I completely gave myself to "God" and did the steps honestly. I should have died many times over before that happened. .I see it here in this sub and in meetings people so desperately hold on to their ego and their beliefs/non beliefs and "their" program. Our stupid fucking egos. You know that voice that says I know better than those AA people/big book that's your ego. . .We hold onto nothing in active alcoholism/addiction we are living in hell yet refuse to let go and COMPLETELY  give ourselves to this simple program. From the outside we can see the insanity in others but it's so hard to see in ourselves. . .When I came back after many years trying to get sober I'll tell you what happened. At my very first meeting back it was a big book step group. .  .We prayed " God please enable me to forget everything I think I know about you the twelve steps and alcoholics anonymous so I can have a new experience"..I believe that prayer was answered 9 years ago. I admitted I knew nothing maybe there is a God maybe I don't know shit maybe I should just shut the fuck up not listen to me and COMPLETELY give myself to the simple program. .I did and I got sober. (Joe and Charlie big book study audio did the steps in 6 weeks) .If you're reading this and you can't get sober or you're struggling to stay sober.....  .LET GO OF EVERYTHING YOUR EGO WILL KILL YOU. .  .Trust God clean house (the steps) and help others.... Its honestly as simple as that. . ."God" bless I pray that you all not only get sober but get serenity happiness and joy.

You're right. It is a simple program. You can take what u need from aa and leave the rest. I love the YouTube video called aa the seven selves. I'm almost 11 months sober cause of aa and honestly I love it. I call it a personal growth program where I learn. Took me a couple relapses to understand my disease but once I got it I got it.  Once we accept that something like addiction can kill...and accept the solution which is abstinence from a poisonous substance - we are free. It's very simple...it is 100% developed ego that gets in the way.  Essentially our egos contribute to our suffering. There are evil things more powerful than us...and amazing god like beautiful things more powerful than us. The greatest part is...we can choose a good greater power over evil every day.  It's that simple. :) we are complex creatures...but once we find a solution...we find a solution for eeeeverything. 
Thank you for sharing this. I needed to read this today.
Okay you said a lot but you didn't answer your question and I'm sure you know the answer because you have gotten past it......FEAR.......one of the most powerful motivators a human being can have and the reason we drink to try and keep it at bay...If i let go of everything then i have to trust that the person telling me to do it has an alternative one that is strong enough to combat the constant barrage of fears that my brain can tirelessly generate. This also explains why we do better when we are hopeless fears of dying and misery vs. the fears of losing all control...
The thing is braap I don't know a single person who practices this perfect program you are always on about and yet many many of them are sober/recovered and have been for years. From the very beginning there was so much contention and disagreement about how the program ought to be done and passed on that the notion of a purist foolproof method is complete fantasy.  We know only a little  and  more will be revealed  and  science may one day accomplish this  and so much recognition that AA as committed to text in the 1930s is *not* the final word and by Bill Wilson himself. ..Is there not even a bit of ego involved in telling people they are doing it wrong and they're going to die for it?
My huge ego is all over my Step 4. I was a 13 year old trapped in a 55 year old's body. ..I heard the phrase "emotional sobriety" a lot in my first week of meetings. I asked someone what that was about and they suggested that I listen to this...[https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/unpacking-bill-wilsons-1956-letter-on-emotional-sobriety/646446873](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/unpacking-bill-wilsons-1956-letter-on-emotional-sobriety/646446873)..If you haven't got an iTunes account you can read the text here. ..[http://home.earthlink.net/\~insure/emotional.html](http://home.earthlink.net/~insure/emotional.html)
I hear ya.  My ego nearly killed me.  I think of the ego as a parasite willing to kill the host to survive.  I read the Power of Now by Eckart Tolle and it didn't make any sense.  After getting sober and working the steps it makes perfect sense.  ..The irony is I have some regret about not getting help sooner.  But that is in the past not now.  And who's to say if I would have been ready.
It's possible that ego makes you think the program you ended up embracing is the best only? one. people need to embrace a program but if non religious programs were more common some of those anti-god people might not die.  don't blame their egos for not being able to surrender to aa if that was the only option presented.
&gt;  From the outside we can see the insanity in others but it's so hard to see in ourselves. ..Truer words were never spoken. ..Reread this post of yours but imagine it was someone else saying it about there alcohol addiction instead of you saying it about your Kratom addiction:..&gt; When I started to abuse it...  I'm dependent on it.....Get off that Kratom before it kills you man!..[https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/9nq8h5/stopped\_drinking\_thanks\_to\_kratom/e7o91u0/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/9nq8h5/stopped_drinking_thanks_to_kratom/e7o91u0/?context=3)
You cannot get rid of your ego u can only manage it
