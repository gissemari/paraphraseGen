I'm really fortunate in that I have a homegroup that has been meeting for over 50 years that has a ton of people in it with decades of sobriety.  We seem to attract people who are really serious about their sobriety and we have a lot of fun...&amp;#x200B;..I pick up two years next week which is unbelievable.  There's a guy that I met and hit it off with who came in about 2 weeks before I did and we've become friends.  He's someone I can lean on and vice-versa.  We're nothing alike but I love the guy and am always happy when we're at meetings together...&amp;#x200B;..He's been struggling lately.  His bottom was pretty bad and outside of still having his job he's lost most everything else.  A few months ago his legal stuff got settled and settled in his favor but in court that day literally after the judge banged the gavel a guy walked up and served him with divorce papers.  He's certainly no saint in regards to her but damn he'd spent 18 months making amends as much as he could and that was harsh.  He went out and got drunk that night but came right back in the next morning and jumped back on the horse- picked up a white chip and started over his stepwork. ..&amp;#x200B;..I was supposed to have dinner with him tonight.  He called me last night to postpone.  From a bar.  He's out and he ain't coming back this time.  The heartbreak in his voice was awful.  ..&amp;#x200B;..I also had a subordinate pull me aside yesterday to explain her recent absences and flightiness at work.  Turns out her husband is spiraling on booze and benzos and trying to detox himself.  He's doing some really dangerous shit and she's working full time while dealing with two children and one adult child who may or may not burn down the house while fucked up.  I was that person two years ago and I do not deserve the amazing woman who stuck by my side while I was recovering...&amp;#x200B;..Our disease takes down some good people.  I'm so very thankful for my sobriety and I wish others didn't have to suffer with our disease or from loving someone with it.  Take care of yourselves we're all we've got.

Thanks for your share! Keep up the good work! Sorry about your loss of a sober friend. 
Life can be so cruel and so sad. I hope that your friend finds his way back.
