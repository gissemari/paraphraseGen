As the dawn breaks and i trudge to my job i allow my walls to crumble and welcome my gods love. Each day i surrender to the fact that i am not just an alcoholic. I am a low down stinking drunk. ..I see my wife struggle with her disease and see my own ego and selfishness in her. It forces me to look at my own faults. She is my lover and partner but before that she was just another alcoholic in the room. And for that i am grateful.

I'm another run-of-the-mill alcoholic.  No more or less than any other.  Just trying to do my best one day at a time...Thank you for reminding me.
