Hope anyone reading this does too... without AA I seriously doubt that I'd still be alive. Thank God the madness of unchecked alcoholism is behind me and I pray it stays there. No matter how difficult each and every day is it's a blessing. If you're struggling with the craving today do whatever you need to do but make it though just another day just another hour another 10 min or even another minute if necessary. Reach out to people and take their advice. It gets better - please believe me. God bless
