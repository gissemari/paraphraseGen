its not fair what alcohol does to us. but the truth is we let it in to our house body and minds. its not going to leave unless we make it. we shouldn't have let the stray into the house but now that its here warm and comfortable its not going to leave easily. fuck it we will have to grab it by the ear lobe or belt loop and toss it out the door on to the street with little or no remorse. we need that bum out of here. he has to fend for himself. were not supporting him anymore. our time with that is done. we need to live our own lives healthy and free. a ball and chain is only going to drag us down to a lower depth than we've been before. where we never imagine we'd go. let's not shall we? let's live and do goodness.
