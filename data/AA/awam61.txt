So I have been sober 7.5 years or so and I have been struggling with something other than alcohol or drugs. But I'm having trouble actually conceding to my inner most self that it is a real problem in my life. Any tips or ideas are welcome.

Is there a program for that problem? If so maybe it would help to take a look at their literature.
r/slaa ?
There is sadly in my area no meetings or literature to my knowledge
Don't have a clue about what you're referring to. In order to share resources it would help knowing what direction to take...It's like telling someone  I want to take a trip can you tell me how to get there  without telling the person you are asking where  there  is. 
Lol well that's one way of looking at it. I'm not really  new though  I've been sober 7.5 years. Iust keep thinking of the line in the BB if when we want to stop we cannot quit entirely lol.amd I've watched many videos about the negative effects.
