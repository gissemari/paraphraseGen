I'm 16 years old and I just got back from rehab about two months ago. Things have gotten progressively worse since leaving rehab. I relapsed after being sober for 3 months. My cravings have gotten worse and I've considered doing harder drugs. I haven't been going to meetings and I don't even call my sponsor anymore. I'm scared about my future and depressed about my past because I lost the girl I loved. I've been considering suicide a lot lately. If anyone has any helpful advice or words that would be appreciated. Thanks.
