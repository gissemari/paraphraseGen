I've sponsored a handful of great women in my two years sober and understand through my relationship with my sponsor and working the 12th step that lines between sponsor / friend / mentor / parent get very blurred since many of us are naturally codependent people. ..I try my best to set healthy boundaries and ground rules like we all do but still when you're helping someone piece their life back together and encouraging rigorous honesty outside issues come up. ..I'm sponsoring someone who is in a relationship with someone she used with. They are both getting sober separately both through AA but in different towns for the time being. ..Their relationship is volatile even though they don't spend time together. Almost every day she asks me for advice on her relationship along the lines of "should I break up with him?" "I'm thinking about blocking his phone number" "should I change my email address and phone number?" "I think he's cheating on me. What do you think?" ..I've made it really clear to her that she needs to pray to her higher power for clarity on their will for her the power to carry that out and to be spiritually fit to make the right decision. I told her today that I can't make that decision for her since I'm not her higher power and can't take on that role but she keeps pushing. I think she wants the decision to be made for her. ..Last night she texted me after a bad conversation with her boyfriend that she was the closest she's been to relapsing. I had to talk her off the ledge like Sandra Bullock in Birdbox and tell her "if you use you will die". ..This relationship is clearly clouding her judgment and she's dedicating more headspace to this than seeking her higher power's will but I also know I can't take control of her life for her. ..What has been your experience dealing with something like this and do you have any helpful advice on how I can better help her connect with her higher power on their will for this decision?

You got to set boundaries. The same thing happened to me but in Reverse when I first got into the program I vented all of my relationship issues to my sponsor and he helps his best he could but it was obvious that he was Ill prepared before the mental unloading I was about to give him. Just listen don't respond with answers just listen
Have you discussed it with your sponsor?  Someone closer to you is likely to see it with a lot more clarity than us...&amp;#x200B;..Other than that set boundaries and stick to them as others have said.
Just tell her to shit or get off the pot. Lol 
Coming from a sponsee: my sponser never offered me advice or told me what to do other than pray and meditate. She did frequently advise me to take a pause and to allow myself the freedom to feel my new sobriety and insecurities intermingling. She would only offer her experience and never try to have it serve as a roadmap for mine. It was almost like a constant speaker meeting where when I was feeling really low and confused I could listen to her and know someone else had felt a similar pain. That shared experience gave me hope that I would get through it. It's terrifying for her and I can't speak to her clarity but I hope there is a way to communicate that it's okay to feel like this but just like trudging through sobriety an answer that appears in a moment without reflection and thought usually isn't the sound one. I learned to get comfortable with the feeling so once the immediate pain of my hurt was there but bearable I could make clearer decisions. Sorry don't know if that was clear. I hope you find a path that works
As part of the 4th step I suggest my sponsee create a sex ideal aka relationship ideal (see page 69 of the Big Book).  What do they think they really want?  What do they see as the best possible relationship for them? What does their behavior look like what does their partners behavior look like? Etc. I suggest they continue to ask their higher power to help them grow towards this ideal and once they have entered into a relationship I encourage them to compare what they are experiencing with their original ideal. Then they have something to refer back to rather than constantly coming to me.  Hope this is helpful. 
This is a big reason it's recommended to not get into a relationship in early sobriety. Although it is a difficult thing not to do
I don't have a lot of experience in this area but i have some that i think can help rather than give your opinion ask questions designed to pinpoint the sponsee's problems to her the fears that hold her back the self defeating decision patterns she may have help her to see them. It may sound a little like a psychiatrist but it is what she needs..." how does that make you feel?".." what do YOU think you should do?".."what is stopping you? "...It really helps if you understand yourself and your defects of character enough to point them right at their own but not tell them directly let them see it. This also has the "bonus" of scaring your sponsee away if they are not ready to face these things yet and since they are not getting the responses they want they will stop bugging you....I was in her position a long time ago and was trying to get my sponsor to make a decision for me it was a stage i had to go through to get where i am.
Do a relationship inventory with her if she really wants to get better. Other than that you do nothing. Focus on your side of the road - maybe find some compassion for her too. 
Experience strength and hope.  That's what we share.  Not advice.  We are not counselors..
Sponsees love to unload the responsibility of their lives and sobriety on their sponsors.. .All I do as a sponsor is help people understand the program I point then to where they should be in the book to eal with that issue. .  .I also share my experiences that relate to their problems. If I don't have a experience that is similar or relates I hook them up with someone who has had a similar experience or simply say I don't know unfortunately I can't relate. .  .I NEVER HIVE ADVICE.... THAT'S PLAYING GOD. .Yet so many "sponsors" do. .I make it very clear to my sponsees in the beginning that I am their AA sponsor I'm not their councilor psychiatrist relationship doctor bank or anything else. .   .Helping a new person understand the program helps them help themselves. As they say give a man/woman a fish feed him for a day teach him/her how to fish feed him/her for a lifetime. That's the goal here to help her help herself. . 
Relationships are tough. I try to stay out of it but ask if the relationship is bringing her closer to or further away from a drink. 
I would remind her that every single day and in every situation she has to put her sobriety first. Then ask her what she needs to do to make that happen. "I cant tell you what to do the only advice I can give is to make your sobriety the absolute first priority. What will be best for your sobriety?"
There are fellowships for this - https://slaafws.org..I have had sponsees try to defer their responsibility to me. .I can't make decisions for them and I never tell them what to do. 
Tell her to get a therapist. 
This program is all about relationships.  Relationship with alcohol relationship with higher power relationship with ourselves.  The same principles apply to relationships with others.  
Well they say to run everything by your sponsor. Their best thinking gets them drunk. .He's working the program. 
You can straight-up tell her "I've told you multiple times I can't give you relationship advice and you keep asking for it. For the next 30 days do not talk to me about your relationship. At all. If you bring it up I will remind you that I do not want to hear about your relationship and I will ask you to stop talking. If need be I will hang up the phone."
