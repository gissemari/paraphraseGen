So as some background I've struggled with an eating disorder for over a decade. For the past several months I've been bingeing and emotionally eating and its started to trigger some other nastier habits from my disorder. I've gained 30 pounds and I cannot seem to stop eating. ..Just recently I found that ephedrine can be taken to help with appetite suppressant. I am take one dose a day to help with my appetite so that I do not spend my entire day binge eating. It has helped so far but it has just occurred to me that maybe it is considered a slip. ..I am taking it solely for the appetite suppression and being careful to only take it once a day so as not to develop a pattern of abuse. I just feel so hopeless and horrible about my eating and I need some help to stop the bingeing. I will not be on it long term nor do I particularly enjoy taking it but its helping me to not binge. ..Do you think I've slipped off the wagon? I know everyone in AA has differing opinions I'm just anxious about preserving my sobriety while also making sure I do not land myself back squarely in my disorder.

&gt; everyone in AA has differing opinions..Ha yep just like the rest of the world! We're no diff.  ..So the thing is is for you to ask yourself of your motives. Which reads as you have. And solely from that reading your not drinking sobriety looks to be intact...I know zip about ephedrine such if or not can get a buzz off it get high you get the drift. Hence cannot comment other than with a quick googly find it is over-the-counter available without prescription. So there's that as a possible neutral benefit as far as sobriety? ..More important than any opinion is and since you do have question is have you spoken with and followed direction from your doctor?  For in A.A. we cannot nor should give out medical advice...Good on you for being concerned about your sobriety! And best to you...P.S. Just thought of this... Have you looked onto O.A. for over-eaters? Might be worth the effort?
If it doesn't have a mood altering effect I wouldn't see it as relapsing if taken in the circumstances you mention. ..I take low dose amytryptaline prescribed for insomnia and see no problem with that. I take it just before I go to sleep at night so I can get drowsy and fall asleep. No other noticeable effect on my mood and I have never yet felt tempted to start abusing it. ..It's about what feels right for you though. For instance I have heard others here who smoke weed and feel this doesn't jeopardise their sobriety whereas for me that would be a disaster and definitely constitute a relapse. ..Sorry you've got all this going on. I also struggle with an ED. I'd been eating normally for years and it started getting bad again within a couple of days of stopping drinking. That's how closely the two substances are linked to my need to self medicate &amp; self sabotage. ..I'd personally see the binge eating as closer to addictive behaviour/ relapse than taking meds to treat it.
