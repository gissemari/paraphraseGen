Today I'm sober and I have been sober for a year.  I had 3.5 years when I relapsed and went to the mental ward of the hospital for suicidal thoughts and panic.  I am so grateful for the program and so grateful that I am developing a relationship with a higher power.  I'm so grateful that I don't have to be alone or afraid any more.  I'm so grateful that I'm (slowly) learning how to be honest with myself my sponsor and my higher power with tools like writing prayer meetings and sharing.  I was miserable in meetings for years.  Years!  I'm so happy I came back and I'm happy I'm finally getting over myself.  I'm a real piece of work but that's ok and my higher power is changing me.  What a miracle!

I'm grateful that you submitted this post! I shared at a meeting this morning about writing a list of all the ways God has intervened in my life. This was suggested to me after I told a girl I was REALLY struggling with the God thing. I got goosebumps as memories came to me. And you know what? I'm just happy - I'm grateful! Grateful for the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and what an opportunity it is. 
Glad I'm not the only "piece of work" here. Glad you're here.
