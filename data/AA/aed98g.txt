After so many attempts to get clean and sober I think I'm actually ready to do it. I'm tired of blacking out. Stealing to provide for my habits. Lying to everyone. So I'm putting all of my effort into becoming clean and sober. ..I've been struggling with drugs and alcohol abuse since I was 15. I made half hearted attempts to get better but they never stuck. I found some meetings to go to; they're all a bit of a drive but I think it's what I need. ..If anyone has any good suggestions for me to help stay on track I'd really appreciate them. Thank you.

If you are just starting out I'd recommend that you..Get a sponsor this week.Do the steps with help from your sponsor .Get a home group when you find somewhere you like...There is more to it but people who do these things immediately from my experience succeed...Alcohol is cunning baffling and powerful so it's particularly important to connect with someone as soon as you can who can help make it less baffling and show you what they did to find a solution.
The recipe for success is 90 meetings in 90 days get a sponsor and work the steps.  
Dont drink between meetings. Also keep going to meetings. What people say in the meetings wont always ring true compared to your own experience but you will hear a lot of what you CAN relate to so hold on to all the great things you hear that might apply to your life
