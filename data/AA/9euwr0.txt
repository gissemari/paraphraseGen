Its not worth it.  You have made it this far what is another day.  It will only get better with time.  Gets some group support its easier knowing many people out there are going through exactly the same thing.  
You're in the right place. We were talking about this yesterday at my morning meeting. It's part of the grieving process some say  I think it's life. We all have bad days. You don't put down the drink and suddenly life is wonderful. Life still happens. But what you said about booze numbing your feelings or something like that. That's true now everything is raw you're feeling all those emotions. Getting sober ain't easy but it's worth it. If you tend to it daily you only go through it once. Keep trudging. 
Hopefully by your sharing it will ease some of the struggle. Stay with us. Things will get better you will see!
