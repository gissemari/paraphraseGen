Good stuff. Are you working a program alongside attending meetings? That's where I (eventually)got relief. Keep coming back. I wish you well. 
Yes indeed. It sure does.  
Way to go! An old timer in my home group told me when I got 90 days that  the first three months were harder than the first thirty years.  Keep coming back!
That's awesome! 
That is such a huge milestone achievement.  Way to go!  Much physiological healing has taken place and new habits and patterns are beginning to take hold.  During the next few months my mental obsession with drinking was completely removed and I haven't had a troubling thought about drinking in the 15 years since.
Nicely done OP!
Congratulations 
Congratulations on your 90 days
