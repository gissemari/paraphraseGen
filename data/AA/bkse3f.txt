I pinky promise you are not a failure. It's ok to feel like that you are experiencing very normal feelings try to let it pass because it does not define you. A mistake doesn't define you.

I truly hope so because you deserve all the tenderness and understanding in the world right now. ..Steps no matter how small are still steps.
