Whether it's in this thread PM's a chat service on the phone...I just need help right now. I'm really scared for myself and my life is in shambles. I need short term guidance until I can get to a meeting tomorrow. Please.

Im here powerless over alcohol 67ish days sober for the first time in 20years  willing to listen!
dude i just saw this but i'm going to sleep but i want you to know i care about you. my advice is if you can't get a convo going with anyone get on youtube and listen to the big book audio book or listen to a speaker. searching aa speaker relapse or aa speaker hope or something like that might help. and if your like me you might find it easier to listen to if you speed up the playing time to 1.25 or 1.5. you can process speech faster than people can talk so listening to books or speakers at a faster speed will help your mind from getting too bored. idk that might just be me tho...good luck hope your meeting goes well and hope to see you here again.
Just dont pick up a drink before that meeting. Do you have any numbers you can call from the meetings you've been going to? 
Pour out any remaining booze and get any sleep you can manage. Consider what your life could be without drinking over the past mistakes you've made due to your drinking...Fresh start today.
What shambles are you referring to my friend?
What's going on?
