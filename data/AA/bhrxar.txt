By the time I was 23 I had 4 years sober through AA. The last 4 years have been spent mostly sober but with about 8 relapses. I didn't want to go back to AA but this last time I surrendered. Nothing else has worked for me I tried the  easier softer  ways and it never worked. ..Now I have 25 days and just feel grateful that I am not alone in this. I struggle with isolating but every time I speak with someone else in the program I walk away feeling hopeful and grateful. I travel 80% of the time for work and need to get better and getting to meetings on the road but wow it's nice knowing I have this free powerful resource everywhere I go. Thank you to all those who came before me

Congratulations! Keep coming back  
Well done on 25 days. If you just Google AA and town city you are in you will find them. ..Use here also. It is my big help today. ..Take care John.       
Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
Phone apps that give meetings based on location could be cool for your travels.  Good luck!
