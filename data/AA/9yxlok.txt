Have been sober many years and am at home taking care of a relative 24/ 7.  I can only get to meetings two or three times a week.   Most of the posts I've browsed here  seem solid.). Any pointers on how best to use this site to help  newcomers who are struggling?  Yes I help a few sponsees but  still need to reach out more some days. Thanks!

Hello! This form is nice for giving experience strength and hope asking questions  to a wider AA audience. Newcomers and those struggling sometimes ask for help. Also for directions to a meeting..A warning Trolls exist here too. 
I am Responsible..When Anyone Anywhere.Reaches Out For Help.I Want The Hand Of A.A..Always To Be There...And For That.I Am Responsible !
In addition to answering questions about AA and sobriety in response to posts you can offer that newcomers contact you by private message if they choose to in order to share more privately...
Helping others has kept me sober. I have worked with some amazing people from Reddit. 
I try to only speak from my experience on here sometimes I want to respond to posts with my opinion but I probably shouldn't because that is outside of my experience. People also post interesting articles or just general A.A. information and topics on here so posting isn't reserved for newcomers necessarily.
I am so happy to hear you what to help others through this online resource! I have noticed that brand new people get up the courage to post here as they're very very first way of admitting they have a problem to someone. Therefore I try to encourage them and share what's worked for me.
