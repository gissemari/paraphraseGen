I joined because my mom has been an alcoholic majority of her life and never faced the truth until last August. She went a good 6 months but I'm in college so she's there with my stepdad and younger brother. My stepdad is an alcoholic and an absolute ass when he's drunk and won't admit it. He controls all the finances and is an egomaniac. I found out my mom relapsed on my birthday in March from my younger brother. Last night I confronted her. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm behind are all the way but she needs to make changes. They are toxic together. She mentioned a divorce and I fully pushed for it. It's sad she has to ask him for money and I found out she had been off her mental heath medication for two weeks because she couldn't afford it. I'm sorry I needed some place to rant. I'm going to be a junior in college and just want the best for my mom and brother. On a good note Happy Derby 2019
