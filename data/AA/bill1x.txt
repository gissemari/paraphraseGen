I struggled. I took drugs. I stay in an abusive relationship. I fight to go to each and every meeting. I am proud of the 5 months I didn't drink. Lesson learned. I gave in and got exactly what I thought I would. Physically and emotionally sick. I am disappointed I don't need to beat myself up. Today is a new day.

The only 2 things we MUST do.....Go to meetings.Don't drink between meetings..When I wanted to drink I went to more meetings. Less time to drink. ..Get back up on that horse.
Do you have a sponsor?  What step were you on!
It really just wasn't the same. Getting drunk made me sick. It didn't give me the escape I thought I needed. I NEED to get out of this abusive relationship. Create a support system and use it. I want to build a life that is worth living and I don't need or want alcohol to do that.
And in the beginning......I hav found a sponsor or two worked the steps and had the spiritual experience.
