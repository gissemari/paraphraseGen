This was my first sober New Years and I got through it and you can too. Love and support to all struggling tonight.

Same here!  I haven't had a sober NYE since before I started drinking.  I went to a meeting earlier this evening and now I'm in PJs on my couch and enjoying some reddit.  Looking forward to not waking up with a hangover! 
Same you will thank yourself tomorrow morning. This is the hardest thing I've ever done. I feel good about myself for doing so though which outweighs the urge.
"got through it". .I remember that now I enjoy it and not drinking isn't a struggle it's normal and what I enjoy. . .It gets easier congrats 
Congrats! It gets easier I promise! This year I had looked forward to just relaxing and eating good food rather than obsessing about a drink! You got this!
