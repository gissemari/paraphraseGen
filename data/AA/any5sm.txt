I was 5 days sober &amp; I just relapsed. I'm still drunk &amp; im terrified about the regret &amp; self-hatred I will feel tomorrow. How do I deal with this? I live in a small town &amp; there is no A.A I'm 21 &amp; just recently started binge drinking(3 months ago?). I know I have a problem so I go to therapy once a week out of town (1 1/2 hr away). I am really looking for people who understand me despite having great friends they don't understand what I'm going through.

I understand what you're going through. I had 54 days and I relapsed. It's ok. It is ok. Start fresh that's all we can do buddy one day at a time 
Message me if you need someone to talk to man
I'm sorry you are struggling. I would prefer chatting with you when you are sober so I hope you will come back when you are. ..You are so young. Is it possible you could move to a larger community where you would have support? ..Check out also /r/stopdrinking. 
It's okay. Just try again tomorrow.  Does the town where your therapist is have an AA chapter? Or your therapist might know where there is one.
You should message me. I was a young person who got sober so I can relate. Don't drive and don't hurt yourself or anyone else tonight. Tomorrow is a new day. Tonight does not define you nor is it the be all end all. 
Its not a complete substitute but I'm on an AA focused discord that is active almost 24/7 and hosts virtual meetings. It's the only aa I've done this year and it works well for me. Let me know if you're interested and I'll PM you an invite 
\&gt; im terrified about the regret &amp; self-hatred I will feel tomorrow. How do I deal with this?..You deal with it by \*feeling\* that regret that self-hatred. There's no easy way around it but that's what it takes. If we run from or mask our feelings they'll only be there waiting later. The good news is that nobody ever died from a feeling overdose. :)
