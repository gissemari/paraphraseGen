If you could help your friends and family understand what you're going through would you?..Supporting my husband through the depths of addiction was eye opening and life changing for me. Since then I've been on a mission to make sure friends and families are armed with evidence-based information resources skills and support to support a loved one wrestling with addiction...So instead of me saying to my husband "stop using then we'll figure all the other life problems out" or expecting that 30 days of rehabs solves the world's problems we'd have more reasonable and evidence-based expectations as well as the skills to help...I wonder if you'd consider inviting your support network (your friends and family) to an early beta new Q&amp;A site for Friends and Families with a loved one struggling with addiction. Research shows that connection is the opposite of addiction but today we don't know how to connect with you in the best ways possible...The whole idea is that when it comes to addiction there are evidence-based best practices which we can lean on professionals to learn about and there's even more knowledge we gain from personal experience that today is not captured anywhere for others to learn from. This new site covers both...We aim to make friends and families the best allies to you and we're looking for any feedback on how we can make it better. Would you consider sharing this with a few of your support network? ..My ask: pick just 3 people who you want to 'get it more' and please pass it on: [https://community.wethevillage.co/](https://community.wethevillage.co/)

Same post made to over ten subreddits which is self promotion oriented- you are a spammer please go away.
Why are you spamming these subreddits?  We are tired of looking at you.
