Is it a relapse?
----------immediate responses--------

They aren't alcohol. The only requirement for AA is a desire to stop drinking. If you aren't drinking it's not a relapse. ..On the other hand it is risky to take pills when you aren't sure what is in them. Perhaps a cup of coffee would have the same result. 
Are you using them to change the way you feel? Are they cutting you off from the sunlight of the spirit? Are you using them to fulfill some internal need/to treat your internal discomfort? If so you may want to pick up a desire chip and get honest...With real alcoholics when the internal condition goes untreated we do not recover and we will drink again and for us to drink is to die. The problem centers in the mind so if I have the mind of an un-recovered alcoholic and I am using chemicals to alter my internal state so I can cope with the world around me I am likely still operating on my own will my own power my own thinking. I am without defense against the first drink until I recover from that state of mind and body. ..Recovery is possible. Happiness fulfillment the complete lack of the obsession to drink and use. An internal comfort where that big empty hole inside my brain that begs to be filled with chemicals has been filled with a power greater than myself. This is not magical thinking. This is the direct result and only purpose of Steps 1-9. 
To thine own self be true.
