Everyone who I've talked to says it's normal but damn are these dreams terrifying.
----------immediate responses--------

I'm almost 4 years sober and I still occasionally have dreams of finding so much dope that I just have to relapse..Then I wake up and go through my daily reprieve and I am good..It's scary. It's the price we pay to live sober.
Know exactly what you mean! They scare me too. The positive I try to pull out of it is they give me a fake way to experience what it would be like to drink again then a firm resolve that I dont want to go there.
I just had one last night. Almost 1.5 years sober and I still get these dreams. I know how you feel. I woke up with so much guilt. Its scary. I wish I knew something that would help
I used to get them nearly every single night. It was awful.
I hate them. But they're an excellent mini-step 1 for me.
I've heard people say  I call that a freebie. ..Not me I agree they are the fucking worse.  The only good thing about it is that it makes you really appreciate your sober life and how hard you've work to get it.
