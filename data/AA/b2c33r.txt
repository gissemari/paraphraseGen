Hello everyone! ..Today is my first year sober! I have been drinking off and on since i was 8 years old started drinking heavy when i was 16 after 21 i was basically drinking a fifth a day at least. Im 26 now and last year it all became too much and i quit drinking and started going to NA(i did other drugs too so NA was a better fit for me). ..Today is march 17th and i now have a year sober. Alcohol is a beast but when you stop feeding it life gets so much better...To anyone still struggling i just want to say this: you may not be able to see it now but life DOES get better when you work on it. You ARE worth it and you CAN do it. ..I love you guys! Thanks so much for making my life possible! Keep up the hard work!
