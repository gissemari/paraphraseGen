I'm getting close to 2 years myself. I just keep going to meetings. Wherever they are in the World they are always happy to see another alcoholic. 
Very well done!

Congrats! My friend likes to call us the  Class of 2011  - March 15 is my 8th!
Congrats! We share a birthday!!! I'm 7 today
I hope I make it to 8 years. I've been sober since September of 2017. I caught myself thinking about whiskey the other day which is kinda scary. I don't go to meetings don't have time. God I hope I don't ever drink again. 
8 years is a lot of letting go. Keep at it!
