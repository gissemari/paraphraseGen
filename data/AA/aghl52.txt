I'm sitting at my dining room table with bits and pieces of my fourth step completed. My mind keeps wondering and I reeeaaaallllly want to be on my couch watching tv. But I promised my sponsor I'd stop procrastinating (after about 3 months) and just get it done! So it may not be the best moral inventory ever but it's mine and I'll be done after tonight (at least with this first one). No more Reddit until I'm done and honestly I hope to be in awe of all this junk I'm letting go of rather than online. ..If I can do it so can anyone else who is struggling or procrastinating!

A modified pomodoro technique helps me with procrastination on many issues. I set a timer for ten minutes and for ten minutes I promise myself I will work diligently on the task at hand. Usually the timer goes off and I keep working because once I'm really working on something I have momentum working for me...Getting started is hard for some projects because I picture them as ongoing anguish...Some other projects I do need to have to-do lists and even a sequence planned out...My fourth step did involve to-do lists and the pomodoro technique for getting it done in a reasonable period of time. Different issue but pomodoro is also how I get my apartment almost clean and tidy sometimes.
