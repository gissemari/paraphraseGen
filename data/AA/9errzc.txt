 No one here can accurately answer this. I'd see my doctor. There are over the counter products to help with sleep. 
Maybe talk to a psychiatrist for a non-addictive sleep med. I didn't sleep for more than an hour a night for a few weeks when I first got sober so mine put me on a pretty high dose of remeron after I had a breakdown from sleep deprivation. She then weaned me off as I started sleeping better. ..Since then exercise or anyway to wear myself out during the day helps me sleep immensely. Alcohol is a depressant so taking that away after abusing it can take some time for your brain to adjust back to normal. But it will. ..Good luck
