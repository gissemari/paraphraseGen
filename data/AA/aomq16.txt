Hi everyone. One month ago I made a post about relapsing after 7 months. I felt so much shame and was very depressed. ..Today I picked up my one month chip! I feel much better than I did on day one. I know there is a lot of work to be done but I'm much more optimistic...Thank you for all the support

I'm happy to hear an glad to hear. I'm about 4-5 days sober and was thinkin of drinking tonight however I thought if all the work I did meditating an feeling good an how I would feel in the morning if I did drink...So I'm going to abstain longer by developing healthier coping mechanisms an just breath through it...Reading your post in a way helped me by trying to think of where I could be in a month if I didn't drink...So thank you for that and stay strong remember you inspired somebody tonight.
Happy birthday!
Great to hear  the best day's lay ahead  take care 
Yes! Please keep posting your progress!
Congratulations. Keep coming back!
Congrats!! You give me hope!! I will hit my very 1st 5 month mark in my life soon and I'm still terrified...i feel like this is my only shot at life and if I relapse I will likely never get sober again. I know I should focus on what could go right not what could go wrong. And only take it day by day. Glad you made it back safely!!
Keep fighting for the good life friend as many times as we fail we gotta keep trying! Happy for u.
