.I'm so humbled by all this day means to me...10.17.03 was the darkest day in my life so far.  It taught me that its truly darkest before the dawn.  ..I thought a lot about this post this year because I manage a team now and wonder how this will be received...but I'm proud of this day.  The shame and sadness is something that drives me...to one day at a time change my life completely.  Life has so many twist and turns...I never thought I'd be living in Seattle married and loving wonderful step children...but here I am.  I love my parents/family more than ever and appreciate the gifts each day holds...its not a perfect experience but its mine &amp; for that I'm grateful...If you or someone you know is struggling with addiction of any kind I'm here to listen  go to a meeting with you or whatever you need. There IS a solution. You don't have to feel that miserable feeling that I know so well...
