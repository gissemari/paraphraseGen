Today marks my one week back. I had 6yrs of good sobriety I ended up relapsing for 2.5yrs. I knew I had to get back to the program  as I was getting worse by the week. This  disease is going to put me into the ground sooner or later. I am thankful to be back. Now to work my program and pull my head out of my ASS!!!

Great job on coming back!  Hearing/reading stories like this helps me feel reassured that AA will always be around for me and that no one is past the point of redemption.
Congratulations and welcome back!! Desperation drove me to the rooms 90 days ago for the first time and I have never felt more hopeful. I'm excited to go get my coin today! I'm going to keep coming back. I hope you will too.
Glad you made it back. ..Do you have a sponsor?  What step are you on?
