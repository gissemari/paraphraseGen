I had three plus years and relapsed horribly. It took me almost two years to come back. Now I have almost 9 months and when i see people getting their coins and celebrating api can't help but think I would of had four plus years by now. ..But on the plus side I learned a lot from that relapse and it made my sobirety stronger I didn't get into much trouble or get a dwi.

Woulda coulda shoulda go smell the damn roses and get on with your life. 
Don't dwell didn't mean to offend you. I was merely getting to the point. Enjoy today  and stop examining the woulda  coulda  shoulda it does you no good. It's great to be sober this moment. Oh and I do talk this way at meetings you get no where if everyone is afraid to say boo. Move on. 
Congrats for 4yrs and 9mths /u/Breezy834! I'm so glad you made it back; many don't. ..Stay focused on today. Acceptance is everything. 
I'd have a bigger number on my chip too if I would have got sober sooner.  It took what it took.  ..It's quality not quantity that counts.
