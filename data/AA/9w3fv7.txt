Armistice Day 1934 was Bill W's last relapse from Pass It On pp. 109-111.  He called it the beginning of his last debauch.  It's a cool story about the insanity.  His last drink was about one month later on Dec 11.

As far as you know it was his last relapse.   ..But he did insist on getting whiskey when he was on his death bed which was not provided to him (again as far as we know).  
I believe there is a recording of him talking about that relapse on the day Bob died.  There are some folks that believe this was a voice actor re-enacting the real speech but here it is: https://youtu.be/jmxqwFoBv2c
*My Name is Bill W* is a wonderful movie.
