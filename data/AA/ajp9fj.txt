 ..I've been having a bit of a rough week. Went back to therapy after a  break  and coming down from a relapse of weed alcohol and benzo's. Dealing with some past and present pains. ..&amp;#x200B;..Have been going to a meeting again every day since Saturday (last drinks   wine to cheer me up and then tequila to knock me out   and benzo was Friday night) and slowly have been feeling better. I know it will take a bit more before the benzo brain will be gone but i'm dealing with it thanks to the help of some fellows who are general addicts too and have been seeing my psychiatrist again who makes me call every 3 days to check up about me abusing meds (he's not prescribing me benzo's anymore i got them while on holiday in a country you can get them over the counter they're all gone now). I poored my stash away and erased phone numbers of dealers. ..&amp;#x200B;..I have some issues with sharing (in general life and in the program) i find it hard to do but i'm doing my best lately. I could not share today since a lot of people wanted to share and i'm not quick enough so i thought making a post to get it out of my mind. It's not what i've wanted to share today but i think i need to share this and i'll just message my sponsor about my other worry. ..&amp;#x200B;..I've been in the program since May and the longest i've lasted is a month. I really want to get better but there is some part of me still fighting the program. I'm trying to get rid of it and have finally been taking some steps i refused to take before i've been reading the literature again and i'm trying to take better care of myself. ..&amp;#x200B;..It's been a bit rough since i'm going through some kind of heartbreak it's not that bad i just miss the person i like a lot and we can't see each other since it's affecting our mental health (anxiety and with me my sobriety too). I can't relate to friends about the whole situation since they don't get/know the sobriety-anxiety part of it and i can't share about it in the program since i went against the suggestions (don't get involved in any type of romantic relationship in early sobriety) and  we told you that was a bad idea  or  that's just what addicts do  i got when talking about being involved with someone to fellows did not help much. I've been feeling both anxious and guilty about not finding anybody to completely and honestly share this with. ..&amp;#x200B;..We stopped seeing each other and have gone from texting throughout the day to hardly anything at all. I miss him a lot. I'm usually a very direct person about everything besides the typical addiction parts of me and the "trauma's" from my past but i can't seem to muster the courage to talk about this. Only one friend knows but she does not know i'm an addict so i feel she only knows half of the story.

Had a sponsee that lied to me about a relationship. I knew he was lying said nothing at the time and let him go ahead and spin the tale. ..Mentioned it a couple of years later. He hung his head but I thought it was really pretty funny. Was best man at their wedding both are still sober many years later..
