For those of you that have been in my position how did you decide rehab was/wasn't for you?
----------immediate responses--------

I know rehab isn't for me cause I only relapsed one night and no rehab is gonna take you for one night. You need to be constantly drinking. Rehab is a really good place to go.
Inpatient rehab is a great choice for a variety of reasons. It takes you away from everything in your life that is causing you/allowing you to drink and it takes you away from anything and everything that is distracting you from focusing on not drinking. You are in a controlled environment with a strict routine. You focus on what addiction is and how to deal with it basically all day with facilitated discussions and stories from people who are also suffering and looking to change.  Every place is different but in general I'd say that's the gist. ..Really only you can decide. I had to take a big step and get away or I knew I'd keep going because that had been my pattern for so long. Have I relapsed after? Yes. But not nearly as much and it gave me a lot of knowledge resources and wisdom. It's a very personal decision... you're considering?
