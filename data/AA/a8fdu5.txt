I think it would be better at this point to focus on getting to meetings finding a home group and getting a sponsor. Your time will be better spent doing that so that in the future you will be able to help people directly. 
The best idea is to get a sponsor and work the steps.  ..Nobody really needs the wisdom of a 10 day wonder.  You can't give away something you haven't got. 
Dude.  We have a tradition of personal anonymity at the level of press radio and films.  That means we remain anonymous at the public level not polish our egos on youtube.  ..Get a sponsor work the steps and learn about the traditions.  And get a fucking shirt.  
Your track record speaks for itself in your dealing with your problems your way.  
It is absolutely awesome that you are thinking of how to help others. .  .When I was ten days sober I was still detoxing and far from achieving sobriety. I concentrated on listening and learning from the big book and others at meetings on how to stay sober.  .   . At ten days sober I needed to listen and learn not teach and talk. .   .Congrats on ten days that's a great start .
