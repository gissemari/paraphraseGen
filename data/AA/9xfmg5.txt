Hello everyone! 148 days sober here.. So I will provide the link to the episode which talks about this but I wanted to share it with reddit specifically and actually write about it because it helps get it out of my head!! So yesterday I was having a great day/morning and I got to the gym and ran into a old best friend of mine who still drinks and smokes. He has been my friend since middle school I ended up working out with him then grabbing lunch.. I offered to buy lunch because he has a 36ft fishing boat that I used to go out on and really have been wanting to go on and thought this would increase my chance... we dont talk much but anytime we see each other its like nothing has changed except i am sober and he has a girlfriend and a ton of money and doesn't have to work.. I am grateful and have a pretty well off financial situation but nothing like his.. I really do care about this persons well being but I think its more of a SELFISH defect trying to go on his expensive boat and fish and be able to say i went on it... GOING ON THE BOAT in the past has lead to relapse when i was not quite ready to get sober. Either way I have another friend in Colorado who is actually a very caring person and always had been there for me no BS He lives out in VAIL and Denver and i always go visit during spring break and get fucked up for 8-10 days but i simply cannot do that this next year but really do enjoy when we are snowboarding and hanging out... It is just these people were really my (homies/brothers) and i dont have friendships like that since getting sober.. its just different. Thankyou for listening to me rant! ..&amp;#x200B;..[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJIANv0Gc9o&amp;lc=z23gyfw4lknnsxamjacdp43avx0vmfc5l3jhswnrc35w03c010c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJIANv0Gc9o&amp;lc=z23gyfw4lknnsxamjacdp43avx0vmfc5l3jhswnrc35w03c010c)..&amp;#x200B;..[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ys-episode-4-weekend-i-stopped-using-old-friends-routine/id1441135047?i=1000423865543&amp;mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ys-episode-4-weekend-i-stopped-using-old-friends-routine/id1441135047?i=1000423865543&amp;mt=2)
