So I'm(26f) an alcoholic. I've been struggling and it is a roller coaster. Often when I get drunk I get aggressive and have frequently taken it out on my long term boyfriend (27m). Plus I'm not really 'there' when under the fog of alcohol. I haven't been able to go longer than a week sober.. as you can imagine it is taxing on our relationship. He has depression that developed in part at least bc of my addiction and how I treat him drunk. It's gotten to the point I feel like I no longer have support or can't really ask him for support because of treating him badly and his depression.  I hate how I have treated him. I've let him know many times. I still try to. I just also feel I can't live my life constantly being contrite and putting myself down for my actions. I want to take responsibility and try and move forward together. ..Am I being unfair? How much should I even expect from him? Do I even deserve to push forward and attempt happiness when I've hurt him so much? Any advice would appreciated.

Al Anon. 
Focus on getting well yourself. You can't be a loving mature trusting partner if you are still enmeshed in alcoholism. Look for support where you are more likely to get it such as AA meetings and therapy. ..What he does is up to him. 
Pretty simple get sober and stay sober.
