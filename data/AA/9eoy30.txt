Hello. You can call me by my username. I'm 22 years old and I've been struggling with alcohol since I was 16.  It started as fun with friends but as I got older I started drinking more and more and especially by myself. I had a lot of terrible accidents(none vehicular just personal injury from falling) and arguments one even ending a 5 year friendship all fueled by alcohol. Like many alcoholics the habit/addiction runs deep in my family history. ..My mother drinks a few beers everyday and my father passed at 41 a drug addict and brutally heavy alcoholic all his life...Now the point I'm at is this: I'm engaged with the love of my life and I've nearly completely squandered it all in one fell swoop of drunkenness.  She gave me a chance though my only option is to sober up. It's been a full week now and I haven't had a drop. In my area/age range it seems like everyone thinks alcoholism is a non-issue. Like only people who drink every day at 5am and lose their job are actual alcoholics...But as someone who is functioning but feeling myself slipping I'm getting sick of that mentality and I just want to get clean.  I feel like my life is in my hands but I'm looking for more support since the only person that truly understands me is my fiance. All my friends drink my family all drinks and none of them really understand it's an issue. So I came here.  ..So yeah a week since my last drink.

As a 37 year old male who was raised around alcohol almost everyone I know drinks social events based around drinking...let me tell you your fiance is a gift. Don't stop drinking for her though. Stop drinking for you. Stop drinking to the be the best version of yourself you can be. Do it now. Stop drinking to break the cycle to save money to save your health (mental and physical) to be a better human. Alcohol for me leads to a rabbit hole of bad compromises excuses and a slippery slope towards a less meaningful me.
I can relate to your story. I am 34 &amp; I got sober at 22. When I was 22 my mind would tell me that I wasn't an alcoholic. After all I never had any legal trouble I never wrecked a car &amp; I was a recent college graduate from a good university. But I knew in my gut that it was a problem. I was drinking everyday lying about it hiding bottles having the occasional morning drink &amp; some of my friends were telling me I should cut back. ..&amp;#x200B;..Well I got fired from a job &amp; one of my coworkers convinced me to go to an AA meeting with him. There I listened to people tell me about their drinking &amp; I could totally relate. Most of them had lost a lot more than I had but that wasn't the point. The point was that I could relate to how they thought about alcohol &amp; their relationship with it. I could relate to that mental process that causes an alcoholic to pick up a drink when he knows he shouldn't. The only difference between the 22 year old me &amp; the 40 year old drunks in that meeting was time. I am glad that I have spent the last 12 years sober. I know that if I had kept drinking my life would be a mess. If you have never been to an AA meeting I encourage you to check it out. It's free &amp; the people there are pretty cool. You have nothing to lose. Depending on where you live they may have AA meeting specifically for younger people.
