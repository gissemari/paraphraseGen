Hi ...I'm new to this and just need some advice ...my bf has been a on off alcholic for 10 years ...I've been wuth him 2 ...9 months ago he went to rehab got sober ....last night he relapsed after we argued.....I'm pregnant and the minute so he's a bit stressed....the problem is wuth him ...it's just me n him ...he's no friends as all his friends drink and he hasn't told them he's a alcholic ....He really needs some sober friends but for a guy to find friends who don't drink is very difficult ...he loves football but won't play as they all go to pub after ...im desperate for him to make some friends but not sure how I can help him....any advice welcome

Are there AlAnon meetings in your area?  My kindest suggestion is to take care of yourself and your little one by attending AlAnon.
Does he go to Alcoholics Anonymous? Pretty good place to make friends. 
I will show him this thanks 
Keep coming back
Alanon.
