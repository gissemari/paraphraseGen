I've struggled with alcoholism for years. I am 24 years old and a my wits end. I had 7 months sober but recently relapsed and am in a living hell right now. I really need help. I'm asking anyone out there to help me pay for my treatment. I need a deposit CA for a bed at the orchard recovery centre in British Columbia on Monday. Please if anyone has the means to help me pay I will be forever in your dept and will pay you back. I know this is a shot in the dark but I have some hope. Thank you for reading this.
