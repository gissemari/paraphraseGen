Hi all..I can't find any topic about anonymity of AA when it comes to my loved ones (family) .In my case they know about me being a member. But what about when I'm talking about my new friends? They're not stupid and realize the friends are members too. ..I wouldn't tell about their personal struggle or anything like that but more like " I met this great guy Mike about my age with similar story" or "my sponsor is 20 years older than me and his name is insertname" or "you know that actress talking about her sobriety in media? Met her often at a meeting" ..So my question is should I just not talk about the new found friends or sponsor?.. If I had a wife she might get jealous if I'm going out with people I can't tell her anything about like sex age or first name :) joke obviously cause the wife left before I got sober

You're not breaking anyone's anonymity if you say to your family members "I've made some good friends in AA especially Mike and Dave we hang out all the time!" or something. None of that is identifiable information if your family members don't know Mike or Dave in any other context...Telling your family members that someone they know (their dentist an old neighbor from down the road some lady in your mom's book club etc) is in AA is breaking their anonymity. Telling your family members that a public figure (politician actor someone who frequently appears on the news because they are an expert in their field etc) is in AA is breaking their anonymity.
